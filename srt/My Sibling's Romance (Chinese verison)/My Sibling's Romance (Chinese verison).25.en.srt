1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,320
Hello

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,720
This is the clothes I prepared for you.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,600
A set.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,680
Why don't you change it first?

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,320
Okay, thank you.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:17,800
Here.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,680
It's suddenly sunny

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,880
Yes.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,200
The soup mentioned

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,400
I want to show girls

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,440
what you've grown up.

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:24,920
Yes.

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,360
These experiences

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,080
Get some water.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,880
Hello.

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,400
So cute.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,400
They wore the same outfit for the first time.

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,760
I think Susu

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,640
is cute.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,000
I want water. Thank you.

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
Are you nervous?

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,720
No.

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,960
Let me introduce.

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,240
Let's go.

26
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,760
Actually this centre

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,960
is where I train every day.

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,720
I want to bring you here

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,360
to know more about me.

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,080
Then I'll treat you

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,120
as a kid with zero foundation.

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,039
Okay, Mr Tang.

33
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,240
Okay.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,160
Can you hold the paddle?

35
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,840
Take this.

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,880
Hold the paddle.

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,720
No.

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
I've never played ping-pong before.

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,320
You go first.

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,440
You put the beat at the mouth of the tiger.

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,479
Yes, put these three fingers down.

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,560
Put your fingers here.

43
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,560
Yes.

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,320
It's familiar at the beginning.

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,240
Start from the spinning ball.

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,280
Did you turn?

47
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,720
Like when I was young, 20 years ago.

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,840
Twenty years ago

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,840
How many?

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,240
I'll make one first.

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,320
You spin five first.

52
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,960
Five at once.

53
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,240
Okay.

54
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,200
Harry said you would bark.

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,160
I knew it.

56
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,640
I'm already awesome.

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,040
Yes.

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,000
Awesome.

59
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,480
The first time I bumped, I usually bumped one.

60
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,160
Ten.

61
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,960
Okay.

62
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,240
You're better than I thought.

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,240
Thank you.

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,280
I'll call my friend.

65
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,600
What are you doing?

66
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,720
Let me teach you.

67
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,960
He'll be our training partner.

68
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,240
This is Xu Tang.

69
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
This is Susu.

70
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,320
Hello.

71
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,400
Can you play?

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,280
No.

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,720
Okay.

74
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,160
You can watch me play first.

75
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,040
Look.

76
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,440
Show your skills.

77
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,280
For example...

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,240
Don't move.

79
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,120
To be precise,

80
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
For example, I was slow at first.

81
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,000
But if

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,360
If I'm faster,

83
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
Me too.

84
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Like two machines

85
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,640
Really.

86
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,440
You can lift your body a little.

87
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,000
I feel dizzy now.

88
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,160
Really Try it

89
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,880
I'm going to play first.

90
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,840
I don't know how to serve.

91
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,520
Let him serve.

92
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,560
But she hit it.

93
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,000
Amazing.

94
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,640
Why are you laughing?

95
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,320
Nothing.

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,200
No, you serve.

97
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,240
You think I'm a genius?

98
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,480
I'll hold your beat and teach you how to hit it.

99
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,800
Okay?

100
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,280
Okay.

101
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,640
That's right.

102
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,000
That's how teaching works.

103
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,480
Slow down.

104
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,320
Look.

105
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,320
Don't use your strength.

106
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,840
Relax.

107
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
Okay, try it.

108
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,760
Don't push. Relax.

109
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Relax.

110
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,960
Okay.

111
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,640
Relax.

112
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,800
Listen to me now.

113
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,560
Okay.

114
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,920
You're proactively making physical contact.

115
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,240
He had a plan.

116
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
When doing this,

117
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,360
I was quite surprised.

118
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,760
I think

119
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,560
this is not something he would do.

120
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,480
This is unexpected.

121
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't laugh.

122
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,840
Let me show you.

123
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,160
Look.

124
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,080
Yeah, put it over.

125
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,480
You used your strength again.

126
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,600
I have to control you. Don't use your strength.

127
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Three, four, five, six.

128
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,760
Don't use your strength.

129
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,440
He loves to use his strength.

130
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,560
I'm better than you.

131
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,280
You're worse than me. That's bad.

132
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,560
Can you stop crossing it?

133
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,120
Good job.

134
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,920
It's her first time.

135
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,040
Is she pretty good?

136
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,240
Yes.

137
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,400
Thank you.

138
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,480
The soup is good.

139
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,120
When I wake up,

140
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,000
I feel like I've digested yesterday.

141
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,080
That's who he is.

142
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,920
Just like me.

143
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,480
He woke up and came back to life.

144
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,480
I figured everything out.

145
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,720
You can figure it out even if the sky falls.

146
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,080
Isn't this torturing?

147
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,760
Really.

148
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,520
Yes.

149
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,080
So I won't show you

150
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,480
to everyone.

151
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,360
So he needs to meet someone with a big heart.

152
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,760
Susu is actually kind.

153
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,360
Yes.

154
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,840
Try backhand.

155
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,520
Like this. Stand up a little.

156
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,440
A little more. A little more.

157
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,680
Should I hit it vertically?

158
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
You hit it like this.

159
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,400
You should hit it like this.

160
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,800
Yes.

161
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Point it.

162
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,520
Try it.

163
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,120
Yes.

164
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,120
So talented.

165
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,880
I'll send you two.

166
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,800
Got it.

167
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,840
Good.

168
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,040
I got it.

169
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,040
Why don't you applaud me?

170
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,720
Amazing.

171
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,400
I've never seen such a good player.

172
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,000
Play this.

173
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,840
What is this?

174
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
Just knock it down.

175
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,080
How?

176
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,360
I...

177
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,640
So accurate.

178
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,840
For example, when I hit this cup,

179
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,240
Do you want a cup or a photo frame?

180
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,400
I'll get a cup.

181
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Then you can open the box.

182
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,640
Let's throw this.

183
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,840
For example, when you throw it, like if you're three,

184
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
you have three balls.

185
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,720
If you can defeat them and connect them together,

186
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,320
you'll win.

187
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,480
If you win, you'll get a prize.

188
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,000
Give her a kiss as a reward.

189
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,680
What if you win?

190
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,440
If I win, do you have a prize?

191
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,720
No.

192
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,360
Let's start.

193
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,200
Okay, I'll go first.

194
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,640
You first.

195
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,280
Go forward. Don't hit up.

196
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,360
It's dangerous.

197
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,000
It's not moving.

198
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,080
What is this?

199
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,960
Six.

200
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,920
What does this mean?

201
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
This is six.

202
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,240
I can see it's six.

203
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,320
No problem.

204
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,120
Three.

205
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,480
Six.

206
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,159
Three.

207
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,080
You can do this.

208
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,760
I'll do that.

209
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,280
Then three is fine.

210
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,600
I don't believe it.

211
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,200
Four.

212
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm speechless.

213
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,520
Four.

214
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,200
What's wrong?

215
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,000
You...

216
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,200
It's so unfair.

217
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,360
I saw two.

218
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,960
Bye.

219
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,400
Nine.

220
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,760
This is six, right?

221
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,720
This is...

222
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,240
There are no nine dices.

223
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,520
Nine.

224
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,640
Nine.

225
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Two out of three.

226
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,360
Harder.

227
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,880
Awesome.

228
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,080
Three more balls.

229
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,640
You didn't know how to play just now.

230
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,080
Soup.

231
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,120
I don't know how to play.

232
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,760
What are you doing?

233
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,720
Sir, let me introduce.

234
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,840
This is Susu.

235
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,159
EN.CEEN.

236
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,800
Hi, Susu.

237
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,600
Date.

238
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,360
And this is Gook-jung.

239
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,800
Hello teacher

240
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,840
My favorite teacher in my life.

241
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,760
Mr. Liu Guozheng.

242
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,160
I think I'm very lucky

243
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,240
to receive his guidance.

244
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,760
This is the first time

245
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,680
to win the championship of Beijing High School Competition.

246
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm very happy

247
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,960
He's also my teacher now.

248
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,760
Hello.

249
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,280
Hello.

250
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,080
What are you playing?

251
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
We're playing the character well.

252
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,880
If she wins, I'll give her a prize.

253
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,200
Can you win her?

254
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,040
I don't think

255
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,760
to win.

256
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,200
It should be a little difficult.

257
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,400
It's not easy to win.

258
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,920
Master is more experienced.

259
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes.

260
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,840
The older the better.

261
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,000
If you can't beat her,

262
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,080
I'll serve you more.

263
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,720
You haven't been training well lately.

264
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,320
Well,

265
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,840
busy recently.

266
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Have some watermelon.

267
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Maybe on a date.

268
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
I see.

269
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,160
Yes.

270
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,040
Did you get anything?

271
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I'm pursuing it.

272
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,920
So straightforward.

273
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,200
What do you think of our soup?

274
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,640
Very good.

275
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Except for being handsome.

276
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,640
What about the ball?

277
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,560
I've never seen it.

278
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,760
His unique skill is hidden.

279
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,720
Let him hit you later.

280
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,040
Okay.

281
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Except the one you know.

282
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,840
and the other side.

283
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,920
his sports skills

284
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,680
in sports.

285
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,240
Good.

286
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,000
He's the leading actor of Qing Hua Ping-pong.

287
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,200
The leading actor of Qing Hua ping-pong.

288
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,160
three keywords.

289
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,440
I'm really here to help you.

290
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,400
I have to help you.

291
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,240
Okay.

292
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,160
I'll call you when I lose.

293
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Okay, you guys start first.

294
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
15.

295
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,760
Thank you.

296
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,560
This doesn't count.

297
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,800
Yes.

298
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
This is more difficult than that.

299
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,640
Indeed, she helped me.

300
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,360
Why is she a vegetable?

301
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
After I came here,

302
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,560
you were nervous.

303
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,360
You really seem a little tight.

304
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,200
Relax.

305
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,080
It's okay if you don't come.

306
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,640
I'm here to give you some pressure.

307
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,840
I missed.

308
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,040
You can come closer.

309
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,480
No.

310
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,280
I'll take it away. Don't block it.

311
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,040
No.

312
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,640
These two don't count.

313
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,200
Okay, thank you.

314
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,120
From top to down.

315
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,440
Okay.

316
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Sir, there are not many prizes.

317
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,960
Mr. Liu is so good.

318
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,120
We won.

319
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,160
I'm speechless.

320
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,240
I wanted to say

321
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,480
if she couldn't defeat me,

322
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,360
I'll defeat her.

323
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Let's play multi-ball.

324
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,400
Okay, I'll give you a prize later.

325
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,240
It's time for training.

326
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,000
Let me practice.

327
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,760
How about this one?

328
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,320
Sure.

329
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,000
Reverse loop.

330
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,720
He changed suddenly.

331
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,920
So handsome.

332
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,360
Too slow.

333
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,560
Forehand hand.

334
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,880
The ping-pong prince.

335
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,040
So handsome.

336
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,440
Yes.

337
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,480
Just practice.

338
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,200
Look.

339
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,000
So fast.

340
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,680
Su Su can't keep up with her eyes.

341
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,360
This is really good.

342
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,640
So tired.

343
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,360
He likes backhand.

344
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,080
Do you know why?

345
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,240
Easy.

346
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
He looks handsome with backhand.

347
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,240
Handsome.

348
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,640
I always want to show you his handsome side.

349
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,120
I've been in a relationship lately.

350
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,280
Dive lines. You're getting worse.

351
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,080
No.

352
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,440
I'm in a relationship.

353
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,840
No.

354
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,360
It's mainly because she always thinks my hands and feet are not coordinated.

355
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,280
No, sir.

356
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,480
There's someone in our room

357
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
bought a case and arrived today.

358
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,720
You should train every day.

359
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,520
Who will serve you more?

360
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,280
You serve.

361
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,400
I don't know how.

362
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
It's okay. I'll teach you.

363
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,400
Sure.

364
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,480
Go downstairs at seven tomorrow morning.

365
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,040
I'm getting off. Can you come down?

366
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,800
You don't need me anymore, right?

367
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,600
Sir, let's take a photo.

368
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,160
Come on.

369
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,400
Thank you.

370
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,960
OK.

371
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,880
Thank you.

372
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,520
Okay.

373
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,920
It feels good

374
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,720
it's good.

375
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,240
Susu may also like ping-pong.

376
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,760
I'm quite happy.

377
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,320
I really enjoyed

378
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
playing ping-pong.

379
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,320
The ping pong game

380
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,600
(the ping-pong game.)

381
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
You're not playing ping pong, Susu.

382
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,440
but love.

383
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,200
Right.

384
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,960
Let's go eat.

385
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,920
Let's go.

386
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,600
Are you still cold?

387
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,520
Cover it up.

388
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,160
This doesn't seem to work,

389
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,880
I thought I should cover her with my hands.

390
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,080
It's as thin as garlic.

391
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,040
Sir, can you turn up the heat?

392
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,640
Thank you.

393
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,320
Happy

394
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,720
Happy again.

395
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,520
I'm so happy.

396
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:08,840
Now

397
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,720
Happy again.

398
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,960
Harry.

399
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,120
Tom?

400
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,920
What?

401
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,720
You're Tom.

402
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm not.

403
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,720
You're...

404
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,560
I'm Soup.

405
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,080
Stop talking nonsense.

406
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,200
Tom Lee?

407
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,800
Who's Tom Lee?

408
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,280
I'm not talking to you.

409
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
Don't talk to me today.

410
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,600
What do you think of Ms Liu? Is she easy-going?

411
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,920
I won't talk to you if you talk to me.

412
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,400
Because you told me not to talk to you.

413
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,720
I won't talk to you.

414
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,880
I want water.

415
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,360
You can drink so much.

416
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,680
You can drink too much.

417
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
Don't choke.

418
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,040
I'm replenishing water.

419
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,320
Drink it for 30 seconds.

420
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,960
So I cry a lot.

421
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,800
My body is full of water.

422
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
My tears are low.

423
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,400
You cried twice yesterday.

424
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,080
Twice. Two letters. Twice.

425
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,360
I guess they look

426
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,680
they don't look alike.

427
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,720
But I didn't know

428
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,280
We're not related by blood.

429
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,600
Do you think my brother and I

430
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,760
look alike?

431
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
So cute.

432
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
I feel the face shape

433
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,680
Your eyes are different.

434
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,400
You mean my brothers and I

435
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,920
are the same size.

436
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Of course you're small

437
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,200
Thank you.

438
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,360
Tata, do you still have shampoo?

439
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,920
I'm out of mine.

440
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,800
Can I borrow it?

441
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,320
Okay.

442
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,040
I'll get it for you.

443
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,520
Thank you.

444
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,320
Here you are.

445
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,760
Why do you use

446
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,080
Olia hydrochloric acid shampoo?

447
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,000
I use this too.

448
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,920
It's really good

449
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
It has fluffy hair after washing it.

450
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,760
And it smells nice.

451
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,120
But

452
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,360
It feels different

453
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
from my previous one.

454
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,360
Mine is the second generation

455
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,280
And when you wash your hair, your scalp will be comfortable.

456
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,480
The hair won't be dry

457
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,520
Like this.

458
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,760
I'll try it now.

459
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,200
The model is right.

460
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,800
Walking grass planter

461
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,800
The temperament changed in a high shirt.

462
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,920
Today is my guardian date.

463
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,920
So I got up early this morning.

464
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,080
And for today's date,

465
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,960
for today's date.

466
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,520
I'm going to bring flowers.

467
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,560
Let's have lunch together

468
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,640
and take her to the ancient city.

469
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,720
Hello.

470
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,480
So pretty.

471
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,120
Of course I'm looking forward to it.

472
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,640
Didn't you see

473
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
pretty today?

474
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,360
It'll be a bit grand today.

475
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
I know

476
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,880
who I'm going on a date with.

477
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,680
Is there anyone competing with me?

478
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,160
Yes

479
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,360
Comedian has spring

480
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,960
Who is the date

481
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,880
Where is it?

482
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
The day after tomorrow.

483
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,440
Is this the place you're looking for?

484
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,200
You're good at finding private dishes.

485
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,520
I found it here.

486
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:32,880
Yes.

487
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,680
I saw your life album yesterday.

488
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,520
Are you running abroad?

489
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,040
It should be more in China now.

490
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,160
I used to be a little more abroad.

491
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,960
Where do you live now?

492
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,040
Shanghai.

493
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,520
What about you?

494
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,120
Changsha.

495
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,440
That day, we first met in the cabin.

496
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,680
You told me to guess your occupation.

497
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,400
I haven't figured it out yet.

498
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,200
what you do.

499
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,920
You can guess.

500
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,000
I can give you three chances.

501
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,640
You can go to the other side.

502
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,520
You're right.

503
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,840
in the self-media industry.

504
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,880
Almost.

505
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,440
Because I'm getting closer to her.

506
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,000
A beauty blogger?

507
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,119
Yes.

508
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,480
What do you think of this makeup?

509
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,280
I did it myself.

510
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,560
It's good

511
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,839
It's beautiful.

512
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,560
Because my previous company was in Changsha.

513
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,520
But now it's the workplace.

514
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,440
It may change a little.

515
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,079
Where are you going?

516
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,760
Beijing.

517
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,839
Okay.

518
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,720
Beijing is good.

519
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,480
Can't you eat spicy food?

520
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,760
I can wash water.

521
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,560
Okay.

522
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,000
Excuse me.

523
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,040
You don't have to order spicy food.

524
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,400
I don't have to eat spicy food.

525
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,480
Order a little.

526
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,080
But I don't think it's very spicy.

527
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,920
Not necessarily.

528
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,040
The noodles I made.

529
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,560
You can't eat any chili.

530
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,560
I ate them all.

531
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,240
But I picked

532
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,360
all your chilies.

533
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,280
Just scoop it with this.

534
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,040
You can scoop it.

535
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,840
Call Tae-ri.

536
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,520
Go get him.

537
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,280
It'll get soggy later.

538
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,720
So careful.

539
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,280
No wonder.

540
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,520
So thoughtful.

541
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,640
Very attentive.

542
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,520
I was very touched.

543
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,000
And she didn't say it.

544
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,320
Now I'm unintentionally

545
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,000
I didn't say it before.

546
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,880
Yes.

547
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,200
So did you

548
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,480
last night?

549
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,080
Yes.

550
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
Susu cried the longest.

551
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,880
I was the one who cried.

552
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,720
Because I think

553
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,160
I heard your letter yesterday.

554
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,920
You went to protect your sister, right?

555
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,880
That scene was just like my siblings.

556
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,320
When my family scolded me,

557
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,000
my brothers were standing in front of me.

558
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,880
He was much shorter than me then.

559
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,200
That's it.

560
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,640
I was also very young.

561
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,160
Yes.

562
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,680
Why did you...

563
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,760
Do you remember how I felt?

564
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,600
Because our family was kind of like boys.

565
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,560
men are more important.

566
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,360
Yes.

567
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,240
You didn't listen to my letter, otherwise...

568
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,720
Really? Is it the same?

569
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I always think my sister

570
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,160
is

571
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,840
an independent person.

572
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,320
Work

573
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,680
and when she's studying,

574
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,200
she may read while working.

575
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,720
After she graduated,

576
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,760
she went to Shanghai alone.

577
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,320
She doesn't know anyone in Shanghai.

578
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,200
so she went to work on her own.

579
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
I'm doing this job

580
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,600
because of my sister.

581
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,960
You happen to be so tall.

582
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,440
Just right.

583
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,320
Yes.

584
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,760
But I never thought about it.

585
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,400
Because I used to be short.

586
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,520
You should think

587
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,840
I don't have anything special about height.

588
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,760
If I'm going to date someone...

589
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,360
Really?

590
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:34,880
No.

591
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,480
I knew it.

592
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,600
The more you lack, the more you need.

593
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,240
You don't.

594
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,600
Looks like she's short of height.

595
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,240
Yes, she's not demanding.

596
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,760
How tall must you be?

597
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,440
Most importantly, it depends on whether they get along.

598
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,160
How do you think we get along?

599
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,960
Do you get along well with each other?

600
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,160
Yes, chatting, life, hobbies.

601
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,360
Three views.

602
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,440
I think these are quite important.

603
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,280
Maybe we get along.

604
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,200
It'll be easier to get along.

605
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,400
Do you prefer

606
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,000
love at first sight or love grows over time?

607
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,200
Love grows gradually

608
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,000
For me,

609
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,880
I used to date

610
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,480
It takes a long time

611
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,280
for observation.

612
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,000
So it's hard for me to get into a relationship.

613
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,560
I understand.

614
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,760
I might observe

615
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,440
for a long time.

616
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,040
You are more passive.

617
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Very passive.

618
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,080
Yeah.

619
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:30,920
But I think

620
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,560
you should be the opposite, right?

621
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,080
I'll be more passive at the beginning.

622
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
I'll take the initiative later.

623
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,280
Your passive attitude at the beginning

624
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,480
to confirm the other person's feelings.

625
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,840
If the other person

626
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,200
to you,

627
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,760
Respond.

628
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,360
Yes.

629
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,960
I won't continue.

630
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,720
I know.

631
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,360
Yes.

632
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,840
Almost. Me too.

633
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Under the passive condition,

634
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,880
maybe they gave me some signals

635
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,840
so I...

636
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,680
You'll be passive if she gives you the signal.

637
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,080
But I will respond accordingly.

638
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,880
Whether it's the early or later,

639
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,760
you still need

640
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,960
to guide you.

641
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,400
You may need his guidance in the beginning.

642
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,600
I'll be better later.

643
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,960
Maybe I can understand

644
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,520
how they feel.

645
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,800
What kind of guy do you usually like?

646
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,840
To be honest, I'm quite fond of him.

647
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,600
Familiar?

648
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,760
Do you have any requirements for height or anything?

649
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,120
I like height.

650
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,560
Ask this question.

651
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,360
You must know it's a bonus question.

652
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,320
Yes.

653
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,280
Because I think

654
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,520
I'm not that tall.

655
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,600
So

656
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,000
I want to find

657
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,320
A little higher.

658
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,000
Higher than me.

659
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,200
Thank you. Okay.

660
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,040
Enjoy.

661
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,520
Let's eat.

662
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:54,920
Okay.

663
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,200
You're welcome.

664
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,280
You're a good cook.

665
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,200
Really?

666
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,200
I've been watching you

667
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,920
I've been watching you taking care of everyone.

668
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,320
No, because among girls,

669
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,480
I know a little

670
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,360
Really?

671
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,160
Let me take a photo.

672
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,920
Do you usually take photos?

673
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,360
I like to record it. Yes.

674
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,360
Let me try it for you.

675
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:18,920
Okay.

676
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,320
I brought a camera.

677
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,440
There's an ancient city nearby.

678
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,360
Let's take photos later.

679
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:25,760
Sure.

680
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,520
Can I?

681
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,280
Are you interested?

682
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,800
Or do you think...

683
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,400
Of course.

684
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,760
Really?

685
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,880
Me too. If I want to go,

686
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,960
I'll choose a small town like this.

687
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,200
I don't think it's spicy.

688
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:38,920
Really?

689
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,880
It's a lot of numb.

690
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,040
It shouldn't be spicy.

691
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,720
Yes, it's not spicy.

692
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,880
It's a little numb.

693
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,440
This chili is just fragrant.

694
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,760
These days,

695
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,560
I've never eaten anything spicy.

696
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,840
Luckily, I can eat it.

697
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,880
Right?

698
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,760
It's not spicy

699
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,360
Yes, it looks spicy, but it's actually okay.

700
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,280
So you just said

701
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,240
more care of you before.

702
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,840
Do you like her type or...

703
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,480
Sisters.

704
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,560
Maybe in real life,

705
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,640
in real life.

706
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,520
Do you need her to pay attention to you?

707
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,520
Because I'm a bit in love.

708
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,440
Your love brain.

709
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,200
Can't you tell?

710
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,600
You're the one being taken care of.

711
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,840
You're so lovesick.

712
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,160
You're totally different

713
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,240
I'm not alone at all.

714
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,880
Really.

715
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,160
But you're being taken care of.

716
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,440
You always ask her

717
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,880
to take care of you,

718
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,040
and she's been taking care of you.

719
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,480
No.

720
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,720
Anyway, when I'm in a relationship,

721
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,800
life is around each other.

722
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,520
Then you...

723
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,240
For example, you like boys.

724
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,360
other than tall ones.

725
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,120
In other aspects,

726
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,440
I like bossy ones.

727
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,760
Okay.

728
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,400
Hua said she likes bossy girls.

729
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
If I don't say anything,

730
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,160
my image will be overbearing.

731
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,920
Tell me.

732
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Yes.

733
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,120
Do you have any questions

734
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,000
about my behavior?

735
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,560
you can ask.

736
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,840
Do I?

737
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,200
Of course.

738
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,360
I'm actually quite...

739
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,600
I don't want you to feel awkward.

740
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,440
No, I'm fine.

741
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,600
Because I did think about it later.

742
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,800
I know what you want to ask.

743
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,880
I sent the message to Xinxin.

744
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,800
The girls in the small house are excellent.

745
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,880
Actually, I want to get in touch with them.

746
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,360
I received Hua's message.

747
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,000
It was obviously her.

748
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,160
I thought I was quite fascinated.

749
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,760
That behavior

750
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,440
Did you realize it yourself

751
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,480
or because you received something,

752
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,720
because you received something?

753
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,160
I got your text.

754
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:47,920
Yes.

755
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,320
Then I regretted

756
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,920
Back then...

757
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,080
So if I didn't take this step,

758
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,880
you won't regret it.

759
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,760
But you'll regret only after I take this step.

760
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,160
No.

761
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,280
I didn't think that much.

762
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Because we were not a team that afternoon.

763
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,200
We had fun this afternoon.

764
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,400
I was happy thinking about it.

765
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,800
Right?

766
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,520
I've been thinking

767
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,240
I said,

768
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,240
Flower.

769
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,920
It really gives people emotional value.

770
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,800
Xinxin may have been in touch with me a lot.

771
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,280
I didn't think too much.

772
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,640
So I sent it directly.

773
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,600
Xinxin.

774
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,280
It's Xinxin. I'll send it to Xinxin.

775
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,560
You sent it to Xinxin?

776
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,440
She was shocked.

777
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,560
Who do you think I sent it to?

778
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,720
Of course I just made an appointment with you, Susu.

779
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,440
No, I sent it to Susu the first night.

780
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,800
I sent it to Xinxin the second night.

781
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,120
It's okay.

782
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,800
I came in before you.

783
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,440
I know enough about other boys.

784
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,920
I think this moment

785
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,440
is the kind of care he wants.

786
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,760
In fact, I understand.

787
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,360
Yes.

788
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,040
I knew everyone was here.

789
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,760
We all chose freely.

790
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,240
Yes.

791
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,600
She makes the atmosphere very comfortable.

792
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,440
and honest.

793
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,680
Don't feel pressured.

794
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,520
Yes.

795
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,880
After that,

796
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,080
come to Beijing.

797
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,400
Not necessarily Beijing.

798
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,360
Shanghai is also good.

799
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,720
Yes.

800
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,200
has started to recommend Shanghai.

801
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,600
Hua asked me many questions

802
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,920
asked me many questions.

803
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,480
What she wants to know

804
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,400
With her guidance,

805
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,040
we may talk more

806
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,680
more and more.

807
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,880
More and more relaxed.

808
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:17,800
I'm full.

809
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,080
Let's go to the ancient city nearby.

810
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,520
Sure.

811
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,920
I saw you all black today.

812
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,960
So I wore white.

813
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,480
They look good together.

814
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,680
They look good together.

815
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,240
You did it on purpose.

816
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,960
What is this?

817
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,920
These are for you.

818
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,480
You can put it anywhere.

819
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,800
A date is more formal.

820
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,880
I'll give you a gift.

821
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,480
Do you want to guess what it means?

822
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,160
What is this?

823
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,360
A butterfly or a snowflake?

824
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,600
It's a butterfly.

825
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,200
Butterfly

826
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,320
Because we watched the first snow.

827
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,120
Yes.

828
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,960
Look at the first snow

829
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,560
We watched the snow together.

830
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,640
It's blue.

831
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,560
But there's another meaning.

832
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,880
Because we listened to Butterfly together.

833
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,280
Thank you.

834
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,720
Only a couple can understand it.

835
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,720
It's similar, but it's not.

836
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,680
You can see what's special about butterflies.

837
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,600
This butterfly

838
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,720
has no wings.

839
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Yes.

840
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,760
A butterfly with broken wings.

841
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,800
Yes.

842
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,960
I guessed it.

843
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,640
I think that's your favorite song.

844
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,440
I like it the most.

845
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,920
Maybe many people don't know

846
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,520
what it's called.

847
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,800
My Tears Smashed.

848
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,120
You know?

849
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,960
I love it.

850
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,160
This is my favorite song.

851
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,800
He remembers it.

852
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,360
He even remembers the lyrics.

853
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,800
Did you make this yourself?

854
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,720
Yes, I did it.

855
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,880
Yesterday

856
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,560
I went yesterday.

857
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,680
So sweet.

858
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,920
This is so thoughtful.

859
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,360
It's not like him.

860
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
The things I know

861
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,400
he would do.

862
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,400
It takes time and energy to do.

863
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,760
It's very sincere.

864
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,560
I'm happy to receive a gift.

865
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,920
Because I've been

866
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,640
in these days.

867
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,160
It will be affected by Su's actions.

868
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,240
It's not a positive development.

869
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,760
So I said I wanted to make some breakthroughs.

870
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,160
This is very touching.

871
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,160
I'm touched. I'm sincere.

872
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,960
What is your ideal love state?

873
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,840
We have our own things to do.

874
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,560
And

875
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,960
But I can't say

876
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
too much to do.

877
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,720
You can't be

878
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,120
that we haven't seen for a long time.

879
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,160
We have our own things to do.

880
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,120
And during the break,

881
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,560
we go out for dinner, watch a movie

882
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,560
or stay somewhere.

883
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,120
Susu is independent.

884
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,440
I don't like foreign places.

885
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,120
I need someone to be with me.

886
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,160
I don't accept long-distance relationship.

887
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,120
Okay.

888
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,920
What about you?

889
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,840
I think we're similar.

890
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,280
If he's not busy with his own things,

891
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,240
he will

892
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,720
put a lot of pressure on another person.

893
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,080
You can't be busy when you're in a relationship.

894
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,960
I have a lot of free time.

895
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,680
That way, the one who's free will think too much.

896
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,760
The busy one will think he's unreasonable.

897
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,520
Do you like to live in a quiet place

898
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,440
or a bustling place?

899
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,240
I like to go to the park.

900
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,400
You prefer a quiet place.

901
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,000
But I can't keep saying

902
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,720
go to the park every day.

903
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,640
Sometimes I have to rely on

904
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,800
to absorb some energy.

905
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,240
You're an alien.

906
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
But I like to go to the park.

907
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,160
Why did you

908
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,120
last night?

909
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,440
I was playing Harry.

910
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,640
Why? He's not sleeping either.

911
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,200
No.

912
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,520
I want to hit someone's brother.

913
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,120
Let it out.

914
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,880
Poor Harry.

915
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,200
No.

916
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,680
Is he that handsome?

917
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,680
Just kidding.

918
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,360
It's very cute to ask.

919
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,000
Yes.

920
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,000
I'll support you.

921
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,960
You don't like it?

922
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,680
people praise your sister?

923
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,080
Okay.

924
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,440
I see.

925
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,680
Then what?

926
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
I really think he's handsome.

927
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,920
I want him to come over.

928
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,480
So I can know him.

929
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,040
I also asked something unhappy.

930
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,080
Susu was just supporting me.

931
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,040
But her emotional value

932
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,280
too much.

933
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,960
I may be a little unhappy.

934
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,360
But I feel much better after we talked.

935
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,240
Maybe

936
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,080
we haven't been in touch for long.

937
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,600
He doesn't know

938
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,280
or what kind of person I am.

939
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,880
or the way

940
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,120
my way of doing things.

941
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,920
I think

942
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,680
we should communicate more.

943
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,480
So you were angry yesterday?

944
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,520
A little.

945
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
Really?

946
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,960
He's angry.

947
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,000
The whole family knows he's angry.

948
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,640
Yes, obviously.

949
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,080
Yes, everyone is here.

950
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,400
Why didn't you tell me yourself?

951
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,920
I don't know.

952
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,840
It might be stuffy.

953
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,280
I'll tell you when I get angry next time.

954
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Yes, I have to tell you.

955
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,160
I think we need to solve something.

956
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,160
You've improved a lot.

957
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,680
Yes.

958
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,600
Soup.

959
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,480
Will something happen?

960
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,840
For example, you didn't think it through.

961
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,800
Then we met today.

962
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
We went on a date.

963
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,160
You may just hang up

964
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,760
or you're cold to me.

965
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,240
I'll think you're weird.

966
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
I think you're suspicious.

967
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,560
And then I get angry.

968
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,920
So you're just

969
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Because I said others are handsome.

970
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,680
And you...

971
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,520
a little...

972
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,520
Next time.

973
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,080
Next time.

974
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,080
Still angry?

975
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,640
Next time.

976
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Okay, I'll learn from you next time.

977
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,480
As long as you talk to other girls,

978
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,240
I get angry.

979
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,040
I get angry.

980
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,960
What?

981
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,760
I want to learn from you.

982
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,920
What did I do?

983
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,840
When you talk to a girl,

984
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,600
when you talk to a girl.

985
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,600
Okay?

986
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,520
No.

987
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,520
Let him feel it.

988
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,480
Good.

989
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,800
Very smart.

990
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,000
I think our relationship

991
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,080
is progressing.

992
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,760
Because she would joke

993
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,360
I'm going to date another girl.

994
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,240
I would think

995
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,000
if she cares about this,

996
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,320
it means she likes me.

997
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,640
I'm not sure yet.

998
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,680
It's hard to confirm.

999
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,760
You have to check it 800 times.

1000
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,960
and finally confirm.

1001
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,480
You're happy now.

1002
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,400
Cheapskate.

1003
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,840
Then be petty. I have no choice.

1004
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,320
You're so petty.

1005
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,120
I'm speechless.

1006
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,040
The soup needs someone to coax him.

1007
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,760
That feeling.

1008
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,120
I keep telling him

1009
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,640
I like you.

1010
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,280
I'm kidding.

1011
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,920
I like you.

1012
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,200
I don't mean anything else.

1013
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,640
Yes.

1014
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,480
He confirmed it.

1015
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,280
Jiang Dunhao, do you want us to coax you?

1016
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,440
Do you need to be coaxed?

1017
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,160
I might be a little cocky.

1018
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,720
You can coax me.

1019
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,360
I might shake your tail.

1020
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,960
Because I also need

1021
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,960
to confirm with others.

1022
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,440
Yes.

1023
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,160
I feel inferior sometimes.

1024
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,880
So I envy

1025
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,480
who is very strong.

1026
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,880
Yes.

1027
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,680
We're not like that at all.

1028
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,600
We've seen an extreme

1029
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,240
She did nothing.

1030
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
She likes me.

1031
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,840
Really.

1032
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,760
Very confident.

1033
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Bro.

1034
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
No, stop it.

1035
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,800
I can see.

1036
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,600
I've seen a lot.

1037
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,360
I just passed by.

1038
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,960
There are 121 girls beside me.

1039
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
like me very much.

1040
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,880
right?

1041
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,040
Ridiculous, you know?

1042
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,400
Handsome and humorous.

1043
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:06,920
Handsome and humorous

1044
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,200
Cool and humorous.

1045
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,199
AVE CREA is ridiculous.

1046
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,880
He’s confident.

1047
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,040
But he won't be exhausted.

1048
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
Other people's internal consumption

1049
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,000
Exhausting others

1050
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,120
It's also a great mental state.

1051
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,040
Do you want some?

1052
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,560
No.

1053
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,880
Why aren't you eating?

1054
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,840
I'll eat it.

1055
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,360
You picked it for me?

1056
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,679
I did it for you.

1057
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,760
I'll give you a big piece.

1058
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,159
I never took the initiative

1059
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,840
to talk to someone.

1060
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,560
Thank you.

1061
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,440
I did it myself.

1062
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,520
You can't do this.

1063
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,840
This will make some people anxious.

1064
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,400
He can't sleep all night.

1065
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,480
If the table is here,

1066
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,800
will you do it?

1067
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
That's easy.

1068
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,760
Really?

1069
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,200
Ten minutes.

1070
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,600
It's so hard. Ten minutes.

1071
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,200
I think

1072
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,000
a vacuum cleaner humidifier.

1073
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,760
To me, it's already...

1074
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,960
Yes, Harry said he bought one.

1075
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,680
He bought that for me and I took it upstairs.

1076
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,240
But I haven't used it

1077
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,960
Not yet

1078
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,720
I did.

1079
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,640
It's useless.

1080
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,520
No water.

1081
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,480
It has been upstairs for three days

1082
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,880
He's better than one person.

1083
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,600
I didn't bring it up.

1084
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,560
It's from the tower.

1085
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,040
No wonder your room is crowded.

1086
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,560
I hope someone is kind.

1087
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,440
Please add the water and open it for me.

1088
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,000
A hint.

1089
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,720
Yes.

1090
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,400
You can't enter a girl's room casually.

1091
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,440
You don't have to come in.

1092
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,840
I'll put that at the door.

1093
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,640
Thank you.

1094
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,240
Okay?

1095
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,360
I think our relationship

1096
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,320
is developing in a good way.

1097
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,200
I think it's good to take it slow.

1098
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,200
This is a very fulfilling date.

1099
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,080
It's well arranged.

1100
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,920
Maybe everything

1101
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,600
the girl's imagination.

1102
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,280
I think

1103
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,600
did a good job.

1104
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,760
It's already perfect.

1105
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,040
I don't think any man

1106
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,400
would give me a date like this.

1107
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,560
Let's go.

1108
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,120
Okay.

1109
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Did you have fun today?

1110
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,200
Yes.

1111
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
I want to play ping-pong.

1112
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,280
I want to play now.

1113
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,640
Their conversation is interesting.

1114
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,200
Yes.

1115
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,040
We didn't talk properly.

1116
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,600
But they said

1117
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,200
have their own frequency.

1118
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,640
Yes.

1119
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,560
Actually, I think the soup is pure.

1120
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,640
He has a lot of mysophobia for love.

1121
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,280
and his insistence.

1122
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,600
Pure love boys.

1123
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,120
Yes.

1124
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,240
Pure love God of War Soup.

1125
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,880
Good taste.

1126
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,760
Right?

1127
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,600
You too.

1128
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Is that what you mean?

1129
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,480
Do you think there are

1130
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
in the house?

1131
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,000
Yes, I'm on a date.

1132
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,880
Okay, I'm happy.

1133
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,120
So when you're in a relationship,

1134
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,280
you will...

1135
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
The question you asked me before

1136
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,120
Did you fall in love at first sight

1137
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,960
or love grows over time?

1138
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,040
I actually feel that

1139
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,680
Both.

1140
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,120
Yes.

1141
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,760
Actually, I'm not like you

1142
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
you may be slow.

1143
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,640
You'll observe for a long time.

1144
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,440
I will.

1145
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:23,880
Yes.

1146
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,520
There's something

1147
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,720
touched me.

1148
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,400
I will

1149
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,280
fall in love.

1150
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,480
Yes, I won't observe for long.

1151
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,880
I'll be together and slowly

1152
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,400
Because I think

1153
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,200
eye contact is very important.

1154
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,000
Maybe

1155
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,640
At that moment, you think it's right.

1156
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,720
you think

1157
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,280
you won't have any conflicts with him anymore.

1158
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,000
Do you have a good temper?

1159
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,960
What do you think?

1160
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,480
It's good for now.

1161
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,080
He has a good temper.

1162
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,960
Do you fight?

1163
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,400
Do you fight like crazy?

1164
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,560
It may be noisy when you suffocate to death.

1165
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,520
But

1166
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,680
I have a big flaw.

1167
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,880
I'm stubborn.

1168
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,160
Stubborn.

1169
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,200
Yes, my family and I are stubborn.

1170
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,560
But will you regret it after that?

1171
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,920
Yes, if this

1172
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,200
is my problem,

1173
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,520
I will reflect on myself.

1174
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,800
But if I think I'm fine,

1175
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,440
I'll be stubborn to the end.

1176
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,160
I saw it.

1177
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,360
Yongning Ancient City.

1178
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,560
So many people.

1179
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,440
Yes.

1180
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,200
The weather is nice today.

1181
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,640
Do you want candied haws?

1182
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,000
You can do it.

1183
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,920
Strawberry

1184
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,960
Two strawberries.

1185
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,840
Okay, let's go.

1186
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,640
Let's go.

1187
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,760
This is my first time eating Tanghulu in Beijing.

1188
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,800
There's a car.

1189
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,600
It's quite sweet.

1190
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,400
The strawberries are quite sweet.

1191
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,040
I think it's sweet.

1192
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,560
Every time I come to Beijing,

1193
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,920
eat candied haws in Beijing.

1194
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,080
but I didn't have the chance to eat them.

1195
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,000
Nest.

1196
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,000
It suddenly occurred to me that Xin said she couldn't understand

1197
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
dried fruit.

1198
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
Do you like it?

1199
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm fine.

1200
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,040
I might like beef jerky.

1201
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,400
And I like nuts too.

1202
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,760
I saw you buy

1203
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,400
Happy Fruit.

1204
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
A dart.

1205
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,840
Do you want to play?

1206
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,400
Can we play this?

1207
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,920
Yes.

1208
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,520
Have a try.

1209
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,040
I'll play.

1210
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:26,880
Okay.

1211
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,520
I won't.

1212
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm off.

1213
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,160
Let me try.

1214
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,560
You do it.

1215
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,360
Try it. Try again.

1216
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,680
Okay.

1217
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,160
It's okay. You can move forward.

1218
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,760
Okay, two.

1219
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,280
Almost.

1220
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,920
If you fail, I'll do it, right?

1221
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,280
Yes.

1222
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,240
One, three.

1223
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,040
Three.

1224
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,840
I think you should do it.

1225
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,720
Really?

1226
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,760
Four.

1227
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,520
Five.

1228
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,400
You're better.

1229
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,320
Six.

1230
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,480
I'll hold it for you.

1231
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,800
Seven.

1232
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,560
Almost. You do it.

1233
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,840
Seven.

1234
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,480
Really?

1235
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,240
I think you're better.

1236
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Why don't you do it?

1237
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,320
Stab right.

1238
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
You do it. You do it.

1239
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,840
Seven.

1240
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,320
Eight.

1241
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,000
I'll stand here. It's windy here.

1242
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,920
Here you are.

1243
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,040
So sweet.

1244
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,320
Okay, thank you.

1245
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,240
I think he's quite considerate.

1246
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,560
Standing at the wind

1247
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,880
It's warm to be able to block the wind for me.

1248
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,880
Thirteen, the last one.

1249
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,400
14.

1250
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,760
Count us fifteen, boss.

1251
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,720
Pick one of the prizes.

1252
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:34,880
This one?

1253
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,200
Okay.

1254
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,240
Thank you.

1255
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,680
I guess you're not as good as me in shooting.

1256
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,800
I'm not convinced.

1257
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,240
I'm not convinced.

1258
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,440
Let's find someone who can shoot.

1259
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,280
There's a chance later.

1260
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,560
How do I use this?

1261
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,840
Turn around.

1262
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,160
Can we use this?

1263
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Can we?

1264
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,240
Sure.

1265
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,000
Turn it around.

1266
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,640
Like this.

1267
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,560
How to turn?

1268
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,280
Now, let me teach you. Turn like this.

1269
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,320
Find the direction first.

1270
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,800
Turn like this when you find the direction.

1271
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,600
I think I got it.

1272
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,840
You should.

1273
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,880
I can see now.

1274
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,000
Let me try. Can my hand do it?

1275
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,720
Let me see.

1276
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,960
Okay.

1277
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,560
Let me try again.

1278
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,400
No.

1279
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Why don't you try it?

1280
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,480
Try it.

1281
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,280
Let me try.

1282
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,240
I think you're learning so fast.

1283
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,160
But you failed.

1284
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,360
Don't stop.

1285
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,080
Yes.

1286
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,840
Don't raise it too high.

1287
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,240
But hurry up, right?

1288
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,520
Let me show you

1289
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,040
Okay.

1290
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,600
Look at this.

1291
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,240
Look.

1292
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,680
Like this.

1293
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,600
Practice makes perfect.

1294
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,840
Look, he must be conscious.

1295
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
Tell it to turn around.

1296
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,000
Got it?

1297
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,520
I was impressed by her.

1298
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,280
Thank you. We learned it today.

1299
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,120
Yes.

1300
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,080
Thank you.

1301
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,720
You're welcome.

1302
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,600
Bye.

1303
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,200
Let's take a walk.

1304
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,560
Okay, when we get back...

1305
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,480
Guodan skin.

1306
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,200
I brought them some.

1307
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,280
Let me.

1308
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,800
It's okay.

1309
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,720
I want to bring a gift too.

1310
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,680
This is your nuts.

1311
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,080
I want to call it one kilo of this.

1312
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,560
This strawberry is really big.

1313
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,920
Buy some

1314
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,720
Thank you.

1315
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:12,880
Bye.

1316
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,440
Boss, buy some beef jerky.

1317
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,040
Okay.

1318
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,640
Thank you.

1319
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,040
Let's go.

1320
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,000
You're here in fashion week's clothes.

1321
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,720
I think

1322
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,680
with Huahua today.

1323
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,920
our relationship will definitely improve.

1324
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
and a lot.

1325
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,240
When two people shopping in life,

1326
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,640
and more relaxed.

1327
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,400
Because these are life.

1328
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,360
If I get full marks,

1329
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,080
I'll give him eight points for today's date.

1330
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,000
I think he's quite considerate.

1331
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,240
Warm his hands with the heating pads.

1332
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,840
and block the wind for me.

1333
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,360
The bag is a little heavy.

1334
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,480
He didn't even carry it for me.

1335
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,120
I think it's quite interesting.

1336
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,840
Their date is very vivid.

1337
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,040
Super life.

1338
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,200
Take a look.

1339
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,200
Let me take a photo for you.

1340
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,480
The city tower?

1341
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,960
Three, two, one.

1342
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,480
What impressed me the most

1343
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,640
I took a photo for her.

1344
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,840
She smiles when she takes photos.

1345
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,440
She looks really cute

1346
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,120
She's really cute.

1347
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,720
Take my prize.

1348
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,440
Three, two, one. Cheese.

1349
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,200
Excuse me.

1350
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,840
Excuse me.

1351
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,120
Three, two, one.

1352
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,000
It suits you.

1353
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,520
I've been recording flowers.

1354
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,440
I was a mother who was loved

1355
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,400
who loved me.

1356
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,200
Not many people recorded me after that.

1357
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,000
Take photos for me.

1358
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,680
I don't know.

1359
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,120
I want to be recorded.

1360
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,920
he took photos for me all day.

1361
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,000
This is what touched me the most today.

1362
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,840
Just stand there today.

1363
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,840
Let me take a photo for you.

1364
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,760
You know,

1365
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,240
this really touched me.

1366
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,640
I'm so happy.

1367
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,800
Let's go home.

1368
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,400
Let's go.

1369
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,360
So cold

1370
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:22,960
Chef

1371
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,240
Do you know what it is?

1372
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,840
Table Tennis table.

1373
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,120
You only think about ping pong table.

1374
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,680
You're back.

1375
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,960
I'll freeze the meat.

1376
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,400
Do you know what we are doing?

1377
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,320
What are we doing?

1378
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,560
We're doing your dragon

1379
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,440
Love it.

1380
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,640
A man who can cook

1381
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,720
He forced himself to do something.

1382
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,360
Let me rest.

1383
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:42,840
Babies.

1384
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,280
I got up at six.

1385
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,920
Go and rest.

1386
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,240
I know you.

1387
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,040
Go.

1388
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,640
Love you.

1389
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,320
I'm in a good mood today.

1390
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,120
Indeed.

1391
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,720
If he's in a good mood, the world can...

1392
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,400
Yes.

1393
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,040
The whole world knows he's in a bad mood.

1394
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,200
So many packages.

1395
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,960
It's freezing.

1396
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,120
What are you doing?

1397
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,920
What did you buy?

1398
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,440
You're back too.

1399
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,200
Good afternoon.

1400
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,600
Yes.

1401
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,000
We're back too.

1402
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,760
I suddenly realized

1403
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,640
we don't have to

1404
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,440
make so much food?

1405
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,000
We bought a lot of food.

1406
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,600
We're amazing, Xiao Ling.

1407
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,320
Cut the beef meatballs and put them in the plate.

1408
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,040
Awesome.

1409
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,480
Thank you for your compliment.

1410
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,400
So virtuous.

1411
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,600
The emotional value is full.

1412
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,280
Give it to me.

1413
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,800
Give it to me.

1414
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,360
Okay.

1415
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,360
I'll let you join.

1416
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,120
It makes me feel participated.

1417
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,080
Thank you.

1418
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,240
Do you need help?

1419
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,120
You're dressed like this.

1420
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,760
I don't think so.

1421
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,960
Are you hungry?

1422
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,800
I don't think the meat is enough.

1423
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,680
If you think it's enough,

1424
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,040
I can do it alone.

1425
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:05,880
Is it enough?

1426
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,840
There's shrimp slices.

1427
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,520
I think we can

1428
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,720
with one spoon.

1429
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,760
I don't think it's enough.

1430
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,280
To be honest,

1431
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,680
Open another one.

1432
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,880
Okay.

1433
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,120
Are you waiting for that?

1434
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,360
How do you know me so well, woman?

1435
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,240
I'm a smart person.

1436
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,600
You shouldn't be that smart.

1437
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,640
I'm just very smart.

1438
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
That doesn't sound like flirting.

1439
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,600
How do you know me so well, woman?

1440
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,560
I think I'm too strong.

1441
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,880
I need to be praised.

1442
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,320
You're amazing.

1443
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,920
You're the chef of this house.

1444
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,320
We'll all starve to death without you.

1445
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,440
Are you happy?

1446
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,120
Rainbow boot.

1447
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,680
I'll take these down first.

1448
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,360
That should be enough.

1449
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:52,720
Okay.

1450
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,000
This is for you.

1451
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,240
You're kind.

1452
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,280
It's just a gift.

1453
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,280
It's a gift.

1454
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,080
Finally we have meat.

1455
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,480
I don't think there's anything to cut.

1456
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,440
No.

1457
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,440
Xiao Ling.

1458
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,800
Try it.

1459
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,920
Give it to her when it's cold.

1460
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,160
How is it?

1461
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,560
No taste.

1462
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,880
But does it smell good?

1463
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,040
Yes.

1464
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,840
You asked so many questions.

1465
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,200
Why don't you try it yourself?

1466
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,440
Do you want some salt?

1467
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,920
No need.

1468
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,280
I won't do it then.

1469
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:35,880
No need.

1470
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,440
Some of them are boiled water.

1471
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:37,840
Both are fine.

1472
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,880
I won't do it then.

1473
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,960
I won't.

1474
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,480
Shut up.

1475
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:43,680
I'm afraid

1476
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,560
check again later.

1477
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,000
Yes.

1478
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,680
I won't.

1479
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,480
Check again, Xiao Ling.

1480
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,040
Let's check again and again.

1481
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,920
He read her name every time.

1482
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,320
He knows what Xiaoling needs.

1483
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,680
So he repeatedly told her

1484
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,920
I've confirmed it with you.

1485
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,480
Actually, I'm hungry.

1486
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,720
You can have beef meatball soup first.

1487
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,720
I think it's okay.

1488
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,560
I'm just too virtuous.

1489
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:07,920
I'm a woman.

1490
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,800
I will marry myself.

1491
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,640
Did you hear

1492
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,800
Did you hear it?

1493
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,480
the joy of having dinner downstairs?

1494
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,080
Hello.

1495
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,160
Whose bowl is this?

1496
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,280
Did you put chili?

1497
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,560
I put a bag.

1498
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,360
Because this is...

1499
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,280
You put them all.

1500
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,320
You want to compete with me?

1501
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,280
I can eat better than you.

1502
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,000
Do you dare to compete with me?

1503
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,200
I don't want to compete with you.

1504
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,760
There's sauce over there.

1505
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,520
You can get it.

1506
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,720
Tata cut some chili for you.

1507
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,200
Where is it?

1508
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,880
Here.

1509
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,920
You cut it for me?

1510
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,560
Only you eat spicy food.

1511
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,600
Great.

1512
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,520
Here.

1513
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,200
We've divided the meat.

1514
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,000
Thank you.

1515
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,160
Like that little bird waiting for mom

1516
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,320
Get that earthworm back.

1517
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,320
He's opening his mouth.

1518
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,200
It feels good.

1519
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,800
Bring me the bowl.

1520
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,480
Here, shrimp slices.

1521
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,120
You spent all of it.

1522
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:38,600
Thank you.

1523
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,600
He only gave flowers.

1524
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,840
How do you know?

1525
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,560
Is there anything you want to eat?

1526
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,160
I want to eat crayfish.

1527
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:47,960
Do you want shrimp skating?

1528
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,640
Harry, come here.

1529
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,160
Come and eat hot pot.

1530
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,920
I'm really tired.

1531
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,680
I'm very tired now.

1532
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,200
You know?

1533
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,520
Xinxin.

1534
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,160
Xinxin, come here.

1535
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,320
Sit here.

1536
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,040
Hua.

1537
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,080
You went to Gu Beishui Town?

1538
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:32,880
Well...

1539
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,280
Yongning Ancient Town.

1540
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,040
So many tofu.

1541
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,480
We bought a lot of things.

1542
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,440
Its specialty, Yongning Tofu.

1543
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,200
Over there.

1544
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,000
Do you want some?

1545
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,160
I'll get you some.

1546
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,920
Sure.

1547
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,560
I'll get some.

1548
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,160
This is a bribe.

1549
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:49,800
Do you understand?

1550
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,120
Okay.

1551
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,000
Wash it for me tonight.

1552
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,680
For what?

1553
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,320
It's none of your business.

1554
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,760
It's a secret between us boys.

1555
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,200
He bribed me every day.

1556
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,560
He paints pastries for me every day.

1557
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,760
He does?

1558
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,400
Don't listen to him.

1559
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,000
He's so happy.

1560
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,840
He smiled like a monkey.

1561
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,640
I heard it.

1562
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,360
Are you that happy, Tu?

1563
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,160
Dried tofu.

1564
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,280
Try it.

1565
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,520
I put them together.

1566
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,280
There are many kinds.

1567
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,560
Do you want to try it? You haven't tried it.

1568
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,560
It's really delicious.

1569
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:23,920
Is it spicy

1570
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,760
Not very spicy.

1571
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,960
Try this tofu.

1572
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,080
I like beans.

1573
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,640
Really.

1574
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,760
These are all

1575
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,360
we had today.

1576
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,080
We had the first bite.

1577
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,560
I thought

1578
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,080
it's better than drawing.

1579
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,320
It's really delicious.

1580
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,880
But it's not as good as mine.

1581
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,360
Yes.

1582
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,080
That's a line.

1583
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,600
You're not as good as the flow line, the map.

1584
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,120
Why did you

1585
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,040
that day?

1586
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,920
I don't know.

1587
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,720
I'm weak.

1588
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,640
sensitive little boy.

1589
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,640
No, you're not dark.

1590
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,720
Just remove your makeup.

1591
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,120
I think it's so dark.

1592
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,960
So dark.

1593
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,680
It's really dark.

1594
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,560
What about me?

1595
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,320
Brother.

1596
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,360
I mean your face.

1597
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,560
Your hands didn't get tanned.

1598
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,600
They are so sweet.

1599
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,520
They're already together.

1600
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:08,920
This is...

1601
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,400
Yes.

1602
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,720
That's because your face is whiter than mine.

1603
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,280
If you say that,

1604
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,760
your hands are darker than mine.

1605
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,520
Almost.

1606
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,560
I beg you.

1607
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,520
Say it again.

1608
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,000
Where's Xinxin? Doesn't she eat?

1609
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,200
I ate a lot.

1610
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,520
I haven't seen Xinxin.

1611
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,440
I've been sitting here.

1612
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,320
Because a mountain blocked me.

1613
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,720
Yes, he blocked it.

1614
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,800
I blocked him.

1615
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,480
Hua, sit down.

1616
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,080
Let me tell you.

1617
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:33,520
I had a dream

1618
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,600
the night before yesterday.

1619
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,960
At our school,

1620
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,000
He was a superstar.

1621
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,520
And he...

1622
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,080
I met him in the toilet.

1623
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,600
Then I met him.

1624
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,800
I said I met a star.

1625
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,120
I said let's take a photo.

1626
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,080
Then I took him in.

1627
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,080
Then I said, "Take a photo quickly."

1628
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,200
After that?

1629
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,800
I ran into flowers after I came out.

1630
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,240
Then I met them.

1631
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,520
they were acting as partners.

1632
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:51,960
And...

1633
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,000
I said,

1634
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,960
I said,

1635
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,000
Master Hua taught me how to fry eggs.

1636
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,880
I said,

1637
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,920
Why did Hua show up?

1638
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,200
I said I was weird.

1639
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,160
They were filming here.

1640
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,760
I chased them behind the motorcycle.

1641
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
Because he didn't...

1642
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,480
He hasn't signed my autograph yet.

1643
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,760
Then I went after them.

1644
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,080
After I met a slope,

1645
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,400
their car fell over.

1646
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,760
Then we went to save them.

1647
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,960
and found they were fine.

1648
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,200
Then he was lying there.

1649
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,800
He fell down and gave me an autograph and woke up.

1650
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,840
A 12-hour dream.

1651
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,520
That long? That short?

1652
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Catch me.

1653
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,560
I said you'll get scratched.

1654
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,520
You need an injection to tell the truth.

1655
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,080
Really?

1656
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,400
Go wash your hands with soap.

1657
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,040
You're not bleeding.

1658
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,120
There's nothing you can do.

1659
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:38,440
No.

1660
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,400
It's a stray cat.

1661
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,880
Is it bleeding?

1662
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,440
A little.

1663
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,000
Go.

1664
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,680
There's blood.

1665
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,160
Does it count?

1666
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:48,920
Go.

1667
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,560
Go.

1668
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,640
Use cold water for five minutes.

1669
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,760
Hurry.

1670
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,440
No need.

1671
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,960
Use cold water for real.

1672
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
I don't know how.

1673
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:55,800
Brother.

1674
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,120
No.

1675
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,240
It'll be fine

1676
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,400
it will be fine.

1677
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:58,920
Of course.

1678
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,280
If you're not alive,

1679
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,280
It will live.

1680
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,360
Don't scare me.

1681
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,360
There's no soap.

1682
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,920
Use soap first.

1683
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,560
Don't pinch it.

1684
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,200
It's okay.

1685
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,120
I think it's okay.

1686
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,400
It's really okay.

1687
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,400
At least 15 minutes.

1688
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,720
Hold it.

1689
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,480
I don't want to go.

1690
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,840
Keep going.

1691
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,800
I don't want to.

1692
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,480
What are you doing?

1693
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,640
I know.

1694
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,120
it only gets infected

1695
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,440
by a mad dog.

1696
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,160
There is no virus on the claws.

1697
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:38,960
Only saliva.

1698
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,320
It just licked his claws, man.

1699
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,080
I'm really fine.

1700
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,920
No bleeding.

1701
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,720
No bleeding.

1702
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,160
I got a text.

1703
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,280
(Every member of the house)

1704
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,720
Every member of the cabin can be the questioner

1705
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,920
to the Mirror House

1706
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,880
to have an anonymous secret conversation.

1707
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,400
We only have one chance

1708
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,160
to invite the opposite sex.

1709
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,520
So you don't have to use it, right?

1710
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,960
You don't have to use it.

1711
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,040
So this is actually

1712
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,840
to test their feelings.

1713
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,000
They can meet the person they want to ask.

1714
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,120
Go into the Mirror Room.

1715
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,640
But the person who answered

1716
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,760
I don't know who's asking him.

1717
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,280
Yes.

1718
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,600
There's something

1719
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,360
to ask the person I want to ask.

1720
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,400
So I sent it that I need this place

1721
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,640
to have a conversation.

1722
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,800
Are you happy today

1723
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,480
or did you have a good date before?

1724
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:43,960
Today's thought

1725
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,000
has changed a few days ago, right?

1726
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,160
I'm a little hesitant.

1727
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,640
I'll make a comparison.

1728
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,360
I'm really unhappy.

1729
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,200
and make more mistakes.

1730
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,800
You should take care of yourself.

1731
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,440
Just ask if you were happy on your date today.

1732
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,760
Is it from my best friend's point of view

1733
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,120
or asking for myself?

1734
00:55:59,120 --> 00:55:59,720
That night,

1735
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,760
that night.

1736
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,360
I don't like girls with short hair.

1737
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,080
The netizens said

1738
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,320
this friend

1739
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,240
I have similar experience.

1740
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,840
Back then, I was dumped for a while.

1741
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,560
I wanted to hide it from everyone.

1742
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,840
from my family.

1743
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,920
But I sometimes send

1744
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,120
very dramatic

1745
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,480
in the Moments in the middle of the night.

1746
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,080
my brother

1747
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,440
by my brother.

1748
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,000
One day,

1749
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,960
my sister-in-law asked me

1750
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,240
if I was dumped.

1751
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,720
I knew my brother guessed it.

1752
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,840
But he was shy to ask me.

1753
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,800
and asked my sister-in-law to ask me.

1754
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,720
I feel that

1755
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,320
between siblings

1756
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,160
I think I can catch

1757
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,040
that no one else can.

1758
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,480
So I call this

1759
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,400
telepathy.

1760
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,440
We're not twins,

1761
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,360
but there are also

1762
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,480
I hope you cherish

1763
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,520
telepathy.

1764
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,280
When you find something wrong with the other person,

1765
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,520
help each other out.

1766
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,880
