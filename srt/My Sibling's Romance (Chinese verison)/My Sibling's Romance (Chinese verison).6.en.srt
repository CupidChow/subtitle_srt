1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
A small party.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like we have wild wine right away.

3
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,080
Feels like there's a wild wine.

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,400
will watch Love Sisters first.

5
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,360
Show us your siblings.

6
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
We are half-siblings.

7
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,440
a family.

8
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,560
Reform a family.

9
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,039
Two moms.

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,080
Hello.

11
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm Hua's mother.

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,960
Hello.

13
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,360
I'm Yu's mom.

14
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,880
Dad is a handsome man.

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,360
My dad is actually an all-rounder.

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,320
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,600
And the mechanical workshop can do anything.

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,440
He will take me to the competition.

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,560
and put me behind him.

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,240
and then the front wheel.

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,920
Back wheel.

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,840
Drifting

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,759
(He shook me around.)

24
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,520
Because her dad

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
He's very ambitious.

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,600
He doesn't want me to get involved in his business.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,120
And I

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,040
I have some ideas

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,639
and his work.

30
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,120
As a woman,

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,520
as a woman,

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,520
I just want to

33
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,600
for the rest of my life.

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,600
But I don't want to quarrel every day.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,800
and cry.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,920
Then...

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,880
we still chose to divorce.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,160
Yu looks like my dad.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,560
I divorced her dad.

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,920
But I never

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,320
in front of a kid.

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,400
Her dad is so handsome.

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,560
Kind.

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,200
I was young back then.

45
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,120
I was young and immature.

46
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,680
He insisted on getting a divorce.

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,880
That's why

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,120
to grow up.

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,320
When I was young, I thought my dad had an impact on me.

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,560
my dad had nothing to do

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,840
it doesn't affect me at all.

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,240
After I grew up,

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,079
I think my insecurity

54
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,320
and sensitive.

55
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,800
may also come from

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
the lack of father's love since childhood.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
I've never...

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,240
including now,

59
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,040
I'm actually allergic to romance.

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,120
I think it was formed when I was young.

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,000
Because I don't think anyone will surprise me.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,280
No expectations, no disappointment.

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,320
I've always felt that way.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,200
Because elementary school and junior high school

65
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,320
basically boarding.

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,280
So I've been quite independent since I was a kid.

67
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,880
My family life

68
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,200
in my family.

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,840
After college, it's because of work.

70
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,320
I moved.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,240
I feel like I'm always moving.

72
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Well,

73
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,320
I want to have my own home.

74
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,040
After the divorce,

75
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,560
I went to Guangzhou.

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,040
When I left Ze for the first time,

77
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,400
she came to see me off.

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,160
She cried heartbroken.

79
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,240
She grabbed my box and said,

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,560
"Mom."

81
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,600
I want my mom.

82
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,200
This scene has always been in my heart.

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,480
I'll call my mom.

84
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,840
And...

85
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,360
my mom's phone number

86
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,200
It hasn't changed,

87
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,880
but I couldn't get through.

88
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
Every time I called,

89
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
I remember a smooth part.

90
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,040
Well...

91
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,400
Hello.

92
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,760
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

93
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,680
If you need her to call back,

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,760
China Telecom from Hunan Province.

95
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,320
(Mobile users of China, please dial 1259.)

96
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
Add each other's phone number.

97
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,600
This part

98
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,200
in my mind.

99
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,880
Because

100
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,200
It's so smooth.

101
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,520
It's so clear.

102
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,880
Every time I call you,

103
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,280
Because he called me in Guangzhou.

104
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,440
and called my phone,

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
Then you have to add a zero

106
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,400
to get through.

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,960
Because my mom

108
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,960
very frugal.

109
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,160
are all like this.

110
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,680
She didn't tell her the zero.

111
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,640
So I've been regretful.

112
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,760
Sometimes,

113
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,640
she wants to call me the most,

114
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,080
When she heard my voice,

115
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,440
I wasn't by her side.

116
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,720
I felt guilty.

117
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,800
I feel sorry for her.

118
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,560
Yes.

119
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,080
How many times

120
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,640
How many times does she have to play it?

121
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,840
She memorized it so well.

122
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,760
It's not easy for mom

123
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,080
But it was really expensive to play long-distance.

124
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,760
Especially for someone like Grandma,

125
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,080
she doesn't have much income.

126
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,320
So, saving money

127
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,920
is the only way she can earn money.

128
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,640
So she doesn't want to spend money.

129
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,520
Maybe she needs to save money to raise her granddaughter.

130
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,120
I just didn't expect

131
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,800
to have a real child.

132
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,080
It sounds so regretful.

133
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,760
Yes, it hurts.

134
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,280
Show your siblings.

135
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,680
The happiest time

136
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,280
is that she comes back every year.

137
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,960
Because she seldom comes back.

138
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,560
She comes back every year to celebrate the Spring Festival.

139
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,800
I'm so excited every time I see her.

140
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,920
I want my mom to remember me.

141
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,080
when I was the prettiest.

142
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,480
I wear pretty clothes every year

143
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,320
But that's a spring dress

144
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,400
Wearing a denim jacket in winter

145
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,600
It's wearing

146
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,760
that was blue when I was young.

147
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,640
It's not cotton shoes below.

148
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,800
She's wearing single shoes.

149
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,680
When I saw her,

150
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
when I saw her.

151
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,640
Mom.

152
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,440
I saw it from afar.

153
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,040
and ran over.

154
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,520
She was heartbroken when she saw it.

155
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,159
But I want to show her

156
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,640
to her.

157
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,280
The most exciting thing is reunion.

158
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,240
I'm most afraid of parting with her.

159
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,800
She would ask my mom

160
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,640
where my mom would sleep tonight.

161
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,440
Is she on the train tonight?

162
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
I asked my mom

163
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
what she eats.

164
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,240
I don't have to take ten yuan from my mom.

165
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,400
I asked my mom to buy more delicious food.

166
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,920
Later, my mom told me this.

167
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,800
I was so touched.

168
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,680
To be honest,

169
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,640
You're so sensible.

170
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,200
I sleep with my mom every time I go back.

171
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,240
And my mom is still willing to kiss me.

172
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,320
She kisses me when she sees me.

173
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,560
Hugging my face and kissing.

174
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,120
Because we didn't spend much time together

175
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,280
in childhood.

176
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,560
So when I grow up,

177
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,000
I cherish every meeting.

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,880
Hello, everyone.

179
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,440
I’m Yu’s mom.

180
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,120
and Xiaomei's mother.

181
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,400
We're from Changsha, Hunan.

182
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,120
She gets along with me

183
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,480
like friends.

184
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,720
Maybe it's because she's too young

185
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,920
So she's quite

186
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,560
with me.

187
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,760
Every weekend,

188
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,080
every weekend.

189
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,560
Watching a movie?

190
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,280
and play with my friends and friends.

191
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,360
She didn't teach me much.

192
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,240
She will influence me quietly

193
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,200
She always supports me

194
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,680
she always supported my idea

195
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,480
and gave me

196
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,160
and do everything she can

197
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,560
to provide me.

198
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,480
Actually,

199
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
sometimes I call her by her full name.

200
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,760
I think he'll never grow up.

201
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,120
But in his heart,

202
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,960
very sensible.

203
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,800
My first impression of my dad

204
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,520
he was different from other men.

205
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,760
He was attracted

206
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,679
by this mature charm.

207
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,720
Actually, Yu's dad was my first love.

208
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,720
I was with him in my twenties.

209
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,000
For a girl,

210
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,800
when I established my view of love,

211
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,880
my dad entered my life.

212
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,360
and Yu.

213
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,040
So cute.

214
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,640
But this

215
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,000
a harmonious atmosphere.

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This kind of warm scene

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
last long.

218
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,960
When Yu was one year old,

219
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,000
my dad got sick.

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,680
When he was four,

221
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,120
he passed away.

222
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,760
Yes.

223
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,320
After dad left,

224
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,120
the atmosphere in my hometown

225
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,760
will be touching.

226
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,600
Then I brought my child

227
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,240
to Changsha alone.

228
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,880
Since Yu was a freshman,

229
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,680
when we were seven,

230
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,320
we lived in Changsha.

231
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,520
and study.

232
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
My child is very young.

233
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,600
I can't

234
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,160
let other kids

235
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
know he doesn't have a father.

236
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
I'm afraid...

237
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,360
He's just a kid.

238
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,800
He makes fun of him.

239
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,160
or him.

240
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,360
Then we reached a consensus.

241
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,920
We won't tell others in a tacit way.

242
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,800
How is dad?

243
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,040
It's not easy for me.

244
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,400
I don't know how to fill in

245
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,680
I don't know how to fill in my father's column.

246
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,040
But I still write my dad's name.

247
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,600
My number is on my dad's column.

248
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,200
Because the first person he contacted

249
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,840
is dad.

250
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,200
I'll leave a number

251
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,640
another number.

252
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,400
I'll use two numbers.

253
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,880
Yes.

254
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,520
When I realized

255
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,920
this love is gone,

256
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,520
I may think if he is here,

257
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,560
I would imagine

258
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,840
if it will be a better result.

259
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,480
I have many families around me.

260
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,080
happy and happy.

261
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,720
I think

262
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,000
when I visit their house,

263
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,240
I would think

264
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,280
if he was my dad,

265
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,480
if my dad was like that,

266
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,320
will he make me happier?

267
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,640
and happier?

268
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,360
Will my mom be

269
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,440
be happier?

270
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
I just need someone to rely on.

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
instead of the shoulder.

272
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I think like this.

273
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
Although

274
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,600
our family is not a normal family

275
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,960
is very complete.

276
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,880
A corner is missing.

277
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,480
But I think our family

278
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,600
is a loving family.

279
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,560
I think

280
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,040
get along so well now.

281
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
most of the credit comes from my siblings.

282
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,760
She was very nice to me.

283
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,040
and took good care of me.

284
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,680
as my own.

285
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,120
The most memorable thing is

286
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,360
I was at my grandmother's house.

287
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,800
It was already midnight.

288
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,600
I found that I had a fever.

289
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,440
Grandma can't go.

290
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,640
My weight...

291
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,800
Then I called my brother and mom.

292
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,720
Ten minutes.

293
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,320
she appeared in front of my house and knocked.

294
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,760
and carried me on her back.

295
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,720
and knock on the door of the small clinic.

296
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,040
Because our medical conditions

297
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,880
wasn't very advanced.

298
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,440
Basically, our county

299
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,600
is a small clinic.

300
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,920
It was already midnight.

301
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,440
So I had to knock one by one.

302
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,240
Then find the IV and give me an injection.

303
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,640
Stay with me.

304
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,840
This is the most memorable thing for me.

305
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,520
And my grandma

306
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,760
my grandma told me.

307
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,440
Two moms are great.

308
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,120
No wonder

309
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,920
at the same time.

310
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,840
Yes.

311
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,520
I used to be Mrs. Xiang.

312
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,400
Then I became Mummy Xiang.

313
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I remember the first time

314
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,320
when I called her mom,

315
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,040
she was cooking for us.

316
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,920
She kept shouting

317
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,440
I was behind and patted her.

318
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,840
Nanny Xiang.

319
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,520
Can I call you mum in the future?

320
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Of course.

321
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,080
I think the image of a child

322
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,360
a mom may wear an apron

323
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
and cook delicious food for her.

324
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,280
Actually, when I heard

325
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,560
my responsibility to her

326
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,080
my responsibility to her

327
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,480
I think this child

328
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,960
I must love her

329
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,840
and love her.

330
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,520
Why is it so beautiful?

331
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,320
My mom told me

332
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,920
we need to

333
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,480
we need to love each other.

334
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,240
Mom often taught him to love sister

335
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
Be good to sister

336
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,600
Yes.

337
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,360
Anyway, he always reminds us.

338
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,880
to engrave our genes.

339
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,440
Great.

340
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,760
Sister Wang Yin-cheol will sleep with me.

341
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,160
I'll sleep with you if you dance.

342
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,320
Dance?

343
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,520
I love to act cute with my sister.

344
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,840
I think after dad passed away,

345
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,040
after dad passed away.

346
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,600
There's more than one person.

347
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,800
My grandma

348
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,400
my mother,

349
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,440
and my brother's mom.

350
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,240
Although there's a corner missing,

351
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,640
I think this part

352
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,040
has made up

353
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
in other ways.

354
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,240
and even beyond it.

355
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,600
Just be yourself.

356
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

357
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,440
Laugh if you want.

358
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,320
No matter how much corners of your mouth are,

359
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,160
just smile.

360
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Just be happy.

361
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,760
Let your true self attract those who love you.

362
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,240
Wish her success

363
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,800
in this room

364
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,640
who can match you.

365
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,480
If you can't find him,

366
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:33,920
It's okay.

367
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm here.

368
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,520
This brother is so nice.

369
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,600
Because our family

370
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,760
So my younger brother

371
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,560
in life

372
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,960
as a man.

373
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,200
I am

374
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,920
very insecure.

375
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,040
But he gives me a great sense of security

376
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,840
Holding her feet

377
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,760
Like you asked me before

378
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,320
What if

379
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
no one likes you in the house?

380
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,040
I said it was okay.

381
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,960
In the corner,

382
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,360
in the corner.

383
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,600
I hope she can find

384
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,120
who can hold her in her hands.

385
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,320
as a treasure.

386
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,680
Of course, if none of you

387
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,040
who you really want to be with,

388
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,480
Then go home.

389
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,040
We'll wait for you at home.

390
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
The flowers and pictures are great.

391
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,280
Yes.

392
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,120
I'm telling you, I'm suffocating.

393
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,920
Let me take a rest.

394
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,440
Close the door.

395
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,720
We are like

396
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,600
like agents.

397
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,520
What is this?

398
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,240
A letter.

399
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,840
We received that message today.

400
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,760
Like me.

401
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,320
give my brother to the man I like.

402
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,280
Someone likes you.

403
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,800
So he gave me this letter.

404
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,600
Not necessarily.

405
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,160
Yes.

406
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,840
They are so hard to guess.

407
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,160
Do you like today?

408
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,320
Today?

409
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,440
Yes.

410
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,320
Who do you think

411
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,880
For now,

412
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,360
which one do you think is better?

413
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,400
Who is easier to get along with?

414
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,880
I think...

415
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,480
Harry.

416
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,200
Soup.

417
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,840
But he is E.

418
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,360
He doesn't talk.

419
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,840
Yes.

420
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,520
My roommate just guessed

421
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,480
he said Susu seemed to have feelings for me.

422
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,680
What about himself?

423
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,480
He...

424
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm not telling you.

425
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,400
I still can't tell you.

426
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,880
Why not?

427
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,600
I can't say that.

428
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,160
Just discussing.

429
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm your sister.

430
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,720
Why can't I tell you?

431
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,400
Hurry up.

432
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,560
Xiao Ling.

433
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,320
Yes.

434
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,920
Because he thinks Xiaoling is pretty.

435
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,520
And...

436
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,920
Very high.

437
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,480
But I asked him

438
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
I said you like I (introverted).

439
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,200
or E?

440
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,400
He said he likes E.

441
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,480
But Xiaoling is an introvert.

442
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, Xiaoling is pure.

443
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,680
I think after getting along,

444
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,520
after getting along.

445
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,200
I want to know

446
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,680
who they like

447
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,880
I like a little bit.

448
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,599
Find out

449
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,839
who the first impression is.

450
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,319
I went to ask about girls.

451
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,480
Let's go for a walk.

452
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,359
Yes, ask around.

453
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,040
Fatty has found out anyway.

454
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,280
Yes, Fatty found out.

455
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,599
Ask about the soup and Harry.

456
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,000
I'll ask Su Xinxin for you.

457
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Hua is really strong.

458
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,480
And I think a lot of touching things

459
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,960
are on my mom.

460
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,440
Actually their mothers

461
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,600
a lot of trouble.

462
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,640
But she's a tough woman.

463
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,720
She went to work far away

464
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,640
she went to a faraway place to work.

465
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,800
We only meet once a year.

466
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,320
But she remembers

467
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,760
she remembers all these.

468
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
and little thoughts.

469
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,440
I want to leave a beautiful impression

470
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,640
in my mom's heart.

471
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,000
And in such cold (weather)

472
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,920
Wear your best clothes.

473
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,440
I think this part is good.

474
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,280
So touching.

475
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,320
Their families

476
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,600
and each family

477
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,720
are different.

478
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,160
After watching your movies,

479
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,480
I feel that the original family

480
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,560
means a lot

481
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,520
for the child's growth.

482
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,160
Yes.

483
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,200
You'll find

484
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,560
the same family changes

485
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,040
will have a different personality.

486
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,760
Yes.

487
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,160
You will find that when she was young,

488
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,720
she experienced

489
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,880
The family atmosphere has changed.

490
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,640
HAVE C

491
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,400
such a family

492
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,960
HAVE GREAT to divorce

493
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,080
It's like what Fatty said.

494
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,640
like Fatty said.

495
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,920
She's trying to

496
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,440
the initiative of her life.

497
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,200
Yes.

498
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,680
What about Fatty?

499
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,240
He was naughty when he was young.

500
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,840
He wasn't like a brother.

501
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,760
He started to

502
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,200
a change of family character.

503
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,080
I started to care about my sister.

504
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,360
and made a very good

505
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,280
a very good character.

506
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,360
For example, flowers and maps.

507
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,120
The map will be safer.

508
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,880
You'll find that he's in a strange environment.

509
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,080
and soon

510
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,280
talk to people

511
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,160
and joking with others.

512
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,920
Flowers are more independent.

513
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,240
She's quietly

514
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,000
handling many things alone.

515
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,160
Their families

516
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,480
and each family

517
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,600
is different.

518
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,080
What is your family environment like?

519
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,400
We are relaxed.

520
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,920
Relax, really.

521
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,880
My parents are loving

522
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,080
We still hold hands and sleep together.

523
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,560
And my brother and I

524
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,960
We're all in different places,

525
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,520
we keep in touch sometimes.

526
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,760
So when I saw the letter part,

527
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,520
I thought

528
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,760
I think I can try.

529
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,240
Because the three of us

530
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,840
have never expressed

531
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,560
so openly.

532
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,200
The only time was a long time ago.

533
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,880
I broke up once.

534
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,480
my brother knew about this.

535
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,960
Then he sent me a message.

536
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,560
The three of us have a group chat.

537
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,680
He said, "It's okay."

538
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,320
Are you sad?

539
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,400
Cry if you're sad.

540
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,240
We'll call you.

541
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,080
You're always the best.

542
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,760
Don't be sad for someone unworthy.

543
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,880
Then I said,

544
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,600
it's really good to have two younger brothers.

545
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,720
You won't be lonely.

546
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,200
And you know

547
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,920
you have someone to rely on.

548
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,840
My family is very typical.

549
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,880
Chinese family.

550
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,320
My dad is very strict.

551
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,720
My dad and I

552
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,800
almost

553
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,240
Maybe

554
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,400
I won't contact her for half a year.

555
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,440
But I often contact my mom

556
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,880
When I was young,

557
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,760
my dad was so strict with me

558
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
Every festival,

559
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,320
as long as there are many relatives

560
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,280
many relatives eat together,

561
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,760
you have to

562
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,320
a good habit

563
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,480
a good habit.

564
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
When I stood up,

565
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,400
I started crying.

566
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
I cried and said,

567
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,400
I wish my uncle

568
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,640
I wish my aunt

569
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,720
I wish you two safety.

570
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,040
How old were you?

571
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,760
I was very young.

572
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
So when I cry,

573
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
when I cry.

574
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,560
I think he's so cute.

575
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,880
Really, so cute.

576
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
This cousin and cousin

577
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,280
They'll line up behind me.

578
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,520
Because I'm the only boy in the family.

579
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,600
I want to take the lead.

580
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,800
I want to set an example for them.

581
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,800
Did they laugh at you?

582
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,680
They're crying too.

583
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,760
Kids cry like this

584
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,280
They all cried

585
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,040
Adults will laugh happily

586
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,520
No adults always pull a long face

587
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,240
Your family is very strict.

588
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,560
Yes, very strict and disciplined.

589
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,280
When I was young,

590
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
It's really hard to express love.

591
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
So I envy them

592
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,440
to have such a specific environment and time

593
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,400
to express their love to their brothers.

594
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,840
I think it's good.

595
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,680
Maybe after the recording,

596
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,840
I'll still send a message

597
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,600
to my parents.

598
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,520
(He's crying.)

599
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,280
Dad.

600
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,480
I miss you.

601
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,360
I miss you.

602
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,840
I have to express my love actively.

603
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,760
I have a child now.

604
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,880
I also hope

605
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,000
will be like this in the future.

606
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,720
Just like they're still playing around.

607
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,200
I knew that when they grow up,

608
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,360
when they grow up.

609
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,520
They are not like us

610
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,680
to express their love.

611
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,520
I'm different

612
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,680
I'm supposed to be a VI without siblings.

613
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm the only daughter of my family.

614
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,480
And my sister is the only daughter of my family.

615
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,920
But in the same year,

616
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,520
when I was seven and my sister was four,

617
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,960
her mother passed away.

618
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,440
My dad passed away.

619
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,160
Because my dad and my mom

620
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,680
are in the same factory.

621
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,760
in the same factory

622
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,680
I went bankrupt.

623
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
So life was

624
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,560
very difficult.

625
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,480
Then someone suddenly made a joke.

626
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
I suggest that it's better to try

627
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
why don't you try?

628
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,320
You can form a family.

629
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,480
Suddenly they would think

630
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,920
when there was no way to go,

631
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,720
it might be a path.

632
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,600
And our broken family

633
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,080
together.

634
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,560
My sister and I were like old friends at first sight.

635
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,720
I don't think

636
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,800
that we were strangers.

637
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,840
Maybe my dad has been sick since childhood.

638
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,760
her mother got sick.

639
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,720
Everyone is focusing on taking care of the patients.

640
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
No one cared about us.

641
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,520
We grew up alone.

642
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,800
But I suddenly feel like I have a sister.

643
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,280
I have a sister.

644
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,920
It's like you know me and I understand you.

645
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,840
Then we cling to each other.

646
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,560
We were arranged to sleep in the same room

647
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,920
Two beds sleep next to each other.

648
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,400
My parents were great too.

649
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,440
My dad always treats me as his own son.

650
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,640
He was very nice to me.

651
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,200
I'm angry.

652
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,840
I mean my sister.

653
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,280
And my mom

654
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,600
Well,

655
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,400
When my sister was angry, she said

656
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,640
She wears the same clothes

657
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,480
wearing the same clothes

658
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
and knitting a sweater.

659
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,600
So if my sister and I

660
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,960
know about this background,

661
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,880
I don't think we're half-parents.

662
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,880
I remember once

663
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,120
when my mom had an acute appendicitis,

664
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,920
I took a big project.

665
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,760
I couldn't rush back.

666
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,480
At that time,

667
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,880
my sister went to accompany her.

668
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,120
She was hospitalized for a week.

669
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,400
When I arrived on the last day,

670
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,440
I found my sister

671
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,320
just like sleeping on the floor.

672
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,120
I felt so sorry at that time.

673
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
But I'm really grateful.

674
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,080
In life,

675
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,120
when you can't take care of yourself,

676
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,160
you have a brother.

677
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,520
Yes.

678
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,400
She will stand up

679
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,720
without any complaints.

680
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,000
I helped you

681
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
behind your back,

682
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,280
I was really happy.

683
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,560
When you said it just now,

684
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,160
I don't know why, but I just thought of

685
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
It's like a sibling.

686
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,400
You said you were busy with something else.

687
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
You seem to have a clone.

688
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,040
It feels like a clone between brothers.

689
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,960
He can help you hold on to IYI.

690
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Having two children is a little hard.

691
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,760
But I thought if I gave birth to them

692
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,480
because of me,

693
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
With them by my side,

694
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,120
When they grow up,

695
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,600
they can rely on each other like this.

696
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,080
I suddenly feel it's worth it.

697
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,840
I was so proud just now.

698
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,680
So far,

699
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,480
our members

700
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,600
For the audience,

701
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,400
The siblings are clear now.

702
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,360
Yes.

703
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,240
We are already

704
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
the God's perspective of brother and sister relationship.

705
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,080
But they don't know

706
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,240
who their siblings are.

707
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,280
Dating is fun.

708
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,040
Dating will be more fun.

709
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,000
Who's going?

710
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,760
Me.

711
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,880
Let's go together.

712
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,720
Let's go.

713
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,960
Someone is coming.

714
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,880
Someone is coming.

715
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,720
Mission?

716
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,520
I think we're going on a date the next day.

717
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Too fast.

718
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,960
It's a long page.

719
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,600
I saw it.

720
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,240
Please read it.

721
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,400
Please give an ad-lib.

722
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,320
Read it.

723
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,040
From today onwards,

724
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,800
in an anonymous way.

725
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,240
And send the message.

726
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,320
You need to complete it in one space.

727
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,320
Text messages are personal secrets.

728
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,120
No discussion.

729
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,080
The third message is very important.

730
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,240
The map must be serious and sincere.

731
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,880
Guoli.

732
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,360
I didn't know who to vote for.

733
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,400
The three of them

734
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,640
Tu Tu, Fatty, Harry,

735
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,160
I really want to know.

736
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,520
But if I have to choose,

737
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,000
I want to choose

738
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,480
to talk about.

739
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,280
Because I feel more relaxed.

740
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,760
and happier.

741
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,760
Read it face to face.

742
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,880
You need to hide your micro expression.

743
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,080
They'll tell us who I want to send it to.

744
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,560
and the directors will send it to you.

745
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,520
But I don't know

746
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
I don't know who sent it.

747
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,440
Harry will send it to Xin.

748
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,720
I also think

749
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,120
Guolifang.

750
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,840
I was a little nervous at first.

751
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,720
I think I'm fat.

752
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,200
The three of them are really handsome.

753
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,960
The picture looks sunny.

754
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,600
Harry

755
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,360
I saw it today.

756
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,960
I think

757
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,600
especially when he cooks.

758
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,240
No need to say the soup.

759
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,120
He's handsome at first sight.

760
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,040
He's handsome.

761
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,520
And he has great experience.

762
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
and has high education.

763
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,960
I think he must get the most votes.

764
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,000
In each episode,

765
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,040
will follow our content

766
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,600
according to the content

767
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,520
to make a deduction.

768
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,720
Separate into two groups.

769
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,240
After the discussion,

770
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,400
after the discussion.

771
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,080
The team with the most correct answer

772
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,080
can get one

773
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,880
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

774
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,520
In our last episode,

775
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,600
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

776
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,440
The guest who got the most votes

777
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,240
will receive a mysterious award

778
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,560
provided by Guoli.

779
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,240
Our deduction for this episode is

780
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,000
Please guess the direction of the message.

781
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,680
Okay.

782
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,320
Now, members of each team

783
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,000
to connect on the board.

784
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,400
Let's get into

785
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
of "Love Sisters".

786
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,800
How?

787
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,920
OK. OK.

788
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,360
Yes.

789
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,920
Let's go with 43.

790
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,280
OK.

791
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,120
Black and white.

792
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,560
I'm white.

793
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,160
I'm black.

794
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,000
Just the four of us.

795
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,720
The three of us.

796
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,760
Let's discuss

797
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,640
Come here.

798
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,480
You come to the middle.

799
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,280
The soup first.

800
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,600
I'll make the soup.

801
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,080
Xinxin will give him

802
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,320
Harry for Esther.

803
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,080
Another vote.

804
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,040
Tu Tu likes the tall Xiaoling.

805
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,800
I think the map is...

806
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,160
Can they have double arrows?

807
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,840
It's hard to choose.

808
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,440
It's hard to guess.

809
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,960
Wait.

810
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,280
Is Zhudan Guoli so good?

811
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,560
Is Guoli so good?

812
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,160
Everyone is different.

813
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,920
Hurry up.

814
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,840
We're done.

815
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,440
Three, two, one. Time's up.

816
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,840
Song Yeon-ju is surprised by the other team.

817
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,680
Really?

818
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,720
Our guess is Seamless Stitch.

819
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,520
Yes, I think it's reasonable.

820
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,480
Very natural.

821
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,360
Come on.

822
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,680
One group is Song Yanju, Ms. Lynn and me.

823
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,040
One is four guests.

824
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,280
Our answer is to show us

825
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,320
It has become three pairs.

826
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,840
The map chose Su.

827
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,440
Xiao Ling chose the drawing.

828
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,080
Yes.

829
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,240
Xiao Ling doesn't have much connection with the map.

830
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,600
But she actually

831
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,400
They expressed their feelings in the house of siblings.

832
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,520
I think he's like me.

833
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,640
Is he in the same major as me?

834
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,760
He's quite considerate.

835
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,000
He said that.

836
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,920
Yes, but I think

837
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,800
she said that on the first day.

838
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,440
After we started dating the next day,

839
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,720
she'll think that fatty suits her better.

840
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,240
Yes.

841
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,240
Hua mentioned it several times.

842
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,760
what she wants is unconditional preference.

843
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,840
So maybe because of this,

844
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,400
her fat

845
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,960
was kicked out by her.

846
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,680
Liberation.

847
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,320
Because her brother said

848
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,640
Fatty has feelings for Xiaoling.

849
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,200
Actually, I think she and Fatty are a good match.

850
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,680
Yes.

851
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:40,960
Fatty and anyone are suitable for IYI.

852
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,040
Fatty and anyone are suitable.

853
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,640
Order Trump Fatty.

854
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,040
Zhu Chuan is

855
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,440
Liberation.

856
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,360
Fatty, I also think Xiaoling is good.

857
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,960
Because he seems

858
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,200
a more stable person.

859
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,280
He can take care of anyone.

860
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,160
Right?

861
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,840
So she kicked him out.

862
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,080
Let's see what Fatty will do.

863
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,200
Right.

864
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,680
Yes.

865
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,240
Next, we're going to

866
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,440
we're going to have wild wine.

867
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
It’s time to reveal the truth.

868
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,280
You are indeed a 1.9 meter athlete.

869
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,120
When can you take me to play ping-pong?

870
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,280
I guess it's from Susu.

871
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,920
She's quite happy.

872
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,560
I remember

873
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,360
familiar language.

874
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,920
She usually says

875
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,320
if you are

876
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,800
See if you have the ability

877
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,480
to study in Tsinghua.

878
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,600
So you’re 1.9 meters.

879
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,080
Yes.

880
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,480
Susu sent the soup.

881
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,640
The soup impressed me.

882
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,760
First, he’s from Tsinghua.

883
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,240
Second, he’s 1.9 meters.

884
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,880
I can feel that

885
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,680
he's usually a quiet person.

886
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,640
But he's talking about what he loves.

887
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,880
and his school,

888
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,240
He's really talking about

889
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,440
about his experience.

890
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,840
Look at his shining points.

891
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,960
I wanted to know more about him.

892
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,000
So I sent this message to Soup.

893
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,080
He was really proud.

894
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,960
He has a star eye.

895
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,880
I also sent the soup to Susu.

896
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,520
I guess the soup was sent to me.

897
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,560
Because when we were in the car,

898
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,640
we were listening to music together.

899
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,360
And

900
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,720
we looked through

901
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,760
the growth album,

902
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,520
he mentioned that he practiced sports.

903
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,960
So I think

904
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,040
the soup must be sent to me.

905
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,440
I sent it to Susu.

906
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,680
After all, my first impression is more interested in her.

907
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,800
She's kind of

908
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,680
a little special to me today.

909
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,960
When I was in the car,

910
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,880
she gave me her earphone.

911
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,040
The song we listened together.

912
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,800
Their language is very specific.

913
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,120
Shi...

914
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,200
We can see

915
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,480
we can see who he's talking to.

916
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,800
When you look at Susu,

917
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,720
in your eyes.

918
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,240
Look, you got my message.

919
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,480
But the soup

920
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,400
can't respond.

921
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,320
Yes.

922
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,760
We're even.

923
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,880
Next.

924
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,440
I think it's either Xin.

925
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,760
or Xiaoling.

926
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,280
Because when I talk to them today,

927
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,800
more.

928
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,440
I haven't figured it out.

929
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,440
I guess it can't be Hua anyway.

930
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,800
This is Xinxin.

931
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,160
I think it's Xinxin.

932
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,240
I kept calling him chef.

933
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,560
The message I sent today

934
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,600
to Harry.

935
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,560
Xin.

936
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:24,920
Double arrows.

937
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,240
I have a new feeling about him today.

938
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,040
Maybe what I said to him today

939
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,920
to him today.

940
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,480
And yesterday I thought

941
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,360
he's hard to communicate with.

942
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,000
I think it's easy to communicate today.

943
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
When we were talking a lot,

944
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,600
I received a message about your feelings today.

945
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,640
But I didn't understand.

946
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,280
what a dream is.

947
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,160
I only understand the last sentence.

948
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,120
I do have feelings for him.

949
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,280
Maybe Harry.

950
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,400
Is it a map?

951
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,640
I don't know.

952
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
I chose Esther

953
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,280
I chose Xinxin.

954
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,920
After a day with me,

955
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,520
I did get to know more.

956
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,800
So I can try to know more.

957
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,360
What are you laughing at?

958
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,920
Did you see my phone?

959
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,640
No.

960
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,280
It's quiet.

961
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,840
I want to laugh.

962
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,280
You're good at

963
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,520
It's good.

964
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,400
I can't see it at all.

965
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,680
The screen is the best.

966
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,240
It's a marvelous cube.

967
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,200
is clear.

968
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,400
Guoli.

969
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,400
Just kidding.

970
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,800
Guolifang.

971
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,680
The message I received today is...

972
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,640
I really can't guess.

973
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,720
Tu, who sent me this message?

974
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,880
Because I think

975
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,520
Susu may have some hints.

976
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm quite confused.

977
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,960
How do I guess?

978
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,160
Lu, I think it's Xiaoling.

979
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Because my message today

980
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,800
to Tu.

981
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,199
Because our majors

982
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,440
is similar.

983
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,280
Xiaoling, I also think

984
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,360
a relaxed person.

985
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,080
So I think drawing may be

986
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,320
I want to know more about

987
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
and get to know

988
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,520
such a candidate.

989
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,840
We're one point ahead.

990
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,960
I guess it's a map.

991
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,000
Because he said

992
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,560
I wanted to go skiing with you.

993
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,400
Because when we talked

994
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,040
in the piano,

995
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,159
we talked about hobbies.

996
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,159
Then I said,

997
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,280
I actually like outdoor.

998
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,480
I like skiing.

999
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,159
I only know how to use double boards.

1000
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,440
I don't know how to play alone.

1001
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,320
I can't do it alone.

1002
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,360
So I think

1003
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,840
these two are related.

1004
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,600
So I guess it's a map.

1005
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,960
I'm quite happy.

1006
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,159
I sent Xiao Ling

1007
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,080
to Xiao Ling.

1008
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,920
I think Xiao Ling

1009
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,200
is very compatible

1010
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,240
are very compatible.

1011
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,080
They are two arrows.

1012
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,200
It's going well.

1013
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,080
Flower.

1014
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,880
My reaction was Flower.

1015
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,960
Flower.

1016
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,840
Because she told me this before.

1017
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,720
So at that moment,

1018
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,120
when I saw that text,

1019
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,400
I thought it was Flower.

1020
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
She must be happy.

1021
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,200
You can't keep your mouth shut

1022
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,160
the corners of your mouth can't be suppressed.

1023
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,520
There are three handsome guys there.

1024
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,120
I got one.

1025
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
I think

1026
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,560
I have some competitiveness.

1027
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,440
Your smile is worthless.

1028
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,880
Fatty.

1029
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,720
I voted for Fatty through the message

1030
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,400
I think his emotional value today

1031
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,560
is really full.

1032
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,440
It makes me happy and comfortable.

1033
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,640
They get along so well.

1034
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,320
Yeah.

1035
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,520
I think Fatty

1036
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,360
sent me a love message.

1037
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,560
He bought me a cup.

1038
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,120
He asked me to choose the color.

1039
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,640
Fatty.

1040
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,960
I think so.

1041
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,040
I sent this message to Hua.

1042
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,360
I feel more comfortable

1043
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,440
with Hua.

1044
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,480
We can go shopping

1045
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,880
including when we're cooking.

1046
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,040
We have great chemistry.

1047
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,920
So I think my feelings for her

1048
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,280
more.

1049
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,080
I think Hua can guess

1050
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,800
when she receives that text.

1051
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,680
They have great chemistry.

1052
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,240
They are really in sync.

1053
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,960
They will say who gave it to.

1054
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,320
Yes.

1055
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,320
My brother

1056
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,360
received a message.

1057
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,720
I was so happy.

1058
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,040
I wanted to see him.

1059
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,120
I think he must be happy.

1060
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,520
This is bad.

1061
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,640
I think it might be Hua.

1062
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,720
When we were together today,

1063
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,560
I can feel

1064
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,880
Hua and my brother interact more.

1065
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,760
At the moment,

1066
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,600
Who is it?

1067
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,200
I'm a little confused.

1068
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,720
I don't know if it's a map

1069
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,280
or Harry.

1070
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,200
I'm having a headache.

1071
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,080
I don't know who it is.

1072
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,920
I guess Harry.

1073
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,440
Harry

1074
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,840
chatting with me.

1075
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,120
I don't know.

1076
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,360
he just made friends with me.

1077
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,440
Making friends?

1078
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,280
Or...

1079
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,840
I'm not sure.

1080
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,040
A little surprise

1081
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,560
I thought he would receive more soup.

1082
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,160
I think the person who texted him

1083
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,440
is Susu.

1084
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,720
Because Sue

1085
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,320
The person who gave me

1086
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,280
to me yesterday.

1087
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,280
When I found out

1088
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,840
when I got the message,

1089
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,960
I was already thinking about a storm.

1090
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,680
I was wondering who it was.

1091
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,120
To be honest,

1092
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,760
I really don't know

1093
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,440
how attractive my brothers are.

1094
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,680
I really don't know

1095
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,840
I really don't understand.

1096
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,880
Because when I saw them talking,

1097
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,440
I think Xiaoling's eyes

1098
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,000
is shining.

1099
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,800
Very happy.

1100
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,960
And my brothers' eyes

1101
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,120
are shining.

1102
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,560
We get along well.

1103
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,680
I think the soup will choose her.

1104
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,320
Because yesterday,

1105
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,240
Truth or Dare,

1106
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,680
Soup said

1107
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,240
his first impression of my sister is the best.

1108
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
This is so smooth.

1109
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,360
Everyone vote for each other.

1110
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,640
I like watching such a comfortable show.

1111
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,440
Okay.

1112
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,520
Let's see the result of our two teams.

1113
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,840
How many mistakes did each team make?

1114
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,280
One.

1115
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,440
Fatty and Xiaoling.

1116
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,040
We thought Xiaoling would send it to Fatty.

1117
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,360
Welcome.

1118
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,880
In fact, she gave us the map.

1119
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,640
We also made a mistake.

1120
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,120
Okay.

1121
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,400
All of us are tied.

1122
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,600
Congratulations to every one of us

1123
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,640
got

1124
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,000
of Guoli.

1125
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,960
In the second episode,

1126
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Now it’s Mr. Lynne.

1127
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,800
He ranks first

1128
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,560
with two Fruit Crest.

1129
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,960
Is the siblings' house opening?

1130
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,000
Because I want to gossip about my brothers.

1131
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,160
Who sent him a message

1132
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,680
or he expressed his feelings for someone.

1133
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,800
Okay.

1134
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,440
Good morning.

1135
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,720
Let's start today's topic.

1136
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
I applied.

1137
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,640
for a chat.

1138
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,680
Actually, I wanted to ask you directly.

1139
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,400
but I felt there were too many people.

1140
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,920
Who did you send it to?

1141
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,760
The one beside me.

1142
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,800
Xin.

1143
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,560
Pay attention to the question today.

1144
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,000
Who sent it to you?

1145
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
No.

1146
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Isn't it anonymous?

1147
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,560
Who sent it to you?

1148
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,640
I guess the soup

1149
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,440
is written.

1150
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,600
Tell me first.

1151
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
But both of us are ambiguous.

1152
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,880
He sent

1153
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,400
if you are also interested

1154
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,840
or sports,

1155
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,240
I think we can try

1156
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,280
to get to know each other.

1157
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,240
Who else?

1158
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,840
Yes.

1159
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,280
Because I think

1160
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,480
He only talked to me.

1161
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,840
Because he doesn't talk much.

1162
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,720
Actually, he talks a lot.

1163
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,040
Not much to the opposite sex.

1164
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,400
Yes, we are close.

1165
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,720
You two seem to know each other.

1166
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,120
for ten years.

1167
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,680
very familiar.

1168
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,880
I think he's your brother.

1169
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,400
He's the one who gets the first place.

1170
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,480
I think he doesn't talk much to men.

1171
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,760
And I think...

1172
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,560
I personally think

1173
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,200
he sent it to me because

1174
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,880
he only had contact with me.

1175
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,000
Because we listened to songs in the car.

1176
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,680
When we were playing games yesterday,

1177
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,040
I mean...

1178
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,400
Who do you like?

1179
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,480
Let's play Truth or Dare.

1180
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,880
He said he likes you.

1181
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,080
It's only the first day.

1182
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,760
It's not a good impression.

1183
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,840
I want to get in touch.

1184
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,360
Then I asked why.

1185
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:34,760
Tell me.

1186
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,440
When you play games,

1187
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,480
when you play games.

1188
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,240
That's great.

1189
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,760
You'll ask me why.

1190
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,800
Of course.

1191
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,760
Of course.

1192
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,840
I think the reason is in the car.

1193
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,560
I was going to listen to the song.

1194
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,560
Then I asked him

1195
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,240
if he wanted to listen.

1196
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,080
But you have to know

1197
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,640
At that time,

1198
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,040
the four of us were in another car.

1199
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,520
But he said

1200
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,600
he wanted to take that car.

1201
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,520
It's not because there's no seat.

1202
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,240
Actually there are.

1203
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,480
There are two seats behind.

1204
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,320
But I don't know what he's thinking.

1205
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,240
Don't flatter yourself.

1206
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,040
Susu has been refusing to admit it.

1207
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,800
She's afraid that she has hope.

1208
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,040
Yes. Everyone is afraid that she'll be too sentimental.

1209
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,240
There's a little detail

1210
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,080
a little detail.

1211
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,040
when Harry

1212
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,600
with his brother,

1213
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,480
he said

1214
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,240
Please pay attention to the question today.

1215
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,320
What do you think it means?

1216
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,840
Because

1217
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,640
he gets along with Xinxin a lot.

1218
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,080
Yes.

1219
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,280
The current impression is today's impression.

1220
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,320
I don't know if he wants to tell Xinxin

1221
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,640
Don't get too emotional.

1222
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,720
today.

1223
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,000
Don't let them think

1224
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,760
we're engaged.

1225
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,720
Yes.

1226
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,640
Then he's really...

1227
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,840
I realized it after you interpreted it.

1228
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,160
I didn't think that way at all.

1229
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,560
I don't think Esther

1230
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,680
Yes, Esther can't imagine it.

1231
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,280
To write a diary?

1232
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,040
Yes.

1233
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,280
I need a notebook.

1234
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,080
Let's go.

1235
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,240
Let's write it down there.

1236
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
Our members

1237
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,000
write down what they want to say

1238
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,040
in a diary every day.

1239
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,680
This part is actually very interesting.

1240
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,640
I can't wait to be a VIP.

1241
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,920
Today is our Cupid's date.

1242
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,720
It's also the first date

1243
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,640
our roommates.

1244
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,320
This was their first day.

1245
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
the girl sent a letter

1246
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,000
in the letter.

1247
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,200
That's why I decided

1248
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,040
their date.

1249
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,120
So the one who loves beauty is Fatty.

1250
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,840
Yes.

1251
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,560
He loves life.

1252
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,240
He's good at it.

1253
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:29,640
You scared me.

1254
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,680
You scared me.

1255
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,520
Want something to eat?

1256
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,800
Freshly made sandwich

1257
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,480
Eat.

1258
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,200
Just a little.

1259
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,840
Because I'm too late.

1260
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,440
Take a bite.

1261
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:36,960
Okay.

1262
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,640
We finally started our first date.

1263
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,200
I'm looking forward to it.

1264
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,880
I think my card is right.

1265
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,880
To be honest, I'm looking forward to it.

1266
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,080
But a little worried.

1267
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,560
A little nervous.

1268
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,920
Because I'm afraid we might be cold.

1269
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,120
We might not have anything to talk about.

1270
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,720
Get out.

1271
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,640
Bye, baby.

1272
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,560
Bye.

1273
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,640
I couldn't find it.

1274
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,720
Someone must have eaten it.

1275
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,800
Probably fatty.

1276
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,760
Fatty.

1277
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,000
If Fatty didn't take it,

1278
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,880
It's unfair to be fat.

1279
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:53,880
So beautiful.

1280
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,800
So pretty.

1281
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,200
The person I love

1282
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,760
Hello.

1283
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,720
I waited so long for you.

1284
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,520
A long time?

1285
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,120
Not really.

1286
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,920
Sorry.

1287
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,880
It's okay.

1288
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,960
When I saw Susu,

1289
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,240
I was right.

1290
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,200
Good.

1291
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,920
I can't smile.

1292
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,400
They look great together.

1293
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,560
You don't know

1294
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,320
It's me.

1295
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,400
I knew it was you.

1296
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:26,840
No.

1297
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,680
It's my card

1298
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,640
I know.

1299
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,520
How did you know it was from me?

1300
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,200
Maybe I hope it's from you.

1301
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,120
I was the first one to give it to you.

1302
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,080
You guessed it was me.

1303
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,000
I knew I invited you.

1304
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,800
Is that what you thought?

1305
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,320
Of course.

1306
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,240
The choice to both sides.

1307
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,120
I'm the hero charge.

1308
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,720
I'm the first

1309
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,560
Well

1310
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,280
After everyone came to my room,

1311
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,400
I think everyone is sitting here.

1312
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,360
It's quite awkward.

1313
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,560
After I finished,

1314
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,080
I'll give it to you immediately.

1315
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,160
You gave it to me casually.

1316
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,640
I didn't give it to you casually.

1317
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,200
I must have guessed it.

1318
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,760
Is it hard to guess?

1319
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,760
What do you mean?

1320
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,720
Because I'm very passive.

1321
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,000
I need to feel

1322
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,960
the signal released by others,

1323
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,840
I can contact others.

1324
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,640
If I can't feel

1325
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,600
any signal from me,

1326
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,560
I won't have any contact with him.

1327
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,800
The soup is still sensitive.

1328
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,920
He keeps checking

1329
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,360
if you want to choose me.

1330
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,200
I need recognition.

1331
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:32,760
Yes.

1332
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,840
Actually the sentence you wrote

1333
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,960
If I wrote it,

1334
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,400
I thought about writing that.

1335
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,400
Like me.

1336
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,760
Do you believe that?

1337
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,000
Do you want to experience the winter in Beijing together?

1338
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,920
What do you want to do

1339
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,640
I wanted to go to Yi He Garden.

1340
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,880
I wanted to go to the Shicha Sea

1341
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,000
I think so.

1342
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,800
Because there's ice

1343
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,120
There's also one in Yi He Garden

1344
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,200
And that car is fun

1345
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,080
If there's a chance,

1346
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:57,640
I've never been there.

1347
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,320
I haven't.

1348
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,200
You haven't?

1349
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,000
It's really fun.

1350
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,520
And you bought candied haws there.

1351
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,000
it won't melt.

1352
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,360
It will freeze hard.

1353
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,160
Such a spoiled smile.

1354
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,760
That look

1355
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,040
It's really fun.

1356
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,920
Are you an I (introvert)?

1357
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,080
You don't remember?

1358
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,520
I remember you're an introvert.

1359
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,920
I'm I (introverted) What?

1360
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,400
No, you're ENFP. I'm a candidate.

1361
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:21,960
You...

1362
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,720
I'm not an ENFP.

1363
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,040
You got the wrong person.

1364
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,520
ISFP.

1365
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,400
Yes.

1366
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,880
He's totally different from me.

1367
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,200
Yes.

1368
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:30,760
Because I remember you are

1369
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,760
ENTJ.

1370
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,120
I got the wrong person.

1371
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,320
It's a flower.

1372
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,520
Oh no.

1373
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,760
I stepped on the thunder.

1374
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,400
No.

1375
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,360
I only remember you.

1376
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,360
you two came in after me.

1377
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,160
Anyway these two

1378
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,200
I'll remember both of us.

1379
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,480
Let's eat.

1380
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,480
Have you eaten?

1381
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,720
Breakfast.

1382
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,480
You must have eaten.

1383
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,600
You got up early.

1384
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,160
I ate your sandwich.

1385
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,760
Really?

1386
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,120
He ate it.

1387
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,800
You haven't had breakfast.

1388
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,600
No.

1389
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,960
No one's eating, right?

1390
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,440
I don't know.

1391
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,040
Let me see.

1392
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,320
I'll find something to eat.

1393
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,880
Have you eaten?

1394
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
I didn't.

1395
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,080
Do you eat it?

1396
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,760
This should be

1397
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,520
Harry for Susu.

1398
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,680
Really?

1399
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,440
Maybe Susu said no.

1400
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,120
I'll have some.

1401
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,880
You eat.

1402
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,240
It's scary.

1403
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,640
Juice wine

1404
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,960
The disappearing sandwich.

1405
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,880
I said I went down to look for it.

1406
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,840
Where's my sandwich?

1407
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,200
I told you to leave it for me.

1408
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,840
I'm sorry.

1409
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,160
I said I was hungry.

1410
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,320
I'm really hungry

1411
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,800
Let's eat now.

1412
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,280
My sandwich

1413
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,560
That's too much.

1414
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,120
Is it good?

1415
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:09,840
So

1416
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,840
What filling?

1417
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,320
Think about it.

1418
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,000
Eggs ham

1419
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,200
Cucumber tomatoes

1420
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,000
These are all your favorite

1421
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,320
I'll try it when I get back.

1422
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:24,880
Okay.

1423
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,960
Don't draw pastries

1424
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,080
I need to learn from my roommate

1425
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,280
how to cook

1426
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,560
You can't do anything.

1427
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,000
You can't do anything.

1428
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,400
You don't know how to cook instant noodles

1429
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,880
I can still cook

1430
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,880
How about dumplings

1431
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,320
Sure.

1432
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,920
It can float.

1433
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,760
You and I are at the same level.

1434
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,600
You won't starve to death.

1435
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,600
Because I've been training.

1436
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,600
Let's go to class.

1437
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,640
You don't have time to go out, do you?

1438
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,560
When I was young,

1439
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,840
I could feel that pain every day.

1440
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,520
But when I grow up,

1441
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,720
Actually,

1442
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,600
I think

1443
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,560
table tennis and piano

1444
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,360
It's fun.

1445
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,160
Just go out for fun

1446
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,960
Something like that.

1447
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,480
I don't know why.

1448
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,560
when I was young,

1449
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,760
when I was a kid.

1450
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,520
I've learned a lot since I was a kid.

1451
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,480
or ping pong.

1452
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,280
I learned a little.

1453
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,600
I learned a little about piano

1454
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,960
I also learned flute

1455
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,120
But I felt tired when I was a kid

1456
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,240
I wanted to play.

1457
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,000
Maybe it's because of my parents.

1458
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,600
because they want me

1459
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,800
grow up happily.

1460
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,560
They didn't force me to say

1461
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,520
you have to hang in there.

1462
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,400
So I tried many things

1463
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,240
I didn't make it to the end.

1464
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,240
You said yesterday

1465
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,520
you mentioned yesterday,

1466
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,240
I said

1467
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,000
Because I envy others

1468
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,400
I envy others.

1469
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,120
So you're not working

1470
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,160
or leave?

1471
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,080
I just graduated.

1472
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,240
So

1473
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,720
I didn't say clearly

1474
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,360
which industry I want to work in.

1475
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,240
I want to try everything.

1476
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,280
Because I'm an undergraduate.

1477
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,000
Design?

1478
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,040
Yes, almost.

1479
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,440
But it's not a simple design.

1480
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,280
It's fashion media.

1481
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,000
You don't know us artists, do you?

1482
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,160
You can.

1483
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,880
OK.

1484
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,360
He looks like E now.

1485
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,120
He expressed it proactively.

1486
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,040
He's willing to understand.

1487
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,760
It means you really like it.

1488
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,880
Take this.

1489
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,760
You want it?

1490
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:22,960
Try it.

1491
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,880
Actually, I...

1492
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,640
Take a spoon.

1493
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,480
Let me help you.

1494
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,080
Really?

1495
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,680
Thank you.

1496
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,000
Help those who don't cooperate well.

1497
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,720
He's getting funny.

1498
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,840
Right.

1499
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,000
Seriously.

1500
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,280
I'll show you how to swallow it.

1501
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,680
Then you get choked.

1502
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,640
You can't talk for five minutes.

1503
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,160
Oh no.

1504
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,400
He's quiet.

1505
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,360
You've become a mute.

1506
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,360
Don't do that I'll be embarrassed

1507
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,560
So beautiful.

1508
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,680
I remember when we were upstairs yesterday,

1509
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,560
I saw Xiaoling playing the piano.

1510
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,480
I asked if you could play the piano.

1511
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,040
You said you couldn't.

1512
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,000
But when I turned around,

1513
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,480
you played the piano.

1514
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,680
What does this mean?

1515
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,680
Humblebrag.

1516
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,680
I thought you were

1517
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,880
to see if we are siblings.

1518
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,360
You think too much.

1519
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,480
No.

1520
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,720
So you played it yesterday.

1521
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,920
It's Jay Chou's.

1522
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,000
A song?

1523
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,960
Can you sing?

1524
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,800
Not out of tune, right?

1525
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,960
You're being modest again.

1526
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,200
Can you play the piano?

1527
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:27,560
No.

1528
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,920
Then I started playing the piano.

1529
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,800
Next time I won't go off-key.

1530
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,360
I'll sing well next time.

1531
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,080
I'm already...

1532
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,240
I can't believe it.

1533
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,080
Really.

1534
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,600
You really didn't sing well.

1535
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,040
But you said you weren't out of tune.

1536
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,240
I'm out of tune.

1537
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,800
As long as you sing happily.

1538
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,880
Be happy.

1539
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,000
I don't usually sing.

1540
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
But I really like to listen to songs.

1541
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,040
I love that song.

1542
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,440
Maybe many people don't know

1543
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,400
what it's called.

1544
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,800
My Tears Smashed.

1545
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,680
You know?

1546
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:58,960
This is it.

1547
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,760
Yes.

1548
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,360
Yes.

1549
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,440
I love it.

1550
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,560
This is my favorite song.

1551
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,280
So sad.

1552
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,560
The flowers are pretty too.

1553
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:08,920
What is this?

1554
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,680
Stars?

1555
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,560
Stars?

1556
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,880
They can get along.

1557
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,280
He didn't let the words fall on the ground.

1558
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,680
Yes.

1559
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,920
It makes them feel comfortable.

1560
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,760
Are you singing?

1561
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,200
No.

1562
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,920
What are you singing?

1563
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,520
You're singing Jay Chou.

1564
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,160
You're singing "My Tears Smashed".

1565
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,280
I'm a little hungry.

1566
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,200
Why are you hungry?

1567
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:42,840
I don't know who ate it.

1568
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,000
Why am I hungry?

1569
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,880
I don't know why I'm hungry.

1570
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,400
I'm quite curious.

1571
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,400
This joke

1572
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,840
can be said

1573
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,960
Oh no.

1574
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,800
The sky has collapsed.

1575
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,560
Every day

1576
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,680
Every day.

1577
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,240
Why am I hungry today?

1578
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,720
I don't really care about it.

1579
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,600
I just think it's funny.

1580
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,360
It's fun.

1581
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,360
I wanted to get closer to him.

1582
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,240
So I kept teasing him.

1583
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,320
Don't you think

1584
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,600
become cheerful?

1585
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,200
And they're all so fun when they're cheerful.

1586
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,160
What's your zodiac sign?

1587
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,160
I'm Taurus.

1588
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:18,720
Really?

1589
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,320
Virgo.

1590
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,600
From September.

1591
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,120
I have filters for the Earth Zodiac Signs.

1592
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,160
Good or bad?

1593
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,840
Good filter.

1594
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,520
Really.

1595
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,640
It's kind of scary when you're not talking.

1596
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,320
Do you know

1597
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,960
is Taurus and which constellation matches the best?

1598
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,520
Virgo.

1599
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,040
Perfect match.

1600
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,000
Go and search.

1601
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,680
What a coincidence.

1602
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,880
You do look like an elephant.

1603
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,240
You talk too little.

1604
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,120
Because I'm afraid of saying something wrong.

1605
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:51,840
I'm afraid I might say something wrong.

1606
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,120
But my mouth is fast.

1607
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,080
So my mom always says

1608
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,000
my mouth is flying in front.

1609
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,600
Your brain is behind you.

1610
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,920
I can't catch up.

1611
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,080
I haven't decided yet.

1612
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,400
I'll say it out.

1613
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,640
That's good.

1614
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,840
Be happy.

1615
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,320
Next time I'll change my phone wallpaper

1616
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,480
Think twice before you act.

1617
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,720
Say less and do more.

1618
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,480
You scared me.

1619
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,280
What?

1620
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,200
A bug.

1621
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,080
A kitten.

1622
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,480
Samhwa?

1623
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,120
Yes.

1624
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,360
Flower.

1625
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,000
That cat was pretty yesterday.

1626
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,840
You didn't feed it.

1627
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,800
I think someone has fed it.

1628
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,480
I won't go.

1629
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,160
I'm afraid it'll suffocate.

1630
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,520
Then it said, "Go home."

1631
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,080
The owner said

1632
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,760
Why did you gain two kilograms?

1633
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,120
Tu and I fed him two sausages.

1634
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,960
It means he still cares about it.

1635
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,640
Jealous?

1636
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,800
It jumped up.

1637
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,120
It's rubbing you.

1638
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,680
I want to take a photo for you.

1639
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:50,920
See if you can run.

1640
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,480
Three.

1641
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,040
You don't have to look at me.

1642
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,600
Then she'll have each other's photo.

1643
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,520
Yes.

1644
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,360
I'm quite happy

1645
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,080
in Cupid's date.

1646
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,040
Because I think

1647
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,200
we know each other's growth experience better.

1648
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,360
I think we can get along.

1649
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,480
Maybe we are interested in the same thing.

1650
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,160
I think we can

1651
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,200
we can continue with the soup.

1652
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,720
more about soup.

1653
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,800
Let's go.

1654
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,840
Let's go.

1655
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,200
Bye, Xiao Hua.

1656
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,120
Give me your bag.

1657
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:30,960
I'll hold it for you.

1658
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,040
Don't hurt yourself.

1659
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,400
She didn't.

1660
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,720
We got it.

1661
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,480
He bumped himself.

1662
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,480
It's too high.

1663
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,400
It went so well.

1664
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,400
I fell in love.

1665
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Locked.

1666
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,280
Then don't try new people anymore.

1667
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,320
If you want to touch the map,

1668
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,840
He's optimistic and cheerful.

1669
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,240
He has something in common with me.

1670
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,520
Cupid's invitation card.

1671
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,120
I filled in Harry.

1672
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,880
I hope so.

1673
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,840
Here.

1674
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,600
Have a seat.

1675
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,840
I want to laugh.

1676
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,040
At first, I thought it might be a map.

1677
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,360
but I found it was Harry.

1678
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,840
Okay.

1679
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,440
Wrong.

1680
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,680
Really?

1681
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,200
How could they?

1682
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,240
I already ordered.

1683
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,080
Wait a moment.

1684
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,200
What did you order?

1685
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,800
You don't eat fish, right?

1686
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,160
I eat fish.

1687
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,040
You eat fish?

1688
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,240
Who doesn't eat fish?

1689
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,400
Susu doesn't eat fish.

1690
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,280
I don't eat sheep.

1691
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,200
I don't eat fish.

1692
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,080
I don't eat blood.

1693
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,880
I don't eat pig brain.

1694
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,720
Pig brain.

1695
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,840
I said I should avoid the fish.

1696
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,840
I didn't order fish.

1697
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,760
It's okay.

1698
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,600
This is really awkward.

1699
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,640
So awkward.

1700
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,000
You're wearing it.

1701
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,920
contact lenses?

1702
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,640
I wear contact lenses every day.

1703
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,880
I can wear contact lenses,

1704
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,400
but it's too soft.

1705
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,040
So sometimes I can't wear it.

1706
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:35,920
I can teach you.

1707
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,520
I'll wear contact lenses.

1708
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,040
Wearing contact lenses doesn't make my eyes look bigger.

1709
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,560
I don't have big eyes.

1710
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,080
I have a lot of thoughts.

1711
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,280
Of course.

1712
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,520
What? Men also have the right to love beauty.

1713
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,200
Of course.

1714
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,760
Of course.

1715
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,080
How about we talk about that?

1716
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,160
Well...

1717
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,800
Let's talk about INFJ, right?

1718
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,560
InFJ, you old man.

1719
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,920
Why did you say that?

1720
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,520
Because the MBTI image

1721
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,720
Well

1722
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,360
One has beard.

1723
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,240
Like he took a magic stick.

1724
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,480
Like Mason.

1725
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,600
Yes.

1726
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,000
Aren't you an introvert too?

1727
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,040
I am.

1728
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,880
What's your MBTI image?

1729
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,640
I'm a little butterfly.

1730
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:18,920
Little Butterfly.

1731
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,000
I'm an INFP.

1732
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,960
You're a butterfly. What does that mean?

1733
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,680
sensitive and fragile.

1734
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,000
sensitive and fragile.

1735
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
This is...

1736
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,080
a general concept

1737
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,040
a little bit.

1738
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,680
I heard about you from your roommate.

1739
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,040
Aren't you very consuming?

1740
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,920
I'm not in that state anymore.

1741
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,280
Are you still a little butterfly?

1742
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:39,920
Yes.

1743
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,400
Why?

1744
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,240
You're not a little butterfly

1745
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,120
you won't be a little butterfly.

1746
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,120
I'm a powerful little butterfly.

1747
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,000
But I'm still a little butterfly.

1748
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,040
In fact,

1749
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,920
has also changed.

1750
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,000
After taking off a layer of shell,

1751
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,320
I'm a moth now.

1752
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,520
Didn't I turn into a butterfly?

1753
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,880
Why did you go back?

1754
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,720
My best friend is

1755
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,920
INFJ.

1756
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,640
We just get along.

1757
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,000
To put it bluntly,

1758
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,440
Yeah.

1759
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,360
They all say I (introverted).

1760
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,280
I know L.

1761
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,640
Do you think

1762
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,720
Do you know me well?

1763
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,040
I don't think

1764
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,560
the minefield of me too much.

1765
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,400
or lightning point.

1766
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,400
At least not when it's just the two of us.

1767
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,800
It's different when there are many people.

1768
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,440
When there are many people,

1769
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,920
you have to “Chuang Fei” everybody equally.

1770
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,160
Yes.

1771
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,680
You look like ENTP.

1772
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,800
You don't look like I (introverted).

1773
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,920
No, just joking.

1774
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,600
Act according to the situation.

1775
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,800
Stop if you don't look right.

1776
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,400
No more words.

1777
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,560
Say no more.

1778
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,360
You'll be in trouble if you keep talking.

1779
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:36,880
Hello.

1780
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,480
Your special "Miss You".

1781
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,120
Enjoy.

1782
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:39,840
Thank you.

1783
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,760
Thank you.

1784
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,520
I prepared this especially for this date.

1785
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,520
I thought we could

1786
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,400
have a chat while drinking.

1787
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,920
Choose one.

1788
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:48,800
This one.

1789
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,200
It's my favorite.

1790
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,680
Peach-flavored fruit cube.

1791
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,200
It smells like fruit.

1792
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,320
How did you make it?

1793
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,400
This is mixed with white grape-flavored fruit.

1794
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,080
This is my favorite

1795
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,480
peach-flavored fruit cube.

1796
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,400
Cheers.

1797
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,640
It tastes good.

1798
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,800
Let's try your new wine list next time.

1799
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:10,760
Eat.

1800
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,680
Thank you.

1801
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,400
What is this

1802
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,840
This is vegetable soup

1803
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,240
Try it.

1804
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,600
Here you go.

1805
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,640
Thank you.

1806
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,440
You're welcome.

1807
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,200
Make yourself at home.

1808
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,240
You're too polite.

1809
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,040
Are you going back to your room?

1810
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,440
Not really.

1811
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,360
We need to find something to do.

1812
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,280
Isn't there a badminton?

1813
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,320
I want to buy a net.

1814
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,360
I don't know where to buy it.

1815
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,400
Sure, I want to play badminton too.

1816
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,760
But I didn't see the net.

1817
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,920
Right?

1818
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,840
You usually

1819
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,920
when you don't have class.

1820
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,000
When I don't have class at school,

1821
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,080
when I don't have class.

1822
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,960
There's nothing in your university

1823
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,320
Yes, you major in acting.

1824
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:56,800
I haven't said it yet.

1825
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,920
You already guessed it.

1826
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,600
It's in the album.

1827
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,000
Yes, the one I performed

1828
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,040
there's "Xiaoling's mom".

1829
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,480
Didn't someone raise the sign for you?

1830
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,280
Or what?

1831
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,960
You're quite interested.

1832
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,120
Yes.

1833
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:07,520
No.

1834
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,280
I didn't come with you

1835
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,080
I didn't come with you

1836
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,120
to say hello to you.

1837
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,880
Why?

1838
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,360
Your photo...

1839
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,000
Hua and I were imitating you yesterday.

1840
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,640
This photo

1841
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,520
when I first learned how to pretend.

1842
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,080
I remember.

1843
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:27,960
That's...

1844
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,720
My friend took it for me.

1845
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,840
How old were you?

1846
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,840
Ten.

1847
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,560
16.

1848
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,080
Not too young.

1849
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,480
About 15 or 16 years old.

1850
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,680
Do you think

1851
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,480
If I let you choose,

1852
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,600
Are you optimistic

1853
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,600
or pessimist?

1854
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,760
I'm definitely a pessimist.

1855
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,520
We're quite alike in this aspect.

1856
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,040
Seriously.

1857
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,760
But I'm not a little butterfly.

1858
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,880
You're an old man.

1859
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,400
If we keep talking like this,

1860
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,640
they'll get together.

1861
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,640
Is there a twist?

1862
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,480
I don't think it's awkward to talk to you.

1863
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:00,560
Why?

1864
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,000
It's awkward to talk to E.

1865
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,880
It's a little awkward sometimes.

1866
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,400
To be honest,

1867
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,640
I feel awkward

1868
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,880
except eating with you.

1869
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,600
It's awkward for you to eat with another I.

1870
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,080
There's another I (introverted).

1871
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,080
It won't be awkward to eat with Susu.

1872
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:14,760
But

1873
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,600
E

1874
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,960
it would be awkward.

1875
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,560
I'm just a little flustered.

1876
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,160
Except the three of us are E.

1877
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,800
It's awkward.

1878
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,560
It's just awkward between us.

1879
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,880
It's not awkward to talk with others.

1880
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,920
What do you mean by that?

1881
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,120
But it's okay.

1882
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,920
I'll give it a try.

1883
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,560
Okay.

1884
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,080
Which one is better?

1885
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,240
I think both are delicious.

1886
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,960
I'm quite good at ordering.

1887
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,680
I ordered all these signatures. They are all delicious.

1888
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,920
We're getting along.

1889
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,400
No.

1890
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,400
Let's see their recommended dishes.

1891
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,240
Yes.

1892
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,160
I thought about it.

1893
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,040
It's a date

1894
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,680
eating cakes and desserts.

1895
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,960
I'm here to show off meat.

1896
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,400
That's more practical than them.

1897
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,680
That makes sense.

1898
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,760
If you want to eat meat and cake,

1899
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,440
Of course.

1900
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,880
That's great.

1901
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,240
What about you?

1902
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:09,920
What do you think?

1903
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,320
Look what I'm holding.

1904
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:12,840
It suits you.

1905
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,440
Yes.

1906
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,800
The more I look at it, the more suitable it is. What should I do?

1907
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,760
Every sentence is a bit ambiguous.

1908
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,440
Shy.

1909
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,200
Yes

1910
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,960
I'm making sandwiches today.

1911
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,040
When did you make sandwiches?

1912
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:22,400
Why didn't I know?

1913
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,040
I woke up in the morning.

1914
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,560
You asked me if I wanted to eat it.

1915
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,440
Then I said I wouldn't eat it.

1916
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,280
Yes.

1917
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,640
Who is the most familiar person in the house?

1918
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,280
Soup.

1919
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:31,760
Yes.

1920
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,960
If the person he likes

1921
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,680
the person he likes is there,

1922
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,400
What would you do?

1923
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,600
How will you help him?

1924
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,400
I'm straightforward and rude.

1925
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,440
I'll give them

1926
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,280
to spend time alone.

1927
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,400
If it were me,

1928
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,680
how can I help him or my brother?

1929
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,080
I think I'm trying to create opportunities.

1930
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,920
I'll go

1931
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,960
I'll go.

1932
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,000
Me too.

1933
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,400
Do you think

1934
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,400
you should find someone

1935
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,720
with a good personality.

1936
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,400
For you,

1937
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,800
to you.

1938
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,040
Maybe

1939
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,040
to argue with you.

1940
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,840
The most important thing is that we can get along.

1941
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,960
This is what I value the most.

1942
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,240
What about you?

1943
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,280
If we just met,

1944
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,240
I'll choose to look good.

1945
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,360
Because we're not close.

1946
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,320
We're not very close.

1947
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,360
But in the middle stage,

1948
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,160
I think

1949
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,080
Because personality

1950
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,160
will take 60 percent.

1951
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,160
I think

1952
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,360
I think people in the same frequency

1953
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:32,920
Yes.

1954
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,720
It's more important to be on the same frequency.

1955
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,080
Yes.

1956
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,480
The longer it takes, the more frequency it will be.

1957
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,400
Yes, that's right.

1958
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,280
I remember the game we played last night.

1959
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,000
Didn't you say you had a boyfriend?

1960
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,240
You haven't dated since college.

1961
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:46,680
Or...

1962
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,440
Yes.

1963
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,640
I haven't met anyone I like.

1964
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,360
We had contact.

1965
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,080
We did, but we didn't talk.

1966
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,320
What? You don't like it enough? To put it bluntly,

1967
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,440
or you don't like it enough.

1968
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,200
or

1969
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,360
(Things don't work.) Wook out

1970
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,840
It's not what I want

1971
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,640
No, you're slow to warm up.

1972
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,720
Yes, because I didn't fall in love at first sight.

1973
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,960
I'm 100% the type of love that grows over time.

1974
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,440
I said the same thing yesterday.

1975
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:12,840
Yes.

1976
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,800
So when I heard you say,

1977
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,680
I said he resembles me.

1978
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,560
Gosh.

1979
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,320
You're done too?

1980
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,440
Let's go.

1981
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,160
Let's retreat.

1982
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,640
What do you mean?

1983
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,280
Retreat.

1984
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,760
To be honest, I was quite happy.

1985
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,120
At first, I thought

1986
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,040
I met someone

1987
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,080
someone I've only known for a couple of days.

1988
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,400
Then we eat alone

1989
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,920
It might be awkward.

1990
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,920
But I think

1991
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,520
the atmosphere is relaxing

1992
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,160
I think the atmosphere is relaxing.

1993
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,720
And we have a lot to talk about.

1994
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:48,920
So I think it's not bad.

1995
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,080
Through this date with Xiaoling,

1996
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,720
we have many common hobbies.

1997
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,840
But different things

1998
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,360
Maybe she told me

1999
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,240
that her little butterfly turned into a butterfly

2000
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,520
is indeed different from what I thought.

2001
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,240
Then I found that we can be friends more.

2002
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,760
It's good to be friends.

2003
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,160
Yes.

2004
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,240
I think so too.

2005
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,440
Yes.

2006
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,560
There are two sets of Cupid dating this time.

2007
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,840
Sue and soup.

2008
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,520
I feel like this Cupid date

2009
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,000
I feel like my feelings are getting better.

2010
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:18,920
And Xiao Ling

2011
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,880
She probably wanted to make a plan.

2012
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,319
Yes.

2013
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:23,920
But we made an appointment with Harry.

2014
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,560
Now it seems

2015
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,000
a little like a friend.

2016
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,479
But we don't know what will happen next.

2017
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,000
It's hard to say.

2018
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,720
For us to know each other

2019
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,880
so we prepared

2020
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,120
our own life albums.

2021
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,479
Let's

2022
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,040
with you, OK?

2023
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:38,560
OK.

2024
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,040
This is Morishiko.

2025
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,520
This

2026
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,520
It should be a 100-day photo.

2027
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,120
This is on a small car

2028
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,840
made by my grandpa.

2029
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,080
This was for my brother.

2030
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,520
Then I was born and put it here.

2031
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,200
I inherited it.

2032
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:52,960
Yes.

2033
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,080
This is my brother and me.

2034
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,359
Let me see your brother.

2035
01:08:56,359 --> 01:08:58,960
In our elementary school,

2036
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,439
this photo is obviously

2037
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:01,640
my parents paid for.

2038
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,399
Because I'm wearing a skirt.

2039
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,600
and I was very clean.

2040
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,960
The last one obviously didn't pay.

2041
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:13,760
when we were young.

2042
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,479
When he retrieves the photos,

2043
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,560
you pay him.

2044
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,920
This is my brother's photo when he was young.

2045
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,240
He thought he was pretty.

2046
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,479
He likes taking photos.

2047
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:23,960
Whenever the photographer comes,

2048
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,399
he would take photos for him with the photographer.

2049
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,279
and waited for someone to come back.

2050
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:28,359
He took that photo

2051
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:30,359
with that photo.

2052
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,960
My brother thought

2053
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,800
he could sell his photos

2054
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,840
by selling his photos.

2055
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,080
Really?

2056
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,640
But I've never sold it.

2057
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,479
Mine is easier.

2058
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,399
We should have just been together.

2059
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:47,800
Look.

2060
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,720
My mom wears the same clothes

2061
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,760
wearing the same clothes.

2062
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,800
This is my latest "Wind 2024".

2063
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,160
Great.

2064
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,760
The Best Breakthrough Award.

2065
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,800
I think that thing

2066
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,960
After giving birth,

2067
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,360
for about seven years.

2068
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,840
for almost seven years.

2069
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,120
Yes.

2070
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,280
It's relatively unstable in business.

2071
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,600
But I did it boldly last year.

2072
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,320
I decided

2073
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,520
if I want to come to you again,

2074
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,760
will it be better

2075
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,960
I also want to regain my vitality.

2076
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,320
and my energy.

2077
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,280
This is the birthday

2078
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,360
on our birthday.

2079
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,320
all the happiness in the world

2080
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:22,920
is on me.

2081
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,960
Why are you smiling so heartless?

2082
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:25,960
Happiness.

2083
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,080
This is...

2084
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,960
With our first baby,

2085
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,560
Yes.

2086
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,520
My first baby

2087
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,640
was the same birthday as me.

2088
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,400
And my son

2089
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,400
was on the same day as my wife.

2090
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,440
We're only one day apart.

2091
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,200
It's my birthday today.

2092
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,400
Tomorrow is my wife's birthday.

2093
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,520
So the four of us have two birthdays.

2094
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,840
Your family is so destined.

2095
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,120
A cake for the four of us.

2096
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,320
And this is my two babies.

2097
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,720
are very happy.

2098
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,560
I think my life

2099
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,480
my life.

2100
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,360
My mom died of cancer.

2101
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,400
Of course she was sad when she left.

2102
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,040
But she taught me

2103
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:09,880
Really.

2104
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,120
Face life

2105
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,240
and braver.

2106
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,000
I'm not afraid of anything, IYI.

2107
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,720
Because you think you're at the lowest.

2108
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:18,920
You've experienced

2109
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,160
You've experienced it.

2110
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:20,760
So I think

2111
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,800
the power she gave me

2112
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,800
is infinite.

2113
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,560
Then I got to have this family.

2114
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,400
I cherish it.

2115
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,520
Like I said just now,

2116
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,040
Let's not wait until we lose

2117
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,400
to cherish it.

2118
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,840
So you cherish every day.

2119
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,480
and cherish every day,

2120
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,960
you will find

2121
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,200
you'll be more and more lucky.

2122
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,120
You'll be happier.

2123
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,440
Yes, so I'm very grateful.

2124
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,120
Great.

2125
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:48,600
It's my turn.

2126
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,520
This is

2127
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,920
I've been on for two years.

2128
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,400
is called "Farming".

2129
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,480
I didn't expect to

2130
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,800
with these nine brothers.

2131
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,240
I said, how about we start a company

2132
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,400
It's called ten consciences.

2133
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,320
I started it.

2134
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,320
I didn't expect that I could get the name

2135
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,480
this name

2136
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,400
and known by so many people.

2137
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,280
In fact, ten conscientious days

2138
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,520
To me,

2139
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,400
I have no siblings.

2140
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,320
Because I really

2141
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,440
want a brother.

2142
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,440
But I got nine.

2143
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,600
who are more noisy than me.

2144
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,600
Because before

2145
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,360
I was a person

2146
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,400
I'm not good at expressing myself.

2147
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,480
and very introverted.

2148
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,720
When I was testing MBTI,

2149
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,120
I was 90 percent introverted.

2150
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,120
But after being with nine brothers,

2151
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,200
because they have different

2152
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:42,880
personality.

2153
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,320
And he also

2154
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,000
positive guidance to me.

2155
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,680
With their help,

2156
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,720
I'll be more outgoing

2157
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,560
and become a leader.

2158
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,360
and become better

2159
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,240
and become better.

2160
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,600
Then I was humblebragging.

2161
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,560
I went to the Spring Festival Gala for two years in a row.

2162
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,600
I worked hard step by step

2163
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,240
and brothers

2164
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,920
I did what I wanted to do the most.

2165
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,840
I always thought I was happy

2166
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,160
and lucky.

2167
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,720
And I'm grateful that I can get all of this.

2168
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,840
So I want to

2169
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,320
I want to take your love

2170
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,320
with your love.

2171
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,760
Actually, my parents

2172
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,880
doted on me since childhood.

2173
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,320
Actually, compared to my two brothers,

2174
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,320
I dote on my daughter.

2175
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,080
Sometimes my dad dotes on me too.

2176
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,240
This is my brother and I.

2177
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,840
Yes, they.

2178
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,560
This should be our first time in Beijing.

2179
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,440
I remember when we were in school.

2180
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,360
We fought a lot at that time.

2181
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:41,440
My brother was short.

2182
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,920
They jumped up to catch me.

2183
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:45,520
That's it.

2184
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,440
We fought quite hard.

2185
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,520
It's not easy for you

2186
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,160
It's not easy.

2187
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,320
But they were very obedient to me.

2188
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:55,360
I remember

2189
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,880
Then my parents said

2190
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,560
why the room was so quiet.

2191
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,240
When you open the door in our room,

2192
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,320
and then stand up.

2193
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,280
holding one of my feet.

2194
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,720
Then my brother said

2195
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,040
she gave us five yuan

2196
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,360
and asked us to give her a massage.

2197
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,000
They were very happy

2198
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,560
to get five yuan.

2199
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,240
Two close brothers are massaging there

2200
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:13,640
Yes

2201
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,080
They are just like me.

2202
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,520
They go up and they go up.

2203
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,040
I'm so happy to have two boys.

2204
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,800
So I think I can be so strong

2205
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,960
because my parents

2206
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,840
my parents gave me so much love

2207
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,280
and the love my brother gave me.

2208
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,400
So I hope I can

2209
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,320
my infinite love to them.

2210
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,400
This may be

2211
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,360
a symbol of pictures.

2212
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,440
will help us recall

2213
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,160
every phase of life.

2214
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,080
Next week, our siblings' house

2215
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,320
will be coming soon.

2216
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,520
How will their relationship develop?

2217
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,280
What will happen to Jab's feelings?

2218
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,840
Let's look forward to the next episode.

2219
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,200
Love Siblings.

2220
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,560
Let love double.

2221
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,120
So scary.

2222
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,760
You're so good at it.

2223
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,240
Come here.

2224
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,560

Boys' Chat Party.

2226
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,160
What type do you like?

2227
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,520
What will you do with her when you go on a date?

2228
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,840
Fair competition.

2229
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,280
It makes me feel threatened.
