1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
Feels like we have wild wine right away.

3
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,080
Feels like there's a wild wine.

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,400
will watch Love Sisters first.

5
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,640
Who?

6
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,759
Li Ronghao: Li Ronghao. Li Ronghao: You're like this.

7
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,360
Can you?

8
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
When Xiaoling was playing the piano,

9
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,960
when Xiao Ling was playing the piano.

10
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,400
I don't want Xiaoling to see it.

11
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,360
I don't want her to notice.

12
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,600
I think it's best for her

13
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,440
is the best.

14
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,280
Thank you.

15
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,640
I almost cried.

16
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,920
You must have learned it for a long time.

17
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,280
Yes.

18
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,440
But I didn't take the exam.

19
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,520
I just learned to play.

20
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,640
I've always been interested.

21
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,440
Almost.

22
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,760
I learned to play drums when I was a kid.

23
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,240
I can't do it at all now.

24
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,880
Drums

25
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
It sounds cool.

26
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,680
He was so handsome.

27
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,960
Of course it was a bit dark

28
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,520
Like a little coal

29
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,760
Do you have a photo

30
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,800
You'll see.

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,080
Looking forward to it.

32
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Yes, what's your hobby?

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,880
Playing the piano?

34
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,320
I actually like outdoor.

35
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,600
I like skiing.

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,320
I only know how to play two strokes.

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,360
Me too.

38
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,680
I just want to learn how to play doubles.

39
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,960
Let's go on a date.

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,240
Let's go skiing that day.

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,000
We went skiing together.

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,800
What did you drink?

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,600
Chinese medicine.

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,200
There's a silver cat outside.

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,000
I want to show you.

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,760
What?

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,120
Stop!

48
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,040
You'll scare him away.

49
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,520
Go one by one.

50
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,640
Where?

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
Mommy.

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,600
Mimi.

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
It's so family.

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,640
Mimi.

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,960
Do you want to play the piano?

56
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,680
What do you want to hear?

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,720
Jay Chou, order.

58
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,360
I'll play whatever I want.

59
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,120
Susu said

60
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,400
she likes Jay Chou very much.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,959
Then I played it.

62
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,040
but she wasn't there.

63
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,640
I should hide the cat.

64
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,280
Who is charming?

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,080
I don't know why he started playing the piano.

66
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,400
I like Jay Chou the most.

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,720
My favorite.

68
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,120
Jay Chou seems to write good songs.

69
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm going to feed it.

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,280
It's coming.

71
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,480
Not every one of them takes a bite.

72
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,000
I saw her with Tu.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,280
I don't want to disturb them.

74
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,720
I think if

75
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,840
the map is interested in Susu,

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
I'll give them some space to get along with.

77
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,200
I'm not a person

78
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,840
to disturb others.

79
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,440
Dinner?

80
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,760
Shall we get ready first?

81
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,200
Then

82
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Don't have so many people in the kitchen

83
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,920
It's too troublesome.

84
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, I think we should just divide it.

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,120
Four in a group.

86
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,680
OK.

87
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
Black and white.

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,960
Then call them back.

89
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,200
Why don't we leave them alone?

90
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,960
Leave them alone.

91
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,920
Why didn't you tell me earlier? I'll lock the door.

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,440
I'll lock something for you.

93
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,040
Let me tell you.

94
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
Let me ask you.

95
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,960
We're going to choose the squad.

96
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,000
We choose the squad.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,720
What squad?

98
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,840
Do you want to fight?

99
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,880
We've decided

100
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,920
to cook.

101
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,440
I don't care about the other four.

102
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,080
OK.

103
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,200
Two boys and two girls.

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,000
OK.

105
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,360
The back of my hand

106
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,720
Chef and I

107
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,880
Can you cook

108
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,600
To be honest, I'm not good at it.

109
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,040
According to my heart,

110
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,520
I don't think you need to make it based on your cooking skills.

111
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:52,960
Yes.

112
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,880
Who do you choose?

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,240
I choose Hua.

114
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,520
Okay.

115
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,640
How hard is it?

116
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,800
Hua is good at cooking.

117
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,440
Yeah.

118
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,440
OK. You are not qualified to choose flowers.

119
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,520
I chose Hua.

120
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,720
I choose Xiao Ling and Xinxin.

121
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,080
Thank you for today.

122
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,720
Let's cook.

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,280
It's okay. We won't do the dishes later.

124
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,800
Come on.

125
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
We're having hot pot today.

126
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,560
I thought he chose Xinxin and Susu.

127
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,320
My head seems a bit messy today.

128
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,280
I can't remember his name.

129
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,800
What should I do?

130
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,840
Oh no.

131
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,880
Do you want your polar scallops today?

132
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,400
Yes, or it'll break.

133
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Eat it all.

134
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,840
Come on.

135
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,520
So many people.

136
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,920
You can do it.

137
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,600
Now I find that I can't remember anyone.

138
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
What's my name?

139
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,640
Your name is Hua.

140
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,400
Your name is Hua.

141
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,320
You're also called Hua?

142
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,200
He did it on purpose.

143
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,720
I can see it.

144
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,480
Go ahead.

145
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,120
Okay.

146
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,840
Then you two take the hot pot base out.

147
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,440
Put it in.

148
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,040
Where is the hot pot base?

149
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,880
Here.

150
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,280
But we can only eat one flavor.

151
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,720
Right?

152
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,600
So spicy.

153
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,840
I bought the tomato pot.

154
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,440
I can't see I'm a little short.

155
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,760
Let me find it for you.

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,960
Tomato flavor?

157
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,520
I bought it.

158
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's eat tomato pot, right?

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
Let's eat spicy food.

160
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
He can't eat spicy food.

161
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,159
Why don't you eat?

162
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,240
Less spicy.

163
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,520
less spicy.

164
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
How about two pots?

165
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,200
Two pots or two electromagnetic ovens?

166
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,280
No.

167
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,960
No two (pot).

168
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,280
I'll take it.

169
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
Eat spicy food. It's okay.

170
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,840
I'll put this back.

171
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,080
What if you can't eat it?

172
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,440
Cook more sesame oil.

173
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
It won't be spicy, right?

174
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,520
Are you sure you can drive?

175
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,800
I just finished.

176
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,960
How much do you want?

177
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
1.6 liters.

178
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,840
Which one is cold water?

179
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,680
Okay, it's fine.

180
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,440
It's cold water over there.

181
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,840
Put cold water.

182
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,160
Ask him.

183
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,720
You ask first.

184
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,760
Cold water, right?

185
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,520
Hurry up if it's boiling water.

186
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,000
It's okay.

187
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,880
It's too hard for me to do it.

188
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Just put it casually.

189
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,040
Is it appropriate?

190
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,800
So what?

191
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,120
Okay.

192
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,040
I'll set it up.

193
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,480
Okay.

194
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,840
Okay, I cracked.

195
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,360
Why?

196
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,240
It's too ugly.

197
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,800
It's okay.

198
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,280
I just made salmon casually.

199
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,760
Okay.

200
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,360
Okay.

201
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Now,

202
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,480
we can wash some vegetables

203
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,040
and iron it?

204
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,800
Of course.

205
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,480
Okay.

206
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,640
I'm coming

207
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,240
Should I peel the garlic?

208
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
It's okay. You wash it.

209
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,040
I don't know how.

210
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,120
You can't wash, right?

211
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,040
I can.

212
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:27,960
I can.

213
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,120
I'm good at washing vegetables.

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,080
How hard it is to wash vegetables

215
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,520
What if the chef is cooking vegetables tomorrow

216
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,480
Whatever

217
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,520
Whatever.

218
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,600
It's a little cold.

219
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,080
Is it hot water?

220
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,000
No.

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,920
What if it's cooked?

222
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,920
It's okay

223
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,720
I'll cook it before eating later

224
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,760
Let me wash it

225
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,320
Okay, wait a moment.

226
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,000
It dropped garlic

227
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,560
It dropped garlic.

228
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,560
Let's flush water.

229
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,880
Come on.

230
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay.

231
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,000
Be careful.

232
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,560
Let me do it.

233
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,120
Can you let me pull that?

234
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
You can't pull that much.

235
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,200
You can do that.

236
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,760
You can do it.

237
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,160
No way.

238
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,360
Okay.

239
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,520
Failed.

240
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,160
You're so cute.

241
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,200
You have great emotional value.

242
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,840
How stupid you are!

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,320
Okay, slow down.

244
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm afraid you'll "fly".

245
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,960
I'll cut some pork belly.

246
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
But we have enough meat

247
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,560
Let's cook for them tomorrow.

248
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,400
I want to eat, OK?

249
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,440
I'll be straight with you.

250
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,040
Cut.

251
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,600
Finish it.

252
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,400
You must eat it.

253
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,840
I'll be mad if anyone doesn't eat it.

254
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,720
Is this potato slices?

255
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,080
Does it look like potatoes

256
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,920
No.

257
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,120
Don't cut your hand.

258
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,960
You can't cut it.

259
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,880
Okay.

260
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,280
You protected yourself well.

261
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,640
Yes.

262
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,400
Okay.

263
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,040
As long as we can be close.

264
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
I haven't said anything yet.

265
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,440
When I saw you say "En",

266
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,680
I know what you want to say.

267
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,600
Really?

268
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,240
The size is different.

269
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
I think it's amazing.

270
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,760
Okay.

271
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,120
The emotional value is high.

272
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,080
Eat more later.

273
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,920
Can you cut it?

274
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,560
You can try.

275
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,120
I can't.

276
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,640
I can wash it for you.

277
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,240
No.

278
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,760
Can you cut your nails?

279
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,280
I can't.

280
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,760
He said he could try.

281
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,560
Okay, come on.

282
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,400
Come on.

283
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,160
Don't get spicy.

284
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,320
Cut it with this.

285
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
Should I cut it like this?

286
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,040
No.

287
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,600
Looking at him

288
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,080
when I look at him.

289
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,360
Try it.

290
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Come on.

291
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,760
Come on.

292
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,160
A boy.

293
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,840
What?

294
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,520
Here we go.

295
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,880
OK.

296
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,560
Fatty, look at the camera.

297
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,720
Three, two, one.

298
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,560
I haven't cooked hot pot at home for a long time.

299
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,720
Fatty, you can't dip it.

300
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,880
You have to stand up and eat if you can't.

301
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,800
I have a map.

302
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,120
Oh no.

303
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,320
Wait.

304
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,920
Who made this?

305
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,320
Me.

306
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,080
thought of something sad.

307
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
You can eat the meat now.

308
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,520
You can eat the bottom.

309
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,400
What's this

310
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,400
This is pork belly

311
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,120
It's my first time eating hot pot pork belly

312
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,480
I made it

313
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,520
I've only had barbecue

314
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,520
Eat soft food.

315
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,240
Susu.

316
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,360
Su Su. Su Su.

317
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,160
No wonder you can dance.

318
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,840
I should know what kind of dance you can dance.

319
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,080
From elementary school?

320
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,240
No.

321
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,520
Not really.

322
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,480
I learned it when I was a kid.

323
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,360
And it broke.

324
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,000
But now

325
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,320
I do it when I like it.

326
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,080
What kind of dance?

327
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
All kinds of dance, right?

328
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,640
The floor.

329
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,480
When we mop the floor,

330
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,080
when we mop the floor?

331
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,440
Sure.

332
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,800
Wipe it.

333
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,040
Just like that cleaning machine.

334
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,480
Xiaoling.

335
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,720
I've never seen you smile so happily.

336
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,400
No, I found Fatty

337
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,720
grow on the smile

338
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,480
of soup and Xiaoling.

339
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,320
They think it's funny.

340
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,800
We think it's okay.

341
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,160
The soup was also at noon today.

342
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,960
Really?

343
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,200
It's funny when you smile suddenly.

344
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,440
We think it's a little funny.

345
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,480
He thought it was funny.

346
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,000
The soup understands my joke.

347
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,280
I'm a little nauseous.

348
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,280
Why? Are you sleepy?

349
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,840
You're up too early.

350
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,520
Sleep more tomorrow.

351
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,320
It's Harry and me today.

352
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay.

353
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,800
Do you need my help?

354
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,000
You need to wear this.

355
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,480
Pull.

356
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,920
Pour it directly later.

357
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,160
It can't be removed, right?

358
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,520
Yes. Just throw it into a trash bag later.

359
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,560
It's more convenient.

360
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,280
I can do it myself.

361
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,000
Let me wash it for you.

362
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,720
I'll wash it after I'm done.

363
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,160
Gloves.

364
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,680
These gloves are so funny.

365
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,560
What's so funny?

366
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,880
This is to prevent dripping on your sleeves.

367
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,240
It's just the two of us.

368
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
They all went to rest.

369
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,160
Could it be...

370
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,040
You...

371
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,079
Can you wear it properly?

372
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,640
No.

373
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,319
Can you wear it properly from the beginning?

374
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,040
You either don't wear it

375
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,319
and go back to do the laundry.

376
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,920
Have you decided what to do tomorrow?

377
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,119
I'm going to make beef rice.

378
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,079
Beef rice.

379
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,280
Oh no.

380
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,200
I didn't buy tomatoes just now.

381
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,240
What should we do?

382
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,800
Beef with needle mushroom.

383
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,040
Sweet.

384
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,000
You can't eat it.

385
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,800
I've never heard of this.

386
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,120
Just put the needle mushroom in the beef.

387
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,560
Okay.

388
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,480
Of course.

389
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,400
Should we fry it or steam it?

390
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
Just use oil.

391
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,520
Fried.

392
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,480
We need to cook eight dishes.

393
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,720
Sorry.

394
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,760
I'll learn one today.

395
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,720
You make seven.

396
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,960
Curry potato chicken legs.

397
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
I think it's okay.

398
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,720
You want it?

399
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,160
I can do it.

400
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,040
Are you sure?

401
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,280
It's not hard, right?

402
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,080
It's just cutting potatoes.

403
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,040
It's easy to peel your hands.

404
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,920
Then you do it.

405
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,520
I think cooking is quite interesting.

406
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,120
Cooking is very interesting.

407
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,080
Really.

408
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,560
Every time I cook, the process is complicated.

409
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,600
I may use several bowls.

410
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,640
But when I was waiting for that dish,

411
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,680
I already washed the dishes.

412
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,160
Right

413
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,440
When you cook,

414
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,080
If everything is messy,

415
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,000
to the end,

416
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,320
I'll slack off the moment I finish eating.

417
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,160
I'll give up.

418
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,480
I don't want to face it.

419
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,440
or there was only one pot left.

420
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,160
I said no.

421
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,760
Wash it tomorrow.

422
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,880
Yes.

423
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,960
Enough.

424
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,360
Do you really have OCD?

425
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,000
You can be dirty secretly,

426
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,920
but not in front of me.

427
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,760
in front of me.

428
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,360
You know?

429
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,240
You just need to look at him

430
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,000
he looks good.

431
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,760
I think personality is more important.

432
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,600
To be honest,

433
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,560
How much do you think looks

434
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,520
to make you like it?

435
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,560
Five points is fine.

436
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,960
Not less than five points.

437
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,400
Six points.

438
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,000
Hey.

439
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
That's good.

440
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,080
It means you care about your heart.

441
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,160
You think I talk less today?

442
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,440
I didn't argue with you.

443
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,720
Guoli.

444
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,520
You know oil can't fall into the sewer.

445
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,680
You said fish can't be eaten.

446
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,600
Who told you not to eat fish?

447
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,960
You said you can't eat the intestines.

448
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
You can't eat your organs.

449
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,760
What should I do?

450
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,640
In your words,

451
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,880
What should I do?

452
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,840
I lost it.

453
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,600
Lost?

454
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,200
We won't wash it tomorrow anyway.

455
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,160
We're so bad.

456
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,600
Don't let others speak ill of you because of this.

457
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,440
Seriously.

458
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,040
During our cooperation,

459
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
there should be

460
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,080
Eight points.

461
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,160
He did most of the work.

462
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,000
Actually, I've been talking beside him.

463
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,800
and quietly...

464
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,480
Actually, time passed.

465
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,880
Two points.

466
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,400
I hope he can keep up the good work.

467
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,040
I'll buy a glass.

468
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,400
Do you want it?

469
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,560
Do you want it?

470
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,480
You mean a big glass?

471
00:20:59,480 --> 00:20:59,920
Yes.

472
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,840
Sure.

473
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,680
Let's buy it.

474
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,880
Different colors, right?

475
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,440
Okay.

476
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,680
I heard "Ding Dong".

477
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,480
There's a doorbell.

478
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,640
Take a look.

479
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,800
Are you sure you don't want to choose a color?

480
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Both are fine.

481
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,200
You or me?

482
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,960
Me.

483
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,120
What about me?

484
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,880
Don't you pick one for me?

485
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,000
Green one.

486
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,520
It looks nice.

487
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,960
Life.

488
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,000
Let's go down.

489
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,400
Let's go.

490
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,920
Is he here?

491
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,840
Yes.

492
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
Come down.

493
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,480
Another mission?

494
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,240
Fall in.

495
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,920
Is this the center?

496
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,720
You take the center.

497
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,240
To the members of the small house.

498
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,680
Today is the second day

499
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,320
the second day.

500
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,440
(In order to make everyone understand each other better,)

501
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,160
I'll reveal your life album later.

502
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,200
Please go to the living room and wait for the announcement.

503
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,160
(A photo album of life.)

504
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,080
Text.

505
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,640
The soup is on the bookshelf.

506
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,480
on the bookshelf

507
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,800
and share it with everyone.

508
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,080
Soup.

509
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,520
Why did you...

510
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,000
Why are you peeking?

511
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,800
Please.

512
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
These eyes.

513
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,120
So cute.

514
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,760
Kind of cute.

515
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Very cute.

516
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,720
You look fat.

517
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,120
"Crown Prince".

518
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
This should be me who grew up for years.

519
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,000
and became a little prince.

520
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,440
At this time, I may not know

521
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,120
I would fall in love with something

522
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,880
that you will love with your whole life.

523
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,640
I'm

524
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,560
(who participated in)

525
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,440
(in the United States.)

526
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,800
Table Tennis?

527
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,400
You play ping pong.

528
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,440
I won the second place in the youth group.

529
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,640
And this one.

530
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,360
This is the first time I represent the American team

531
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,240
on behalf of the American team.

532
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,800
Although I didn't win,

533
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm still very happy.

534
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,160
This photo

535
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,640
is the National Championships I participated in.

536
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,720
My teammates and I

537
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,760
won the second place of the team.

538
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,320
In this competition,

539
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,080
in this competition,

540
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,880
I won.

541
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,160
The top American man.

542
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,240
Awesome.

543
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,280
This is the photo

544
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,000
I entered Tsinghua University.

545
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,280
Lucky.

546
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,480
Tsinghua University approved

547
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,160
My talent in sports

548
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,120
gave me the qualification.

549
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,880
So happy.

550
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,480
Great.

551
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,840
This photo is

552
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,320
is organised by Tsinghua University.

553
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,240
Global High School Z Generation

554
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,160
of the Global High School.

555
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm happy to be recognized by the school.

556
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,920
This is my favorite teacher

557
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,720
my favorite teacher.

558
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,320
Mr. Liu Guozheng.

559
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,400
I think I'm very lucky

560
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,480
to receive his guidance.

561
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,280
This is Gook-jung's dad.

562
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,360
brought me

563
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,000
Beijing High School Competition for the first time.

564
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,840
I feel very happy.

565
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,040
This photo represents Tsinghua University

566
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
on behalf of Tsinghua University.

567
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,400
I've been the champion of men's singles

568
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,760
for two years.

569
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,080
And then

570
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,880
This is the champion I won in three years.

571
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,680
Mr. Gukjung.

572
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,960
He gave me an award.

573
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,880
I think it’s a meaningful moment.

574
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,560
So you’re 1.9 meters.

575
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,280
Yes.

576
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,840
He is indeed 1.9 meters.

577
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,320
Real evidence.

578
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,640
When the soup starts, it will be the king.

579
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
He's handsome

580
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
And he has high education.

581
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,120
and experienced.

582
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,440
Every photo is classic.

583
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,320
Every photo is highlight.

584
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,800
Everyone has been

585
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,280
really excellent.

586
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,400
I was shocked.

587
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,000
There are no photos at the back.

588
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,280
A letter.

589
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,360
I'm looking forward to it.

590
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,120
I'm really nervous.

591
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,960
Me too.

592
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,360
To the soup.

593
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,960
He's handsome and smart.

594
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,600
and good at sports.

595
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,240
These are all the comments you gave him.

596
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,320
He has been working hard

597
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,560
to show others his good and good quality.

598
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,600
He is strong.

599
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,920
I hope everyone recognizes him.

600
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,360
Wait.

601
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,360
It's okay.

602
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,000
A little sad.

603
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,720
He's strong.

604
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,600
I hope everyone recognizes him.

605
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,320
It's not a bad thing.

606
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Anyway, it's his personality.

607
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,680
He has excellent grades

608
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,160
in learning and sports.

609
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,080
But these labels

610
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,960
doesn't form a complete him.

611
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,160
I don't want this letter

612
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,280
can make him cry.

613
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,800
But between me and him

614
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,680
between me and him,

615
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,560
Lettering is a good choice.

616
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,080
Let's be honest.

617
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,800
Indeed, he is excellent.

618
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,760
But these results made him contribute a lot.

619
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,880
When he was in primary school, he started learning piano.

620
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,640
He started practicing sports not long after.

621
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,400
After school, other kids went home.

622
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,520
But he came back at night.

623
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,720
This kind of life

624
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,560
until high school graduation.

625
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,440
for more than ten years.

626
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,200
his willpower

627
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,560
is the strongest I know.

628
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,200
He's tired from training.

629
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,920
He played countless games

630
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,840
for several hours every day.

631
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,720
Maybe the piano was his vent.

632
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,040
Every time I see him playing the piano quietly for a long time,

633
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,960
I would think that.

634
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,520
Then he got into a very good university.

635
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,440
He was also good at studying.

636
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,640
and continued physical training.

637
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,840
and made great achievements for the school.

638
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,720
If anyone

639
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,800
I don't think

640
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,440
Sports Piano Learning

641
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,920
These three are excellent.

642
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,680
He cares about what others think.

643
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,080
he might be sensitive inside.

644
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,240
It's stressful.

645
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,960
I've seen his small breakdown.

646
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,600
Why is it small?

647
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,920
Because he always digests it himself.

648
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,800
He doesn't want to be negative.

649
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,080
So many times,

650
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,960
I didn't even notice his emotions.

651
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,960
But we met every day.

652
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,000
in our life,

653
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,240
Talk to me more.

654
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
You don't have to be so strong in front of me.

655
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,800
In my heart,

656
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,720
I hope other than those handsome

657
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,200
and excellent labels,

658
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,560
can be more carefree

659
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,960
and be yourself.

660
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,160
I thought

661
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,840
he might be moved.

662
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,760
or touched.

663
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,640
Because we don't usually

664
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,680
say these things.

665
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,600
But I didn't expect

666
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,720
he would cry at the beginning.

667
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,000
I remember it was all about

668
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,480
Although you have your own shining point,

669
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,120
but please relax.

670
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,720
Don't worry too much.

671
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,200
fear others' comments.

672
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,720
Maybe mom and dad

673
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,520
give you some pressure.

674
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,240
They may think pressure is motivation.

675
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,200
I do care too much about what others say.

676
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,520
I think the letter Xiaoling gave me

677
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
in the letter Xiaoling gave me.

678
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,560
I used to think she took care of me

679
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,760
just because she wanted to be good to me.

680
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,240
But now I think

681
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
she wants me to be less stressed.

682
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,600
Susu.

683
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,440
This is me.

684
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,200
So cute.

685
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,880
Why are you so thin now?

686
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,880
I'm on a diet.

687
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,920
I just learned to sit.

688
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,360
I won't leave yet.

689
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,960
You can tell it's me at a glance, right?

690
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,200
A round head.

691
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,840
So cute.

692
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,000
Cute. Okay.

693
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,960
This should be when I was three or four years old.

694
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,760
I learned some dance.

695
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,560
and my favorite fluffy toy.

696
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,240
Since childhood

697
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,680
since childhood.

698
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,680
And this is me.

699
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,160
Three or four years old.

700
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,520
My mom took me downstairs

701
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,400
to take a walk.

702
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,440
I was good at posing when I was young.

703
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,480
I knew it would make your face look smaller.

704
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,360
I was skiing.

705
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,960
So pretty.

706
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,440
That's why

707
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,760
I never skied again.

708
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,520
It's because

709
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,440
fractured.

710
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
Because... Yes.

711
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,680
I fell into the net.

712
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,320
But no one saw me.

713
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,160
for half an hour.

714
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,000
So I haven't

715
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,680
skiing again.

716
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,160
This is my wig and scarf

717
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,160
at home.

718
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,400
I've always loved my beauty since I was a kid.

719
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,480
This is the first sports meeting

720
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,720
after I went abroad.

721
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,960
About 14 years old.

722
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
14, 14, 5.

723
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,960
This is my 18-year-old birthday.

724
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,720
my dad held a adult ceremony for me.

725
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,040
When I was in school,

726
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,360
a famous landmark over there.

727
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,560
It's full of cherry blossoms.

728
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,000
So beautiful.

729
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,920
This is my graduation ceremony.

730
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,760
It was pretty that day.

731
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,680
You're still pretty now.

732
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,320
Okay. That's all.

733
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,560
Okay.

734
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,840
I'm going to read my brother's introduction letter.

735
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,200
Let's listen.

736
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,600
I can't imagine

737
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,880
My brothers have

738
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,320
in my heart.

739
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,600
After all, blood is thicker than water.

740
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,760
But if I have to describe my feelings for her,

741
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,680
I can only say she's a little "big-minded".

742
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,120
She always forgets things.

743
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,240
I don't have a good memory.

744
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,480
Don't cry.

745
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,280
It'll swell tomorrow

746
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,680
It looks silly.

747
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,440
But in a good way,

748
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,240
her optimism and cheerful

749
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,720
and broad-minded.

750
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,120
always brings joy

751
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,960
the people around you.

752
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,880
I'm sorry.

753
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,800
I made a bad start.

754
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,040
Really

755
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,960
Really.

756
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,320
Although someone said she's magnanimous,

757
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,040
in my eyes,

758
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,040
She just

759
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,000
and her family.

760
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,120
It's okay.

761
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,560
So awkward.

762
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,440
She lives

763
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
every day.

764
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,080
Be happy.

765
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,200
and happy.

766
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
She seems carefree.

767
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,280
This is what she's suitable for.

768
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,480
So when I shoulder

769
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,040
the burden of my family,

770
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,239
I will do my best

771
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,040
to keep her happy and happy.

772
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,040
I can't help crying.

773
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,120
I want to cry again.

774
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,760
Because my brothers and I

775
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,840
never express our feelings.

776
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,480
or say something cheesy to each other.

777
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,000
My sister and I

778
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,560
so frankly.

779
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,120
This time, I'll express my emotions

780
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,600
in a letter.

781
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,560
and write her true feelings.

782
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,520
Let her understand.

783
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,320
As for Susu,

784
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,440
I think from her album to the end,

785
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,159
I think she is

786
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,600
a very cute little princess.

787
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,640
She is also very considerate.

788
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,440
I think she is

789
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,160
who is irrigued by love.

790
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,000
should be the love given by her parents.

791
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
are full of

792
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,560
Susu.

793
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,720
May I ask

794
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,960
what do you do now?

795
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,840
I'm a business major now.

796
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,560
I'm in charge of

797
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,280
the copyright of the media company.

798
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,120
Okay.

799
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,360
Got it. Got it.

800
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,120
Come on, Fatty.

801
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,480
Come on.

802
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,240
Smile.

803
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,640
Why does he smile?

804
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,120
Take a look.

805
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,760
Why am I called Fatty because

806
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,520
So cute.

807
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,440
So cute

808
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,000
Meat pout

809
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,560
Yes

810
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,440
Because I was fat when I was born.

811
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,360
So Fatty is my nickname.

812
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,600
My eyes are getting red.

813
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,840
Maybe when I was young,

814
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,360
I might be a bit like soup.

815
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,280
I know cars.

816
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,280
sports player.

817
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,880
This is the first car

818
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,600
when I was young.

819
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,920
Yes, because I was naughty when I was a kid.

820
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,000
I liked

821
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,920
amusement park.

822
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,520
And this was when I was in sixth grade.

823
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,840
What are you doing?

824
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,560
Playing with cars.

825
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,800
You really like cars.

826
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,720
Yes, I really like cars.

827
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,240
When I was in college,

828
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,360
In school,

829
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,560
my classmate celebrated my birthday.

830
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,680
I like sports.

831
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,920
or playing basketball.

832
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,960
Another photo of exercise.

833
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,400
Ride

834
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,080
Ride.

835
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah, maybe I didn't lose weight.

836
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,160
But I still love sports.

837
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,440
By the way,

838
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,120
my occupation.

839
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,880
I'm a car manager.

840
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,920
No wonder.

841
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,120
So handsome.

842
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,600
Yes.

843
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,920
I run three garage.

844
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,040
I started my own business.

845
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,760
And my hobby became my job.

846
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,040
I admire Fatty.

847
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
Because many of my classmates and friends

848
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,160
want to start their own business.

849
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,360
But 99.9 percent

850
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,600
is a failure.

851
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,000
If he succeeds,

852
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,160
and run three companies,

853
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,880
or a workshop,

854
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,360
I think

855
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,720
a great thing.

856
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,720
Really.

857
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,760
It's okay.

858
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,000
Not much. I think I can hold it.

859
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,600
I can't hold it anymore.

860
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
I can't do it anymore.

861
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,600
When I wrote this letter,

862
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,760
I can only think of three words.

863
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,720
Stop eating.

864
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,680
I remember you've been cheerful and playful since you were a kid.

865
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,560
You're the child king of the kids around you.

866
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,400
You always play pranks and bully me.

867
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,040
I have to cry every time.

868
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,960
It's so hard.

869
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,760
It's really hard for me to read.

870
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,320
I wanted to be the only little princess in my family.

871
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,480
But dad told me

872
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,040
we're brothers.

873
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,200
Wait for me to grow up.

874
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,960
Why are you writing such sentimental words?

875
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,640
Let's hold hands in the future.

876
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
and walk together.

877
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,080
Then you became mature and reliable.

878
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,000
We still bicker

879
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,800
Just look at me

880
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,200
you'll know what he's thinking.

881
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,640
People always joke about

882
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,280
you are the male version of me.

883
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,520
I'm the female version of you.

884
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,680
You have

885
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,160
in work.

886
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,920
You always look happy

887
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,000
and happy in life.

888
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,520
You can always see

889
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,960
my lack of confidence and anxiety.

890
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,800
gives me a sense of security.

891
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,920
I know something.

892
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,360
You have many weaknesses and grievances.

893
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,240
But you've been hiding them in your heart

894
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,280
I never say

895
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,680
I'm afraid I'll think too much because of this.

896
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,760
because of that.

897
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,280
You've always been

898
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,440
who loves me the most.

899
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,280
So your big hand

900
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,640
has been holding my hand.

901
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,680
Let me tell you secretly

902
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,560
You're the most handsome guy among the comedians.

903
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,240
Let's do this together.

904
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,960
and enjoy this rare journey.

905
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,880
I didn't expect to cry so much.

906
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,240
The reason I cried

907
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,440
because my brothers and I

908
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,360
don't say these things.

909
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
I won't say it either.

910
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,360
Fatty.

911
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,040
I think he's a tender man.

912
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,640
He said he wouldn't cry.

913
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,840
But when he sat there,

914
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,240
I felt like he was about to cry.

915
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,240
I think so too.

916
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,880
he doesn't usually say something sentimental.

917
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,560
He’s actually a very fragile

918
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,640
very fragile.

919
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,360
When I opened the letter,

920
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,600
when I opened the letter.

921
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,320
I saw something in my mind.

922
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,960
What she meant

923
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,640
not only me,

924
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,920
More importantly,

925
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,000
I thought a lot.

926
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,760
I think it's our next life.

927
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,520
Let's hold hands.

928
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,720
When I think about these things,

929
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,840
I really want to cry.

930
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,000
Xiao Ling.

931
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,320
Go.

932
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,600
Here.

933
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,600
This is mine.

934
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,520
So pretty.

935
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,600
A hundred-day photo.

936
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,120
A doll.

937
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,600
Is that all you have when you were born?

938
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Yes.

939
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So beautiful.

940
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,440
This is the first time

941
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,200
went to the park to catch goldfish.

942
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,120
It's really like a doll.

943
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,960
And

944
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,800
This is my graduation photo from kindergarten.

945
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,400
So pretty.

946
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,760
And this is...

947
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,640
I like animals.

948
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,760
That's why I'm riding a horse.

949
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,600
This should be in grade 3 or 4.

950
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,520
I was that tall.

951
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,560
I grew taller.

952
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,840
This is my first time fishing in the lake.

953
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,080
I caught a bask.

954
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,720
This is a photo of me and a lizard.

955
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,280
So I like animals very much.

956
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,760
When I was performing,

957
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,480
when I was performing.

958
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,920
Xiaoling's mom.

959
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,360
I read it out.

960
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Because my classmates

961
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,280
they all think I'm a maternal halo.

962
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,560
I may take more care of others.

963
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:27,880
Like this.

964
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And this is

965
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,560
when I graduated.

966
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,560
So beautiful.

967
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,320
This is the video

968
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,920
in class.

969
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,400
a makeup photo.

970
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,560
So pretty.

971
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,400
The last one is my graduation photo.

972
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,960
I'm still in Beijing Film Academy.

973
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,080
I have my master's degree.

974
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,960
I'm still studying for postgraduate studies.

975
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,520
How can everyone be so excellent?

976
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,800
Yes, they are all excellent.

977
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,880
Here's the letter.

978
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,560
Let me see if it's enough.

979
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,120
A little.

980
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,720
I won't cry.

981
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,920
Nice to meet you.

982
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,840
Today, let me introduce

983
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,720
the best siblings in the world.

984
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,800
Since I remember,

985
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,000
Xiaoling and I often

986
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,880
because of delicious food and remote control.

987
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,920
No one goes easy on each other.

988
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,920
We've been following the principle of fair competition.

989
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,680
(We grew up fighting.)

990
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,560
After entering puberty,

991
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,200
I gradually have my own pursuit.

992
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,360
I paid more attention

993
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,720
on my own.

994
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,960
She's carefree.

995
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,080
Xiao Ling became more quiet.

996
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,800
She always takes care of everyone's emotions.

997
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,640
Because I'm too tired,

998
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,920
because I'm too tired

999
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,840
in secret.

1000
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,000
Xiao Ling never shows herself.

1001
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,960
Although she's pretty,

1002
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,720
and kind.

1003
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,840
She's good at drawing.

1004
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,200
She is gentle and delicate.

1005
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,200
She's gentle and delicate.

1006
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,480
is full of selfishness.

1007
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,360
You're out of line.

1008
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,680
I like a saying.

1009
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,360
We love ourselves more than love others.

1010
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,960
but we care about others' opinions

1011
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,440
than what they think.

1012
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,920
Everyone is good at showing

1013
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,280
to everyone.

1014
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,480
But Xiao Ling is an exception.

1015
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,160
She's self-conceited.

1016
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,280
I don't think it's necessary to show

1017
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,360
Accept the good or bad you are now.

1018
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,560
and improve it little by little.

1019
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,600
my own life.

1020
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,640
I envy her.

1021
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,480
She laughs again.

1022
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,200
I can't watch the last part.

1023
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,280
I won't let go

1024
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,600
I won't let her go easily.

1025
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,720
If you want to pursue her,

1026
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,960
you must pass me first.

1027
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,400
Who wrote it?

1028
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:03,840
It's nice.

1029
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,320
I didn't expect my siblings to be so delicate.

1030
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,640
Who is it I'm curious

1031
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,320
I'm curious.

1032
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,080
You're curious too, right?

1033
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,800
In the whole letter,

1034
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,600
many things

1035
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,440
I think it's all about my heart.

1036
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,120
But the most touching thing is

1037
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,760
he said my existence

1038
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,160
in this world

1039
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,400
in this world of self-esteem,

1040
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,560
in the world of self-esteem.

1041
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,720
That makes me feel

1042
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,320
he really saw through me.

1043
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,720
My sister doesn't like being criticized.

1044
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,120
Everyone is showing a better self.

1045
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,800
and their true self.

1046
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,800
But what I want to tell her

1047
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,600
that you may be better than me.

1048
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,560
I hope you can

1049
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,800
show yourself confidently.

1050
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,800
Map.

1051
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,800
Map.

1052
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,520
The first one.

1053
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,160
This is my 100-year-old photo.

1054
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,000
A hundred-year-old photo.

1055
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:08,920
So cute.

1056
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,120
It's totally different now.

1057
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,080
My ears were pressed.

1058
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,520
In fact, my ears could tell

1059
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,080
It's big, right?

1060
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,720
It's like this.

1061
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,760
Look back later.

1062
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,440
You can see this.

1063
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,480
This is a picture of me when I was ten months old

1064
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,920
So fat.

1065
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,760
Yeah I was chubby when I was a kid

1066
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,400
Like a fairy

1067
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,480
My ears were this big

1068
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,800
When I was young

1069
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,160
I learned drums in elementary school.

1070
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
So cute.

1071
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,400
The next one was

1072
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,840
was a certificate I got

1073
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,360
in a model competition.

1074
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,200
In 2014,

1075
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,480
in 2014

1076
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,360
is to help Lin Zhi Ying dance.

1077
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:50,960
Who?

1078
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,960
Lin Zhi Ying.

1079
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,360
Yes.

1080
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,600
I was very happy and excited.

1081
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,440
After everyone left,

1082
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,960
I left a video there.

1083
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,680
And this photo is my transformation.

1084
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,200
This is the photo

1085
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:06,920
in high school.

1086
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,480
In my opinion,

1087
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,800
is the most handsome cut.

1088
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,400
Now the hairline is getting higher

1089
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,240
So you can't keep a inch

1090
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,360
And this.

1091
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,200
I couldn't find

1092
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,160
a photo with the school.

1093
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,600
At home,

1094
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,960
at home.

1095
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,680
It's Zhejiang Media.

1096
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,720
The last one is in the school.

1097
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,480
Host?

1098
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,720
Yes at school

1099
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,640
at school.

1100
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,680
I was very happy.

1101
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,760
I picked up

1102
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,560
on the ground.

1103
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,240
When you sprinkle it like this,

1104
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,120
this beautiful photo.

1105
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,880
This is my current situation.

1106
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,480
I'm a student.

1107
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,360
It's so long.

1108
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,280
(Dear Drawing, Exhibition)

1109
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,600
About this letter of introduction,

1110
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,160
I thought about it for a long time.

1111
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,280
I received your letters many times.

1112
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,680
And this is the first time I wrote to you.

1113
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,240
I have a lot to say,

1114
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,200
but I couldn't say it.

1115
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,440
Somewhere

1116
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,080
Let's talk about you first.

1117
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,880
I remember

1118
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,520
When you grow up,

1119
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,200
they would chase me and make a wish.

1120
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,760
As if as long as I'm by your side,

1121
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,360
I can grant all your wishes.

1122
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,360
At home,

1123
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,600
you are the babies of the elders.

1124
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,160
But when you're with me,

1125
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,240
you'll become very carefree.

1126
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,200
and listen to me in everything.

1127
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,160
Give way to me.

1128
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,000
In front of you,

1129
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,760
I can be the real me.

1130
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,600
I can be lazy,

1131
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,640
You can be angry,

1132
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,680
or do something wrong.

1133
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,760
You can say whatever you want.

1134
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,120
Many people say that they give me the sense of security.

1135
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,320
But you must have given me the sense of security.

1136
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,040
What impressed me was one Spring Festival.

1137
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,880
I was scolded by my elders.

1138
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,440
I was in my third year.

1139
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,760
You pulled me behind.

1140
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,560
and yelled at her elders.

1141
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,680
Don't scold her.

1142
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,080
I know you always

1143
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,920
want me to feel loved.

1144
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,720
You don't want me to envy others.

1145
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,240
You're still

1146
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,360
to be loved.

1147
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,920
but you gave me all your love.

1148
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,200
You always show

1149
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,000
that don't fit your age.

1150
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
When you're here,

1151
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,560
I'm a capable and independent person.

1152
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,680
always like to be a shopkeeper.

1153
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,520
Because I know

1154
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,280
you would arrange everything well.

1155
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,040
You can always take everything down.

1156
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,880
and reassure me.

1157
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
When I ride a motorcycle,

1158
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,960
I might fall.

1159
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,720
and use your hands to hold me.

1160
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,040
is the corner

1161
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,440
in a certain degree.

1162
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,200
I don't care what happens.

1163
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,680
Because you'll always be there and love me.

1164
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,720
All this time,

1165
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,880
you seem to be a born Letian.

1166
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,080
You seldom have worries.

1167
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,760
I've never seen you cry.

1168
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,120
I feel happy and proud

1169
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,840
for your personality.

1170
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,800
I hope you can be

1171
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,360
happy and happy forever.

1172
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,280
But the path of growing up

1173
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,160
is not always smooth.

1174
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,120
If you want to stop when you're sad,

1175
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,400
take a break.

1176
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,840
You don't have to be so sensible.

1177
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,960
Because when you need me,

1178
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,600
when you need me.

1179
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,440
I'm grateful to you

1180
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,480
in my life.

1181
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,040
I've always wanted to say thank you.

1182
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,600
Thank you.

1183
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,040
Thank you for always being here.

1184
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,200
This is not bad.

1185
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,560
This is the first letter she wrote to me.

1186
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,120
When I read the letter she wrote to me,

1187
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,520
I never thought about crying.

1188
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,320
I cried while reading.

1189
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,720
I don't think I ever cried in front of her.

1190
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,280
I can't cry for a while.

1191
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,000
Let me tell you.

1192
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,200
It rained just now.

1193
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,640
That's different.

1194
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,680
It's raining.

1195
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,360
Have some.

1196
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:38,920
No hurry.

1197
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,480
The more I drink, the more I want to cry.

1198
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,640
He's nervous.

1199
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,280
His hand is like this.

1200
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,800
Stop talking, okay?

1201
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,240
Sit here. Hurry.

1202
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,080
Come on.

1203
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,840
If my roommate hadn't said

1204
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,520
I wouldn't sit here.

1205
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,200
I'll give you energy.

1206
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,080
Here.

1207
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,120
This one.

1208
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,560
They are all funny anyway.

1209
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,440
I didn't pick the most handsome one.

1210
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,400
I don't remember when

1211
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,440
It must be in the shower

1212
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,840
Soup is also in the shower

1213
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,800
How about we roommates?

1214
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,280
What about your roommates?

1215
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,720
To be honest,

1216
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,680
Actually next to this

1217
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,720
is my brother.

1218
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,160
I just dropped it.

1219
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,680
She looked like this.

1220
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,120
I think I dislike her.

1221
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,040
You know?

1222
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,480
It's kind of pretentious.

1223
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,760
I used to pretend when I was young.

1224
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,160
What's wrong?

1225
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,960
What?

1226
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,160
What is this?

1227
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,760
Too ugly.

1228
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,160
A bit charming.

1229
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,120
Very charming.

1230
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,040
Halloween

1231
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,280
He was raising his little butt.

1232
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,920
I thought I was handsome.

1233
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,520
I put on makeup.

1234
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,720
They are also my brothers.

1235
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,800
I can see that.

1236
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,760
Yes, I can.

1237
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,160
I don't like taking photos.

1238
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,400
but my brothers love taking photos.

1239
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,240
So most of my photos

1240
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,800
with her.

1241
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,480
Harry's photo

1242
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,800
It means he doesn't like taking photos.

1243
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,400
We took photos for him.

1244
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,000
They must be very close.

1245
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,000
Very close.

1246
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,120
It's also a drum.

1247
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:28,920
I learned it.

1248
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,240
It was a little dark.

1249
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,000
Why is it dark?

1250
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,080
Let me explain.

1251
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,520
I trained track and field every day.

1252
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,400
I won a prize in elementary school and junior high.

1253
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,640
It was my school.

1254
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,040
in my school.

1255
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,280
He can win the first place of nine.

1256
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,720
So it's very dark.

1257
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,520
Awesome.

1258
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,960
I hope in my next life

1259
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,480
in my next life.

1260
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,000
I don't need to be so dark.

1261
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,320
Interior sports.

1262
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,600
and got the trophy.

1263
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,600
A medal?

1264
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,520
This is a medal.

1265
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,960
And this shield.

1266
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,720
Amazing.

1267
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,200
Awesome.

1268
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,760
Wait.

1269
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,120
Middle school.

1270
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,400
It's ugly.

1271
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm still trying to hide my innocence.

1272
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,080
This photo

1273
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,080
when I first learned how to pretend.

1274
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,400
Is this a headache?

1275
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,240
Yes, a headache.

1276
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,240
My head hurts.

1277
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,600
My head hurts.

1278
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,040
When we meet Harry next time,

1279
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,160
we'll do one, two, three.

1280
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,800
Then I shave my hair.

1281
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,640
This looks good.

1282
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,080
Kitten.

1283
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,120
This is my kitten in England.

1284
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:38,280
Bring Eleven.

1285
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,000
Eleven.

1286
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,520
And then,

1287
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,680
my brother was next to me.

1288
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,800
to celebrate my birthday with me.

1289
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,360
And this is

1290
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,800
to shoot.

1291
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,160
Angel lamp.

1292
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,440
I went to England for eight years.

1293
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,120
It's my first time taking a picture with an angel lamp.

1294
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,160
I'm a little embarrassed.

1295
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:57,880
Wait.

1296
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,840
Don't rain.

1297
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,280
I'll take an umbrella.

1298
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,760
I can't cry.

1299
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,560
Wait. I want to laugh.

1300
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,120
Draw yourself.

1301
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,080
I won't cry.

1302
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,760
My brother

1303
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,120
is a big boy with a strong personality.

1304
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,680
He has a personality

1305
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,240
and has his own opinion.

1306
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,440
He looks cool.

1307
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,640
He looks like a player.

1308
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,960
But in fact,

1309
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,880
who hides

1310
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,360
in his heart.

1311
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,120
He has been smarter than me since he was a kid.

1312
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,680
Very right.

1313
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,520
I think my brother

1314
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,200
very clearly.

1315
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,360
He keeps provoking me.

1316
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,640
Trying to provoke me?

1317
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,600
No matter what I say,

1318
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:44,920
or what I do,

1319
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,040
he seems to be going against me.

1320
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,160
In my memory,

1321
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,000
he's always good at being naughty.

1322
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,480
Every day after school,

1323
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,760
he always comes home with scars.

1324
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,480
My mom will be called to school

1325
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,440
she would be called to school to meet her teacher.

1326
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,800
At that time, I thought

1327
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,160
what to do when he grew up.

1328
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,400
Unexpectedly,

1329
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,200
as he grew up,

1330
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,000
many advantages appeared.

1331
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,120
He loved sports when he was young.

1332
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,000
He also participated in various sports competitions.

1333
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,480
Many sports competitions in school

1334
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,240
in many sports competitions.

1335
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,640
Although I don't know how to praise,

1336
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,120
but I'm still very proud.

1337
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,280
And the expression of a wave.

1338
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,440
Wave.

1339
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,920
It's very detailed.

1340
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,600
After high school,

1341
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,440
I gradually got busy with my studies.

1342
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,880
We've also lived

1343
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,840
to go to cram school every day.

1344
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,880
I didn't expect that

1345
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,120
he actually loves

1346
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,360
a science that I've never learned.

1347
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,080
Philosophy?

1348
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,920
Maybe it's because

1349
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,920
his science was better.

1350
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,640
So when I quarreled with him,

1351
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,320
I couldn't beat him.

1352
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,720
Although we were just playing around,

1353
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,920
but most of the time,

1354
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,640
he always did something that touched me.

1355
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,720
When I was sick,

1356
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,320
when I was sick.

1357
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,680
Although I don't remember this,

1358
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,040
but I think I did.

1359
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,000
When no one wants to eat with me,

1360
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,560
without any complaints.

1361
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,720
At last, I hope

1362
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,720
he can shine

1363
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,440
in the field he loves.

1364
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,200
Her letter of introduction is not as emotional as others.

1365
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,080
The compliment is more than the emotional part.

1366
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,360
I'm touched.

1367
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,200
My brother and I

1368
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,640
in normal times.

1369
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,680
I've never praised him face to face.

1370
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,480
This is the first time I wrote to him.

1371
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,360
and the first time I praised him.

1372
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,440
In the letter,

1373
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,600
I wrote many good points of my brother.

1374
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,440
I want my friends in the house to know

1375
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,960
my brother is really good.

1376
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,560
Am I the first one

1377
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,760
who set a goal and didn't fall?

1378
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,560
Yes.

1379
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,200
I'm sorry.

1380
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,320
It rained just now.

1381
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,280
It's sunny now.

1382
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,560
It's over.

1383
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,000
Xinxin.

1384
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,920
Coming.

1385
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,920
I'm getting nervous.

1386
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,000
I think I'll be choking later.

1387
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,960
Prepare the soup.

1388
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,880
Yes.

1389
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,360
We'll start anytime.

1390
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,000
Tu Tu, don't cry.

1391
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,920
Tu, don't cry.

1392
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,600
This

1393
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,040
is a photo of me when I was half a year old.

1394
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,200
Half-year-old?

1395
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,040
This is about one and a half years old.

1396
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,760
Your head is so fashionable.

1397
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,280
I've had a lot of hair since I was a kid.

1398
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,400
I'm so jealous.

1399
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,600
This is the first time I came to Beijing.

1400
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,040
You looked like a boy when you were young.

1401
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,960
I think you were two years old.

1402
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,000
About three years old.

1403
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,800
My photo

1404
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,320
in my photos.

1405
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,760
After that, my family

1406
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,360
family reasons.

1407
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,440
Then my parents separated.

1408
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,480
Then...

1409
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,840
my grandma passed away.

1410
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,320
for a long time,

1411
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,640
I went abroad alone.

1412
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,440
When I was 14,

1413
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,320
I was alone

1414
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,520
with no siblings.

1415
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,200
I went to America alone.

1416
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,440
Not many photos

1417
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,560
I didn't save them.

1418
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,800
and moved often.

1419
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,240
I didn't even

1420
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,040
graduation photos.

1421
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,160
I've been changing schools.

1422
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,600
I came back from America and went to Singapore.

1423
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,080
After three years,

1424
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,000
This is the first time

1425
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,800
when I was 19 or 20.

1426
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,720
So pretty.

1427
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,480
She's already 20 years old.

1428
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,760
When I was 20,

1429
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,840
I went to Japan for a trip.

1430
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,440
About a year.

1431
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,280
It's in Barcelona.

1432
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,520
I love traveling.

1433
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,680
My hobby is to travel.

1434
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,160
And last year,

1435
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,320
I went to Xinjiang.

1436
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,800
It's so beautiful.

1437
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,720
This is the Global Film.

1438
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,160
My brother took this for me.

1439
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,040
Nice shot.

1440
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,840
You're good at shooting.

1441
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,120
This is the investment meeting

1442
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,560
last year.

1443
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,720
I'm here as the manager of the marketing department.

1444
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,320
This is a photo of me and my dad.

1445
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,800
Okay, over.

1446
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,000
My siblings have been good at studying since childhood.

1447
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,480
My little head is more flexible than mine.

1448
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,760
She's the daughter of the family.

1449
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,480
Especially after being naughty

1450
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,840
I got scolded by my parents.

1451
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,840
Xinxin always comforts me.

1452
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,240
Esther has big eyes.

1453
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,760
Smile is warm and shiny.

1454
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,480
It always brings joy to our family.

1455
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,080
It's the brightest star in the house.

1456
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,760
But Xin is also a crybaby.

1457
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,640
When I was a kid, my mom scolded me and cried.

1458
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,640
I cried when I got bad grades.

1459
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,720
She cries even if I steal her snacks.

1460
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,000
Speak louder to her now.

1461
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,200
I cry too.

1462
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,320
It's heartbreaking.

1463
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,080
I want to tell my brothers

1464
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,640
about the future.

1465
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,560
I hope you don't worry.

1466
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,000
Don't worry.

1467
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,640
Do what you want.

1468
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,960
I'll talk about you a lot,

1469
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,840
no matter what you do,

1470
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,000
I will support you.

1471
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,120
Life is full of thorns and challenges.

1472
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,520
But we're not alone.

1473
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,120
No matter where we are

1474
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,000
our bond has never broken.

1475
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,840
I hope you can

1476
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,560
with a happy life.

1477
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,520
Meet the right person and love.

1478
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,920
and try it boldly.

1479
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,840
and enjoy life.

1480
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,880
I'll always be by your side to protect you.

1481
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,680
I hope you can be happy every day.

1482
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,600
Everything is the best arrangement.

1483
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,200
Everything is the best arrangement.

1484
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,040
This is my personality signature too.

1485
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,120
Everything is the best arrangement.

1486
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,600
Your brother wrote it well.

1487
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,760
Yes, it's good.

1488
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,520
I was touched.

1489
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,200
I was crying when he cried.

1490
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,920
I cried my nose out.

1491
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,760
I think...

1492
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,200
But I have no choice.

1493
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,400
I couldn't stop crying.

1494
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,560
Then I cried.

1495
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,920
Because he can sense my emotions.

1496
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,520
And when I'm sensitive

1497
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,560
and fragile,

1498
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,480
he always encouraged me

1499
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,200
and told me not to be anxious.

1500
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:46,560
Show your brothers.

1501
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,760
Aren't you too relaxed

1502
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,720
when you were relaxed?

1503
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,800
I started playing by myself.

1504
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,280
I think my appearance

1505
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,440
in all aspects,

1506
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,600
in front of the screen.

1507
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,760
Not to mention a romance show.

1508
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,000
I think she's pretty.

1509
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,520
I think she can do it.

1510
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,840
But I never thought

1511
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,440
to come to this show.

1512
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,440
because of my sister.

1513
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,480
I'm He Wenxin, He Wenjie's dad.

1514
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,880
Fatty is mostly happy.

1515
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,600
and simple.

1516
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,120
and sensible.

1517
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,120
and responsible.

1518
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,040
Esther

1519
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,080
It's the same.

1520
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,800
filial

1521
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,360
and thoughtful.

1522
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,200
She studied early too.

1523
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,520
She went to school with her brother when she was five.

1524
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,440
She had good grades.

1525
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,040
So I doted on her.

1526
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,400
I've spoiled her since I was a child.

1527
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,880
When I was young,

1528
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,520
I spent 10 yuan a week.

1529
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:54,960
My sister is 100.

1530
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,400
The difference is ten times.

1531
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,520
It's not that exaggerated.

1532
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,280
Yes.

1533
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,560
I found out later.

1534
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,880
I was quite shocked.

1535
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,160
I thought everyone was $10.

1536
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,400
I went into my sister's room

1537
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,560
I saw it.

1538
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,760
full of snacks.

1539
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,480
That means I saved them.

1540
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:11,960
Really?

1541
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:12,480
Yes.

1542
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,200
No.

1543
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,720
I saw her room

1544
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,840
full of snacks.

1545
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,080
All kinds of snacks

1546
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,520
Something like that.

1547
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,760
A pen. A pen. A notebook.

1548
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,560
When you were young,

1549
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,200
you didn't spend much money.

1550
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,280
You don't like studying.

1551
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,280
You have a happy family.

1552
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,040
He smiles and is gentle.

1553
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,440
and brings warmth

1554
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,400
to family.

1555
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,080
In daily life,

1556
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,240
in daily life.

1557
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:41,880
Fatty.

1558
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,400
or Fatty, what are you doing?

1559
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,600
I seldom call him brother.

1560
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,560
Because he had a round face since he was a kid.

1561
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,800
He was cute when he was born.

1562
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,080
Actually, he was cuter than me when he was little.

1563
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,800
A lot cuter.

1564
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,600
Although he likes to bully me,

1565
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,880
he can also make everyone

1566
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,200
to everyone.

1567
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,640
They always go out

1568
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,480
It's just the two of us.

1569
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,800
There are always two people everywhere.

1570
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,480
It's good that they have a boyfriend.

1571
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,280
They have a girlfriend.

1572
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,360
Only the two of them know.

1573
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,000
None of us knew.

1574
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,640
When I was young,

1575
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,160
I liked snatching snacks from my brother.

1576
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,680
and milk.

1577
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,160
Then my brothers get angry.

1578
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,360
I'll cry first

1579
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,400
and tell on you.

1580
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,640
Then get angry

1581
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,960
and then make up.

1582
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,360
There's a process.

1583
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,080
I could only complain when I was young.

1584
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,040
All kinds of complaints

1585
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,840
Complain to mom and dad

1586
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,120
Tell aunt and grandma

1587
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,400
the whole family.

1588
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,000
Then I was beaten.

1589
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:35,720
Right.

1590
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,280
No.

1591
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,200
Keep up the good work.

1592
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,040
and figure out a new way to trick me.

1593
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,480
I think the way I get along with my brother

1594
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,160
is love and hate.

1595
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,200
I can tell my sister everything.

1596
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,120
and share everything.

1597
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,040
Even the two of us

1598
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,520
have no secrets.

1599
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,760
He taught me something.

1600
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,880
I taught him something.

1601
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,400
I'm more strict with He Wenxin.

1602
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,960
Because she's a girl.

1603
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,000
When she was in third grade,

1604
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,920
I asked my teacher for tutoring.

1605
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,080
and accompany him myself.

1606
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,520
Because I used to be a teacher.

1607
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,680
and accompanied her every day.

1608
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,520
for a year.

1609
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,720
Every day, basically in the afternoon,

1610
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,800
every day.

1611
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,800
I'll see her off at 7 a.m.

1612
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,560
I do this every day.

1613
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,120
for a year.

1614
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,240
I don't care about boys.

1615
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,320
I'll let him play basketball.

1616
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:19,880
Go out.

1617
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,800
Fatty can play outside.

1618
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,120
He's a bit wild.

1619
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,400
He likes to play with cars since childhood.

1620
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,840
When I see these cars,

1621
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,080
since I was young.

1622
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,160
So, in the end,

1623
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,840
he did what he liked.

1624
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,920
He did a good job.

1625
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,920
Basically,

1626
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,920
I don't need any support from my family.

1627
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,400
So I let him develop on his own.

1628
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,160
A sense of loss means

1629
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,000
I broke up with his dad.

1630
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,960
Although love was there,

1631
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,080
I think

1632
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:49,880
relatively,

1633
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,720
Parents' separation

1634
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,040
I owe a little to my child.

1635
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,120
I didn't feel it at that time.

1636
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,160
When I grew up,

1637
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,040
I feel it's a bit weird.

1638
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:57,920
I can feel it

1639
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,360
I can feel it.

1640
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,520
In junior high.

1641
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,480
I felt it in junior high.

1642
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,720
Because the two of them are getting farther and farther.

1643
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,840
When I was twelve or three, I could already feel it.

1644
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,880
I had my own emotions

1645
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,840
and locked myself in the room.

1646
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,800
Before I went abroad,

1647
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,520
my father had a serious talk with me.

1648
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,840
Tell He Wenxin first.

1649
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,040
We were taking a walk downstairs.

1650
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,840
I said your mom wanted a divorce.

1651
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,160
What do you think?

1652
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,080
At that time, I felt

1653
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,720
I could only accept it.

1654
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,680
I learned it from my brothers.

1655
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,160
12th grade.

1656
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,520
I was a grown-up then.

1657
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,160
I could accept it at that time.

1658
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,040
Because they separated peacefully.

1659
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,720
When parents separated,

1660
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,760
she was rebellious.

1661
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,480
has a great impact on her.

1662
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,840
Her personality changed suddenly.

1663
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,280
I used to love studying.

1664
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,400
It feels like a gentle sheep

1665
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,160
a gentle

1666
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,560
a wild horse.

1667
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,840
The impact of my parents being apart

1668
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,120
the most

1669
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,360
affect my view of love.

1670
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:11,640
I think

1671
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,080
girls should be

1672
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,200
in this society.

1673
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,240
Wake up.

1674
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,880
She's going abroad.

1675
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,240
She said there was an exchange student.

1676
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,160
She's really thoughtful.

1677
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:23,520
and bold.

1678
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,400
I've contacted everything.

1679
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,600
She did it herself.

1680
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,600
We couldn't contact her.

1681
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,080
I was confused at that time.

1682
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,920
When I think back, I was scared.

1683
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,720
She's only 15 years old.

1684
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,600
She was happy.

1685
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,480
not afraid at all.

1686
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,720
One person carried two boxes

1687
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,880
He went to America from Hong Kong Airport, China.

1688
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,920
When I was abroad,

1689
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,040
It's like holidays.

1690
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,720
during holidays.

1691
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,800
Maybe I've always been alone.

1692
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,080
Sometimes, I don't have friends.

1693
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,640
So, the festival is over.

1694
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,280
Ever since I lived abroad,

1695
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,080
I think

1696
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,440
enjoy being alone.

1697
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,520
After all,

1698
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,720
you have to do everything on your own.

1699
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,760
Because if no one helps you,

1700
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,360
you can't finish this.

1701
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,440
I can't finish my study.

1702
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,480
You can't complete your life.

1703
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,160
You can only muster up the courage

1704
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,560
to do everything well.

1705
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,360
So this year in America,

1706
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,440
I think after experiencing these things,

1707
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,360
it's also a growth for her.

1708
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,200
It's a training.

1709
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,280
She's very independent.

1710
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:14,840
I used to

1711
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,760
I used to sleep with my phone off.

1712
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,160
Ever since she went to America,

1713
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:18,760
I haven't

1714
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,479
I've never turned off my phone and slept.

1715
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:20,960
I remember

1716
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,240
their class ended at noon.

1717
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,800
I'm at 2:30 p.m.

1718
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,760
She was the first year in America.

1719
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,760
She called me every night.

1720
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:27,880
She called me after class.

1721
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,840
I waited for her call at 2:30.

1722
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,399
I think I've grown up

1723
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,960
when I grow up.

1724
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,560
Maybe I was naughty when I was a kid.

1725
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,680
When I grow up,

1726
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,600
when parents

1727
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,720
and communicate with each other,

1728
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,399
my parents came to me first.

1729
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:43,000
At that moment,

1730
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,279
I felt a burden on my shoulder.

1731
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:45,800
For example,

1732
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,960
some problems in love,

1733
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,080
and conflicts,

1734
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,359
he would tell me

1735
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:51,960
Don't be afraid.

1736
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,600
It's okay.

1737
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,760
I'll help you.

1738
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:57,120
You can do whatever you want.

1739
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,720
When I feel a little wronged,

1740
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,399
or unhappy,

1741
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:03,760
I want to call him right away.

1742
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,640
I hope he can enlighten me by my side.

1743
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:08,120
I'll tell him

1744
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,840
emotional words.

1745
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,279
he will accept it all.

1746
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:14,520
It feels like we're more than siblings.

1747
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,359
Like family and friends

1748
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:18,560
Like brothers and besties.

1749
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,960
Multiple identity.

1750
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,359
One time Fatty was bullied by a student.

1751
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,040
I hit him.

1752
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,640
He Wenxin even talked about that boy.

1753
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,479
to teach that boy a lesson.

1754
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:30,760
When he grows up,

1755
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,560
he told He Wenxin everything.

1756
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,479
He was afraid of something.

1757
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:36,160
He Wenxin also dealt with them.

1758
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:36,960
Now I feel

1759
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,520
he has grown up.

1760
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,120
My family

1761
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,840
to train him.

1762
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,160
Be responsible.

1763
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,160
Right take care of your sister

1764
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,000
Now everything

1765
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,920
He Wenxin follows you now.

1766
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,720
It's upside down.

1767
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:49,880
Fatty told me.

1768
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,600
He said he actually

1769
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,399
had a boyfriend.

1770
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:54,480
What do you think?

1771
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,000
He said I'll watch.

1772
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,680
I won't let my sister suffer.

1773
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,200
He's like this.

1774
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,080
So I feel relieved

1775
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,000
I feel relieved.

1776
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,960
They are together every day.

1777
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,200
So how can I be at ease

1778
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:02,800
How can I be at ease?

1779
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,720
Because Fatty saw it.

1780
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,400
I'm very interested in his love life.

1781
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,320
gossip.

1782
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,040
I have to know it as soon as possible.

1783
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,240
and know immediately.

1784
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:14,840
she is

1785
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,120
who likes to eat my love affairs.

1786
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,160
Yes, I do.

1787
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,760
They said I can grow up if I eat melons.

1788
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,640
I don't need to eat anything.

1789
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,080
I don't eat much every day.

1790
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,720
She eats a lot.

1791
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,480
If she is bullied in love,

1792
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,160
I will stand out immediately.

1793
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,400
As for their relationship,

1794
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,480
I won't interfere in other things.

1795
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,200
But I just

1796
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,600
I can't see my brother being bullied.

1797
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,000
He will...

1798
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,480
He gets involved in everything.

1799
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,480
He's very involved.

1800
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,280
"The three are talking."

1801
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,080
Do you think you have the invitation card?

1802
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:50,720
Not necessarily.

1803
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,520
Don't be modest.

1804
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,000
You're the most cheerful.

1805
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,080
But I may not have a card.

1806
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,040
Do you think you have it?

1807
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,120
I think I do.

1808
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,520
You just said no.

1809
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,800
If I say yes, you do.

1810
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,560
Aren't you disappointed if I say no?

1811
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,200
But I know who likes you.

1812
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,080
Who likes me?

1813
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,360
I said there are two houses.

1814
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,160
They have feelings for you.

1815
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,040
That's impossible.

1816
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,240
Don't do this.

1817
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,480
I really didn't feel it.

1818
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,640
I think there might be.

1819
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,280
Go ahead.

1820
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,880
Tell me who it is.

1821
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:20,880
I don't think he...

1822
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,440
he didn't say anything.

1823
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,280
All the topics

1824
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,400
Today.

1825
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,440
That's all for today.

1826
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,760
I think

1827
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,000
Harry...

1828
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,800
No, he doesn't.

1829
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,960
If not, it's a map.

1830
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,160
I think

1831
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,480
is like this.

1832
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,160
No.

1833
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,640
He will answer my words.

1834
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,440
Tu is my roommate.

1835
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,080
Just ask?

1836
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,600
Yes, I was talking about this with Tu.

1837
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,360
Then Tu Tu guessed me.

1838
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:49,800
Do you know

1839
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,920
Guess who my crush is.

1840
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:52,480
Who is it?

1841
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,520
Tu Tu thought you were my guest.

1842
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,600
Tu thinks you like me.

1843
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,560
Yes, it's funny.

1844
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,520
Because when we play games,

1845
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,720
when we play games.

1846
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,840
You love to pick up my words.

1847
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,880
I love to pick you up.

1848
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,040
No.

1849
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,280
And sometimes,

1850
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,080
you call me by my full name.

1851
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:09,800
You scared me.

1852
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,560
Show your brothers.

1853
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,440
Show your brothers

1854
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:12,480
Go out and freeze me.
Show your brothers

1855
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,040
Go out and freeze me.

1856
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,160
He Wenxin.

1857
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,120
No.

1858
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,080
subconsciously.

1859
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,400
That's my problem.

1860
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,880
But I think you did well today.

1861
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,320
You're quite natural.

1862
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,000
I think you're more natural

1863
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,840
than the interview.

1864
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,360
Loosen it.

1865
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,160
You and

1866
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,880
Yuanyuan is in charge.

1867
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,680
Who am I controlling the scene with?

1868
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:39,600
Not Yuanyuan.

1869
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,080
A map.

1870
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,440
When playing games,

1871
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,680
when we play games,

1872
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,480
Can you tell?

1873
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,640
Someone likes drawing.

1874
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,440
It's too obvious.

1875
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,880
I don't like it.

1876
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,600
Not like.

1877
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,840
I just liked him at first sight.

1878
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,360
No.

1879
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,600
It's just a game that will hit a car.

1880
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,640
I think girls

1881
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,720
are not sure about her feelings.

1882
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,720
Oh no.

1883
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,680
But boys...

1884
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,920
I think you and Tu

1885
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,680
a little bit.

1886
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,720
Do you know who I am?

1887
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,400
I think it's obvious.

1888
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:06,960
Who is it?

1889
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,240
Hua.

1890
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,120
The drawing is also a guess.

1891
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,600
Aren't you Hua?

1892
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,360
I'm not good on my first day.

1893
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,080
You have to stick to your choice.

1894
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,760
We haven't started yet.

1895
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,280
I think we need to get along.

1896
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,120
Congratulations.

1897
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,880
You got a card.

1898
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,400
Really?

1899
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,520
Yes.

1900
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:36,640
Let me help you.

1901
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,400
No.

1902
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,520
Are you peeping?

1903
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,160
Let's watch it together.

1904
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:42,800
No.

1905
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,560
No, this.

1906
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,120
You're so curious.

1907
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,600
Good.

1908
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,920
Congratulations.

1909
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,080
I didn't expect that I would have one.

1910
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,000
To be honest,

1911
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,560
Because I think they are all handsome.

1912
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,360
You're handsome too.

1913
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,120
No.

1914
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,440
I can go on a date tomorrow.

1915
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:03,560
Yes.

1916
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,800
You can go on a date tomorrow.

1917
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,680
Show your brother.

1918
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,040
It's my turn.

1919
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,080
I look forward to it.

1920
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,040
You must be cute when you were young.

1921
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,600
Look forward to me.

1922
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,760
Look at my childhood.

1923
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,080
You really love sleeping.

1924
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:30,440
Yes.

1925
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,400
This is when I'm sleeping.

1926
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,000
Such big eyes

1927
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,080
It's still big now

1928
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,520
His eyes are really big.

1929
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,960
Dark eyes.

1930
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:46,840
Yes

1931
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,120
This was taken by my mom

1932
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,400
in Zhuhai.

1933
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,600
This is an art photo of my childhood.

1934
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:00,880
So cute.

1935
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,840
So pretty.

1936
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,440
What a familiar hairstyle.

1937
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,720
Dora.

1938
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,080
Dora!

1939
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,400
Dora!

1940
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,880
Dora.

1941
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:16,680
It's trendy.

1942
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,680
Frowning bangs.

1943
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,080
Yes.

1944
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,960
I don't have bangs anymore.

1945
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,280
This is the same as you.

1946
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:22,680
wearing a wig.

1947
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,040
Me? Yes.

1948
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,600
Mom wig

1949
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,200
Yes, my mom came back.

1950
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,240
She was wearing a wig

1951
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,880
and took her wig.

1952
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,560
When I was young,

1953
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,280
I learned a little dance.

1954
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,920
This is also the graduation photo

1955
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,600
This is a graduation photo

1956
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,280
It's pretty.

1957
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,360
It's pretty.

1958
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:48,840
Skiing

1959
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,760
This is skiing.

1960
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,320
So

1961
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,160
I said we were here.

1962
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,240
we could ski here,

1963
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,600
it would be good.

1964
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,080
And this is...

1965
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,600
When I was in Taiwan, China,

1966
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,880
in Taiwan, China.

1967
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,320
Try the makeup.

1968
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,840
Start your own business.

1969
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,720
It's comfortable to open a small shop.

1970
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:12,920
Very professional.

1971
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,440
Yes.

1972
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,840
The most beautiful person in the world

1973
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,040
Yes.

1974
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:17,720
Hello.

1975
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,600
I really want to tell you

1976
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,000
you are the most important person in my life.

1977
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,800
Beautiful.

1978
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,840
generous,

1979
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:24,800
and considerate.

1980
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,960
All the good words in the world

1981
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,920
can describe you.

1982
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,200
We grew up together

1983
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,160
and grew up together.

1984
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,560
You're not like your family.

1985
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,440
like your family.

1986
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,800
You always make fun of me.

1987
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,720
and do childish things with me.

1988
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,040
From catching ants

1989
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,120
raise turtles,

1990
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,200
and play house with flowers and grass.

1991
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,480
My favorite is after school this weekend.

1992
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,560
after school.

1993
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,600
You like taro flavor.

1994
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,680
I like strawberry flavor.

1995
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,800
We can't finish it.

1996
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,360
So you always compromise

1997
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,560
and drink strawberry flavor with me.

1998
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,440
When I was young,

1999
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,720
you grew up with me.

2000
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,560
has been deeply engraved in my memory.

2001
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,520
If you ask me

2002
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,040
the most unforgettable thing for you

2003
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,560
I think it was that time.

2004
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,760
I had a minor surgery

2005
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,600
for personal reasons.

2006
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,280
One day, the adults were not home.

2007
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,680
You took a leave to take care of me.

2008
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,360
Our family asked us

2009
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,720
to have dinner at the aunt next door.

2010
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,200
But she went out for something.

2011
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,760
It's not nutritious to order takeout.

2012
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,560
You can't cook.

2013
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,640
made me nutritious food.

2014
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,240
I didn't know how to cook at that time

2015
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,640
Now I know

2016
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:22,880
I know it now.

2017
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,360
I learned to cook online

2018
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,160
Looking at your busy back in the kitchen

2019
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,320
I'll remove the fishy smell

2020
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,320
Cut the vegetables carefully later

2021
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,680
When you put the meat in the pot,

2022
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,160
I forgot to cut the side dishes

2023
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,880
and took out the green onion, ginger and chili in a hurry.

2024
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,600
I was so scared watching you from behind

2025
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,040
but I couldn’t help.

2026
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,880
When the last dish is served,

2027
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,160
you feel relieved.

2028
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,920
You wiped the sweat on your forehead and said

2029
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,600
I've never cooked for anyone in my life.

2030
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,480
You're the first one.

2031
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,840
My parents haven't eaten it yet.

2032
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,960
I was very happy.

2033
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,440
Is this part "Chef Little Fugui"?

2034
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,560
It seems all my worries are gone.

2035
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,600
But I regretted the first bite.

2036
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,880
Too much soy sauce

2037
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,520
The meat turned black.

2038
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,920
Potato shredded slices mixed

2039
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,680
The cabbage is stir-fried.

2040
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,960
I'll argue with you

2041
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,640
You can't get married if you do this.

2042
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,520
You said it's fine.

2043
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,160
If you can't get married, stay at home forever.

2044
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,200
I'll cook you bad meals every day.

2045
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,440
Although the dishes are unforgettable,

2046
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,120
your words comforted me.

2047
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,240
This comfort makes me

2048
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,680
in puberty.

2049
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,960
and conflicts.

2050
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,360
You always guide me patiently

2051
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,400
face problems one after another.

2052
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,800
In my memory, you didn't teach me much.

2053
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,080
but more importantly divertizing.

2054
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,320
and affect my personality.

2055
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,600
Let me smile like you

2056
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,920
sunny and considerate.

2057
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,760
and always full of energy.

2058
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,920
Behind these shining energy,

2059
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:42,280
I know there are many heartaches

2060
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,680
when you grow up.

2061
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,520
We both know

2062
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,480
our family is a bit special.

2063
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:50,880
Don't cry.

2064
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,760
They don't seem to care about

2065
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,760
your strengths.

2066
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,760
are affected by

2067
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,480
tenacious concepts of men over women.

2068
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,440
I can feel it every family gathering.

2069
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:20,200
You're facing the sex trials of adults.

2070
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,760
Wait.

2071
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,200
I didn't expect

2072
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,760
my brother would say

2073
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,400
in the album.

2074
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,120
Hua read her brother.

2075
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,600
When I wrote to her,

2076
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,560
she mentioned that there might be

2077
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,920
in our family.

2078
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,800
She is still so optimistic

2079
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,800
and outgoing.

2080
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,000
I think she must be

2081
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,960
must be very strong.

2082
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,280
When you respond to each other cheerfully,

2083
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,600
they feel extremely uncomfortable.

2084
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,720
Everyone wants to be loved by their family equally.

2085
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,120
But because of me,

2086
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,160
because of me.

2087
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,680
I can clearly feel

2088
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,520
that this is how

2089
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,240
is formed slowly.

2090
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,200
I also saw clearly

2091
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,000
your fragile side

2092
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,880
your fragile side.

2093
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,880
You always consume more.

2094
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:27,560
No matter what happens,

2095
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,280
you have to find the reason.

2096
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,080
Not only in love,

2097
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,680
but also in life.

2098
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,760
Once you fell down,

2099
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,320
you went to the hospital to treat your wound

2100
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,400
and solve the dispute.

2101
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,120
If this happens again,

2102
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:40,720
I hope

2103
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,760
stop thinking about solving it yourself.

2104
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,160
Just tell me

2105
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,560
I can carry you to the hospital

2106
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,520
and help you solve everything.

2107
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,800
Lastly, I want to say it out loud.

2108
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,000
You're the best person in the world.

2109
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,040
You're like a gift.

2110
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,000
Be more confident.

2111
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,080
and less internal consumption.

2112
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,840
You don't have to feel sorry

2113
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:09,760
for others' kindness.

2114
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,120
Sorry.

2115
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:11,680
I feel burdened.

2116
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,560
You deserve to be loved.

2117
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,600
Straighten your back.

2118
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,160
and embrace everything that belongs to you.

2119
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,440
and pursue what you like bravely.

2120
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,400
You brought me along when I was young.

2121
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,720
Now, I'll protect you.

2122
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,560
I'll always be behind you

2123
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,680
as your protector.

2124
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,640
Thank you.

2125
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,080
The last signature is

2126
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,040
to get married behind your back.

2127
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,200
Because there is

2128
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,880
There's a custom when we get married.

2129
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,280
Well,

2130
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:38,800
to get married secretly.

2131
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,640
The closest man.

2132
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,840
She rarely cries.

2133
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,360
She rarely cries

2134
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,280
in front of so many people.

2135
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,320
Because she is

2136
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,080
who can hold herself back.

2137
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:51,920
I think crying

2138
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,520
is a kind of emotional vent.

2139
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,560
so that I can

2140
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,880
find the right way

2141
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,160
to let

2142
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,560
the burden of your daily life.

2143
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,200
Show your brothers.

2144
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,600
I'm really tired today.

2145
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,640
Finally (you)

2146
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,040
I'm telling you, I'm suffocating.

2147
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,280
You first?

2148
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,280
You go first.

2149
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,320
Okay.

2150
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:29,240
I think she looks very beautiful

2151
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,080
and amazing.

2152
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,080
She is a very kind person.

2153
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,640
Sometimes,

2154
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,800
a little fragile.

2155
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,280
But she will be strong

2156
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,040
through her appearance

2157
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,800
to hide

2158
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,800
little thoughts.

2159
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,080
is too considerate.

2160
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,080
and sometimes

2161
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:49,960
the person I feel.

2162
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,440
You punk.

2163
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,560
You're so eloquent.

2164
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,720
My brother.

2165
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,640
He looks like a sheep.

2166
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,160
but a big wolf in his heart.

2167
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,040
On the outside,

2168
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,600
harmless.

2169
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,000
But in fact, Xiaojiu and his thoughts

2170
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,920
including the dark side.

2171
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,360
in fact.

2172
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,600
I've smeared more people.

2173
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,400
I can still control him.

2174
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,600
I can control him.

2175
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,840
The first impression she gave me

2176
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,600
she must smile a lot.

2177
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,080
and be optimistic

2178
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,680
is optimistic.

2179
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:23,760
I'm not sure

2180
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,560
the first side.

2181
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:25,320
In my mind,

2182
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,480
in my memory.

2183
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,960
So cute.

2184
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:28,880
White and fat.

2185
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:32,840
So cute.

2186
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:33,880
I want to pinch it.

2187
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,120
Because I knew at that time

2188
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,040
I wanted a boy at home.

2189
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,680
So when the result comes,

2190
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,440
I've already prepared myself.

2191
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,760
there won't be

2192
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,400
Besides,

2193
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,240
I really like kids.

2194
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,280
When I knew he was my younger brother,

2195
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:51,720
he was really cute.

2196
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,280
I love recording his

2197
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,040
in my album software.

2198
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,480
I may not have the most photos.

2199
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,240
He can take most of his childhood photos.

2200
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:09,480
I think

2201
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,560
we are very close.

2202
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,040
We never fought.

2203
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,680
Although I'm so much older than her,

2204
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,520
our work

2205
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,360
or in different directions.

2206
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:21,840
But my communication with her

2207
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,840
is really zero.

2208
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,040
He kissed me cute when I was young.

2209
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,120
Bye.

2210
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,320
I'll miss you.

2211
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,560
I'm leaving. Kiss me.

2212
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,720
Stand here and kiss me.

2213
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,680
Sit there and kiss me.

2214
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,600
Since I was a kid.

2215
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,560
Now that you've grown up,

2216
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,560
Let go.

2217
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,240
She asked me to kiss her when she was young.

2218
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,000
When she was young,

2219
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,160
when she asked me to leave,

2220
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,400
You don't want to?

2221
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,680
Every time you say I'm leaving,

2222
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:44,440
you didn't kiss me?

2223
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,480
You wanted to kiss me.

2224
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,480
So at that time,

2225
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,160
it might have become a habit.

2226
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,440
You don't want it?

2227
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,640
Did I force you?

2228
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,840
But when you grow up,

2229
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,520
there was no such thing.

2230
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,120
After all,

2231
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,280
I remember a few years ago,

2232
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,360
I forced him to kiss me.

2233
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,120
He was so embarrassed.

2234
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:58,680
He...

2235
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:00,960
After all, he's so big.

2236
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:01,200
Right

2237
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,560
But now I know how to hug

2238
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,400
Just hug

2239
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,120
Yes.

2240
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,200
She always

2241
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,080
help me

2242
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,400
sensitive topics.

2243
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,120
My family may often say that

2244
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,240
I may not be manly

2245
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:13,760
or something like that.

2246
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,600
Maybe they think

2247
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,600
too many women around me.

2248
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,720
She didn't mean to

2249
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,640
to hurt you.

2250
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,240
but to let you know

2251
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,880
They think that's what they meant.

2252
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,480
But in my opinion,

2253
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,000
it hurts some self-esteem in my childhood.

2254
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:28,680
or something.

2255
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,040
Actually my sister could

2256
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,400
at that time.

2257
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,360
I would tell them

2258
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,320
and tell me in private.

2259
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,200
Be yourself.

2260
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,800
Don't force yourself.

2261
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,520
Just grow up happily.

2262
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,320
I think the manliness is

2263
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,320
the pillar of our family.

2264
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,040
can lift up the sky

2265
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,600
or protect

2266
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,920
and protect.

2267
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,880
I think that's the real manliness.

2268
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,360
Yes.

2269
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,560
We are half-siblings.

2270
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,160
a family.

2271
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:07,680
Hello.

2272
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,600
I'm Hua's mother.

2273
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,560
Hello.

2274
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,960
I'm Yu's mom.

2275
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,480
Dad is a handsome man.

2276
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,960
My dad is actually an all-rounder.

2277
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,920
What are you talking about?

2278
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:24,200
And the mechanical workshop can do anything.

2279
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,040
He will take me to the competition.

2280
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,160
and put me behind him.

2281
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,840
and then the front wheel.

2282
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,520
Back wheels.

2283
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,440
Drifting

2284
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,360
(He shook me around.)

2285
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,120
Because her dad

2286
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,920
He's very ambitious.

2287
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,200
He doesn't want me to get involved in his business.

2288
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,720
And I

2289
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,640
I have some ideas

2290
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:47,240
and his work.

2291
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,720
As a woman,

2292
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,120
as a woman,

2293
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,120
I just want to

2294
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:57,200
for the rest of my life.

2295
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,200
But I don't want to quarrel every day.

2296
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,400
and cry.

2297
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,520
Then...

2298
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,480
we chose to divorce.

2299
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:21,160
I divorced her dad.

2300
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,520
But I never

2301
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,920
in front of a kid.

2302
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:31,000
Her dad is so handsome.

2303
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,160
Kind.

2304
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,800
I was young back then.

2305
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,720
I was young and immature.

2306
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:41,280
He insisted on getting a divorce.

2307
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,480
That's why

2308
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,720
to grow up.

2309
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,920
When I was young, I thought my dad had an impact on me.

2310
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,160
my dad had nothing to do

2311
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,440
it doesn't affect me at all.

2312
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,840
After I grew up,

2313
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,680
I think my insecurity

2314
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,920
and sensitive.

2315
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:04,400
may also come from

2316
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,400
the lack of father's love since childhood.

2317
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,560
I've never...

2318
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:08,840
including now,

2319
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,640
I'm actually allergic to romance.

2320
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,720
I think it was formed when I was young.

2321
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,600
Because I don't think anyone will surprise me.

2322
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,880
No expectations, no disappointment.

2323
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:18,920
I've always felt that way.

2324
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,800
Because elementary school and junior high school

2325
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,920
basically boarding.

2326
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,880
So I've been quite independent since I was a kid.

2327
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,480
My family life

2328
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,800
in my family.

2329
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,440
After college, it's because of work.

2330
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,920
I moved.

2331
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,840
I feel like I'm always moving.

2332
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:37,840
Well,

2333
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,920
I want to have my own home.

2334
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,640
After the divorce,

2335
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,160
I went to Guangzhou.

2336
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,640
When I left Ze for the first time,

2337
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,000
she came to see me off.

2338
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,760
She cried heartbroken.

2339
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,840
She grabbed my box and said,

2340
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,160
"Mom."

2341
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,200
I want my mom.

2342
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,800
This scene has always been in my heart.

2343
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,080
I'll call my mom.

2344
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,440
And...

2345
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,960
my mom's phone number

2346
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:17,800
It hasn't changed,

2347
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,480
but I couldn't get through.

2348
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,680
Every time I called,

2349
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:23,000
I remember a smooth part.

2350
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:23,640
It's...

2351
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,000
Hello.

2352
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,360
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

2353
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,280
(If you need someone to call back,)

2354
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,360
China Telecom from Hunan Province.

2355
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,920
(Mobile users of China, please dial 1259.)

2356
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,430
Add each other's phone number.

2357
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:31,200
This part

2358
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,800
in my mind.

2359
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,470
Because

2360
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,480
every time I called,

2361
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,880
Because he called me in Guangzhou.

2362
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,040
and called my phone,

2363
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,030
Then you have to add a zero

2364
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:44,990
to get through.

2365
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:46,560
Because my mom

2366
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,560
very frugal.

2367
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:50,750
are all like this.

2368
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:53,280
She didn't tell her the zero.

2369
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,230
So I've been regretful.

2370
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,360
Sometimes,

2371
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,230
she wants to call me the most,

2372
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:00,670
When she heard my voice,

2373
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:02,040
I wasn't by her side.

2374
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,320
I felt guilty.

2375
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,400
I feel sorry for her.

2376
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,160
Yes.

2377
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,760
The happiest time

2378
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,360
is that she comes back every year.

2379
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,040
Because she seldom comes back.

2380
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:24,640
She comes back every year to celebrate the Spring Festival.

2381
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,880
I'm so excited every time I see her.

2382
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,000
I want my mom to remember me.

2383
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,160
when I was the prettiest.

2384
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:31,550
I wear pretty clothes every year

2385
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:33,400
But that's a spring dress

2386
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:37,470
Wearing a denim jacket in winter

2387
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,680
It's wearing

2388
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,840
that was blue when I was young.

2389
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,720
It's not cotton shoes below.

2390
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,870
She's wearing single shoes.

2391
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,750
When I saw her,

2392
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:51,760
when I saw her.

2393
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,720
Mom.

2394
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,520
I saw it from afar.

2395
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,120
and ran over.

2396
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,600
She was heartbroken when she saw it.

2397
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,240
But I want to show her

2398
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:58,720
to her.

2399
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,360
The most exciting thing is reunion.

2400
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,320
I'm most afraid of parting with her.

2401
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:06,880
She would ask my mom

2402
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,720
where my mom would sleep tonight.

2403
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,510
Is she on the train tonight?

2404
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:13,520
I asked my mom

2405
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,960
What does she eat?

2406
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,310
I don't have to take ten yuan from my mom.

2407
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:20,480
I asked my mom to buy more delicious food.

2408
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:24,000
Later, my mom told me this.

2409
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,880
I was so touched.

2410
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:26,750
To be honest,

2411
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,720
So sensible

2412
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:32,280
I sleep with my mom every time I go back.

2413
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,320
And my mom is still willing to kiss me.

2414
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,400
She kisses me when she sees me.

2415
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:38,640
Hugging my face and kissing.

2416
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:47,200
Because we didn't spend much time together

2417
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,350
in childhood.

2418
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:50,640
So when I grow up,

2419
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:54,080
I cherish every meeting.

2420
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:54,960
Hello, everyone.

2421
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,510
I'm Yu's mom.

2422
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:58,200
and Xiaomei's mother.

2423
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,480
We're from Changsha, Hunan.

2424
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:03,200
She gets along with me

2425
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,560
like friends.

2426
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,800
Maybe it's because she's too young

2427
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,990
So she's quite

2428
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:09,630
with me.

2429
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:10,840
Every weekend,

2430
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,150
every weekend.

2431
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:13,630
Watching a movie?

2432
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:15,360
and play with my friends and friends.

2433
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,440
She didn't teach me much.

2434
01:32:18,110 --> 01:32:20,320
She will influence me quietly

2435
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,280
She always supports me

2436
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,760
she always supported my idea

2437
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:25,560
and gave me

2438
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,230
and do everything she can

2439
01:32:27,230 --> 01:32:28,640
to provide me.

2440
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:29,560
Actually,

2441
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,550
sometimes I call her by her full name.

2442
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:34,840
I think he'll never grow up.

2443
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:38,200
But in his heart,

2444
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,040
very sensible.

2445
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:44,880
My first impression of my dad

2446
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,600
he was different from other men.

2447
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:48,830
He was attracted

2448
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:51,760
by this mature charm.

2449
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:56,800
Actually, Yu's dad was my first love.

2450
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,800
I was with him in my twenties.

2451
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:03,070
For a girl,

2452
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:07,870
when I established my view of love,

2453
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:09,950
my dad entered my life.

2454
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:11,440
and Yu.

2455
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:22,720
But

2456
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,080
a harmonious atmosphere.

2457
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,080
This kind of warm scene

2458
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,680
last long.

2459
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,040
When Yu was one year old,

2460
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,080
my dad got sick.

2461
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,760
When he was four,

2462
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,200
he passed away.

2463
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:36,830
Yes.

2464
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,680
After dad left,

2465
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,480
the atmosphere in my hometown

2466
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,110
will be touching.

2467
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,960
Then I brought my child

2468
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,600
to Changsha alone.

2469
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,240
Since Yu was a freshman,

2470
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,040
when we were seven,

2471
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,670
we lived in Changsha.

2472
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:13,880
and study.

2473
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:14,880
My child is very young.

2474
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:16,960
I can't

2475
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,520
let other kids

2476
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,960
know he doesn't have a father.

2477
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,150
I'm afraid...

2478
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:22,720
He's just a kid.

2479
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,150
He'll make fun of him.

2480
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:26,520
or him.

2481
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:30,720
Then we reached a consensus.

2482
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:34,270
We won't tell others in a tacit way.

2483
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:36,160
How is dad?

2484
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,390
It's not easy for me.

2485
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:43,760
I don't know how to fill in

2486
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,040
I don't know how to fill in my father's column.

2487
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,400
But I still write my dad's name.

2488
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,960
My number is on my dad's column.

2489
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,560
Because the first person he contacted

2490
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,190
is dad.

2491
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,560
Then I left

2492
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,000
another number.

2493
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,760
I'll use two numbers.

2494
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:01,240
Yes.

2495
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,880
When I realized

2496
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,280
this love is gone,

2497
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,880
I may think if he is here,

2498
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:10,910
I would imagine

2499
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:13,200
if it will be a better result.

2500
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,840
I have many families around me.

2501
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:16,440
are happy and happy.

2502
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,080
I think

2503
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:19,360
when I visit them,

2504
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,600
I would think

2505
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,640
if he was my dad,

2506
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,830
if my dad was like that,

2507
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:28,670
will he make me happier

2508
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:30,000
and happier?

2509
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,710
Will my mom be

2510
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:32,800
be happier?

2511
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,360
I just need someone to rely on.

2512
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,670
instead of the shoulder.

2513
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:37,680
I think like this.

2514
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,320
Although

2515
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,960
our family is not a normal family

2516
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,310
is very complete.

2517
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,240
A corner is missing.

2518
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,840
But I think our family

2519
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,960
is a loving family.

2520
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,920
I think

2521
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,390
get along so well now.

2522
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:57,400
most of the credit comes from my siblings.

2523
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,120
She was very nice to me.

2524
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,400
and took good care of me.

2525
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,040
as my own.

2526
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,480
The most memorable thing is

2527
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,720
I was at my grandmother's house.

2528
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,160
It was already midnight.

2529
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,950
I found that I had a fever.

2530
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:12,800
Grandma can't go.

2531
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,000
My weight...

2532
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,150
Then I called my brother and mom.

2533
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:18,080
Ten minutes.

2534
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,680
she appeared in front of my house and knocked.

2535
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:21,120
and carried me on her back.

2536
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,070
and knock on the door of the small clinic.

2537
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:24,400
Because our medical conditions

2538
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,240
wasn't very advanced.

2539
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:26,800
Basically, our county

2540
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,960
is a small clinic.

2541
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,280
It was already midnight.

2542
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,800
So I had to knock one by one.

2543
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,590
Then find the IV and give me an injection.

2544
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:36,000
and accompany me.

2545
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,200
This is the most memorable thing.

2546
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:37,880
And my grandma

2547
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,120
my grandma told me.

2548
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:47,680
I used to be Mrs. Xiang.

2549
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,560
Then I became Mummy Xiang.

2550
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:51,550
I remember the first time

2551
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:52,480
when I called her mom,

2552
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,200
she was cooking for us.

2553
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,070
She kept shouting

2554
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:56,600
I was behind and patted her.

2555
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,000
Nanny Xiang.

2556
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,680
Can I call you mum in the future?

2557
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,680
Of course.

2558
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,240
I think the image of a child

2559
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:06,520
a mom may wear an apron

2560
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,920
and cook delicious food for her.

2561
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,430
Actually, when I heard

2562
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,720
my responsibility to her

2563
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,230
my responsibility to her

2564
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:16,640
I think this child

2565
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,120
I must love her

2566
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,000
and love her.

2567
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,480
My mom told me

2568
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,080
we need to

2569
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,640
we need to love each other.

2570
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:30,400
Mom often taught him to love sister

2571
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,230
Be good to sister.

2572
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:31,760
Yes.

2573
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,520
Anyway, he always reminds us.

2574
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,040
to engrave our genes.

2575
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:41,920
Sister Wang Yin-cheol sleeps with me.

2576
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,320
I'll sleep with you if you dance.

2577
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:55,000
I think after my dad passed away,

2578
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,190
after dad passed away.

2579
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,760
There's more than one person.

2580
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,960
My grandma

2581
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:00,560
my mother,

2582
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:01,600
and my brother's mom.

2583
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:04,400
Although there's a corner missing,

2584
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:05,790
I think this part

2585
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:07,200
has made up

2586
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,200
in other ways.

2587
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,400
and even beyond it.

2588
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:14,750
Just be yourself.

2589
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:16,510
Don't feel too burdened.

2590
01:38:16,510 --> 01:38:17,600
Laugh if you want.

2591
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:19,480
No matter how much corners of your mouth are,

2592
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,320
just smile.

2593
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,310
As long as you're happy.

2594
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:23,920
Let your true self attract those who love you.

2595
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:28,400
Wish her success

2596
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,950
in this room

2597
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:32,800
who can match you.

2598
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,640
If you can't find him,

2599
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:35,070
It's okay.

2600
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:35,800
I'm here.

2601
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,400
Because our family

2602
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:41,560
So my younger brother

2603
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,360
in life

2604
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,760
as a man.

2605
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,000
I am

2606
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,710
very insecure.

2607
01:38:47,710 --> 01:38:50,840
But he gives me a great sense of security.

2608
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,560
Like he asked me before,

2609
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:57,120
What if

2610
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,040
no one likes you in the house?

2611
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,830
I said it was okay.

2612
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:01,760
In the corner,

2613
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,160
in the corner.

2614
01:39:04,510 --> 01:39:08,160
I hope she can find

2615
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:12,670
who can hold her in her hand.

2616
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:13,880
as a treasure.

2617
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,240
Of course, if none of you

2618
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,590
who you really want to be with,

2619
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:20,030
Then go home.

2620
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,590
We'll wait for you at home.

2621
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,680
I'm telling you, I'm suffocating.

2622
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,480
Let me take a rest.

2623
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,000
Close the door.

2624
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:45,280
We are like

2625
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,160
like agents.

2626
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:49,080
What is this?

2627
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,800
A letter.

2628
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,400
We received that message today.

2629
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,320
Like me.

2630
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:57,880
give my brother to the man I like.

2631
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:58,840
Someone likes you.

2632
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:00,350
So you gave me this letter.

2633
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:03,440
Is there a day you like?

2634
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:04,600
Today?

2635
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,710
Yes.

2636
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,590
Who do you think

2637
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:12,160
For now,

2638
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,630
which one do you think is better?

2639
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:15,680
Who is easier to get along with?

2640
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:17,150
I think...

2641
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:18,560
Soup.

2642
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,120
But he is E.

2643
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,640
He doesn't talk.

2644
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:23,120
Yes.

2645
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:24,800
My roommate just guessed

2646
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,750
he said Susu seemed to have feelings for me.

2647
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:27,960
What about himself?

2648
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:28,760
He...

2649
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,240
I'm not telling you.

2650
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,680
I still can't tell you.

2651
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:33,150
Why not?

2652
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:33,880
I can't say that.

2653
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:34,430
Just discussing.

2654
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:35,280
I'm your sister.

2655
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,000
Why can't I tell you?

2656
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:36,670
Hurry up.

2657
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:38,840
Xiao Ling.

2658
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:39,600
Yes.

2659
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,200
Because he thinks Xiaoling is pretty.

2660
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:41,790
And...

2661
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,200
Very high.

2662
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:44,760
But I asked him

2663
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,750
I said you like I (introverted).

2664
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,480
or E?

2665
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,670
He said he likes E.

2666
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:49,760
But Xiaoling is an introvert.

2667
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,280
Yeah, Xiaoling is pure.

2668
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:53,950
I think after getting along,

2669
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:55,800
after getting along.

2670
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,470
Actually, I want to know

2671
01:40:57,470 --> 01:40:58,960
who they like

2672
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,160
I like a little.

2673
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:02,880
Find out

2674
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,120
who the first impression is.

2675
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,600
I went to ask about girls.

2676
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,760
Let's go for a walk.

2677
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:09,630
Yes, ask around.

2678
01:41:09,630 --> 01:41:11,320
Fatty has found out anyway.

2679
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,560
Yes, Fatty found out.

2680
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,880
Ask about the soup and Harry.

2681
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:18,270
I'll ask Su Xinxin for you.

2682
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:25,880
Who's going?

2683
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:27,640
Me.

2684
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,760
Let's go together.

2685
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:29,600
Let's go.

2686
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:43,840
It's a long page.

2687
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,480
I saw it.

2688
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:46,110
Please read it.

2689
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,280
Give me a freestyle.

2690
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:49,200
Read it.

2691
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,910
From today onwards,

2692
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:57,680
in an anonymous way.

2693
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:00,120
And send the message.

2694
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:03,200
You need to complete it in one space.

2695
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,200
Text messages are personal secrets.

2696
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,000
No discussion.

2697
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,110
Be serious and sincere.

2698
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:35,230
I didn't know who to vote for.

2699
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:36,280
The three of them

2700
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:37,520
Tu Tu, Fatty, Harry,

2701
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,040
I really want to know.

2702
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,400
But if I have to choose,

2703
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,870
I want to choose

2704
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:45,360
to talk about.

2705
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,160
Because I feel more relaxed.

2706
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:48,640
and happier.

2707
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:40,720
I was a little anxious at first.

2708
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,590
Nervous? Maybe I'm fat.

2709
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:45,080
The three of them are really handsome.

2710
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:47,840
The picture looks sunny.

2711
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:48,480
Harry

2712
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,240
I saw it today.

2713
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:50,840
I think

2714
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,480
especially when he cooks.

2715
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,120
No need to say the soup.

2716
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,000
He's handsome at first sight.

2717
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,910
He's handsome.

2718
01:43:54,910 --> 01:43:56,400
And he has great experience.

2719
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,600
and has high education.

2720
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,840
I think he must get the most votes.

2721
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,320
I guess it's from Susu.

2722
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:19,960
She's quite happy.

2723
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:20,600
I remember

2724
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:22,400
familiar language.

2725
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:23,960
She usually says

2726
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,360
if you are

2727
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,840
See if you have the ability

2728
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,520
to study in Tsinghua.

2729
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,640
So you’re 1.9 meters.

2730
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:33,120
Yes.

2731
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:40,670
The soup impressed me.

2732
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:42,800
First, he’s from Tsinghua.

2733
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,270
Second, he’s 1.9 meters.

2734
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:47,920
I can feel that

2735
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,720
he's usually a quiet person.

2736
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:51,680
But he's talking about what he loves.

2737
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:52,920
and his school,

2738
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,270
he was talking about

2739
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:56,480
about his experience.

2740
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:57,880
I want to know more about

2741
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:59,000
I wanted to know more about him.

2742
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,040
So I sent this message to Soup.

2743
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,560
I guess it was soup.

2744
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:15,600
Because when we were in the car,

2745
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,680
we were listening to music together.

2746
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:19,390
And

2747
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:20,760
we looked through

2748
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,800
the growth album,

2749
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,560
he mentioned that he practiced sports.

2750
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,000
So I think

2751
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,080
the soup must be sent to me.

2752
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,480
I sent it to Susu.

2753
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:34,720
After all, my first impression is more interested in her.

2754
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,830
She's kind of

2755
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:38,720
a little special to me today.

2756
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:40,000
When I was in the car,

2757
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,920
she gave me her earphone.

2758
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:42,080
and listen to it together.

2759
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:54,320
I think it's either Xin

2760
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,640
or Xiaoling.

2761
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,160
Because when I talk to them today,

2762
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,680
more.

2763
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:03,320
I haven't figured it out.

2764
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:06,320
I guess it can't be Hua.

2765
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:12,440
The message I sent today

2766
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,470
to Harry.

2767
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:18,110
I have a new feeling about him today.

2768
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:19,920
Maybe what I said to him today

2769
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:20,800
to him today.

2770
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,360
And yesterday I thought

2771
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,240
he's hard to communicate with.

2772
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:26,880
I think it's easy to communicate today.

2773
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,880
When we were talking a lot,

2774
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,480
I received a message about your feelings today.

2775
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:40,510
But I didn't understand it.

2776
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:45,040
I only understand the last sentence.

2777
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,000
I do have feelings for him.

2778
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,150
Maybe Harry.

2779
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,030
Today's message

2780
01:46:56,030 --> 01:46:57,150
I chose Xinxin.

2781
01:46:57,150 --> 01:46:58,800
After a day with me,

2782
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,400
I did get to know more.

2783
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:03,680
So I can try to know more.

2784
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,240
What are you laughing at?

2785
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,790
Did you see my phone?

2786
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:16,510
No.

2787
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:17,150
It's quiet.

2788
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:17,720
I want to laugh.

2789
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:20,160
You're good at

2790
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:21,400
It's good.

2791
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:22,270
I can't see it at all.

2792
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:24,560
The screen is the best.

2793
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:27,070
It's clear.

2794
01:47:28,670 --> 01:47:30,270
Just kidding.

2795
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:41,560
The message I received today

2796
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:42,520
I really can't guess

2797
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,600
who sent this message to me.

2798
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,750
Because I think

2799
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:50,400
Susu may have some hints.

2800
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,870
I'm quite confused.

2801
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I sent you a message

2802
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:56,670
to Tu.

2803
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,080
Because our majors

2804
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,320
is similar.

2805
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:01,150
I also think

2806
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:04,240
a relaxed person.

2807
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:06,960
So I think drawing may be

2808
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,200
I want to know more about

2809
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,200
and get to know

2810
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,390
such a candidate.

2811
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,840
I guess it's a map.

2812
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,880
Because he said

2813
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,430
I wanted to go skiing with you.

2814
01:48:22,430 --> 01:48:24,280
Because when we talked

2815
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:24,920
in the piano,

2816
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:26,040
we talked about hobbies.

2817
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,040
Then I said,

2818
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,160
I actually like outdoor.

2819
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,360
I like skiing.

2820
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,040
I only know how to use double boards.

2821
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:31,320
I don't know how to play alone.

2822
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32,190
I can't do it alone.

2823
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,240
So I think

2824
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:37,720
these two are related.

2825
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,480
So I guess it's a map.

2826
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,830
I'm quite happy.

2827
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,030
I sent Xiao Ling

2828
01:48:44,030 --> 01:48:45,950
to Xiao Ling.

2829
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:46,800
I think Xiaoling

2830
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,080
is very compatible

2831
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:50,110
are very compatible.

2832
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:01,950
Flower.

2833
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,760
My reaction was Hua.

2834
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:07,710
Because she told me this before.

2835
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:08,600
So at that moment,

2836
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,000
when I saw that text,

2837
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,280
I thought it was Flower.

2838
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,280
She must be happy.

2839
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:16,080
You can't keep your mouth shut

2840
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,040
the corners of your mouth can't be suppressed.

2841
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:19,390
There are three handsome guys there.

2842
01:49:19,390 --> 01:49:20,990
I got one.

2843
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:22,000
I think

2844
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,440
I'm more competitive.

2845
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,590
I voted for Fatty because

2846
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:33,280
I think his emotional value today

2847
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,440
is really full.

2848
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:38,320
It makes me happy and comfortable.

2849
01:49:44,030 --> 01:49:45,400
I think it should be Fatty today.

2850
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:47,230
sent me a love message.

2851
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:49,440
He bought me a cup.

2852
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,000
He asked me to choose the color.

2853
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:57,920
I sent this message to Hua.

2854
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,240
I feel more comfortable

2855
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,310
with Hua.

2856
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:02,360
We can go shopping

2857
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,760
including when we're cooking.

2858
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:05,920
We have great chemistry.

2859
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,800
So I think my feelings for her

2860
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,150
more.

2861
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:10,960
I think Hua can guess

2862
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,680
when she receives that text.

2863
01:50:25,470 --> 01:50:26,200
My brother

2864
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,240
received a message.

2865
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:29,600
I was so happy.

2866
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:31,920
I wanted to see him.

2867
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:34,000
I think he must be happy.

2868
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,390
This is bad.

2869
01:50:35,390 --> 01:50:37,520
I think it might be Hua.

2870
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,600
When we were together today,

2871
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,440
I can feel

2872
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:43,760
Hua and my brother interact more.

2873
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:51,640
At the moment,

2874
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,470
I wonder who it is.

2875
01:50:53,470 --> 01:50:55,070
I'm a little confused.

2876
01:50:55,390 --> 01:50:56,600
I don't know if it's a map

2877
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:58,160
or Harry.

2878
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,080
I'm having a headache.

2879
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:00,960
I don't know who it is.

2880
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,800
I guess Harry.

2881
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,320
Harry

2882
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,720
chatting with me.

2883
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:14,000
I don't know.

2884
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,240
he just made friends with me.

2885
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:18,320
Making friends?

2886
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,160
Or...

2887
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,720
It's hard to say.

2888
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,920
A little surprise

2889
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:32,440
I thought he would receive more soup.

2890
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,040
I think the person who texted him

2891
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:35,320
is Susu.

2892
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:37,600
Because Sue

2893
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,200
The person who gave me

2894
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,160
to me yesterday.

2895
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,160
When I found out

2896
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:52,720
when I got the message,

2897
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,840
I was already thinking about a storm.

2898
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:56,560
I was wondering who it was.

2899
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:56,990
To be honest,

2900
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:57,630
I really don't know

2901
01:51:57,630 --> 01:52:00,320
how attractive my brothers are.

2902
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:02,560
I really don't know

2903
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,710
I really don't understand.

2904
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,760
Because when I saw them talking,

2905
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,310
I think Xiaoling's eyes

2906
01:52:17,310 --> 01:52:18,880
is shining.

2907
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:19,680
Very happy.

2908
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:20,830
And my eyes

2909
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:22,000
are shining.

2910
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,440
We get along well.

2911
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:31,550
I think the soup will choose her.

2912
01:52:31,550 --> 01:52:32,190
Because yesterday,

2913
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:33,120
Truth or Dare,

2914
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:33,560
Soup said

2915
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:36,120
his first impression of my sister was the best.

2916
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,710
Because I want to gossip about my brothers.

2917
01:52:59,710 --> 01:53:01,880
Who sent him a message

2918
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:05,400
or he expressed his feelings for someone.

2919
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,520
Okay.

2920
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,160
Good morning.

2921
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:27,440
Let's start today's topic.

2922
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:29,920
I applied.

2923
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,360
for a chat.

2924
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,400
Actually, I wanted to ask you directly.

2925
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,120
but I felt there were too many people.

2926
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:36,640
Who did you send it to?

2927
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,470
The one beside me.

2928
01:53:37,470 --> 01:53:38,520
Xin.

2929
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,280
Pay attention to the question today.

2930
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:42,720
Who sent it to you?

2931
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:43,710
No.

2932
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:44,720
Isn't it anonymous?

2933
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,270
Who sent it to you?

2934
01:53:46,270 --> 01:53:49,360
I guess the soup

2935
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,160
is written.

2936
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,320
Tell me first.

2937
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:53,310
But both of us are ambiguous.

2938
01:53:53,310 --> 01:53:54,590
He sent

2939
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:56,120
if you are also interested

2940
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,560
or sports,

2941
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:58,960
I think we can try

2942
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:00,000
to get to know each other.

2943
01:54:01,150 --> 01:54:02,960
Who else?

2944
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,550
Yes.

2945
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:04,990
Because I think

2946
01:54:04,990 --> 01:54:06,200
He only talked to me.

2947
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:07,550
Because he doesn't talk much.

2948
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:08,440
He talks a lot.

2949
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:09,760
Not much to the opposite sex.

2950
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,120
Yes, we are close.

2951
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:13,440
You two seem to know each other.

2952
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:14,840
for ten years.

2953
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:16,400
very familiar.

2954
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:17,600
I think he's your brother.

2955
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,200
He doesn't talk much to men.

2956
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:23,480
And I think...

2957
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:24,280
I personally think

2958
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:25,920
he sent it to me because

2959
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,600
he only had contact with me.

2960
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:30,720
Because we listened to songs in the car.

2961
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:32,400
We played a game yesterday

2962
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:33,760
I mean...

2963
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:37,120
Who do you like?

2964
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:38,200
Let's play Truth or Dare.

2965
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:39,600
He said he likes you.

2966
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:40,800
It's only the first day.

2967
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,480
It's not a good impression.

2968
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,550
I want to get in touch.

2969
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:45,080
Then I asked why.

2970
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:45,470
Tell me.

2971
01:54:45,470 --> 01:54:46,160
When you play games,

2972
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,190
when you play games.

2973
01:54:48,190 --> 01:54:48,960
That's great.

2974
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,480
You asked me why.

2975
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:51,520
Of course.

2976
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,480
Of course.

2977
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:55,550
I think the reason is in the car.

2978
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:57,280
I was going to listen to the song.

2979
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:58,270
Then I asked him

2980
01:54:58,270 --> 01:54:58,960
if he wanted to listen.

2981
01:54:58,960 --> 01:54:59,800
But you have to know

2982
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:00,350
At that time,

2983
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:02,750
the four of us were in another car.

2984
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:04,240
But he said

2985
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,310
he wanted to take that car.

2986
01:55:05,310 --> 01:55:07,230
It's not because there's no seat.

2987
01:55:07,230 --> 01:55:07,960
Actually there are.

2988
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:09,200
There are two seats behind.

2989
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:11,040
But I don't know what he's thinking.

2990
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,950
Don't flatter yourself.

2991
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,280
Write your diary.

2992
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:26,040
Yes.

2993
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:27,280
I need a notebook.

2994
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,080
Let's go.

2995
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,240
Let's write it down here.

2996
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:02,560
You scared me.

2997
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:03,600
You scared me.

2998
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:04,440
Want something to eat?

2999
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:05,720
Freshly made sandwich

3000
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:06,400
Eat.

3001
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:07,120
Just a little.

3002
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:07,760
Because I'm too late.

3003
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,360
Take a bite.

3004
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:24,560
It's finally our first date.

3005
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,110
I'm looking forward to it.

3006
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,790
I think my card is right.

3007
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:32,800
To be honest, I'm looking forward to it.

3008
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,000
But a little worried

3009
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:36,480
A little nervous.

3010
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:38,840
Because I'm afraid we might be cold.

3011
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:41,040
We might not have anything to talk about.

3012
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:42,640
Get out.

3013
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:43,550
Bye, baby.

3014
01:57:43,550 --> 01:57:44,480
Bye.

3015
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,680
The person I love

3016
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:33,240
Hello.

3017
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:35,200
I waited so long for you.

3018
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:36,990
A long time?

3019
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:37,600
Not really.

3020
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:38,400
Sorry.

3021
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,360
It's okay.

3022
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,440
When I saw Susu,

3023
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:43,710
I was right.

3024
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:44,670
Good.

3025
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:51,040
You don't know

3026
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:52,800
It's me.

3027
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:54,880
I knew it was you.

3028
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:55,320
No.

3029
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,150
It's my card.

3030
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:58,110
I know.

3031
01:58:58,110 --> 01:59:00,000
How did you know it was from me?

3032
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,680
Maybe I hope it's from you.

3033
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:06,590
I was the first one to give it to you.

3034
01:59:07,070 --> 01:59:08,560
You guessed it was me.

3035
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:11,480
I knew I invited you.

3036
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,280
Is that what you thought?

3037
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:18,800
Of course.

3038
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:22,590
I'm the hero charge.

3039
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:23,200
I'm the first

3040
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,030
Well

3041
01:59:24,030 --> 01:59:26,750
After everyone came to my room,

3042
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:27,870
I think everyone is sitting here.

3043
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:28,830
It's quite awkward.

3044
01:59:28,830 --> 01:59:30,040
After I finished,

3045
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:31,550
I'll give it to you immediately.

3046
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:33,630
You gave it to me casually.

3047
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:35,120
I didn't give it to you casually.

3048
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:36,670
I must have guessed it.

3049
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:38,240
Is it hard to guess?

3050
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,240
What do you mean?

3051
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:43,200
Because I'm very passive.

3052
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:45,470
I need to feel

3053
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:47,440
the signal released by others,

3054
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:50,320
I can contact others.

3055
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:51,120
If I can't feel

3056
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:53,080
any signal from me,

3057
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:56,030
I won't have any contact with him.

3058
01:59:57,630 --> 01:59:59,480
Actually, the sentence you wrote...

3059
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:01,600
If I wrote it,

3060
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,030
I thought about writing that.

3061
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,040
Like me.

3062
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,400
Do you believe that?

3063
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,640
Do you want to experience the winter in Beijing together?

3064
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:10,560
What do you want to do

3065
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:12,280
I wanted to go to Yi He Garden.

3066
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:15,520
I wanted to go to the Shicha Sea

3067
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:16,640
I think so.

3068
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,440
Because there's ice

3069
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:18,750
There's also one in Yi He Garden

3070
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:20,830
And that car is fun

3071
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:21,720
If there's a chance later,

3072
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:22,270
I've never been there.

3073
02:00:22,270 --> 02:00:22,960
I haven't.

3074
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:23,840
You haven't?

3075
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:24,640
It's really fun.

3076
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:27,160
And you bought candied haws there.

3077
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:28,640
it won't melt.

3078
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:30,000
It will freeze hard

3079
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:34,680
It's really fun.

3080
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:38,560
Are you an introvert?

3081
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:40,720
You don't remember?

3082
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:42,160
I remember you're an introvert.

3083
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:43,550
I'm I (introverted) What?

3084
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,040
No, you're ENFP. I'm a candidate.

3085
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:46,590
You...

3086
02:00:46,590 --> 02:00:48,350
I'm not an ENFP.

3087
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:49,680
You got the wrong person.

3088
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:52,160
ISFP.

3089
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:53,040
Yes.

3090
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,520
He's totally different from me.

3091
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:54,840
Yes.

3092
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:55,390
Because I remember you are

3093
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:56,400
ENTJ.

3094
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:57,760
I got the wrong person.

3095
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,960
It's a flower.

3096
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,040
No.

3097
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:04,990
I only remember you.

3098
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:07,000
you two came in after me.

3099
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:07,800
Anyway these two

3100
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:11,840
I'll remember both of us.

3101
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:14,110
Let's eat.

3102
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:15,120
Have you eaten?

3103
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,350
Breakfast.

3104
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:17,120
You must have eaten.

3105
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,240
You got up early.

3106
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:20,800
I ate your sandwich.

3107
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:22,400
Really?

3108
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,440
You didn't have breakfast.

3109
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:34,240
No.

3110
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,600
No one's eating, right?

3111
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:36,080
I don't know.

3112
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:36,670
Let me see.

3113
02:01:36,670 --> 02:01:37,950
I'll find something to eat.

3114
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,510
Have you eaten?

3115
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:41,520
I didn't.

3116
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:42,720
Do you want it?

3117
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:45,400
This should be

3118
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:47,160
Harry for Susu.

3119
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:49,310
Really?

3120
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:51,070
Maybe Susu said no.

3121
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:52,760
I'll have some.

3122
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:53,520
You eat.

3123
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:54,880
It's scary.

3124
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,280
Fruity juice wine

3125
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:18,520
I said I went down to look for it.

3126
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,480
Where's my sandwich?

3127
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,840
I told you to leave it for me.

3128
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,470
I'm sorry.

3129
02:02:25,470 --> 02:02:26,800
I said I was hungry.

3130
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:27,960
I'm really hungry

3131
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:30,430
Let's eat now.

3132
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:31,920
My sandwich

3133
02:02:32,510 --> 02:02:33,200
That's too much.

3134
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:33,760
Is it good?

3135
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:34,480
So

3136
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:36,480
What filling?

3137
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:36,960
Think about it.

3138
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:38,640
Eggs ham

3139
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:41,840
Cucumber tomatoes

3140
02:02:44,350 --> 02:02:45,630
These are all your favorite

3141
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,960
I'll try it when I get back.

3142
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,520
Okay.

3143
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:50,590
Don't draw pastries

3144
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:52,720
I need to learn from my roommate

3145
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:53,920
how to cook

3146
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:55,200
You can't cook anything.

3147
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:57,630
You can't do anything.

3148
02:02:57,630 --> 02:02:59,040
You don't know how to cook instant noodles

3149
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:00,510
I can still cook

3150
02:03:00,510 --> 02:03:01,520
Dumplings

3151
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:02,960
Sure.

3152
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,560
It can float.

3153
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,400
You and I are at the same level.

3154
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:09,240
You won't starve to death.

3155
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:12,240
Because I've been training.

3156
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:14,240
Let's go to class.

3157
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:16,280
You don't have time to go out, do you?

3158
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:17,200
When I was young,

3159
02:03:18,270 --> 02:03:20,480
I could feel that pain every day.

3160
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:23,160
But when I grow up,

3161
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:24,350
Actually,

3162
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:25,240
I think

3163
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:26,200
table tennis and piano

3164
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,000
It's fun.

3165
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,800
Just go out for fun

3166
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:29,600
Something like that.

3167
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,120
I don't know why.

3168
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:32,190
when I was young,

3169
02:03:32,190 --> 02:03:33,400
when I was a kid.

3170
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:36,160
I've learned a lot since I was a kid.

3171
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:38,110
or ping pong.

3172
02:03:38,110 --> 02:03:38,910
I learned a little.

3173
02:03:38,910 --> 02:03:40,240
I learned a little about piano

3174
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:41,600
I also learned flute

3175
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:44,760
But I felt tired when I was a kid.

3176
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:45,880
I wanted to play.

3177
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:47,640
Maybe it's because of my parents.

3178
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:48,240
because they want me

3179
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:49,440
to grow up happily.

3180
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:51,200
They didn't force me to say

3181
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:53,150
you have to hang in there.

3182
02:03:53,150 --> 02:03:56,030
So I tried many things

3183
02:03:56,030 --> 02:03:57,880
I didn't make it to the end.

3184
02:03:59,160 --> 02:03:59,870
You said yesterday

3185
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:01,150
you mentioned yesterday,

3186
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:01,880
I said

3187
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:06,640
Because I envy others

3188
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:08,030
I envy others.

3189
02:04:08,670 --> 02:04:09,760
So you're not working

3190
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:11,800
or leave?

3191
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:12,720
I just graduated.

3192
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:13,880
So

3193
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:15,360
I didn't say clearly

3194
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:18,000
which industry I want to work in.

3195
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,880
I want to try everything.

3196
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:22,910
Because I'm an undergraduate.

3197
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:24,640
Design?

3198
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:25,680
Yes, almost.

3199
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:27,070
But it's not a simple design.

3200
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:28,920
It's fashion media.

3201
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:31,640
You don't know us artists, do you?

3202
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,800
You can.

3203
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,510
Okay.

3204
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:40,480
Take this away.

3205
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:42,360
You want it?

3206
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:43,550
Try it.

3207
02:04:43,550 --> 02:04:44,480
Actually, I...

3208
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:45,240
Take a spoon.

3209
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:49,080
Let me help you.

3210
02:04:49,630 --> 02:04:50,680
Really?

3211
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:53,280
Thank you.

3212
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:55,600
Help those who don't cooperate well.

3213
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:00,600
Really.

3214
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:03,870
I'll show you how to swallow it.

3215
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:05,280
Then you get choked.

3216
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:07,230
You can't talk for five minutes.

3217
02:05:08,350 --> 02:05:08,760
Oh no.

3218
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,000
I don't talk much.

3219
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:10,960
You've become a mute.

3220
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:12,960
No, I'll be embarrassed.

3221
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,280
I remember when we were upstairs yesterday,

3222
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,150
I saw Xiaoling playing the piano.

3223
02:05:21,150 --> 02:05:23,070
I asked if you could play the piano.

3224
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:24,640
You said you couldn't.

3225
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:25,600
But when I turned around,

3226
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:27,070
you played the piano.

3227
02:05:27,070 --> 02:05:28,280
What does this mean?

3228
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:30,270
Humblebrag.

3229
02:05:30,270 --> 02:05:32,280
I thought you were

3230
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,470
to see if we are siblings.

3231
02:05:33,470 --> 02:05:34,960
You think too much.

3232
02:05:36,030 --> 02:05:37,080
No.

3233
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:38,320
So you played it yesterday.

3234
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:41,520
It's Jay Chou's.

3235
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:42,590
A song?

3236
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:44,560
Can you sing?

3237
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,400
Not out of tune, right?

3238
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:46,560
You're being modest again.

3239
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,800
Can you play the piano?

3240
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:48,160
No.

3241
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,520
Then I started playing the piano.

3242
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,390
Next time I won't go off-key.

3243
02:05:51,390 --> 02:05:52,960
I'll sing well next time.

3244
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:53,680
I'm already...

3245
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:54,840
I can't believe it.

3246
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:55,680
Really.

3247
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:57,200
You really didn't sing well.

3248
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:58,640
But you said you weren't out of tune.

3249
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:00,830
I'm out of tune.

3250
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:02,400
As long as you sing happily.

3251
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:03,480
Be happy.

3252
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:05,600
I don't usually sing.

3253
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,600
But I really like to listen to songs.

3254
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,640
I love that song.

3255
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:12,030
Maybe many people don't know

3256
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:12,990
what it's called.

3257
02:06:12,990 --> 02:06:15,390
My Tears Smashed.

3258
02:06:15,390 --> 02:06:16,280
You know?

3259
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:19,550
This is it.

3260
02:06:19,550 --> 02:06:20,350
Yes.

3261
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:20,960
Yes.

3262
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:22,040
I love it.

3263
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:23,160
This is my favorite song.

3264
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:24,880
So sad.

3265
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:29,150
The flowers are pretty too.

3266
02:06:29,150 --> 02:06:29,520
What is this?

3267
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:30,270
Stars?

3268
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:32,160
Stars?

3269
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:43,360
Are you singing?

3270
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:45,790
No.

3271
02:06:45,790 --> 02:06:47,520
What are you singing?

3272
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:50,110
You're singing Jay Chou.

3273
02:06:50,110 --> 02:06:51,760
You're singing "My Tears Smashed".

3274
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:54,880
I'm a little hungry.

3275
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:57,790
Why are you hungry?

3276
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:03,440
I don't know who ate it.

3277
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:04,600
Why am I hungry?

3278
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:07,480
I don't know why I'm hungry.

3279
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:08,990
I'm quite curious.

3280
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,000
This joke

3281
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:13,440
can be said

3282
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:14,560
Oh no.

3283
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:15,390
The sky has collapsed.

3284
02:07:15,390 --> 02:07:16,160
Every day

3285
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:18,270
Every day.

3286
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:19,840
Why am I hungry today?

3287
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:23,320
I don't really care about it.

3288
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:25,200
I just think it's funny.

3289
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:25,950
It's fun.

3290
02:07:25,950 --> 02:07:27,960
I wanted to get closer to him.

3291
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:29,840
So I kept teasing him.

3292
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:36,760
What's your zodiac sign?

3293
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:37,760
I'm Taurus.

3294
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:39,320
Really?

3295
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:40,920
I'm Virgo.

3296
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,200
From September.

3297
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:43,710
I have filters for the Earth Signs.

3298
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:45,760
Good or bad?

3299
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,440
Good filter.

3300
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:48,120
Really.

3301
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:50,240
It's kind of scary when you're not talking.

3302
02:07:51,870 --> 02:07:52,920
Do you know

3303
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:56,560
is Taurus and which constellation matches the best?

3304
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:00,120
Virgo.

3305
02:08:00,990 --> 02:08:01,630
Perfect match.

3306
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:02,590
Go and search.

3307
02:08:02,590 --> 02:08:04,280
What a coincidence.

3308
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:06,480
You do look like an elephant.

3309
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:07,840
You talk too little.

3310
02:08:09,950 --> 02:08:11,710
Because I'm afraid of saying something wrong.

3311
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:12,440
I'm afraid I might say something wrong.

3312
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:13,720
But my mouth is fast.

3313
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:15,680
So my mom always says

3314
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:16,600
my mouth is flying in front.

3315
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:17,200
Your brain is behind you.

3316
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:18,520
I can't catch up.

3317
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:21,680
I haven't decided yet.

3318
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:23,000
I'll say it out.

3319
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:26,240
That's good.

3320
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:27,440
Be happy.

3321
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:28,920
Next time I'll change my phone wallpaper

3322
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,080
Think twice before you act.

3323
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,320
Say less and do more.

3324
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:38,080
You scared me.

3325
02:08:38,430 --> 02:08:38,880
What?

3326
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:39,800
A bug.

3327
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:40,670
Kitten.

3328
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:41,360
What is this?

3329
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,080
Samhwa?

3330
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:42,720
Yes.

3331
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:43,960
Flower.

3332
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,590
That cat was pretty yesterday.

3333
02:08:47,230 --> 02:08:48,440
You didn't feed it.

3334
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:49,400
I think someone has fed it.

3335
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:50,080
I won't go.

3336
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:51,760
I'm afraid it'll suffocate.

3337
02:08:53,150 --> 02:08:54,110
Then it said, "Go home."

3338
02:08:54,110 --> 02:08:54,680
The owner said

3339
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:55,360
Why did you gain two kilograms?

3340
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:57,720
Tu and I fed it two sausages.

3341
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:06,400
It jumped up.

3342
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:07,710
It's rubbing you.

3343
02:09:08,990 --> 02:09:10,270
I want to take a photo for you.

3344
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:11,520
See if you can run.

3345
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,080
Three.

3346
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:18,640
You don't have to look at me.

3347
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:24,960
I'm happy

3348
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:26,680
in Cupid's date.

3349
02:09:27,550 --> 02:09:28,640
Because I think

3350
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:31,800
we know each other's growth experience better.

3351
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:33,950
I think we can get along.

3352
02:09:33,950 --> 02:09:36,080
Maybe we are interested in the same thing.

3353
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:38,750
I think we can

3354
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:40,800
we can continue with the soup.

3355
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,320
more about soup.

3356
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:46,400
Let's go.

3357
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:47,440
Let's go.

3358
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:48,800
Bye, Xiao Hua.

3359
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:50,720
Give me your bag.

3360
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:51,550
I'll hold it for you.

3361
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:02,640
Don't hurt yourself.

3362
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:11,070
You'll hurt yourself.

3363
02:10:11,070 --> 02:10:12,080
It's too high.

3364
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,800
If you want to touch the map,

3365
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:29,310
He's optimistic and cheerful.

3366
02:10:29,310 --> 02:10:30,720
He has something in common with me.

3367
02:10:31,710 --> 02:10:32,990
Cupid's invitation card.

3368
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,590
I filled in Harry.

3369
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:37,360
I hope so.

3370
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:38,320
A map.

3371
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:53,080
Have a seat.

3372
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:55,320
I want to laugh.

3373
02:10:56,510 --> 02:10:58,520
At first, I thought it might be a map.

3374
02:10:58,520 --> 02:10:59,840
but I found it was Harry.

3375
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,310
Okay.

3376
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:10,720
I already ordered.

3377
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:11,550
Wait a moment.

3378
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:12,670
What did you order?

3379
02:11:12,670 --> 02:11:15,280
You don't eat fish, right?

3380
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:16,640
I eat fish.

3381
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,520
You eat fish?

3382
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:20,720
Who doesn't eat fish?

3383
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:21,880
Susu doesn't eat fish.

3384
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:23,760
I don't eat sheep.

3385
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:24,670
I don't eat fish.

3386
02:11:24,670 --> 02:11:25,560
I don't eat blood.

3387
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:26,360
I don't eat pig brain.

3388
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:27,200
Pig brain.

3389
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,320
I said I should avoid the fish.

3390
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:31,320
I didn't order fish.

3391
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:32,240
It's okay.

3392
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:41,470
You're wearing it.

3393
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:42,400
contact lenses?

3394
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:44,120
I wear contact lenses every day.

3395
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:45,360
I can wear contact lenses,

3396
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:46,880
but it's too soft.

3397
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:48,510
So sometimes I can't wear it.

3398
02:11:48,510 --> 02:11:49,400
I can teach you.

3399
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:51,000
I'll wear contact lenses.
Three.

3400
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,510
Wearing contact lenses doesn't make my eyes look bigger.

3401
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:54,040
I don't have big eyes.

3402
02:11:55,230 --> 02:11:56,560
You're thoughtful.

3403
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:57,760
Of course.

3404
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,990
What? Men also have the right to love beauty.

3405
02:12:00,990 --> 02:12:01,680
Of course.

3406
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:03,230
Of course.

3407
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:10,560
How about we talk about that?

3408
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:11,640
Well...

3409
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:14,270
Let's talk about INFJ, right?

3410
02:12:14,270 --> 02:12:16,030
InFJ, you old man.

3411
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:18,400
Why did you say that?

3412
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:20,000
Because the MBTI image

3413
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,200
Well

3414
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:21,840
One has beard.

3415
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:22,720
Like he took a magic stick.

3416
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:23,960
Like Mason.

3417
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:25,080
Yes.

3418
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:26,480
Aren't you an introvert too?

3419
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:27,520
I am.

3420
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:29,360
What's your MBTI image?

3421
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,120
I'm a little butterfly.

3422
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:32,400
Little Butterfly.

3423
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:33,470
I'm an INFP.

3424
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:35,440
You're a butterfly. What does that mean?

3425
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:39,160
sensitive and fragile.

3426
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:41,470
sensitive and fragile.

3427
02:12:41,470 --> 02:12:42,480
This is...

3428
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:43,550
a general concept

3429
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:46,520
a little bit.

3430
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,160
I heard about you from your roommate.

3431
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:49,520
Aren't you very consuming?

3432
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:51,390
I'm not in that state anymore.

3433
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:52,760
Are you still a little butterfly?

3434
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:53,400
Yes.

3435
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:53,880
Why?

3436
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:55,710
You're not a little butterfly

3437
02:12:55,710 --> 02:12:56,600
you won't be a little butterfly.

3438
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:58,590
I'm a powerful little butterfly.

3439
02:12:58,590 --> 02:12:59,480
But I'm still a little butterfly.

3440
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:00,510
In fact,

3441
02:13:00,510 --> 02:13:01,400
has also changed.

3442
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:02,480
After taking off a layer of shell,

3443
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:03,800
I'm a moth now.

3444
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:06,000
Didn't I turn into a butterfly?

3445
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,360
Why did you go back?

3446
02:13:11,390 --> 02:13:12,190
My best friend is

3447
02:13:12,190 --> 02:13:13,400
INFJ.

3448
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:14,110
We just get along.

3449
02:13:14,110 --> 02:13:14,480
To put it bluntly,

3450
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:15,920
Yeah.

3451
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:16,830
They all say I (introverted).

3452
02:13:16,830 --> 02:13:17,760
I know L.

3453
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:20,120
Do you think

3454
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:23,200
Do you know me well?

3455
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:25,520
I don't think

3456
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:28,030
the minefield of me too much.

3457
02:13:28,030 --> 02:13:28,880
or lightning point.

3458
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:32,880
At least not when it's just the two of us.

3459
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,270
It's different when there are many people.

3460
02:13:34,270 --> 02:13:34,910
When there are many people,

3461
02:13:34,910 --> 02:13:36,400
you have to “CHUANG fly” everybody equally.

3462
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:37,630
Yes.

3463
02:13:37,630 --> 02:13:39,160
You look like ENTP.

3464
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:40,280
You don't look like I (introverted).

3465
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:43,390
No. I just like joking.

3466
02:13:43,390 --> 02:13:44,080
Act according to the situation.

3467
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:45,280
Stop if you don't look right.

3468
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:45,880
No more words.

3469
02:13:46,430 --> 02:13:47,040
No more words.

3470
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:47,840
You'll be in trouble if you keep talking.

3471
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:50,360
Hello.

3472
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:51,960
Your special "Miss You".

3473
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:52,600
Enjoy.

3474
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:53,310
Thank you.

3475
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:54,240
Thank you.

3476
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:56,000
I prepared this especially for this date.

3477
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:56,990
I thought we could

3478
02:13:56,990 --> 02:13:59,870
have a chat while drinking.

3479
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:01,400
Choose one.

3480
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:02,270
This one.

3481
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:04,670
It's my favorite.

3482
02:14:04,670 --> 02:14:06,160
Peach-flavored fruit cube.

3483
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,680
It smells like fruit.

3484
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:10,800
How did you make it?

3485
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:13,880
This is mixed with white grape-flavored fruit.

3486
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:15,550
This is my favorite

3487
02:14:15,550 --> 02:14:16,960
peach flavor.

3488
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:18,880
Cheers.

3489
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:21,120
It tastes good.

3490
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:23,280
Let's try your new wine list next time.

3491
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:24,240
Eat.

3492
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:25,150
Thank you.

3493
02:14:25,790 --> 02:14:26,880
What is this

3494
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,320
This is vegetable soup

3495
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,680
Try it.

3496
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:30,720
Try it.

3497
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:34,080
Here you go.

3498
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:35,120
Thank you.

3499
02:14:35,710 --> 02:14:36,920
You're welcome.

3500
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:37,680
Make yourself at home.

3501
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:38,720
You're too polite.

3502
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:40,510
Are you going back to your room?

3503
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:43,920
Not really.

3504
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:48,830
We need to find something to do.

3505
02:14:48,830 --> 02:14:49,760
Isn't there a badminton?

3506
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:50,800
I want to buy a net.

3507
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:51,840
I don't know where to buy it.

3508
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:52,880
Sure, I want to play badminton too.

3509
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:54,240
But I didn't see the net.

3510
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:55,390
Right?

3511
02:14:55,390 --> 02:14:57,310
You usually

3512
02:14:57,310 --> 02:14:58,400
when you don't have class.

3513
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,470
When I don't have class at school,

3514
02:15:01,470 --> 02:15:02,560
when I don't have class.

3515
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:06,430
There's nothing in your university

3516
02:15:06,430 --> 02:15:07,800
Yes, you major in acting.

3517
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:10,270
I haven't said it yet.

3518
02:15:10,270 --> 02:15:11,390
You already guessed it.

3519
02:15:11,390 --> 02:15:13,080
It's in the album.

3520
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:14,480
Yes, the one I performed

3521
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:15,520
there's "Xiaoling's mom".

3522
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:16,960
Didn't someone raise the sign for you?

3523
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:17,760
Or what?

3524
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:20,990
No.

3525
02:15:20,990 --> 02:15:21,760
I didn't come with you

3526
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:23,550
I didn't come with you

3527
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:25,600
to say hello to you.

3528
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:29,360
Why?

3529
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:30,840
Your photo...

3530
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:32,480
Hua and I were imitating you yesterday.

3531
02:15:33,630 --> 02:15:35,120
This photo

3532
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:38,000
when I first learned how to pretend.

3533
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:40,560
I remember.

3534
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:41,440
That's...

3535
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:43,200
My friend took it for me.

3536
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:44,320
How old were you?

3537
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:47,320
Ten.

3538
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:48,030
16.

3539
02:15:48,030 --> 02:15:49,560
Not too young.

3540
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:50,960
About 15 or 16 years old.

3541
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:53,150
Do you think

3542
02:15:53,150 --> 02:15:53,950
If I let you choose,

3543
02:15:53,950 --> 02:15:55,070
Are you optimistic

3544
02:15:55,070 --> 02:15:56,080
or pessimist?

3545
02:15:56,080 --> 02:15:58,240
I'm definitely a pessimist.

3546
02:15:58,240 --> 02:16:00,000
We're quite alike in this aspect.

3547
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:01,520
Seriously.

3548
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:04,240
But I'm not a little butterfly.

3549
02:16:05,470 --> 02:16:06,360
You're an old man.

3550
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:10,910
I don't think it's awkward to talk to you.

3551
02:16:11,710 --> 02:16:12,000
Why?

3552
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,440
It's awkward to talk to E.

3553
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:15,320
It's a little awkward sometimes.

3554
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:16,830
To be honest,

3555
02:16:16,830 --> 02:16:19,070
I feel awkward

3556
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:20,320
except eating with you.

3557
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:23,040
It's awkward for you to eat with another I.

3558
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:23,520
There's another I (introverted).

3559
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:25,520
It won't be awkward to eat with Susu.

3560
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,200
But

3561
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:27,040
E

3562
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:28,400
it would be awkward.

3563
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:31,000
I'm just a little flustered.

3564
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,600
Except the three of us are E.

3565
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:34,240
It's awkward.

3566
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:36,000
It's just awkward between us.

3567
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,309
It's not awkward to talk with others.

3568
02:16:37,309 --> 02:16:40,350
What do you mean by that?

3569
02:16:40,350 --> 02:16:41,559
But it's okay.

3570
02:16:41,559 --> 02:16:43,360
I'll give it a try.

3571
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:44,000
Okay.

3572
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:46,520
Which one is better?

3573
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:49,680
I think both are delicious.

3574
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:51,389
I'm quite good at ordering.

3575
02:16:51,709 --> 02:16:54,110
I ordered all these signatures. They are all delicious.

3576
02:16:56,350 --> 02:16:56,830
No.

3577
02:16:56,830 --> 02:16:58,840
It's called the recommended dishes.

3578
02:16:59,070 --> 02:16:59,680
Yes.

3579
02:17:03,549 --> 02:17:04,600
I thought about it.

3580
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:07,480
It's a date

3581
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:09,120
eating cakes and desserts.

3582
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:10,400
I'm here to show off meat.

3583
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:12,830
That's more practical than them.

3584
02:17:13,879 --> 02:17:15,120
That makes sense.

3585
02:17:15,709 --> 02:17:17,200
You want to eat meat and cake?

3586
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:17,879
Of course.

3587
02:17:17,879 --> 02:17:19,320
That's great.

3588
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:20,670
What about you?

3589
02:17:20,670 --> 02:17:21,360
What do you think?

3590
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:22,750
Look what I'm holding.

3591
02:17:30,639 --> 02:17:32,400
I'm making sandwiches today.

3592
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:33,469
When did you make sandwiches?

3593
02:17:33,469 --> 02:17:33,840
Why didn't I know?

3594
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:35,480
I woke up in the morning.

3595
02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:36,990
You asked me if I wanted to eat it.

3596
02:17:36,990 --> 02:17:37,879
Then I said I wouldn't eat it.

3597
02:17:37,879 --> 02:17:38,719
Yes.

3598
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:42,080
Who is the most familiar person in the house?

3599
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:42,719
Soup.

3600
02:17:42,719 --> 02:17:43,200
Yes.

3601
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:48,400
If the person he likes

3602
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:50,110
the person he likes is there,

3603
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:50,840
What would you do?

3604
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:52,030
How will you help him?

3605
02:17:52,030 --> 02:17:53,840
I'm straightforward and rude.

3606
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:54,879
I'll give them

3607
02:17:54,879 --> 02:17:56,719
to spend time alone.

3608
02:17:56,719 --> 02:17:57,840
If it were me,

3609
02:17:58,910 --> 02:18:01,120
how can I help him or my brother?

3610
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:03,520
I think I'm trying to create opportunities.

3611
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,360
I'll go

3612
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:06,400
I'll go.

3613
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:07,440
Me too.

3614
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:08,830
Do you think

3615
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:11,840
you should find someone

3616
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:14,160
with a good personality.

3617
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:14,840
For you,

3618
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:16,240
to you.

3619
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:17,469
Maybe

3620
02:18:17,469 --> 02:18:19,480
to argue with you.

3621
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:22,270
The most important thing is that we can get along.

3622
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:23,389
This is what I value the most.

3623
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:27,680
What about you?

3624
02:18:28,639 --> 02:18:29,719
If we just met,

3625
02:18:29,719 --> 02:18:31,680
I'll choose to look good.

3626
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:32,799
Because we're not close.

3627
02:18:32,799 --> 02:18:33,760
We're not very close.

3628
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:34,799
But in the middle stage,

3629
02:18:34,799 --> 02:18:35,600
I think

3630
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:36,510
Because personality

3631
02:18:36,510 --> 02:18:38,590
will take 60 percent.

3632
02:18:38,590 --> 02:18:40,600
I think

3633
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:43,799
I think people in the same frequency

3634
02:18:43,799 --> 02:18:44,350
Yes.

3635
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:46,160
That's more important.

3636
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:46,520
Yes.

3637
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,920
The longer it takes, the more frequency it will be.

3638
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:49,840
Yes, that's right.

3639
02:18:50,559 --> 02:18:52,719
I remember the game we played last night.

3640
02:18:52,719 --> 02:18:54,430
Didn't you say you had a boyfriend?

3641
02:18:55,709 --> 02:18:57,680
You haven't dated since college.

3642
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:58,110
Or...

3643
02:18:58,110 --> 02:18:58,879
Yes.

3644
02:18:58,879 --> 02:19:00,080
I haven't met anyone I like.

3645
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:01,790
We had contact.

3646
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:03,520
We did, but we didn't talk.

3647
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:05,760
What? You don't like it enough? To put it bluntly,

3648
02:19:06,590 --> 02:19:07,870
or you don't like it enough.

3649
02:19:07,870 --> 02:19:08,639
or

3650
02:19:09,559 --> 02:19:10,799
(Things don't work.) Wook out

3651
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:12,280
It's not what I want

3652
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:14,080
No, you're slow to warm up.

3653
02:19:14,879 --> 02:19:17,150
Yes, because I didn't fall in love at first sight.

3654
02:19:18,639 --> 02:19:21,400
I'm 100% the type of love that grows over time.

3655
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:23,870
I said the same thing yesterday.

3656
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:24,280
Yes.

3657
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:25,240
So when I heard you say,

3658
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:26,110
I said he resembles me.

3659
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:28,000
Gosh.

3660
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:33,760
You're done too?

3661
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:35,870
Let's go.

3662
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:37,600
Let's retreat.

3663
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:39,070
What do you mean?

3664
02:19:39,070 --> 02:19:39,709
Retreat.

3665
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:43,200
To be honest, I was quite happy.

3666
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:44,559
At first, I thought

3667
02:19:44,559 --> 02:19:45,469
I met someone

3668
02:19:45,469 --> 02:19:48,510
someone I've only known for a couple of days.

3669
02:19:48,510 --> 02:19:50,840
Then we eat alone

3670
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:52,360
It might be awkward.

3671
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:54,360
But I think

3672
02:19:54,360 --> 02:19:55,960
the atmosphere is relaxing

3673
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:57,600
I think the atmosphere is relaxing.

3674
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:59,160
And we have a lot to talk about.

3675
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:00,360
So I think it's not bad.

3676
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:03,520
Through this date with Xiaoling,

3677
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:05,160
we have many common hobbies.

3678
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:07,280
But different things

3679
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,800
Maybe she told me

3680
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:11,680
that her little butterfly turned into a butterfly

3681
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:13,960
is indeed different from what I thought.

3682
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:16,680
Then I found that we can be friends more.

3683
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:28,400
