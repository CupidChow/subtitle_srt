1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
A party with wild wine

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It's like drinking wild wine

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. It can breathe.

6
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,840
Take part in it on Weibo #Love and Siblings

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
On Weibo. Participant #Love & Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game You'll get a chance to get a surprise reward.

8
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,280
I'm hungry.

9
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,160
Let's eat.

10
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,800
Let's eat.

11
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,200
Let's eat.

12
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,920
Let's go.

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,320
I'll take it.

14
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,560
Luckily, it's not spicy today.

15
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,600
Otherwise, I can't even eat the skewers.

16
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,160
You can't eat spicy food.

17
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,240
Right.

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,200
Soup.

19
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,479
More.

20
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:53,800
No.

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,440
I'll get it myself.

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,560
Hurry.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
Do I understand you?

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,080
You know me.

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,320
Tata.

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,880
Help me get the fruit cube with grapefruit flavor.

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,720
Add some ice to alleviate greasy.

28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,720
Here.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
I also added ice for this lemon

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
And the juice with grapefruit and lemon

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,120
I think it tastes good.

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
Just drink them and mix them.

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,160
They're all good

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,080
Next time we get together,

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,920
when we get together next time.

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,440
Okay.

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,600
Let's have a toast.

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:18,920
Come on.

39
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,560
Okay.

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,880
Cheers.

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,000
The first party.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Happy.

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
It's good.

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,760
It's so good.

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,520
So cool.

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,200
Sing another song.

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,240
OK. Sing one.

48
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,640
Let's welcome the soup.

49
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,120
What?

50
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
ELE YAN's

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,320
I Want to Say.

52
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,920
Can you lower the key?

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,320
Thank you.

54
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,040
No.

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,840
I've asked.

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,440
You can't lower the key.

57
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,040
Then stop singing.

58
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,760
At first, I couldn't tell

59
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,040
which one belongs to.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,600
One of the receivers is soup.

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,520
One is Tom.

62
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,080
I think it might be the Tom.

63
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,840
But there's another supplement.

64
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,920
I haven't sent any supplements lately.

65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,280
I sent the soup.

66
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
Actually, there's a meaning to add one and one.

67
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,840
The first one is

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,640
when he plays the piano.

69
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,040
He's charming.

70
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,920
The second one plus one.

71
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,280
He has

72
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,440
singing to me,

73
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,640
to sing to me.

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,080
So I wrote two plus one.

75
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,280
I added that

76
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,840
the clothes he's wearing today look good on him.

77
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,320
Very cool.

78
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,680
This is what I think.

79
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,760
I sent the message to the soup.

80
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,040
Because first of all, I know

81
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,360
he's good at playing the piano.

82
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,760
and good at playing basketball.

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,520
But I didn't expect him to sing.

84
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,440
In my eyes,

85
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
handsome guys can't sing.

86
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,320
So I sent this message

87
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,800
to him.

88
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,760
to encourage him to sing more.

89
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
I want to be in a relationship.

90
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,480
I want to confess to you.

91
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,520
It's a bit too straightforward.

92
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,360
But I think if I tell her,

93
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,680
if I tell her.

94
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,360
The message she received was...

95
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,720
Xiaoling sent it to me.

96
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
She said she saw the other side of me.

97
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,520
the other side of my dance.

98
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,360
Very cool.

99
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,520
She has a different view of me.

100
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,640
Maybe I am

101
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,120
smile

102
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,080
and cheerful.

103
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,520
But when I dance,

104
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,720
when I dance.

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,159
It's kind of cool.

106
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,560
She might think

107
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,040
my style will change.

108
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,200
I sent a message to Tu Tu today.

109
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,000
I've never seen

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,159
I've never seen.

111
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,480
Today, I saw

112
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,800
I think it's very attractive.

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,280
I guess it's from the map.

114
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,680
I've been texting him for days.

115
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,680
That's why I'm more certain.

116
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,040
Harry sent me

117
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,720
a long text message

118
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,280
to make up for yesterday's mistake.

119
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,920
And I was in a good mood.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,760
Because I've been playing straight.

121
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,720
In my relationship,

122
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,040
is not always like this.

123
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,960
As long as

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,840
a girl like Tata

125
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,880
needs me,

126
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,200
when she needs me.

127
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,240
and my question directly.

128
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,600
and my thoughts directly.

129
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,280
Because I think

130
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,320
if I don't express it directly,

131
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,400
and play straight,

132
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
we might fight and get angry.

133
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,440
So I don't think it's necessary.

134
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,760
I think as long as I can hit it straight,

135
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,520
if I can handle this,

136
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,600
you have to go straight.

137
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,520
Why not?

138
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,040
Right?

139
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,480
Actually,

140
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,240
I don't know who it is.

141
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,520
I sent the message to Tata today.

142
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,799
I was supporting her.

143
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,720
Of course, that's pure friendship.

144
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,400
A support.

145
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,200
We can see that

146
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,440
I'll send it to whoever performs well.

147
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,440
I knew it was Tata.

148
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
Because I'm in the same group with her today.

149
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,000
I think Tata sent me this message

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,800
means

151
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,480
we both did great today.

152
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,000
Maybe the affirmation between partners

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
I sent it to Terri.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,840
There are two reasons.

155
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,160
On one hand,

156
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,200
I should send it to Harry

157
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,960
I should send it to Harry.

158
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,520
But because the day before yesterday,

159
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,800
I wasn't mad at Harry.

160
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,680
I don't think he sent me well.

161
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,720
I wanted to piss Harry off.

162
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,400
On the other hand,

163
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,600
I was with Tae-seo all day.

164
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,560
I didn't really get to know Harry.

165
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
I think I should

166
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,000
to Tae-seo.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,520
Today, I'm going to

168
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,040
with him.

169
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
I think both of them are excellent.

170
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,080
and happy.

171
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm happy to receive Hwa's text.

172
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,360
Today's message was for Tae-seo.

173
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,160
At that time,

174
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,600
he was stylish when walking the model.

175
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,840
It's really eye-catching.

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,760
I had two choices.

177
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,920
One is Tata.

178
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,840
and the other is Flower.

179
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,760
Because this is a sincere message.

180
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,120
I should write it to myself.

181
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,400
interested in.

182
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,360
Tata is really a sister to me.

183
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,480
So I sent the message

184
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,920
to Hua firmly today.

185
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,240
When I was rehearsing today,

186
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,400
I hurt my eyebrows.

187
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,240
She saw

188
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,960
and she cared about me.

189
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,080
My brother didn't receive a message from her.

190
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,640
For the sake,

191
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,920
I feel a little sad

192
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,400
feel a little sad.

193
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,880
We all have feelings.

194
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,520
We don't.

195
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,360
But I think it's normal.

196
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,520
I can't beat them in terms of looks.

197
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,760
It makes sense.

198
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,360
Wake up.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,440
Actually, I thought

200
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,280
he might not receive it today.

201
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,120
Because Tata told me

202
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
I didn't want to send it to him today.

203
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
But I thought she was angry.

204
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,680
she might send it to him.

205
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,960
But she didn't send it to him.

206
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,400
I was also surprised.

207
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,680
and shocked.

208
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,400
I was thinking

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,160
what happened.

210
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,640
Tata didn't send it to him today.

211
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,680
Because she told me

212
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
she wouldn't send it to me.

213
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,080
But she really didn't send it to me.

214
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,440
I was very annoyed.

215
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I didn't say I was unhappy.

216
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,960
But I couldn't figure it out.

217
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,680
He just hung up.

218
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,280
But he didn't receive my message.

219
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
he would be unhappy.

220
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,640
I don't dare to see him.

221
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,560
You can clearly feel

222
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,600
the person sitting next to you

223
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,840
his air pressure dropped.

224
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,480
It feels like a cloud on his head.

225
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,640
on my head.

226
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,240
Let's let Tarri and Tata

227
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,760
to choose.

228
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,600
Close your eyes when it's dark.

229
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,120
What are you doing?

230
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll tell you later.

231
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,200
Don't be sad.

232
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,280
Choose me, right?

233
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,760
Don't peek. I'm leaving.

234
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,800
Nodding?

235
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,040
It's so loud.

236
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,440
Let's go.

237
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,160
My kitty.

238
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,760
Bye.

239
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,280
Let's

240
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,600
Let's go.

241
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,080
Let's go.

242
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,000
Follow them.

243
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
Follow them.

244
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,520
Go home.

245
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,360
You said

246
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,840
You said you wanted to know more about others.

247
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,520
Why did you choose me today?

248
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,680
I won't pick you tomorrow.

249
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,880
But didn't you say

250
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
you want to know more about others?

251
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,440
Since you said so,

252
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,080
I guess you don't miss me that much.

253
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,960
Okay.

254
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,320
Right?

255
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,960
I don't have the right to refuse.

256
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,720
I don't know what to do.

257
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,880
Yes.

258
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
You'd better be.

259
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,600
So did you hesitate?

260
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,960
On the way back with you,

261
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,760
Did you hesitate?

262
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,320
What are you hesitating about?

263
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,560
Choose someone else.

264
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,160
Who should I choose?

265
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,400
Who?

266
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,560
Who do you want to go back with?

267
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,840
Drawing.

268
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,680
Who do you want me to choose?

269
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,320
Go ahead.

270
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,160
Go to sleep.

271
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,120
I'm really going to sleep.

272
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,600
I didn't ask you to choose anyone.

273
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,000
You said you wanted to get in touch.

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I didn't see you.

275
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,680
Again.

276
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,760
I asked yesterday when we were eating

277
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,400
Now on the way home

278
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,480
This is a good chance

279
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,800
to let you

280
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,600
I'm very confident.

281
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
It's up to you.

282
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,360
Mind your own business.

283
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,960
Okay.

284
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,160
The winner is us.

285
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,720
Okay.

286
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,800
We have the right to choose.

287
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,080
Okay.

288
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,720
I can't refuse it.

289
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,000
How about

290
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,720
Try rejecting one.

291
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:36,960
Okay.

292
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,400
The acting master is on.

293
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,320
Yes, the boss is on.

294
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,840
Okay.

295
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
I feel it.

296
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,800
I'm in love.

297
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
I mean feelings.

298
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,800
Okay.

299
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,640
If I'm the winner today,

300
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,720
if I didn't invite you,

301
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,000
if I didn't invite you?

302
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,080
Who will you invite?

303
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,120
I'll think about it.

304
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,120
Who would you invite?

305
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,640
If I didn't invite you,

306
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,680
If, there's no if.

307
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,040
I'm sorry, Poshin guy has spoken.

308
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,800
Will you ignore me?

309
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,000
No.

310
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,160
I'm not a kid like Harry and the others.

311
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,280
How old am I?

312
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,520
So who did you send to before?

313
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
It's the same person.

314
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,960
Xinxin.

315
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,840
Almost like you.

316
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Xinxin.

317
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,880
Really?

318
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,360
Why do you think so?

319
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,000
So who?

320
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,120
Like this?

321
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,360
I didn't see it at all.

322
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,680
I didn't know you two were interacting.

324
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,040
Really?

325
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,760
Yes.

326
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,920
But it's hard to tell.

327
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,840
I think Harry and Tata

328
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
are

329
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,680
I think it's nailed.

330
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,520
Not necessarily.

331
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,880
Tata didn't send it to Harry today.

332
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,000
It's getting interesting.

333
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,960
What are you doing?

334
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,200
Don't be angry.

335
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,440
I'll explain.

336
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,760
Go ahead.

337
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,359
Let me hear it.

338
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,240
I'm listening.

339
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,359
I was with Tae-seo

340
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,280
with Tae-seo all day?

341
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
In the end, Tae-seo and I

342
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,040
with Tae-seo.

343
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,800
Then I...

344
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,040
I thought I could send it to him.

345
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,880
The content I sent him is very normal.

346
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,600
I'm very happy

347
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,560
to get the first place.

348
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,960
We did well.

349
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,000
That's all.

350
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,680
I was thinking to send him the message.

351
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,560
And...

352
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,160
And I'll invite you to ride a car with me.

353
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,680
Yes.

354
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,760
Can we sleep?

355
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,200
I think...

356
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,960
Can we sleep?

357
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,120
Do you want to sleep?

358
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,240
Really? You don't want to talk to me anymore?

359
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,880
You're silent.

360
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,880
I (introverted) people's silence.

361
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,320
No.

362
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,040
Sorry.

363
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,080
I regretted it after I sent it.

364
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
Really?

365
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,400
Do you think my explanation is unreasonable?

366
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,600
It does.

367
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,840
I never said it's unreasonable.

368
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,560
What's wrong?

369
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,760
Why aren't you talking to me?

370
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,520
I don't know what to say.

371
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,000
You don't know what to say. Why?

372
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,600
I don't know what to say.

373
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,640
I just don't know what to say.

374
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,320
It's okay.

375
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,720
Don't regret what you did.

376
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,400
I was not sure

377
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,960
because I never had

378
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,600
with him.

379
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,200
he didn't say a word to me in the car.

380
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,520
I really had no choice.

381
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,520
Don't be like this.

382
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,280
What's wrong with me?

383
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,720
I just don't talk.

384
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,560
What do you want me to do?

385
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,680
I don't know.

386
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,280
what you want me to do to make you forgive me.

387
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,760
I don't know.

388
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,120
Then why don't you send it to me tomorrow?

389
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
To whom?

390
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,320
How would I know?

391
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,240
If you don't send it to me,

392
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
You'll balance.

393
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
So childish?

394
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,600
What are you doing?

395
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,720
I don't know.

396
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,560
I don't know who to ask for help.

397
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,240
Who?

398
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,280
Help you.

399
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,240
Help me.

400
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,960
Help me.

401
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,960
I don't like to talk anyway.

402
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,640
To be honest,

403
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,160
So you don't want to talk to me now?

404
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,240
Go ahead.

405
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,840
How can I tell you if you're in a bad mood?

406
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,800
Sleep.

407
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,560
Lean this back.

408
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,840
I'll lean this back for you.

409
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,880
She kept telling me

410
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,240
she was a passive girl.

411
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,520
She apologized to me.

412
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,600
She explained to me

413
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,200
She kept interacting with me.

414
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,600
I'm relieved.

415
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,120
So you're the one

416
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,760
who can't help apologizing.

417
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,680
Sort of.

418
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm not sure.

419
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,240
Got it.

420
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,960
You don't know.

421
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,160
I might have to cold you for a while.

422
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,640
Who cares?

423
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,840
Okay.

424
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,760
Okay.

425
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,960
Okay.

426
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,840
You don't know.

427
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,680
I got it.

428
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,120
No.

429
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,880
You said it yourself.

430
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,760
I lied to you.

431
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,000
How can you believe a man?

432
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
What did you say?

433
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,720
You're so smart. You can tell it by yourself.

434
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,360
I don't know.

435
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,080
It's true that you asked me to get off.

436
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Then why are you still in the car?

437
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
I like to fight against you.

438
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,440
I don't like it to go your way.

439
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,680
Okay.

440
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,920
Yes, I know you want me to get off.

441
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,840
I won't.

442
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,960
Okay.

443
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
In this case,

444
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,720
there should be

445
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
in your modeling circle.

446
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,840
Why?

447
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,520
You're still single.

448
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,560
I don't like those in the industry.

449
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,920
I have five girlfriends.

450
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,400
You even counted.

451
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,360
One of them is in the same industry.

452
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,960
Nothing else.

453
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,080
Who takes the initiative or you?

454
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,600
Others?

455
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,360
Have you ever thought about taking the initiative?

456
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,720
It's always someone else who takes the initiative.

457
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,520
Okay.

458
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,760
He took the initiative for a while.

459
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,880
I was touched. OK.

460
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,280
After being together, OK.

461
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,040
Because you take the initiative

462
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,360
Then you're in love. Okay.

463
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,360
I started to take the initiative.

464
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,680
Then someone started to lower their head.

465
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,520
Then they broke up.

466
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,480
About this.

467
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,880
Me too.

468
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,280
I always take the initiative.

469
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,880
So others told me

470
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,600
to change.

471
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,880
But it seems

472
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,680
It's not that simple.

473
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Because it's mutual.

474
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,000
Whether it's initiative or passive,

475
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,160
you have to respond

476
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,800
to keep going.

477
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,600
So it's always someone who takes the initiative

478
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,840
and then someone asked you to break up.

479
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,200
Yes, and I got dumped.

480
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,320
Have you thought about the reason?

481
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,840
Maybe you're too proactive

482
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,440
too emotional

483
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,400
Too passive, right?

484
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,080
My friend said

485
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,040
he said you should take the initiative next time.

486
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,440
and say you'll take the initiative.

487
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,720
What did you do to her?

488
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,040
Did you listen to your friend's advice?

489
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:12,840
No.

490
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,640
I did.

491
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,840
I did.

492
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,040
But I think it's a bit...

493
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,720
to change.

494
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,920
I don't know. I don't know.

495
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,160
It seems

496
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,240
We're similar.

497
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,080
When I went back with Tae-seo,

498
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,800
we kept chatting.

499
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,440
It feels like

500
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,520
It's more urgent than our first date.

501
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,000
I'll be happier if we go home together today.

502
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,360
My face is ruined.

503
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,840
I'm fine.

504
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,960
I brought some scars.

505
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,880
It must be a scar.

506
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,280
Go back and apply some medicine.

507
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,320
Did they apply medicine for you?

508
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,120
Yes, I got iodine.

509
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,960
I'll go back.

510
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,160
Is there a fast healing wound?

511
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,600
I think we should go back and apply ice on it.

512
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm worried

513
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,480
his eyelids will swell.

514
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,640
Yes, because your upper eyelid

515
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,120
Yes.

516
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,640
Close your upper eyelid and apply it like this for a while.

517
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,440
Poor thing.

518
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,120
It's cold.

519
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,680
Let's go.

520
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,560
Let's go.

521
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
Let's go.

522
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,400
It's cold.

523
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,640
How can it be so cold?

524
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,840
Tu.

525
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,640
Come up. I need to talk to you.

526
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,040
Coming.

527
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,080
You saw it yesterday.

528
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,800
I was a little out of control.

529
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,080
Then you came to me yesterday and told me

530
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,480
you said it was a comforting message.

531
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,880
She also followed

532
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,480
Well,

533
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,160
My brother says it's a comfort message.

534
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,360
Right?

535
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,520
You saw the same thing today.

536
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,800
I didn't receive it either.

537
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,520
Did she tell you

538
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,800
what text she sent today?

539
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,320
Because she noticed today

540
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,000
your emotions are...

541
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,560
You know?

542
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,840
So,

543
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,840
she felt that my emotions were...

544
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,200
That's why she didn't text me.

545
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,040
Is that what you mean?

546
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,080
Because you ignored her all day today,

547
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,120
I think comforting this person

548
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,680
doesn't mean

549
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,240
a heart message.

550
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,440
And if the two of us

551
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,760
between us,

552
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,480
you two can talk face to face.

553
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,080
I really support you to talk face to face.

554
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,240
Let me

555
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,560
I need to compare the information to it.

556
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,240
From her actions,

557
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,840
she can understand my feelings.

558
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,560
She can feel your feelings for her.

559
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,760
And she can feel

560
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,000
Tae-ri's feelings for her.

561
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,280
Actually, that day,

562
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Objectively speaking,

563
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,840
she might love you more.

564
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,000
But Tae-ri's siblings weren't there that day.

565
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,720
She wanted to comfort him.

566
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,640
Because she thinks

567
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,040
Text messages are not just

568
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,800
It may be just a way to express your feelings.

569
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,760
But do you know

570
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,320
why I was so angry?

571
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,400
It's because the day before,

572
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,840
I was just about to confess my love.

573
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,880
Except that I didn't say it directly,

574
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,440
I've already made it very obvious.

575
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,120
I asked her a question

576
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
I asked her a question.

577
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,160
I said you were

578
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,760
two boys treat you well at the same time.

579
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,680
Are you a person who treats you differently

580
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,320
or the same?

581
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,800
She told me she answered discrimination.

582
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,800
But now when I see her behavior,

583
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,880
she doesn't treat me differently.

584
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,920
She accepted it at the same time.

585
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,200
She treated it differently today.

586
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,520
It's different today.

587
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,080
So today,

588
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,440
I'm talking about

589
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,160
But you sent me another message.

590
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,600
She wanted to send it to me today,

591
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,880
but she saw me ignoring her today.

592
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,240
Yes.

593
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,880
So she didn't send me

594
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,000
because of her pride.

595
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
Is that what you think?

596
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It's not for face.

597
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,520
It's just a little...

598
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,960
She's a bit...

599
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,040
and emotional.

600
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,160
Yeah, I think you two are really...

601
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,240
You two talk alone.

602
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,720
Really?

603
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,400
For this matter,

604
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,800
some things need to be

605
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,000
Don't pass it around.

606
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,920
Actually, I'll think about it.

607
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,520
I'll think about it.

608
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,240
Don't think about it. Go find her now.

609
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,880
I'll call her.

610
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,360
No.

611
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,880
Let's talk right away.

612
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,360
No need.

613
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,760
Do you want to talk?

614
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,080
No.

615
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,720
No.

616
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,160
Do you want to talk?

617
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:00,880
I don't want to talk now.

618
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,520
You must want to talk.

619
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't want to talk now.

620
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,920
Call him over.

621
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,480
I don't want to talk.

622
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,680
What are you doing?

623
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,200
Are you applying a mask?

624
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,960
I'm not going to talk to Fatty.

625
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,240
I think we should...

626
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,040
I have nothing to say.

627
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,200
Talk?

628
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,480
Let's talk now.

629
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,040
No.

630
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,840
I think I should take a break.

631
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,040
I think I'll get angry.

632
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
Can we talk?

633
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,360
Can you stay here?

634
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,840
Yes.

635
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,560
Why did he run away?

636
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,400
So weak.

637
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,680
Fatty, come up.

638
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,600
What?

639
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,280
Come up.

640
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,840
Tomorrow.

641
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,200
I haven't written my diary yet.

642
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,880
Tomorrow.

643
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,280
Let's not talk then.

644
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,080
What's there to think about?

645
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,600
Tomorrow.

646
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,240
I'm done.

647
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,000
Your breath is so short.

648
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,760
Three, two, one.

649
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,320
Again.

650
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,560
Raise your legs.

651
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,080
Raise your legs.

652
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,400
800 pacesetters go to the north slope

653
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,040
Then the white stone tower and white stone set up. Come on.

654
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,880
OK.

655
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,440
One, two, three, go.

656
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,280
Eight hundred.

657
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,360
Slow down.

658
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,720
800 pacesetters go to the north slope

659
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,440
White stone tower and white stone set.

660
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,600
White stones build white tower

661
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,800
White tower and white stones.

662
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,040
Set up the white tower.

663
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
The white tower is white and big.

664
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,840
Excuse me.

665
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,800
Do you want glutinous rice balls or wontons?

666
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,040
Wonton.

667
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm fine with anything.

668
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:33,920
Choose one.

669
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,360
Wonton.

670
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,480
You just want to choose wontons.

671
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,720
Tata, have breakfast?

672
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,480
Yes.

673
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,400
How about I make glutinous rice balls together? The fastest.

674
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,120
Sure.

675
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,840
I didn't wash the dishes.

676
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,360
Put it here. I can wash it.

677
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,400
I'll finish it in a few minutes.

678
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,880
You want to make it harder for me?

679
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,560
Wash your hands.

680
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,520
I didn't touch your stuff.

681
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,480
Take this. Hurry up.

682
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,520
It's hot.

683
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,160
One minute difference.

684
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,640
I know you're hungry.

685
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,720
Don't worry.

686
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,600
Can you wash the spoon for me first?

687
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,680
I'll be back soon.

688
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,160
Don't ask for anything.

689
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,240
I can do it myself.

690
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,080
It's okay. I can do it myself.

691
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,920
This one?

692
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,040
Just one.

693
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,160
Okay, I'll do it.

694
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,040
Really?

695
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,480
I won't forgive you if you hurt me.

696
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,400
Hua, let me tell you.

697
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,040
We are enemies now.

698
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,840
What else to say?

699
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,240
I don't like this atmosphere.

700
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,280
I think we should make it clear.

701
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,240
Actually not.

702
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,080
We live together every day.

703
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,240
See you every day.

704
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,560
It's actually quite awkward

705
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,680
Men who work are the most handsome

706
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,480
Better.

707
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,720
Do you have a problem with praising me?

708
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,560
Here comes Master Hua.

709
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,240
Okay.

710
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,159
Does it fit?

711
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,719
Is it suitable?

712
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,159
Take out the trash.

713
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,199
Throw these two garbage out.

714
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,280
and get a new trash bag.

715
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,280
Slow down.

716
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,560
Come here.

717
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,040
Look at handsome guys.

718
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,719
Shut up.

719
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,920
Have some dumplings

720
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,120
What did you do

721
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,560
Should I just eat it?

722
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,199
Really

723
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,080
It was supposed to be for them.

724
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
You eat first.

725
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,520
Okay.

726
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,040
Take it away.

727
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,920
Thank you.

728
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,880
It's delicious.

729
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,360
Okay.

730
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,760
Don't put it in the pool.

731
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,960
Today is the day.

732
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,760
Okay.

733
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,160
Where should I put it?

734
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,960
Put it inside.

735
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,680
It doesn't matter.

736
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,000
Eat slowly next time.

737
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,640
Thank you.

738
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,960
I can't hold this.

739
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,360
You need to hold it and pour it.

740
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,480
The small pot is big.

741
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,280
I'll wash while you eat.

742
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,200
I can't finish.

743
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,960
He said to put it aside.

744
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,240
You insisted on coming.

745
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,640
You wash first.

746
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,720
I'll kill you!

747
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,200
Wait.

748
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,440
I don't want to hear your nagging.

749
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,760
Is there anyone else?

750
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,400
What do you want?

751
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,200
I want to wash some fruits.

752
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,320
Wait.

753
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,200
Wait.

754
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,760
Okay.

755
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,480
Don't come again.

756
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,760
Increase the workload of fat.

757
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,560
I'll teach you how to play the piano.

758
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,880
What do you want to play?

759
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,920
I want to play something simple and pleasant.

760
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,560
I'll learn "Happy Birthday to You".

761
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,520
I want to compete with Hua.

762
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,520
You want to play two hands and one hand.

763
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:31,960
Two hands.

764
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,520
Play it.

765
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,840
You play the right hand first.

766
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,200
Okay. Which side?

767
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,320
Here.

768
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,400
Put it on.

769
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,320
Ta-da.

770
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,320
Dadadadadadadada.

771
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,520
Thumb.

772
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,600
Thumb

773
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,680
Then

774
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,280
Boom.

775
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,600
Ta.

776
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,280
Shake hair.

777
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,200
Shake hair.

778
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,920
Yes.

779
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,200
This should be demoted.

780
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,280
This is bang.

781
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,360
Come down

782
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,080
It's coming down.

783
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,160
Let's go.

784
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,840
Let's play Eagle and Chicken later.

785
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,600
Who is the eagle?

786
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,680
The soup is like an eagle.

787
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,520
An athlete is an eagle.

788
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Let's go to the grass.

789
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,600
I'm afraid you'll fall.

790
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,760
No.

791
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,800
Your team is too long.

792
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,200
It's easy to catch it.

793
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,600
Let's see

794
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,880
Let's see who gets caught.

795
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,960
Action.

796
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,360
Let's go.

797
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,880
Wait.

798
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,280
Are you okay?

799
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,800
I got caught.

800
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,040
No.

801
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,760
This is too slippery.

802
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,960
It's inside

803
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,080
Let's go to the grass.

804
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,440
I'm afraid you'll fall.

805
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,240
Now there are two eagles.

806
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,200
Two eagles?

807
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,720
Why are there two?

808
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,480
Why are you grabbing me?

809
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,320
What the hell?

810
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,960
Who is the eagle?

811
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,600
You three hawks.

812
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,800
You three hawks.

813
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,840
Did you catch them?

814
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,880
I got Susu.

815
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,400
Susu, let's go.

816
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,480
Catch Susu.

817
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,720
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

818
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,160
No.

819
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,200
I don't know.

820
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,920
I'm a little tired.

821
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,800
Tired.

822
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,560
I got you.

823
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,080
No.

824
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,960
You have to hold it.

825
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,920
Your hands are so long.

826
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,680
Arm stretching, right?

827
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,000
Touching it means catching it.

828
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
Go down.

829
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,560
I'm tired.

830
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:23,920
Are you okay?

831
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,920
Are you okay?

832
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,680
I don't hug him

833
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,200
I don't have any physical contact.

834
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,800
It's not bad

835
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,280
to be loved.

836
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,320
Good.

837
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,440
Another one.

838
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,200
The chicken mother was caught.

839
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,800
Come on.

840
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,720
No.

841
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,960
I ran away from home.

842
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,000
Hide ball.

843
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,840
Help me!

844
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,520
It's so scary.

845
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,040
I want to be with you.

846
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,440
I want to hit someone.

847
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,480
I'll take off my clothes.

848
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,240
Someone is serious.

849
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
What's going on?

850
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,760
Master Hua.

851
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,480
You hurt your sister so badly.

852
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,560
Hit her hard.

853
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,960
The flower looks pale.

854
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,600
So tired.

855
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Really tired

856
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,680
Take a break.

857
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,320
I got a text.

858
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,640
From today onwards,

859
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,440
will be upgraded to House of Feelings.

860
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,080
Management inviters

861
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,600
We can only invite one man in.

862
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,360
It only opens once a day.

863
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,560
No time limit.

864
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,240
We can't refuse the invited man.

865
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,520
I want to say something.

866
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,280
I didn't have time to say it yesterday.

867
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,040
It could be two people.

868
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,680
more private space.

869
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,160
We can talk about something else.

870
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,040
You can ask

871
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,480
or questions you want to answer,

872
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,800
So choose the House of Feelings.

873
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,520
Go ahead.

874
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,640
Let me ask you.

875
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
If I don't apply,

876
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,000
Will you?

877
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,120
Why?

878
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,920
I just want to say

879
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,880
what happened last night.

880
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,560
Go ahead.

881
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,160
You go first.

882
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,840
After sending that message,

883
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,280
I think I'm more sure of my feelings.

884
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,800
After you texted me,

885
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,640
What do you mean?

886
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,320
I regret it.

887
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,800
Yes.

888
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,520
I don't think I should do this.

889
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,880
I just feel

890
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,640
against my will.

891
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,920
I just want to say

892
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,840
we were in the car yesterday.

893
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,000
in the car.

894
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,480
You're talking to me.

895
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,040
and ignored you.

896
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,000
Then I apologize to you.

897
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,280
I thought about

898
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,520
to take a ride with me.

899
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,160
You might not even ride with me.

900
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,200
If I'm angry,

901
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,160
Why should I sit for you?

902
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,960
Normally,

903
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,440
I won't sit with you then.

904
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,560
I'll definitely go back to my room.

905
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,800
I'll still look for you.

906
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,720
Really?

907
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,920
But if you keep ignoring me,

908
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,600
I have to find Susu.

909
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,680
Why?

910
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,200
What for?

911
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,560
Su Zihao.

912
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,280
I have to let her know.

913
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,360
What should we do?

914
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,720
Then I found that she didn't tell her.

915
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,640
what you told her.

916
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,800
She forgot.

917
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,280
every time

918
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,200
she was going to tell me

919
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,360
was interrupted by something else.

920
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:57,800
After that,

921
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,640
she forgot.

922
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,400
It's not reliable at all.

923
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,720
But if it were me,

924
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,240
I won't go back with you.

925
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,320
That's terrible.

926
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,600
What are you talking about?

927
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,480
I won't sit with you.

928
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,200
You're like...

929
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,480
Double standard.

930
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,560
You've never had a younger one than yourself.

931
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,720
Yes.

932
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,400
I hate boys younger than me.

933
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,840
I can feel that you are younger than me.

934
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,480
I'm definitely younger than you.

935
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,480
But your psychological age

936
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,800
is quite mature.

937
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,480
So I can understand

938
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,160
age is not important.

939
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,000
But you need to find someone

940
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,760
someone older than you.

941
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,000
I think I have expressed

942
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,720
what I want to express.

943
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,960
And I'm happy

944
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,280
I can accept her answer.

945
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,280
So I think many questions

946
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,560
can be mysterious.

947
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,000
Some are slowly getting to know

948
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,680
and develop slowly.

949
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,600
The process of excavation

950
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,480
is always better than

951
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,480
what the answer is.

952
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,080
I'm more excited.

953
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,880
After this experience,

954
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,160
I think I can firmly believe my feelings.

955
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,400
The two of them

956
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,000
have some feelings

957
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,200
in the process of contact.

958
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,600
Will you do it?

959
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,480
Yes.

960
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,280
Go ahead.

961
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,880
Try it.

962
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,520
Wait.

963
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,440
I can't hold my hand.

964
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,360
Go ahead.

965
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,000
Why do you have to do it when I'm talking?

966
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,240
I really...

967
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,520
Take a look first.

968
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,160
Last night's cuteness.

969
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
You wore your sister's cuteness last night.

970
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,720
I thought about it.

971
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,480
If I send it to you,

972
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,440
I've figured out what to send.

973
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,800
Then I thought

974
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,000
I gave it to Bobo.

975
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,200
OK.

976
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,600
Okay.

977
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,000
Okay.

978
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,880
Don't send it tonight.

979
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,560
If you don't kill me,

980
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,520
I won't kill you.

981
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,560
Calm down.

982
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,400
I'm going home.

983
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,200
You're home

984
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,840
I'm coming home.

985
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,720
You won't see me tomorrow.

986
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,560
I'm going home.

987
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,680
I'm going home already.

988
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,280
I have a big face.

989
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,680
Go through the photo first.

990
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,840
You can nail it on your head.

991
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,560
This is fun.

992
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,280
Okay.

993
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,120
Okay.

994
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,840
Let's go.

995
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,040
There's a mission.

996
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,320
I'll take a look.

997
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,440
(To members of the house.)

998
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,200
(A date with faith is coming.)

999
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,200
express your feelings in an anonymous letter.

1000
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,440
and secretly put it in the mailbox.

1001
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,200
(A man who received an anonymous letter)

1002
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,120
Don't refuse the date invitation.

1003
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,720
Please finish the invitation before eight.

1004
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,120
In the anonymous letter,

1005
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,040
(Do not reveal any identity information)

1006
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,480
about the writers.

1007
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,560
I can't refuse.

1008
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,400
Okay.

1009
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,120
The person who received it can't refuse.

1010
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,840
Okay.

1011
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,640
Bravo!

1012
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,240
To members of the house

1013
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,640
From sunrise to sunset

1014
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,920
You are all romantic memories together.

1015
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,880
Tomorrow the romantic house will open

1016
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,320
In the remaining time,

1017
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,320
in the remaining time

1018
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,000
to witness your feelings.

1019
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,440
Please cherish every opening

1020
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,160
Treasure every romance

1021
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,200
One limited edition for each person.

1022
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,840
Two hours per time.

1023
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,040
Five at most.

1024
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,360
Please fill in the business board.

1025
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,840
Be a considerate landlord.

1026
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,000
I can also make coffee.

1027
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,720
It smells good

1028
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,600
Really

1029
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,480
Smells good

1030
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,480
This is the smell of romance.

1031
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,760
What do you want to say to me?

1032
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,160
Yes.

1033
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,360
Go up.

1034
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,120
What do you want to share with me?

1035
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,400
I don't know how to say romantic house.

1036
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,920
How do you want to be romantic?

1037
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,120
Isn't it a rule to write about the gender and gender?

1038
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,000
Hello?

1039
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,240
Over here! Over here!

1040
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:28,760
Here.

1041
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,240
Who?

1042
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:30,840
Tae-seo.

1043
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,560
Hello.

1044
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,040
Do you want some?

1045
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,640
Yes.

1046
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,560
We're talking in secret.

1047
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,280
Take more.

1048
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,040
Let's talk.

1049
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,400
Who are you inviting today?

1050
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,080
What do you think?

1051
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,320
Fatty and Xinxin.

1052
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,120
I think if we invite Fatty, Xinxin will come in.

1053
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,880
How do you think I should start?

1054
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,600
I'm afraid I'll get excited later.

1055
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:56,640
No.

1056
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,800
I don't think you'll get excited.

1057
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,520
Because it's not yesterday.

1058
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,040
If it was yesterday, you would be excited.

1059
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,920
You're fine today.

1060
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,160
calm today?

1061
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,440
Are you sure?

1062
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,440
After I open a romantic house,

1063
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,440
after I open a romantic house?

1064
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,800
Will he come?

1065
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,760
Can you take the lead first?

1066
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,040
Just sit down.

1067
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,200
Yes, I'll organize it.

1068
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,440
Are you sure you don't want the fifth person?

1069
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,320
Of course not.

1070
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,200
I don't know.

1071
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,440
Think about who the fifth person is.

1072
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,320
I think Xiao Ling

1073
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,520
Xiao Ling will be embarrassed.

1074
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,560
Look at your phone.

1075
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,440
Look at the phone.

1076
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,040
Hua.

1077
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,600
Two men and two women.

1078
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,360
So this number

1079
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,520
the number of people?

1080
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,640
That girl.

1081
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,520
she can only restrict a few men and women.

1082
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,160
But as for

1083
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,480
the man and the woman

1084
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,400
It's us.

1085
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,840
What if there are too many people?

1086
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,280
Grab it.

1087
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,640
I hope

1088
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,120
I hope we can get to know each other more.

1089
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,760
It's my own request.

1090
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,760
There may be some misunderstanding these days.

1091
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,600
We're going to talk.

1092
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,520
Good.

1093
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,880
I have to talk to Hua.

1094
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,280
I think it should be a great reconciliation in the century.

1095
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,240
Romantic House.

1096
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,320
Today's owner is us.

1097
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,200
Hua.

1098
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,040
So did you get this position?

1099
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,920
Follow me.

1100
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,880
I'll come even if you don't allow me to.

1101
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,280
No.

1102
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,400
There's a fire here. Light the candles.

1103
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:45,880
Okay.

1104
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,600
It feels so good.

1105
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:50,680
Smells good.

1106
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,520
I already smell it.

1107
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,680
Have one.

1108
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,640
I'll take one.

1109
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,320
It's fun.

1110
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,800
Right?

1111
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,840
You're too old to play with fire.

1112
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,080
Done.

1113
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,000
So romantic.

1114
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,400
It's really romantic.

1115
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,440
Then why is it called "Romantic House"?

1116
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,360
Come up and talk.

1117
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,880
Let's talk.

1118
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,720
Because I will definitely say

1119
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,200
talk to you.

1120
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,400
I have to say this.

1121
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,160
Because you'll be there too.

1122
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,800
And I'll tell her

1123
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,640
I'll say it too.

1124
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,800
Say it.

1125
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,840
You can say whatever you want.

1126
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,680
I think it's the happiest to say it out.

1127
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,440
You'll know

1128
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,600
how you're going to get along with her.

1129
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,520
Friends can be more natural friends.

1130
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,680
I just stand

1131
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,600
very neutral.

1132
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,000
no matter what happens between you two,

1133
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,360
I will be her best friend.

1134
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,120
Right?

1135
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:48,560
It's okay.

1136
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,760
Because we... Yes.

1137
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,720
You've made up your mind.

1138
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,160
what you want to say, right?

1139
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,960
I'm sure I've thought about it.

1140
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,440
They are already here.

1141
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,360
Coming.

1142
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,400
Come in. Isn't it romantic?

1143
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,120
How is it?

1144
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,640
Do you feel it?

1145
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,320
So romantic.

1146
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,360
Did you do this?

1147
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:16,760
Yes.

1148
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,880
Yes, I lit the candles.

1149
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,680
Have a seat.

1150
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,760
Let's make some coffee

1151
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,720
Like having tea at night.

1152
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,160
It's beautiful here

1153
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:26,520
Yes.

1154
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,040
That's right.

1155
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,160
You should bring your camera here.

1156
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,600
Yes.

1157
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,200
Let's take a photo.

1158
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:40,680
Nice.

1159
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,600
Yes.

1160
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,760
Very natural.

1161
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,960
We're the first to come to Romantic House

1162
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,320
So romantic

1163
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,720
You are the most romantic siblings

1164
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,680
I'm so happy here.

1165
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,480
Right?

1166
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,680
It's like a paradise.

1167
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,920
And this place

1168
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,320
a sense of security.

1169
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:57,800
Yes.

1170
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:58,960
Okay.

1171
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,160
Okay.

1172
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,920
Here.

1173
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,640
Pour it in the cup.

1174
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,200
Okay, thank you.

1175
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,280
Hua, sit next to me.

1176
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:04,480
Okay.

1177
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,160
It's a bit watery.

1178
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,120
Sorry.

1179
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,080
So you saw

1180
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,200
the text I sent.

1181
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,240
I'll come if you send it.

1182
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,400
You'll come no matter what.

1183
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,840
You'll come no matter what.

1184
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:32,960
Excited.

1185
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,880
Can't there be background music like that?

1186
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,280
No.

1187
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,200
But yesterday

1188
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,320
did really well.

1189
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,880
But we're not the best partners.

1190
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,760
Yes, we're not the best.

1191
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,720
I thought it would be you.

1192
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,440
Did you vote for me?

1193
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,040
Yes.

1194
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:46,800
Did you vote for me?

1195
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,560
Tata.

1196
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,880
It's where they make models.

1197
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,320
and singing and dancing.

1198
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,680
I think they put more effort

1199
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,240
in this aspect.

1200
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,600
I think Tata and others

1201
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,360
are eye-catching.

1202
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,240
Because in the end,

1203
00:52:59,240 --> 00:52:59,960
Memory point.

1204
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,760
Yes.

1205
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,760
It doesn't matter.

1206
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,400
As long as I'm happy.

1207
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,800
It doesn't matter. He said a lot.

1208
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,520
OK, we're here.

1209
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,720
Let's get straight to the point.

1210
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,240
Who will speak first?

1211
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,080
Let me say something first.

1212
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,600
Why am I

1213
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,360
my emotions

1214
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,720
to the back.

1215
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,440
and then there were so many ups and downs.

1216
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,280
After our first date,

1217
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,360
we talked about

1218
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,160
We have expressed each other.

1219
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,560
They want to meet the other side again.

1220
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,800
and take a look.

1221
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,560
So when Tata

1222
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,040
when Tarri and I came in,

1223
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,080
we sent the text

1224
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,200
to newcomers respectively.

1225
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,800
But at that time,

1226
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,640
I also said

1227
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,800
I was in contact with Xiaoling.

1228
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,640
Because the next day,

1229
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,280
the next day.

1230
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:51,840
But because

1231
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,040
your emotions were unstable,

1232
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,400
So I changed my direction quickly.

1233
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,680
When I saw you unhappy,

1234
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,560
At that time,

1235
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,760
I couldn't make you so sad.

1236
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,320
So the next day,

1237
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,400
the next day.

1238
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,040
I sent you that message.

1239
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,760
First of all, you think she was unhappy.

1240
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,600
Were you unhappy then?

1241
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,760
I haven't received your message for two days.

1242
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,080
Yes.

1243
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,440
I knew it when I saw you.

1244
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:13,920
Two days.

1245
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,400
But I've never expressed it to anyone.

1246
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,160
I have negative emotions,

1247
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,160
including my unhappiness.

1248
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,360
Maybe I didn't express it.

1249
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,200
But you feel that I don't know.

1250
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,320
But in my heart,

1251
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,400
I never wanted to express

1252
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,560
about this.

1253
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,960
It's just that you may have received

1254
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,920
including me.

1255
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,120
My siblings (text number) are zero.

1256
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,000
My brothers and I

1257
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,920
received zero in two days.

1258
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,160
But we were in the siblings' house.

1259
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,320
We had fun.

1260
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,680
Hahaha. There's no love between a funny man and a woman.

1261
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,920
Although it's possible

1262
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,440
when we say this,

1263
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,320
But maybe

1264
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,280
a little disappointed.

1265
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,040
But I can guarantee that

1266
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,880
we never

1267
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,360
emotions to anyone.

1268
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,080
I don't want you

1269
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,200
pity us or something.

1270
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:52,720
No.

1271
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,480
Don't stress yourself out.

1272
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,200
I'll say,

1273
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:55,680
I'm not stressed.

1274
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,320
Let me tell you.

1275
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,720
I'll tell you what I think.

1276
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,520
And I was in the Mirror Room.

1277
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,160
Do you know I asked you a question?

1278
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,400
Of course I know.

1279
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:02,920
Yes.

1280
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,520
I asked you.

1281
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,400
Do you prefer dating

1282
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,760
or sports day?

1283
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,080
You said dating is more fun.

1284
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,640
Okay, this is my first question.

1285
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,400
I'll ask you the third question.

1286
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,200
You said after the sports day,

1287
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,680
after the sports day.

1288
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,040
Right?

1289
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,440
But after the sports day,

1290
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,560
you sent them to Xiao Ling.

1291
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,680
I didn't send Xiaoling the next day.

1292
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,480
I didn't know who it was.

1293
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,520
You didn't send it to her.

1294
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,160
Yes.

1295
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
I'll welcome Tata.

1296
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,600
Because on that day,

1297
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,800
We talked that day.

1298
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,440
That's it.

1299
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,520
Why didn't you send it to her the next day?

1300
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:28,840
Because...

1301
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,560
Do you want to hear me out?

1302
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,640
The first day Tae-seo came in,

1303
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,760
I was the one who was left behind.

1304
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,160
I am...

1305
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,760
We have no choice.

1306
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,920
After Tae-seo was rejected,

1307
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,720
after Tae-seo was rejected.

1308
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,440
And on the sports day,

1309
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,920
Tae-ri didn't send it to me either.

1310
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,920
I know that.

1311
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,680
It means I haven't received it for two days.

1312
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,680
So I can understand

1313
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,400
how sad you were when you didn't receive the message.

1314
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,160
Because I know

1315
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,960
more emotionally than me.

1316
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,880
But I won't.

1317
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,680
I think

1318
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,880
I just want to be sad.

1319
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,600
or don't think about it secretly.

1320
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,680
Excuse me.

1321
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,560
Well...

1322
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,880
About this message.

1323
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,120
Why didn't I

1324
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,600
I didn't send it to you

1325
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,240
because when we were on a date,

1326
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,280
we clearly said

1327
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,160
they both want to try it again.

1328
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:13,520
Yes.

1329
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,240
So we get along as usual.

1330
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:15,640
right?

1331
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,880
We got along well with each other.

1332
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,240
Until the Secret Mirror Room,

1333
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,160
you couldn't do it.

1334
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,200
You said you can check it after the sports day.

1335
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,120
But what you said is different from what you did.

1336
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,520
Your actions

1337
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,320
and all your

1338
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,520
follow your heart?

1339
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:29,960
Are you affected?

1340
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,720
Yes, you said yes.

1341
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,840
I said I firmly said

1342
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,720
I said yes.

1343
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,960
It's because I didn't feel it.

1344
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,080
That's why I'm asking you this.

1345
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,200
Maybe everyone has their own way

1346
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,280
in their own way.

1347
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,960
In reality,

1348
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,120
in life,

1349
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,200
that I can feel my love,

1350
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,440
I actually gave you a lot.

1351
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,000
It's just that you can't see it.

1352
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I can feel it.

1353
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,920
I'm very sure.

1354
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,200
Yes.

1355
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,720
I also told Tu

1356
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,160
I can feel that Fatty

1357
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,280
his feelings for me.

1358
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,040
But...

1359
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,360
So...

1360
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,920
Otherwise, I wouldn't have chosen you

1361
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,680
to ask you these questions.

1362
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,040
Yes, so I personally think

1363
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,760
you can feel my feelings.

1364
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,120
And I'm pretty clear.

1365
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,560
Why can't I go so fast?

1366
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,320
I'm answering the question.

1367
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,360
First, it's about speed.

1368
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,760
The emotions in it

1369
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,360
will be magnified.

1370
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,080
No.

1371
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,280
Then you go out and play with Xinxin.

1372
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,040
In front of me,

1373
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,400
in front of me.

1374
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,160
He has been making

1375
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,960
a gift for Xiaoling today.

1376
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,040
and put the ecosystem in front of me.

1377
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,400
I said it.

1378
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,080
He...

1379
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,920
I didn't say that.

1380
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,160
you gave it to Xiao Ling.

1381
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:29,840
I didn't give it to Xiaoling.

1382
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,520
I put it at the entrance.

1383
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,160
I said I'd show it to Xiaoling.

1384
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:33,960
You did.

1385
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,080
When you came in, you said Xiaoling

1386
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,640
Fatty wants to give you a gift.

1387
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,280
I didn't say it.

1388
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,200
He did it all day.

1389
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,640
I said we made a gift

1390
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,160
for everyone.

1391
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,360
I didn't say it's for Xiaoling.

1392
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,920
I said I'd wait for you.

1393
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,520
Because Xiaoling asked me,

1394
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,000
So I said,

1395
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,280
You'll know when you see it.

1396
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,160
I clearly remember this sentence.

1397
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,360
Xiaoling, Fatty made you

1398
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,520
a gift for you today.

1399
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,360
And Xiaoling said, "What is it?"

1400
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,040
Did you miss me?

1401
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,520
What?

1402
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,240
Do you miss me?

1403
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,960
Yes.

1404
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,760
Linlin.

1405
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,920
I've been waiting for you.

1406
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,560
What's wrong?

1407
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,280
Waiting for you.

1408
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,040
because you were waiting for us?

1409
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,520
Do you know what we were doing today?

1410
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,240
What did we do?

1411
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,040
Let me show you later.

1412
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:14,880
What did I do today?

1413
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,600
Show.

1414
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,800
Wait.

1415
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,480
I have a gift for you. Wait.

1416
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:20,640
It's not me.

1417
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,120
I just took off my clothes.

1418
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,280
Not me.

1419
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,520
I'm going to put something down.

1420
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,240
Fatty.

1421
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,160
Good evening.

1422
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,280
What is this?

1423
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,640
I made this.

1424
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,280
You didn't even look at it.

1425
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,840
Let me see what it is.

1426
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,360
The ecosystem.

1427
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,600
The ecosystem.

1428
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,200
What happened?

1429
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,160
I remember.

1430
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,120
Hua was sitting at the table.

1431
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,280
Susu was also at the table.

1432
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,120
Xiao Ling is here too.

1433
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,040
I don't remember saying

1434
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,240
Fatty made this ecosystem for Xiaoling.

1435
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,240
This whole sentence.

1436
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,320
So I think

1437
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,320
there was a misunderstanding.

1438
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,000
You said that you misunderstood.

1439
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,480
Because I didn't say that.

1440
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,080
If I give you something,

1441
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:26,840
I will definitely...

1442
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,960
No, I think the four of us

1443
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,040
are too different.

1444
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,520
You can tell me.

1445
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,560
You can tell me.

1446
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,960
what you did today.

1447
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,440
can you say

1448
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,440
Fatty wants to give it to Xiaoling?

1449
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,200
Or if you want to give it to Xiaoling,

1450
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,800
you can ask directly.

1451
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,640
If I could ask,

1452
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,760
we wouldn't be sitting here now.

1453
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,880
And the point is this ecosystem

1454
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,200
I didn't do it alone.

1455
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:42,400
Yes.

1456
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,280
And when we

1457
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,800
didn't mention Xiaoling

1458
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,600
I never mentioned Xiaoling.

1459
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,840
How could it be?

1460
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,240
I don't think you need to care about this misunderstanding.

1461
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,840
After this misunderstanding,

1462
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,520
I clearly

1463
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,640
how I feel.

1464
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,000
It's not a misunderstanding.

1465
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,520
I think it's just

1466
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,120
you told me

1467
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,880
after the sports day.

1468
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,440
But in my understanding,

1469
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,640
you didn't send me

1470
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,600
after the sports day.

1471
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,520
Okay.

1472
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,760
Let's talk now.

1473
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,920
Follow that topic.

1474
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,760
Mirror House.

1475
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,520
You didn't feel it for two days.

1476
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,640
In the next three days,

1477
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,720
Do you feel it?

1478
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,360
Yes.

1479
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,160
In this small house,

1480
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,800
I can feel it every day.

1481
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,520
you have feelings for me.

1482
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,160
Yes. Good.

1483
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,240
Except for the first day.

1484
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:20,720
Yes.

1485
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,000
That's good.

1486
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:21,840
I can feel it.

1487
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,040
Yes.

1488
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,080
The romantic house is open today.

1489
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,800
Because the initiator is Flower.

1490
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,800
So I sneaked over and took a look.

1491
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,520
to see who it was.

1492
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,640
Then I saw Fatty.

1493
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,080
I took a look and left.

1494
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,040
I couldn't get in because there were enough people.

1495
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,360
Let's talk about Mirror House.

1496
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:58,800
Okay.

1497
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,040
I asked a few questions

1498
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,680
I asked a few questions.

1499
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,320
I remember.

1500
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,960
The first question is

1501
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,400
Are you happy dating Tae-seo

1502
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,200
or happy with you?

1503
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,000
Yes, I also asked

1504
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,360
if you would treat me differently.

1505
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,560
Then you say yes, I will.

1506
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,440
Then why did I

1507
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,640
at dinner that day?

1508
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,080
I suddenly lost control.

1509
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:17,600
It's like this.

1510
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,040
When we had dinner that night,

1511
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,600
you asked me before I texted you.

1512
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,600
if you would send it to me tonight.

1513
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,720
Yes.

1514
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,040
Will you send it to me today?

1515
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,120
What are you doing?

1516
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,680
Excuse me.

1517
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,120
After sending this message that day,

1518
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:34,920
I got angry right away.

1519
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:35,600
But in the next second,

1520
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,840
the map came to explain to me.

1521
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,000
This is obviously your order.

1522
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,160
I wanted to talk about it last night.

1523
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,120
But the chat last night

1524
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,160
is definitely not as good as it is now.

1525
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,720
Because I saw you wearing a mask last night.

1526
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,360
my emotions

1527
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,760
is still very emotional.

1528
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,240
I'm afraid I'll get too excited.

1529
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,600
To avoid more conflicts with you,

1530
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,920
I had to

1531
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,640
to not communicate with you.

1532
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,760
I think

1533
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,720
our feelings

1534
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,200
are mutual.

1535
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,320
I think as chubby,

1536
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,120
he would mind

1537
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,280
he thinks you like him.

1538
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,160
and sent it to Terri.

1539
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,880
The second question is

1540
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,520
there's a problem with lack of information.

1541
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,640
I got

1542
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,480
from my sister.

1543
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,520
So you're not interested in Tae-seo.

1544
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,680
After your first date with Tae-seo,

1545
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,680
I understand if you send it to him.

1546
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,960
But why?

1547
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,680
After I expressed my feelings,

1548
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,160
you have to comfort someone

1549
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,280
who didn't come.

1550
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,000
and Tata.

1551
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,960
And I don't think

1552
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,920
should be comforted by text.

1553
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,080
I didn't say I didn't mean anything to him.

1554
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,680
I was in contact with him.

1555
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,800
Okay, Guoli.

1556
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,760
But the message I sent that day

1557
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,520
is comfort.

1558
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,600
Because I think everyone is here.

1559
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,200
He's not here.

1560
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,920
I feel sorry for him.

1561
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,680
As fat,

1562
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,480
he might mind

1563
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,600
the meaning of your message.

1564
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,880
At that time,

1565
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,280
at that time.

1566
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,480
She can feel Fatty's love for her.

1567
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,200
She was also in contact with Tae-ri.

1568
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,920
and the atmosphere.

1569
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,520
and send it to Tae-seo.

1570
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,960
That's what we've been together for the past three or four days.

1571
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,960
You know

1572
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,000
how you feel, right?

1573
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,200
The first day Tae-seo came in,

1574
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,400
and the next day,

1575
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,400
I clearly

1576
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,360
with you.

1577
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,920
Tae-seo is not my type.

1578
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,040
Because Tae-seo is passive.

1579
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,680
But we've been getting along these days.

1580
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,760
I don't think he's completely passive.

1581
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,200
On the contrary, Fatty doesn't treat me well.

1582
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,960
I haven't talked to you these days.

1583
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,720
Actually, in the past few days,

1584
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,920
I've spent the most time with Tae-seo.

1585
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,920
I'm sure

1586
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,240
with the map and you.

1587
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,360
I didn't say

1588
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,160
every day.

1589
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,360
I don't follow my heart every day.

1590
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,360
First of all, you didn't see

1591
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,000
what Fatty did.

1592
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,760
That's why your feelings are weakened.

1593
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,800
Then you didn't.

1594
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,960
Now I've met a new guy.

1595
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,280
And you think

1596
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,400
on a new guy.

1597
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,600
it's normal.

1598
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,800
In his opinion,

1599
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,280
he expressed his feelings for you for three days.

1600
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,480
You knew he liked you

1601
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,120
you met another guy,

1602
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,160
and didn't tell him.

1603
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,880
He thought

1604
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,360
why I would explode that day.

1605
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,400
Because you asked me

1606
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,160
you asked me

1607
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,160
You said you would send it to me today.

1608
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,600
Then I thought

1609
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,320
I asked if you would send it to me today.

1610
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,200
Then you said,

1611
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,760
Don't you know what I'm doing?

1612
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,880
Yes.

1613
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,320
I think what you did

1614
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,520
will make Fatty...

1615
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,000
Okay.

1616
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,360
I'm sorry.

1617
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,280
I apologize for this.

1618
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,880
I think the most wrong thing I did

1619
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,760
is asking you about this that day.

1620
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,000
will affect your judgment.

1621
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,600
Definitely.

1622
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,560
Because I sent you two days in a row.

1623
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,280
I can't accept this explanation.

1624
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:42,600
right?

1625
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,240
Why do I have to tell you

1626
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,240
how I feel for you?

1627
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,720
you need to do something nice.

1628
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,360
You know how I feel.

1629
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,400
But the text you sent to Tae-seo.

1630
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,480
I was treated differently.

1631
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,920
Is this the answer today?

1632
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,200
I made myself clear.

1633
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,560
From the day we started dating,

1634
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,800
I know how you feel.

1635
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,120
Including your kindness to me.

1636
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:11,520
Yes.

1637
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,280
I know.

1638
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,520
But before I know how I feel,

1639
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,880
what you did to me

1640
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,360
I think

1641
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,520
I'm just being inconsistent.

1642
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,600
Maybe I think too bad of people.

1643
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,400
I might not know

1644
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,840
because I sat there

1645
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,960
because I was sitting there?

1646
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,920
I did hear it. I saw it too.

1647
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,480
No.

1648
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,760
I didn't say that.

1649
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,640
We won't say it.

1650
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,480
I think we'll know when we look back.

1651
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,480
I just said this.

1652
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,360
Now I know.

1653
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,400
I heard you sitting here.

1654
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,680
I understand what you mean.

1655
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,600
Because you also text me how you feel.

1656
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,240
Sometimes,

1657
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,440
with comfort.

1658
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,200
In my eyes,

1659
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,960
you're actually...

1660
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,920
Your feelings for Tae-ri

1661
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,320
on friends.

1662
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,680
That's what I received.

1663
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,520
So I will push Fatty

1664
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,520
to send it to you more proactively.

1665
01:05:59,520 --> 01:05:59,920
or

1666
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,280
push forward your relationship.

1667
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:02,920
It's like this.

1668
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,200
I don't want your future development

1669
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,120
will be affected

1670
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,000
or my relationship with you.

1671
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,880
I made myself clear that

1672
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,680
I like Esther very much.

1673
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,200
I often say that.

1674
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,080
I don't want

1675
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,000
I don't want anything to affect us.

1676
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,000
Me too.

1677
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,080
I know you're very nice to me.

1678
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,000
I don't want anything

1679
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,880
make you unhappy.

1680
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,120
The day you were unhappy today

1681
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,120
makes me very emotional.

1682
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,920
Including yesterday, it's not like you.

1683
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,160
Because you have to allow me

1684
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,640
to have my own ideas.

1685
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,320
I don't want it to be because of me.

1686
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,240
Sit together.

1687
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,600
You didn't come because I was there.

1688
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,600
I don't know if you have that.

1689
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,960
But I don't want that to happen.

1690
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,120
I don't want you to be unhappy.

1691
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,360
I won't. Don't think too much.

1692
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:44,880
This thing...

1693
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,600
I said I respect it.

1694
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,200
I think we've talked it through.

1695
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,000
Actually, you...

1696
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,480
I think we should just talk it out.

1697
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,400
Yes, first of all,

1698
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,280
you can feel his feelings.

1699
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:53,600
Yes.

1700
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,760
Did you accept this?

1701
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,120
Yes.

1702
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,040
What about after you accept it?

1703
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,680
You're still getting along with Tae-seo.

1704
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,520
Yes.

1705
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,480
I won't complain

1706
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,680
I like someone.

1707
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:03,720
and someone is not interested in me.

1708
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,400
I'll avoid you on purpose.

1709
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,200
I won't.

1710
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,480
Okay, you'd better.

1711
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,120
Do you think I'll avoid you and Tae-seo?

1712
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:11,640
No way.

1713
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,000
Why are you avoiding me and Tae-seo?

1714
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,120
You're avoiding me.

1715
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,400
I think you...

1716
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,280
We used to be noisy.

1717
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:19,680
These days,

1718
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,000
You used to be noisy because...

1719
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,920
That's just a form of expressing my love.

1720
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,520
Okay, I understand.

1721
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,120
Actually, on that day,

1722
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,600
I had feelings for you.

1723
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,240
That day,

1724
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,920
you texted me

1725
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,720
Map came to me and told me.

1726
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,640
This behavior makes me feel

1727
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,680
you care about me.

1728
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,840
It's not that you don't care about me.

1729
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,080
I think you're in a bad mood.

1730
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:40,760
I said, go over there.

1731
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,240
Yes, why did you do this?

1732
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,880
Because I think you're in a bad mood.

1733
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,880
So I wanted him to come over.

1734
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,600
You're interacting there again.

1735
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,920
and you have to consider my feelings.

1736
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,160
You said you would treat me differently.

1737
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,120
I think it's better to discriminate.

1738
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,680
Because I'm a person who treats me differently.

1739
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,640
You asked me if I was biased.

1740
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,640
I'm absolutely biased.

1741
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,400
For example, if the soup is unhappy,

1742
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,840
Go and comfort the soup.

1743
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,160
or go to the soup directly.

1744
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,480
No one will think you're giving him a signal.

1745
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,880
Because you two don't like each other.

1746
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,240
But when Fatty has feelings for you,

1747
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,760
when Fatty likes you,

1748
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,560
ask Tu to do this immediately.

1749
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:10,760
This is a misunderstanding.

1750
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,480
He's just overthinking.

1751
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,280
In the future, if you want to say no, just say no.

1752
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,880
Yes, you can refuse me.

1753
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:17,840
Yes, make it clear.

1754
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,040
Why should I change myself

1755
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:19,880
because of this?

1756
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,640
When I think back now,

1757
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,880
I will still let him comfort you.

1758
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,200
Why do you think

1759
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:23,760
Because

1760
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,200
a kind person.

1761
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:25,680
I feel

1762
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,800
you're on my side again.

1763
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,600
You didn't...

1764
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,319
You just said the same thing.

1765
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:31,040
I said in their opinion,

1766
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,800
you can refuse them if you want.

1767
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,120
But I think you are a nice person.

1768
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,319
You need to comfort him.

1769
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,240
I gave the wrong signal.

1770
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,279
I'm sorry. I can apologize.

1771
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:39,840
But you told me not to do this.

1772
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,760
I'm not asking you to apologize.

1773
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,760
No.

1774
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,720
I can apologize.

1775
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,120
But if you want me to stop doing this,

1776
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:46,760
I can't.

1777
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,000
It was when you comforted Tae-seo.

1778
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,040
Why are you explaining to me?

1779
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:50,600
It's okay.

1780
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,760
Just ignore me.

1781
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,960
I didn't explain to you.

1782
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,080
You look unhappy.

1783
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,600
I asked him to comfort you.

1784
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,800
Don't be upset.

1785
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,800
Time's up.

1786
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,399
I don't think it's a kind of

1787
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,160
to comfort him.

1788
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:21,840
a way

1789
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,800
a way to release my feelings for him.

1790
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,080
Maybe in some small things,

1791
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,200
for example, making noodles for him,

1792
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,240
or argue with him.

1793
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,720
I think in the men's eyes,

1794
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,880
they might think

1795
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,279
having feelings for him is mutual.

1796
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,479
But it's not

1797
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:37,720
is not

1798
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,359
I'm trying to show my interest.

1799
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,120
When I came out of the house,

1800
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,600
a little unhappy.

1801
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,720
She's unhappy because

1802
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,240
she wants to get close to Tae-seo.

1803
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,000
I thought it could be a relief.

1804
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,520
We can be good friends.

1805
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,520
I didn't expect

1806
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,360
to end up like this.

1807
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,840
It even affected

1808
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,320
her relationship with Xinxin.

1809
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,240
She's back.

1810
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:07,960
You're back.

1811
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,440
Let's go upstairs and talk.

1812
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,160
Let's go to the wilderness of Guoli.

1813
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,080
I don't want to tell you.

1814
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,920
I'm Tu Tu.

1815
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,160
to help me speak.

1816
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,920
But I want to see God

1817
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,480
including the back.

1818
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,920
He's standing in the same line with them.

1819
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,160
I would be angry.

1820
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,040
Even if it's all my fault,

1821
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,440
I want someone to be on my side.

1822
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,200
and speak for me.

1823
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,160
But he didn't.

1824
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,040
So I was very angry.

1825
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,880
You do it.

1826
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,600
I don't want to talk.

1827
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,760
I need to change my pants now.

1828
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,360
Hua is obviously unhappy.

1829
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,680
Because she thought that Tu Tu didn't protect her.

1830
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,240
It's not that.

1831
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,400
Not really.

1832
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,880
She said I was confused about the ecosystem.

1833
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,320
I don't remember either.

1834
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,120
I brought the ecosystem in

1835
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,280
and put it at the door.

1836
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,080
I said I would give it to you right away.

1837
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,280
I was joking.

1838
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,040
She said...

1839
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,000
Tell Xiaoling

1840
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,240
Fatty said it's a gift for you.

1841
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,520
Did I really say that?

1842
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,160
Are you really not going to tell me?

1843
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:02,800
What?

1844
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,360
Let's talk inside.

1845
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,480
What are you doing

1846
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,520
What are you talking about now?

1847
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,120
Do you think I'm not defending you?

1848
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,120
What do you think?

1849
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,280
I know, but...

1850
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,680
from an objective point of view,

1851
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,440
if I were to help you,

1852
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,880
we would have had a big fight.

1853
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:22,760
So what?

1854
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,920
Actually, you guys...

1855
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,400
Fatty felt that I comforted him that day

1856
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,280
that I went to comfort him that day.

1857
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,560
and a misunderstanding.

1858
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,080
So I should be responsible

1859
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,520
his own information shortage?

1860
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:39,920
Even just now...

1861
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,560
I asked you to comfort them.

1862
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,440
You all think I'm problematic, right?

1863
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,200
You think so too.

1864
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,920
They think

1865
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,040
should be decisive.

1866
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:49,800
When I talked to you,

1867
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,160
when I talked to you.

1868
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,360
That's why

1869
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,640
to tell you in private.

1870
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,400
Why can't you tell me in person?

1871
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,000
in private?

1872
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:57,480
No.

1873
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,200
What I want to tell you is

1874
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,680
in a relationship,

1875
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:01,880
it's true that

1876
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,680
Don't be too nice to them.

1877
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,080
You are kind in nature.

1878
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,320
You can be kind to anything.

1879
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,920
But for a relationship,

1880
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,960
you are kind and hesitant

1881
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,520
the kindness and hesitation

1882
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,680
will hurt both of them.

1883
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,400
I can also think that you're the problem.

1884
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,520
I want you to comfort him.

1885
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,800
You can comfort him as a friend.

1886
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,360
Why did you say I asked you to go?

1887
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,560
I didn't care about that.

1888
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,520
Yes, I don't care about you.

1889
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,240
That's why you think it doesn't matter.

1890
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:40,880
Really?

1891
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,760
Did I just

1892
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,560
with him just now?

1893
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,200
Because from the beginning,

1894
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,160
you didn't care about these things.

1895
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:51,920
You don't think

1896
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,120
I care about this.

1897
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:54,640
You don't think

1898
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,000
this has affected me.

1899
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,200
Because you can't see my emotions.

1900
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,720
It's nothing.

1901
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,640
He's mad at him.

1902
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,120
You think it's nothing?

1903
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,880
Don't you think I'm sad?

1904
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,280
You think it's nothing?

1905
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,800
From the beginning,

1906
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,720
when I wanted to talk to him,

1907
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,760
you thought it was nothing.

1908
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,000
You didn't try to help me.

1909
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,040
What should I ask?

1910
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,000
Just tell me.

1911
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,320
I did.

1912
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,680
What's your point of view?

1913
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,200
I think you two

1914
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,720
talk to each other.

1915
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,600
We must talk face to face.

1916
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,280
Yes, so you've made it clear?

1917
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,200
Do you think

1918
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,400
I thought you would help me

1919
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,400
you would help me

1920
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,320
and let everyone untie this.

1921
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,080
I didn't want to go to a romantic house.

1922
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,720
I thought I should talk to Fatty alone.

1923
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,040
I thought I would be more confident with you.

1924
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,360
I don't want to talk anymore.

1925
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,920
Why do I have to tell you

1926
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,760
I told you my feelings for you,

1927
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,840
you have to do something nice.

1928
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,840
In the future, you have to say no to me.

1929
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,000
When I think back now,

1930
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,360
I will still let him comfort you.

1931
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,720
Why do you think

1932
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:24,920
Because she is

1933
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,520
a kind person.

1934
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,160
Now you're on my side.

1935
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,000
You didn't.

1936
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,640
You just said the same thing.

1937
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,400
I don't know what to say.

1938
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,520
many images flashed in my mind.

1939
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,200
I thought maybe

1940
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,240
in the past,

1941
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,280
or some

1942
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,760
in the house.

1943
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,640
No matter what happens,

1944
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,680
she can't let us suffer.

1945
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,480
She was protecting us.

1946
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,320
When I think about it,

1947
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,880
I started to blame myself.

1948
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,920
I don't mean to blame you.

1949
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,520
I was wrong.

1950
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,000
I was wrong.

1951
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,240
I don't mean to blame you.

1952
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,680
I'm not blaming you.

1953
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,280
I'm sorry.

1954
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,800
I don't mean to blame you.

1955
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,080
I'm sorry.

1956
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,880
When I saw him crying,

1957
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,840
I thought he was too harsh.

1958
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,520
I feel guilty.

1959
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,800
I don't blame you.

1960
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,840
I didn't help you just now.

1961
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,600
I don't mean to blame you.

1962
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,720
Stop crying.

1963
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:57,840
I don't blame you.

1964
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,560
I was thinking

1965
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,520
you usually...

1966
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,000
I don't mean to blame you.

1967
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,840
Don't cry.

1968
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,560
Hurry up.

1969
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:09,800
All right.

1970
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,400
I'm not blaming you.

1971
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,440
I was thinking that

1972
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,720
Every time you're heading towards us,

1973
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,800
no matter what happens,

1974
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,120
I'm angry.

1975
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,480
But I don't blame you.

1976
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:30,760
I know.

1977
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,400
I'm afraid I'm not capable.

1978
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,160
I didn't speak for you just now.

1979
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,640
What do you mean?

1980
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,840
You just became a mute.

1981
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,960
All right.

1982
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:44,400
Okay.

1983
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,600
Stop.

1984
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,200
I'm happy to see you cry.

1985
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,600
I just want you to cry.

1986
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,680
Wait. People will think we're okay.

1987
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,640
It's okay.

1988
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,320
I didn't mean it.

1989
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,640
All right.

1990
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,880
If someone sees us,

1991
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,280
I can't explain.

1992
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,120
All right.

1993
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,560
All right.

1994
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,640
I'm not angry anymore.

1995
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,560
I know you're not angry.

1996
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,480
I blame myself

1997
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,480
why I didn't help you.

1998
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,160
No.

1999
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,680
I'm actually fine.

2000
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,800
Look at me. I just wanted you to cry.

2001
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:44,960
You asked me

2002
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,640
I haven't seen you cry for a long time.

2003
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,280
I didn't see you cry

2004
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,800
I didn't see you crying either.

2005
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,320
All right.

2006
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,440
Why are you more like a brother?

2007
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,480
Don't cry.

2008
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,960
I think

2009
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,560
if I can't do anything,

2010
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,440
I can't help you.

2011
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,200
What else can I do for you?

2012
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,800
What else can I say?

2013
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,040
to participate in your love experience.

2014
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,200
I can't do anything.

2015
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,000
What else can I do?

2016
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,840
Okay, stop crying.

2017
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,120
Okay.

2018
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,720
I'm sorry.

2019
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,400
It's okay.

2020
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,000
You're crying.

2021
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,760
I don't know

2022
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,880
why I'm crying like this.

2023
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:31,560
I just...

2024
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,080
You cried so hard.

2025
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,800
At first, I really thought

2026
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,800
it's not a big deal.

2027
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,760
Everyone is interacting with each other.

2028
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:44,840
I've been silent for so long.

2029
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,880
I was thinking

2030
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,960
no matter what I do,

2031
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,160
you will protect me

2032
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,600
and help us do these things.

2033
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,440
I think

2034
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,360
when I can do something for you,

2035
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,600
even if I can say something for you,

2036
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,320
I can't say it.

2037
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,640
I think I'm useless.

2038
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,040
I knew why I was like this.

2039
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,920
Why was I standing there?

2040
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,280
No, I didn't mean

2041
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,640
I really have to stand

2042
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,960
from that angle?

2043
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,200
It's okay.

2044
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,680
Okay.

2045
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,880
I know.

2046
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,120
I'm happy to see you cry, actually.

2047
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,720
You made me cry on purpose.

2048
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,520
Yeah.

2049
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,840
I won't be good if you don't cry today.

2050
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,880
I'll be angry all day.

2051
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,280
and forgive you before I go to bed.

2052
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,600
Okay.

2053
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,400
Satisfied?

2054
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,160
Yes, I am.

2055
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,520
Go clean up and eat.

2056
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,280
Are you hungry?

2057
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,480
No one cooks anything.

2058
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,720
I'll cook.

2059
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:38,880
I'll do it every day.

2060
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,640
All right, your hands are cold.

2061
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,400
Are you cold?

2062
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,720
Add some clothes. Let's go.

2063
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,560
I'll cook for you.

2064
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,000
I'm coming in.

2065
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,360
Come in.

2066
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:53,520
Okay.

2067
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:56,840
What's wrong with the map?

2068
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,600
Why is he crying?

2069
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,280
Who?

2070
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,040
Map.

2071
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,960
Because Xin and I

2072
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,080
and Hua

2073
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,400
had a

2074
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,160
with the four of us.

2075
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:16,800
The map

2076
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,880
is neutral.

2077
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:21,480
So just now

2078
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,560
just talked about these.

2079
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,400
I feel so sorry for the drawing.

2080
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,560
I want to see the map.

2081
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,440
Can I come in?

2082
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,360
Yes.

2083
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,080
I'm really fine.

2084
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,240
Did you cry a lot just now?

2085
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,240
Do you know why I wear glasses?

2086
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:47,960
Do you know

2087
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,240
swollen

2088
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,440
Is it swollen?

2089
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,080
I just...

2090
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,280
I wanted to go in just now.

2091
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,560
but I don't think it's good.

2092
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:56,360
Close the door.

2093
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,080
Have a seat.

2094
01:21:59,080 --> 01:21:59,840
Is it appropriate?

2095
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,000
Yes, just sit down.

2096
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,440
I'm really fine.

2097
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,840
It's okay. Tell me if you want to.

2098
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,440
It doesn't matter if you don't want to.

2099
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,520
How should I put it?

2100
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,520
I cried because

2101
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,760
I think

2102
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,800
what happened

2103
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,600
what happened,

2104
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,320
you didn't take my side immediately.

2105
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:18,520
That's it.

2106
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:18,880
Yes.

2107
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,680
So,

2108
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,400
I felt really bad.

2109
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,720
I blamed myself.

2110
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,240
I heard you say you won't scold me, right?

2111
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,720
That's why this happened.

2112
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:31,600
It's swollen.

2113
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,400
I really...

2114
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,080
I almost ran out of oxygen.

2115
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,280
I cried so much that I was out of oxygen.

2116
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,600
I need to

2117
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,720
calm down.

2118
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,040
It's okay.

2119
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,760
Then my sister said

2120
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,200
I won't be angry if you cry.

2121
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,640
Was that too embarrassing?

2122
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,640
I cried a lot.

2123
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,360
Objectively speaking, I'm fine now.

2124
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:00,520
It's big.

2125
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,040
Really? Can you hear that on the first floor?

2126
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,920
I don't know. I'm not on the first floor.

2127
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,200
But I think I can hear it on the first floor.

2128
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,680
Did they hear it?

2129
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,160
They are not in the room.

2130
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,960
I was sitting alone in their room.

2131
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,040
But there are people downstairs.

2132
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,160
I hope this day will come for you.

2133
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,080
Tom can cry for me.

2134
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,720
I don't want to cry for him.

2135
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,360
Okay, do you want some water?

2136
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:27,680
No.

2137
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,280
I'll pour you a drink.

2138
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,320
You rejected my kindness.

2139
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,400
Okay.

2140
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,480
You have to come up later.

2141
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,480
Do you want ice?

2142
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,840
No, I'll write slowly.

2143
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,640
Write it. Forget it.

2144
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,440
If you want to write,

2145
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,640
I won't pour you water.

2146
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,760
So just go back.

2147
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,480
It's okay. I'm just writing.

2148
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:42,840
I was stunned by crying.

2149
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,080
I don't know what to write now.

2150
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,760
Write whatever you want.

2151
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,800
Please.

2152
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,160
I won't pour you water.

2153
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:50,360
Bye.

2154
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,200
After going through the romantic house,

2155
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,000
I was quite torn.

2156
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,520
In the romantic house,

2157
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,560
Hua has clearly rejected it.

2158
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,040
So I'm thinking who I should write to.

2159
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,720
The Luo family. The Su family.

2160
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,560
Where should I put it?

2161
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,920
Personally,

2162
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,760
I'm not good at talking.

2163
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,640
So I think I can write

2164
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,440
I can write it.

2165
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,400
to tell Hua

2166
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,120
you are a great girl.

2167
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,960
and positive.

2168
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,840
There are many things I need to learn.

2169
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,800
I drew that flower when I was writing the draft.

2170
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,360
But it was too ugly.

2171
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,320
Then I thought

2172
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,880
I could just fold a handmade flower.

2173
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,840
I watched a lot of teaching lessons.

2174
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,120
and kept folding.

2175
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,280
I really learned it.

2176
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:40,920
I didn't learn how to use my hand.

2177
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,400
Think about it later. Forget it.

2178
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,360
Failed.

2179
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,320
He is...

2180
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,640
No love line.

2181
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,160
I wrote it to

2182
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,840
a close male friend.

2183
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:27,880
Because I think writing to her

2184
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,680
to her.

2185
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,480
Because we didn't

2186
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,400
discuss

2187
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,560
whether we still have feelings

2188
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,200
Can we continue?

2189
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,240
Because they are explaining

2190
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:46,720
why I did it.

2191
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,240
I want to use this date

2192
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:50,360
whether we can continue

2193
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,360
talk about us

2194
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,800
or choose to be friends,

2195
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,800
I hope we can have

2196
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,400
to have a one-on-one chat with him.

2197
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,200
That's why I wrote this letter to him.

2198
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,320
Are you nervous?

2199
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,560
A little.

2200
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,720
How many letters do you think you've received?

2201
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,040
One.

2202
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,840
How many do you think I received?

2203
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,880
Ten letters?

2204
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,600
Ten letters? That's too much.

2205
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,320
Three.

2206
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,440
Let's see if it's yours.

2207
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,240
or whose.

2208
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,760
Maybe all three are for you.

2209
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,320
Yours.

2210
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,320
I'll close it for you.

2211
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:54,760
You're quite polite.

2212
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:56,920
Let me see who this is for.

2213
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,480
It's for me.

2214
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,600
So popular.

2215
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,280
I opened that envelope

2216
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,520
and saw it folded like a fan.

2217
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,600
I said Fatty.

2218
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,360
I'm actually quite surprised.

2219
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,000
Because I didn't expect Fatty would write to me.

2220
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,280
He really praised me.

2221
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,600
I don't know what to say.

2222
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,160
He said my beauty is my biggest strength.

2223
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,000
When I read this, I...

2224
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,720
You usually look silly.

2225
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,350
I didn't expect you to be so delicate.

2226
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,070
I'm so touched that I'm going to cry.

2227
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,760
You're going to cry.

2228
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,480
Okay.

2229
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,280
I'm very happy

2230
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,280
I'm very happy.

2231
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,550
telling me in the letter

2232
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:05,120
All the present

2233
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,710
It seems ordinary day after day

2234
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:10,160
One day

2235
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,320
I'll make you understand the meaning of persistence.

2236
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,160
hoping that

2237
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,000
to stick to what I love.

2238
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,310
In the end, she said

2239
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:20,080
she invited me to experience

2240
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,070
The cold winter in Beijing is full of love.

2241
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:25,840
I feel very happy and happy.

2242
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,000
When I read this,

2243
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:35,600
In fact,

2244
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,830
who wrote that letter.

2245
01:30:36,830 --> 01:30:38,200
Because he mentioned him crying.

2246
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,230
My first feeling was

2247
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,870
I think he trusts me.

2248
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:45,630
Because in the letter,

2249
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:47,920
he said I comforted him when he cried.

2250
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,400
Other than his sister,

2251
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,120
who noticed his emotions.

2252
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,440
He also thinks I comforted him.

2253
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,760
Because I said before

2254
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,360
I want to be a soup

2255
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,760
a strong tree hole.

2256
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:57,680
So I think

2257
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,920
this time I became a tree hole in the picture.

2258
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,080
And I think

2259
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,960
get closer to him.

2260
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,760
Let me see yours.

2261
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:09,310
No.

2262
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,710
Let's analyze who wrote it.

2263
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,040
Okay.

2264
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,120
I'll check yours first.

2265
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:16,760
before you look at mine.

2266
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:25,400
So...

2267
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:26,430
Just read it.

2268
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:28,720
Let me make it clear.

2269
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,430
I seldom cry.

2270
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,440
In the letter,

2271
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,030
he didn't want anyone to see him cry.

2272
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:37,760
But when you comfort him,

2273
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:38,800
he was happy.

2274
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,280
I didn't see him cry.

2275
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,680
I went after he cried.

2276
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:42,800
How did you comfort him?

2277
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,440
I asked him

2278
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:47,520
If you have something to tell me,

2279
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,120
You can tell me.

2280
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,440
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

2281
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,790
When will you comfort me?

2282
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,190
You never cry here.

2283
01:31:56,190 --> 01:31:57,120
Cry and let me see.

2284
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:57,880
I'll comfort you.

2285
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,800
A punch.

2286
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:07,440
There's a saying in "The Green Leather".

2287
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,320
There are many people in the world.

2288
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,150
We happened to be friends.

2289
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:15,320
So beauty is your weakness.

2290
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:17,600
Okay.

2291
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,200
Stop reading.

2292
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,680
I'll be embarrassed.

2293
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,880
You received two letters

2294
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,280
It's also a kind of recognition for your excellence.

2295
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,960
The picture is full of

2296
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,600
more about his feelings.

2297
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,360
Actually, he didn't write it on you.

2298
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,600
Fatty is full of sisters.

2299
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,550
I still think she is happy.

2300
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,720
The most important thing is she chose what she likes.

2301
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,480
Beauty is only your weak point.

2302
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,440
Okay, I want to see yours.

2303
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,680
Okay, that's it.

2304
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,190
No.

2305
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,400
Hurry up.

2306
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:55,870
Have a look.

2307
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:56,960
Come on.

2308
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,080
Don't even think about the letter.

2309
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,680
It's from Susu.

2310
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,830
She also mentioned in the letter that

2311
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:09,790
at the beginning,

2312
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,390
I found the topic dry.

2313
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:12,880
But when we didn't talk,

2314
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:13,950
I felt comfortable.

2315
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:14,430
So I think

2316
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:15,520
this is a good sign.

2317
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,230
Keep it up.

2318
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:26,720
Nice.

2319
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,360
I suggest we take a photo.

2320
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:31,550
Okay.

2321
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,030
I didn't expect

2322
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:37,240
I could receive two letters.

2323
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,000
Charism.

2324
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:40,880
You're popular.

2325
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:41,790
She's quite charming.

2326
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:48,190
Place it from the top.

2327
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:49,120
You first.

2328
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,000
Don't be so nervous.

2329
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:52,990
One.

2330
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,440
Two. Come on.

2331
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,200
I saw it clearly.

2332
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,480
I'll put it in slowly.

2333
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:00,800
Thank you.

2334
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:12,400
What are you doing?

2335
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,400
Get up.

2336
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,080
I'll pull you up.

2337
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:14,720
Pull me up.

2338
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,000
Harder.

2339
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,880
I'm impressed.

2340
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:19,680
Let's go.

2341
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,270
We can't demolish it so violently.

2342
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,880
Isn't there a squat here?

2343
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:39,440
Excuse me.

2344
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:41,760
Take that.

2345
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,800
Are you a normal person?

2346
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,360
Look, it's all broken.

2347
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,520
No.

2348
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,320
It's the same.

2349
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:53,280
Look at them. They are fine.

2350
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,480
It's broken.

2351
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,040
What a coincidence.

2352
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,040
That's soup.

2353
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,200
How did you know?

2354
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,720
Because I saw it writing "Dear Harry".

2355
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:09,240
Let's take a photo first.

2356
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,840
Why don't you take a photo after you're done?

2357
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,400
Take a photo first.

2358
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:28,480
I'm touched.

2359
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:31,200
It's an interpretation from beginning to end.

2360
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,990
From the first day

2361
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:34,080
to our last day.

2362
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,550
The day before yesterday.

2363
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:39,480
And she took the initiative

2364
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:40,720
what she did yesterday.

2365
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:43,320
I think it's a change of acknowledgment.

2366
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,920
she still cares about me and cares about me.

2367
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,360
So I'm really touched.

2368
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:48,760
My eyes are wet.

2369
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,200
In this letter,

2370
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,760
I can see his growth.

2371
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:01,880
And in the letter,

2372
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,760
in the letter.

2373
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,470
I talked to him about his behavior.

2374
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:08,240
he would think about what he did wrong.

2375
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,270
He might be improving.

2376
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:22,640
I'm done. I'll take a photo too.

2377
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,360
What? Are you crying?

2378
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:35,600
Who knows?

2379
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,680
I've never received a handwritten letter in my life.

2380
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:39,760
Neither have I.

2381
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:40,960
So sincere.

2382
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:43,680
Can I take this with me?

2383
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:45,200
I don't know.

2384
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:46,880
I'll see if they've taken it.

2385
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:47,600
I knew it.

2386
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,920
if I would take it with me.

2387
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,270
Open from the back. There's a small door behind.

2388
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,440
Oh no.

2389
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:55,710
Why are there three letters?

2390
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:58,840
Oh no.

2391
01:36:58,840 --> 01:36:59,390
Do you know the soup?

2392
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:00,640
two texts yesterday?

2393
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:01,790
I don't know.

2394
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,480
He asked me which one was written by you.

2395
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,120
Then I said, "There must be one of them."

2396
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,640
You're always the one who wrote the script.

2397
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:08,880
He can't even tell which one I wrote.

2398
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,680
That's too much.

2399
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:12,990
Who sent the other one?

2400
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,750
Did Xin send it?

2401
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:16,670
I feel...

2402
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:17,630
I think so too.

2403
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,000
Can I see yours?

2404
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:21,120
No.

2405
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:25,040
Can I see yours?

2406
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,040
Let me see it.

2407
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,710
I can show you.

2408
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:28,720
Mine is okay.

2409
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:29,630
Forget it. I don't want to show it to you.

2410
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:30,910
I don't want to see your present.

2411
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,240
Are you going to put it back?

2412
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:35,200
Of course.

2413
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,120
Let's go.

2414
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,400
He wrote a Chinese and an English article.

2415
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,320
He thinks both of us are a little stubborn

2416
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,510
and sensitive.

2417
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:23,480
If he thinks I'm too passive,

2418
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:24,240
he'll be passive too.

2419
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,200
It's not good for both of us to solve the problem together.

2420
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:28,240
So he probably

2421
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,840
to see me being passive,

2422
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:33,470
he still talked to me.

2423
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:23,320
Is there no letter?

2424
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:26,320
It might be awkward if you don't.

2425
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,870
There are two letters every day, but you haven't.

2426
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:29,630
Not today.

2427
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:30,640
The Wang family.

2428
01:39:31,070 --> 01:39:31,960
I dare not look at it.

2429
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:32,640
This is ours.

2430
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,880
Three letters.

2431
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,560
You have two.

2432
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,920
Impossible. Sit here.

2433
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,720
I know who wrote it.

2434
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,160
Terri gave me the letter.

2435
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,550
In fact, he didn't

2436
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:01,790
he didn't express his feelings.

2437
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:03,230
But one sentence impressed me a lot.

2438
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:03,870
He said

2439
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:05,280
he was nervous and nervous

2440
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,760
I was nervous and rushing.

2441
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:08,760
I didn't expect this.

2442
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,720
I thought

2443
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,520
he would feel happy and happy.

2444
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,840
Let's read this letter carefully and read it slowly.

2445
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,000
Xiaoling's letter touched me a lot.

2446
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,550
She wrote that when she was watching

2447
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:28,830
in the video,

2448
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:31,040
others may feel sorry for us.

2449
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,480
and feel sorry for us.

2450
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,630
But she wrote

2451
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:34,270
In her heart,

2452
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:35,920
she thinks

2453
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,640
are so lively and cheerful.

2454
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,670
She admires and respects us.

2455
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:42,240
It seems that since young,

2456
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,870
since I was a kid.

2457
01:40:43,870 --> 01:40:45,630
said this to us.

2458
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,320
It's well written.

2459
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,360
I can tell who it is.

2460
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:51,640
It's so well written.

2461
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:58,270
Me too.

2462
01:40:59,390 --> 01:41:00,400
Look at the next letter.

2463
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:08,400
Xinxin wrote to me mainly to comfort me.

2464
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,840
After the romantic house,

2465
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,760
she thought maybe

2466
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,120
a bit harsh today.

2467
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,590
And she wrote in the letter

2468
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:17,310
She said she saw

2469
01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:19,040
how to get along

2470
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,720
with her siblings.

2471
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,840
She thinks I'm a role model for her.

2472
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:24,800
and communicate with me more.

2473
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:27,920
So does Xinxin.

2474
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:31,600
Do you know how I feel now?

2475
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,240
I feel

2476
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:36,800
full of warmth.

2477
01:41:39,230 --> 01:41:40,640
I think Tae-seo wrote mine.

2478
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,560
He took pictures of me all day.

2479
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,150
I thought we would get along well.

2480
01:41:45,150 --> 01:41:48,440
but it was a bit hasty.

2481
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:50,800
Is he a little awkward?

2482
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,920
I'll take a photo of it.

2483
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,080
I'll review it for him later.

2484
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,480
But when I cried just now,

2485
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:57,280
when I cried?

2486
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:58,880
I want to laugh.

2487
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:01,520
I cried like that.

2488
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:02,480
So what?

2489
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,760
I've never seen you cry.

2490
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:05,240
Indeed.

2491
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,480
So do you know

2492
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:08,600
how important you are to me?

2493
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:11,840
It's as heavy as your weight.

2494
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,680
I'm speechless.

2495
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:18,560
Then I won't lose weight.

2496
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,670
Then don't eat tonight.

2497
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:22,590
Fine.

2498
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:25,520
Let's go.

2499
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:26,840
Let's go.

2500
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,600
The Yuan family?

2501
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,400
I don't think so.

2502
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,200
Okay, no.

2503
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:44,880
After I moved in,

2504
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,320
Hua has been choosing me.

2505
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:48,920
I think

2506
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:51,000
only Hua Hua would write to me.

2507
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,640
But I didn't receive it.

2508
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,000
I'm a little disappointed.

2509
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,720
This is ours.

2510
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,440
Take a look.

2511
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,560
Who will write for us?

2512
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,160
Can one person write a lot?

2513
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:27,480
Sit down.

2514
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:36,990
I don't understand.

2515
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,080
To Fatty, this is an invitation for a date.

2516
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:40,960
I still think

2517
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,360
between us.

2518
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,720
So I hope there is another chance

2519
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,680
to meet each other again.

2520
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,800
I'm thinking about how I feel right now.

2521
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,030
So I want to use this chance to forget it.

2522
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:53,760
Whether it's happy or unhappy,

2523
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:54,320
I have a chance

2524
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,350
to measure my thoughts again.

2525
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:57,520
I might be a little selfish.

2526
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,240
But this date

2527
01:43:58,240 --> 01:43:59,320
this date.

2528
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:00,480
So I'll see you then.

2529
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,440
I don't understand.

2530
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:08,080
When I read this letter,

2531
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,520
I was totally confused.

2532
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:10,910
She's still struggling.

2533
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:14,360
She still wants to know more about Fatty.

2534
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,720
and date Fatty.

2535
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,160
This behavior makes me confused.

2536
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,440
Because one hour ago,

2537
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:27,870
a very clear conversation.

2538
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:29,470
In five minutes,

2539
01:44:29,470 --> 01:44:30,960
in five minutes.

2540
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,030
I don't understand.

2541
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:32,480
Let's go.

2542
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,280
There's nothing to talk about.

2543
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:46,640
You're back.

2544
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,120
You haven't eaten yet?

2545
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:48,880
Let's eat.

2546
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,520
Go and eat. I've kept some for you.

2547
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:21,520
It's not worth it for Fatty.

2548
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:23,040
We are sincerely

2549
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,240
with sincerity.

2550
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,120
because there may be some misunderstandings,

2551
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,600
Hua and I are also good friends.

2552
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:32,400
I think good friends should play straight.

2553
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,040
and talk to each other.

2554
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,920
If she could tell me,

2555
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,880
I wouldn't have such emotions.

2556
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:43,710
You're back.

2557
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:48,030
What's wrong?

2558
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,240
I don't understand.

2559
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:56,030
Let's go to Romantic House.

2560
01:45:56,030 --> 01:45:57,360
Hua has made it clear.

2561
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:58,910
she's in contact with Tae-seo.

2562
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:00,830
It also means

2563
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:03,230
she doesn't care about Fatty anymore.

2564
01:46:03,230 --> 01:46:05,470
She's really getting to know Tae-ri now.

2565
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:07,360
And the misunderstanding has been cleared.

2566
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,830
It means we've made things clear.

2567
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:12,440
She wrote this letter to Fatty.

2568
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,040
Date.

2569
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,600
They must have different ideas.

2570
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:17,760
But I don't understand.

2571
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:20,510
I thought I was unnecessary.

2572
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:22,110
I was still thinking when I came back,

2573
01:46:22,110 --> 01:46:23,600
because she cried at the map.

2574
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,080
she must be very upset.

2575
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:26,320
So I was wondering

2576
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:27,440
if we were too harsh.

2577
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,520
Because it's like three-on-one.

2578
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,840
I'm afraid

2579
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,520
what would she think?

2580
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,070
She said

2581
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,750
I think I'm still thinking about my feelings.

2582
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:43,870
Let's go on a date.

2583
01:46:44,830 --> 01:46:46,400
So let's have a good chat.

2584
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:48,640
First,

2585
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:50,750
you did show that you like flowers.

2586
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:52,640
And Hua clearly said

2587
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,320
she knew Fatty likes her.

2588
01:46:55,230 --> 01:46:55,870
But she said

2589
01:46:55,870 --> 01:46:57,600
she's now in contact with Terri.

2590
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,800
That means

2591
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:00,440
I don't like you.

2592
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:03,640
Stop texting me how you feel.

2593
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,350
I didn't say anything else.

2594
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:05,760
That means you said it directly.

2595
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,070
It means no.

2596
01:47:07,070 --> 01:47:09,310
And the end of our chat is refusing.

2597
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:12,510
Then what did you write this letter for?

2598
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:13,440
I'll get you some paper.

2599
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,110
Don't cry.

2600
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,960
I'm so sad.

2601
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,000
That's...

2602
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:22,910
It's...

2603
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,240
If

2604
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,160
you are...

2605
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,120
For example, when the four of us

2606
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:29,560
sitting there and chatting,

2607
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:31,480
you did say

2608
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:34,000
you know Fatty likes you.

2609
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,280
and you have feelings for Fatty.

2610
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,590
And you do have feelings for Tae-ri now.

2611
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:40,280
Can you explain your feelings?

2612
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:41,630
How about consolation?

2613
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:43,230
You are

2614
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:45,240
You are

2615
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,800
a reserved state.

2616
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,640
Then you write this letter. Everything makes sense.

2617
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:54,160
I can understand that you're in contact with her.

2618
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:55,870
I don't think she likes Tae-ri either.

2619
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:56,990
You know what?

2620
01:47:56,990 --> 01:47:58,200
But

2621
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,880
she changed so fast.

2622
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,230
I did have

2623
01:48:03,230 --> 01:48:06,800
I'm not saying what to do.

2624
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:11,040
Don't cry.

2625
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,480
Your eyes are swollen.

2626
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:31,360
What are you doing?

2627
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:32,670
What are you doing?

2628
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:33,720
Rest.

2629
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:34,110
What's wrong?

2630
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:36,080
I have something to tell you.

2631
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:39,320
When we were at the House of Feelings,

2632
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:41,760
Harry suddenly told me

2633
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,070
he received two letters yesterday.

2634
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:44,440
He didn't know which one was yours.

2635
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,480
When I went back,

2636
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,480
I wanted to say,

2637
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:48,560
if you don't understand,

2638
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,160
I'll explain it to you.

2639
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,320
Do you know

2640
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:53,400
that texted you yesterday?

2641
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,040
I guessed for a while.

2642
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:55,710
You guessed for a while.

2643
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:56,400
And then?

2644
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,440
You didn't guess it.

2645
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:58,040
Yes.

2646
01:48:58,040 --> 01:48:58,960
I think so.

2647
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:00,990
There should be something else.

2648
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,680
Su Zihao guessed it for you.

2649
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,480
You can't tell it at all.

2650
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,680
I can see it.

2651
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,240
But let me confirm with him.

2652
01:49:11,230 --> 01:49:12,560
Do you know what I mean?

2653
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:14,040
Yes.

2654
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:14,590
You do.

2655
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:15,550
You don't even know which one I sent.

2656
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:16,600
Can you understand?

2657
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,800
I guessed it.

2658
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:21,680
Okay.

2659
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:23,200
Are you happy?

2660
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:25,600
Are you happy to receive two letters?

2661
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:27,320
No.

2662
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:30,110
I just went to the siblings' house.

2663
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,160
Because you read my letter.

2664
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:32,800
No.

2665
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:35,840
Okay.

2666
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,630
Are you happy to receive two?

2667
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:39,040
No, I'm sad.

2668
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:39,710
Why?

2669
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,360
Why are you so sad?

2670
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:42,880
I don't know if I'm happy or sad.

2671
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:44,350
Then you are happy.

2672
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:45,520
It's okay.

2673
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,070
I'm fine.

2674
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:49,040
No.

2675
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:54,480
I think the text I sent

2676
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,280
you don't understand what I mean.

2677
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:57,470
Right? You didn't ask me.

2678
01:49:58,430 --> 01:49:59,640
I thought you wouldn't let me ask.

2679
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:00,440
Really?

2680
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:01,310
I'm afraid you won't understand.

2681
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:02,960
So I'm here to tell you.

2682
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,640
It's okay. I understand.

2683
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,520
You understand everything.

2684
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:06,430
I understand every single one.

2685
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:08,990
I think it was easy to understand the previous one.

2686
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,560
I was very careless just now.

2687
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,430
I wanted to see if I could take the letter.

2688
01:50:14,430 --> 01:50:15,920
I saw three letters from you.

2689
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:16,990
So I came to ask you.

2690
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:18,520
I really didn't mean it.

2691
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:20,960
I took a look.

2692
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:22,160
It's okay.

2693
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:22,750
Maybe

2694
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,150
my brothers are more popular.

2695
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:28,320
Really?

2696
01:50:28,350 --> 01:50:29,840
Did you receive a letter?

2697
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:30,720
Yes.

2698
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:32,160
You only received one letter.

2699
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,520
You received several.

2700
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:34,520
No.

2701
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,760
I received a letter.

2702
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:37,680
Okay.

2703
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:38,520
Okay, let's go.

2704
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,440
I'm observing both of them.

2705
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,590
As for being friends,

2706
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:16,280
I may not know how I feel.

2707
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:19,230
I'm not feeling better.

2708
01:51:19,230 --> 01:51:20,670
I'm still thinking about my feelings.

2709
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:23,600
if I can still contact her.

2710
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,830
The moment I received her text,

2711
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:29,840
I was happy.

2712
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:35,280
I still sent the message to Harry.

2713
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,280
In the letter today,

2714
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:39,040
in the letter today.

2715
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,640
So in today's message,

2716
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:42,880
I criticized

2717
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,920
I mocked his letter.

2718
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:45,630
I said

2719
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:47,120
Even kindergarten is better than yours.

2720
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:49,440
In the letter he wrote to me, he said

2721
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:52,350
he wanted me to only receive his letter.

2722
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:54,750
He didn't want anyone to go on a date with me.

2723
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:56,920
So I replied to him

2724
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,430
in that text message.

2725
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:00,960
I said I only received your letter.

2726
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,400
That's why I don't date anyone.

2727
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,960
It's like giving him an answer.

2728
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:27,160
I know Tata.

2729
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:28,510
I'm very happy to receive the text today.

2730
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:30,910
Since the night of siblings,

2731
01:53:30,910 --> 01:53:32,670
my text messages are very long.

2732
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:33,630
I promised her

2733
01:53:33,630 --> 01:53:34,840
I'll write an essay to her friend.

2734
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:36,560
I'll definitely keep my promise.

2735
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,200
I think as long as she is happy.

2736
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,400
I received

2737
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,400
from him.

2738
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,870
The day before yesterday, I told him

2739
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:50,040
he wasn't emotionless.

2740
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:51,390
And today,

2741
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,920
a lot today.

2742
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,120
And the emotions are in place.

2743
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:22,270
I sent my message to soup today.

2744
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:24,030
The first sentence I sent was

2745
01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:24,600
is from

2746
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:25,200
a line

2747
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,120
a line from a drama.

2748
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:28,880
When I run to the moon,

2749
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:31,000
I hope the moon is running towards me.

2750
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,240
What I want to say is

2751
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:35,160
I'm trying to overcome my personality

2752
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:37,400
and trying to get close to you.

2753
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:42,270
I hope you can give me the same feedback.

2754
01:54:42,270 --> 01:54:45,680
In my opinion,

2755
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:47,600
when I'm approaching you,

2756
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,360
even if

2757
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:52,320
who doesn't approach others,

2758
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:55,230
I hope you'll be different from me.

2759
01:54:55,230 --> 01:54:56,510
One more thing.

2760
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:58,400
I like flowers.

2761
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,350
I prefer white roses.

2762
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:02,110
I think she might be saying

2763
01:55:02,110 --> 01:55:03,440
the letter I wrote to her.

2764
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,200
He wrote that

2765
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:06,520
I'm like a white rose.

2766
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,830
Because on our date,

2767
01:55:08,830 --> 01:55:10,270
he did give me white roses.

2768
01:55:10,270 --> 01:55:12,190
She likes white roses.

2769
01:55:12,190 --> 01:55:13,400
It means

2770
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:17,680
the flowers I chose

2771
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,000
has a different meaning.

2772
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:50,200
Because I read her letter.

2773
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:53,720
I wanted to give her a good response.

2774
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:56,560
I don't want her to think her letter was written in vain.

2775
01:56:00,190 --> 01:56:00,670
After reading it,

2776
01:56:00,670 --> 01:56:02,750
I couldn't help laughing.

2777
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:03,480
Actually,

2778
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:04,960
I just came out of the siblings' house

2779
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:06,040
I'm just shy.

2780
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,200
I can't calm myself down.

2781
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,240
So in bed

2782
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:09,760
listening to the song.

2783
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:13,150
I think he's quite cute.

2784
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,960
His message today

2785
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:19,120
as a feedback for the letter.

2786
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:20,320
I'm quite happy.

2787
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,960
I did work hard.

2788
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:25,400
work hard.

2789
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:27,520
It feels like I got the correct feedback.

2790
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:55,360
The message I received

2791
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,800
Xiaoling sent it to me.

2792
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:01,880
The person I sent is the map.

2793
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:03,840
I added a fake number.

2794
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:04,760
The expression of Big D.

2795
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:06,640
Like this.

2796
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:08,320
Just send him a message.

2797
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,630
Tell him I'm here.

2798
01:57:09,630 --> 01:57:11,200
I want to send him this message.

2799
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:16,080
I was worried

2800
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,840
I was afraid that people would see my sad side.

2801
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,480
But after she came,

2802
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,430
I can let go of myself.

2803
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:23,840
my sense of security and shame.

2804
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:24,760
to share

2805
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:27,520
my feelings and process.

2806
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:28,880
After I told her,

2807
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:31,070
I felt much relieved.

2808
01:57:31,070 --> 01:57:32,350
I think Xiaoling

2809
01:57:32,350 --> 01:57:34,910
is the only one

2810
01:57:34,910 --> 01:57:36,160
who can let my guard down

2811
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:37,840
who can communicate

2812
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:39,600
who can communicate with.

2813
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:53,280
The text is quite obvious.

2814
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,040
It's just a picture.

2815
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:55,440
He said I would comfort him when he was crying.

2816
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,280
He said he would be touched.

2817
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:58,430
Then he said,

2818
01:57:58,430 --> 01:58:00,000
although his piano talent is average,

2819
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,880
I can't beat him in five-piece chess.

2820
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:02,640
How many rounds did we play?

2821
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:03,520
I didn't beat him.

2822
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,280
Then he became proud of it.

2823
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:06,560
That's why I said this is the map.

2824
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:10,590
I sent it to Xiaoling today.

2825
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:11,160
I think

2826
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:13,680
the way I get along with Xiaoling

2827
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:14,680
understand each other

2828
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:16,880
and understand each other's emotions.

2829
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:18,080
Like family.

2830
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:30,720
I'm surprised. Two letters.

2831
01:58:43,230 --> 01:58:44,600
I guess it's Fatty.

2832
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:45,470
Because I lost to him

2833
01:58:45,470 --> 01:58:47,230
I lost to him.

2834
01:58:47,230 --> 01:58:48,670
So I think Fatty sent it.

2835
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:50,750
I think Fatty sent me this message.

2836
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:52,240
Maybe he and Hua

2837
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:53,760
are not going well.

2838
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:56,830
Maybe he doesn't know who to send it to.

2839
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:07,710
I sent my message to Xiaoling.

2840
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,200
It's about ping pong.

2841
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:14,880
I'm just kidding. I won.

2842
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,280
Tell her to keep up the good work.

2843
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,920
We're just friends.

2844
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:18,840
My feelings.

2845
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:20,280
It's a text message called friendship.

2846
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:48,160
I texted Hwa today.

2847
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:50,840
I sent her to take care of her health.

2848
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:53,360
I know she's not feeling well these days.

2849
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,800
I want to express my concern for her.

2850
02:00:11,390 --> 02:00:12,440
I'm hesitating

2851
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:15,320
between the two boys.

2852
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:16,640
I follow my heart.

2853
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:19,600
I only respect my own choice.

2854
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:27,000
I'm very confident.

2855
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,280
Because Hua does give me

2856
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:29,310
a lot.

2857
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:31,760
between the two,

2858
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:34,910
her real expression

2859
02:00:34,910 --> 02:00:37,310
whether she wants to be someone

2860
02:00:37,310 --> 02:00:38,800
or someone who can explain.

2861
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,120
I think it makes sense.

2862
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:41,200
The remote control

2863
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,360
is in the girl's hands.

2864
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:43,200
It's fine.

2865
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:11,960
It's obviously flower-haired.

2866
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:13,790
This is the longest text

2867
02:01:13,790 --> 02:01:16,960
for so many days.

2868
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:19,360
Because she explained

2869
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,640
why I didn't

2870
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,040
I didn't go to the romantic house.

2871
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:24,160
and why they didn't give me the letter.

2872
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:37,120
Maybe before I came here,

2873
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:38,680
before I came here.

2874
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:39,800
There might be

2875
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,120
between them.

2876
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:43,200
When you see it,

2877
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:44,440
Please understand.

2878
02:01:47,710 --> 02:01:49,950
I sent my message to Tae-seo.

2879
02:01:49,950 --> 02:01:51,840
It says clearly in the message.

2880
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:52,600
Before he came in,

2881
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,110
I've been in touch with Fatty.

2882
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:55,040
with Fatty.

2883
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,400
But there was a misunderstanding between me and Fatty.

2884
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:57,630
So I told Terri

2885
02:01:57,630 --> 02:02:00,160
my current state

2886
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:03,000
I'm observing both of them.

2887
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:09,520
So I think I can be sure

2888
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,360
I can be sure

2889
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:12,670
what I really want.

2890
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:35,280
Since you want to write to me,

2891
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:35,920
and go on a date with me,

2892
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:36,720
Text me how you feel.

2893
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:37,680
You're so good at apologizing.

2894
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:38,560
Please apologize to me.

2895
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:39,120
No.

2896
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:40,560
She kept sending it to Tae-seo.

2897
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:46,720
She didn't send a message to express her feelings.

2898
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:48,320
Take it to apologize

2899
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:50,750
You don't use it to express your love.

2900
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:51,800
Give me an explanation.

2901
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:53,920
This is Hua.

2902
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:09,040
I wrote this message.

2903
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,800
I didn't care about Fatty.

2904
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,080
whether Fatty or not.

2905
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:14,800
I hope one more time

2906
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:16,830
with Tarri and Fatty

2907
02:03:16,830 --> 02:03:18,960
each of you

2908
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,440
for each other.

2909
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:23,070
so that I can understand my feelings.

2910
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:26,590
Because I think both of them

2911
02:03:26,590 --> 02:03:28,880
haven't released

2912
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:30,720
to me.

2913
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,240
I have to find it myself.

2914
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:33,470
How much

2915
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:35,120
my feelings for them?

2916
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:16,720
My brother didn't receive any message from you.

2917
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:18,720
Our ignorance has reached the top.

2918
02:04:19,550 --> 02:04:21,600
After talking,

2919
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:23,120
Then write a letter

2920
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:26,480
Then send a message.

2921
02:04:26,910 --> 02:04:28,880
I feel like I'm getting along with three girls.

2922
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:29,840
Well,

2923
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:30,640
I don't understand.

2924
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:43,160
What are you doing?

2925
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:45,280
I want to talk to Tae-seo.

2926
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:46,360
Talk to him.

2927
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:07,870
Did you know

2928
02:05:07,870 --> 02:05:09,280
I was in contact with Fatty?

2929
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:10,320
Didn't you tell me?

2930
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:10,800
Fragrant juice wine.

2931
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:13,840
I didn't contact Fatty on the first day.

2932
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:15,280
I only met Fatty the next day.

2933
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:16,190
We went to the supermarket together.

2934
02:05:16,190 --> 02:05:17,310
Then we got along.

2935
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:19,040
And we had our first date.

2936
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:22,520
After the first date,

2937
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:23,800
the two of us

2938
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:25,680
still have feelings for each other.

2939
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:27,280
The feelings and texts

2940
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,670
to each other.

2941
02:05:28,670 --> 02:05:30,910
Maybe we think we get along too fast.

2942
02:05:30,910 --> 02:05:32,030
We had a chat.

2943
02:05:32,030 --> 02:05:34,160
We said we hope we can

2944
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:36,920
to know more about other girls.

2945
02:05:37,470 --> 02:05:37,760
Okay.

2946
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:38,360
He said yes.

2947
02:05:38,910 --> 02:05:40,080
That's what I told him.

2948
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,360
and he listened.

2949
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:42,520
That morning,

2950
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:44,560
he got the letter.

2951
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,790
He gave it to Xiao Ling.

2952
02:05:45,790 --> 02:05:47,320
After the sports day,

2953
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:49,150
he also sent it to Xiao Ling.

2954
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:49,680
That's normal.

2955
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:50,960
Because he stays with her every day.

2956
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:51,320
Yes.

2957
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:52,600
They went on a date too.

2958
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:54,110
When he came back, he said

2959
02:05:54,110 --> 02:05:55,640
he made something for Xiaoling.

2960
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:56,440
Then I thought

2961
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:57,840
Maybe, right?

2962
02:05:58,750 --> 02:05:59,550
Then you came in.

2963
02:05:59,550 --> 02:06:00,760
We came in by accident.

2964
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:02,480
I came in again.

2965
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:03,070
I played all day.

2966
02:06:03,070 --> 02:06:03,600
Because we

2967
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,880
for a whole day.

2968
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:05,200
right?

2969
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:06,960
I think it's good.

2970
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,080
And he said

2971
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:09,520
He said he liked his first date.

2972
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:10,480
or the second date?

2973
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:11,550
So sharp.

2974
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:16,030
You...

2975
02:06:16,510 --> 02:06:17,470
My answer is the same.

2976
02:06:17,470 --> 02:06:18,750
I said I liked the second date.

2977
02:06:20,190 --> 02:06:20,720
That day,

2978
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:22,960
when we watched the footage together,

2979
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,880
I asked him who he sent it to today.

2980
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:26,320
He said you didn't know?

2981
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:27,120
I said, "How do I know?"

2982
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:28,160
Then I didn't answer.

2983
02:06:28,160 --> 02:06:31,480
The text I sent you that day was...

2984
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:32,760
I know. I remember.

2985
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:33,790
Then I saw

2986
02:06:33,790 --> 02:06:35,280
Fatty didn't receive my message,

2987
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:36,440
before he got my message.

2988
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:37,920
I'm Tu Tu to comfort him.

2989
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,160
because I gave him a signal.

2990
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:41,840
he thought

2991
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,990
I'm texting you about my feelings.

2992
02:06:44,990 --> 02:06:46,200
Then I asked Tu to chase him.

2993
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:47,550
Both sides.

2994
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:49,630
Yes, he has a point.

2995
02:06:49,630 --> 02:06:50,000
So I think

2996
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,080
I should tell you today.

2997
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,360
I think you wrote a letter to me.

2998
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:55,120
But

2999
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,040
I'm sorry

3000
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,360
I'm sorry.

3001
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:58,840
It's okay.

3002
02:06:58,840 --> 02:06:59,920
But I know

3003
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:02,590
Through this lesson,

3004
02:07:02,590 --> 02:07:03,920
I think I need to make it clear.

3005
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:11,120
When you didn't receive my letter,

3006
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:13,150
You mean

3007
02:07:13,150 --> 02:07:14,110
when I didn't receive your letter?

3008
02:07:14,110 --> 02:07:14,880
when I didn't receive your letter?

3009
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:16,760
Are you?

3010
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:17,630
A little.

3011
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:18,800
I went to see

3012
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:19,390
Because

3013
02:07:19,390 --> 02:07:21,950
you're the only one who can give it to me.

3014
02:07:23,230 --> 02:07:25,120
I got it when I went to get it.

3015
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:28,160
Then I came out.

3016
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:28,880
What else can I do?

3017
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:31,550
What should I do?

3018
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:32,760
But you still chose

3019
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:34,000
to send me your message.

3020
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:34,640
Yes.

3021
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:41,600
Maybe Tae-ri

3022
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:43,120
A little.

3023
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:44,320
I was disappointed.

3024
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:45,920
Because I didn't receive the letter.

3025
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:48,000
I wanted the atmosphere to be happier.

3026
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:48,560
Relax.

3027
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,040
I don't want him

3028
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:51,680
not to be unhappy after receiving my letter.

3029
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:52,400
But in my opinion,

3030
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:54,520
I might be a little overwhelmed.

3031
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:55,230
But maybe

3032
02:07:55,230 --> 02:07:57,240
he's a mature man.

3033
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:57,920
Maybe

3034
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:04,830
Hua asked me to explain this alone.

3035
02:08:04,830 --> 02:08:06,880
About the romantic house and the envelope.

3036
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:08,240
I'm quite surprised.

3037
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:11,200
But I'm definitely happy inside.

3038
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:12,880
I have to tell you what I think.

3039
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,910
And you can also

3040
02:08:14,910 --> 02:08:17,240
change yourself according to my opinion.

3041
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:18,840
You want me to contact other girls again?

3042
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:20,480
I didn't.

3043
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:21,920
I didn't.

3044
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:22,840
Yes.

3045
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:24,190
I didn't say that.

3046
02:08:24,190 --> 02:08:25,470
Then why

3047
02:08:25,470 --> 02:08:27,840
when we were playing that video?

3048
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:29,440
What did you say?

3049
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,710
You won't get a chance if you don't contact him now.

3050
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:33,080
Because time is almost over.

3051
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:33,630
It's been so many days.

3052
02:08:33,630 --> 02:08:35,070
That's true.

3053
02:08:35,070 --> 02:08:36,120
I don't want to touch anything.

3054
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:37,310
I would have done it sooner.

3055
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:39,710
Let's go.

3056
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:41,440
Go down.

3057
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,480
I want some honey.

3058
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:49,760
What do you want to drink? I'll make it for you.

3059
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:51,870
What do you want to drink?

3060
02:08:51,870 --> 02:08:54,200
What do you want to drink, Yinbo?

3061
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:58,880
What do you want to drink?

3062
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:00,830
No need. I just want some water.

3063
02:09:00,830 --> 02:09:02,640
Drink some water. I'll get it for you.

3064
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:02,880
Come on.

3065
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:03,480
What are you doing?

3066
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:04,880
I'll get you some water.

3067
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:05,950
You want hot or cold?

3068
02:09:05,950 --> 02:09:07,000
or honey water?

3069
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,600
Honey lemon

3070
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:11,040
You really ordered it

3071
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:11,870
Make some.

3072
02:09:11,870 --> 02:09:12,670
Since you said so,

3073
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:13,760
Why should I be polite to you?

3074
02:09:14,750 --> 02:09:16,510
Don't mention it.

3075
02:09:16,510 --> 02:09:17,470
Okay.

3076
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:19,680
Are you really going to Beijing?

3077
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:20,960
So you really want to come to Beijing?

3078
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:24,000
Shanghai?

3079
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,040
Really?

3080
02:09:28,350 --> 02:09:29,840
Sure.

3081
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:31,000
The bag is here to pick you up.

3082
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:31,600
Okay.

3083
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:37,080
Let me help you.

3084
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:40,400
I'm not used to it.

3085
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:42,590
I'm afraid you'll be agitated and nervous.

3086
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:45,920
More. It’s not that sweet.

3087
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:47,600
Let me help you, Yinbo.

3088
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:49,920
What are you doing?

3089
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,070
I kept chasing him and shouting.

3090
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:52,280
Yinbo.

3091
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:53,040
Pour him some water.

3092
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:54,240
To make him happy,

3093
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:56,760
I’ll do something I can do.

3094
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:58,560
Can I beat you, Yinbo?

3095
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:02,320
Say something if you win.

3096
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:03,480
What if I win?

3097
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:04,000
Let's make a bet.

3098
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:05,920
Do whatever you say.

3099
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:07,520
I promise.

3100
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:16,080
What are you two doing?

3101
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:17,080
I walked five steps.

3102
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:18,270
I won five-in-a-row.

3103
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:19,870
I'll set up the formation.

3104
02:10:19,870 --> 02:10:21,310
Just tell me if you want me to make a request.

3105
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:22,270
You don't have to.

3106
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:24,030
No, do it again.

3107
02:10:24,030 --> 02:10:25,280
I'm going to laugh to death.

3108
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:25,720
I didn't.

3109
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:28,440
I just set up the formation.

3110
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:29,080
Set up the formation?

3111
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:30,320
I'm really setting up the formation.

3112
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:32,000
Do you want me to...

3113
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:32,830
Of course not.

3114
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:34,080
Yinbo.

3115
02:10:34,590 --> 02:10:35,920
Yinbo.

3116
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:40,670
Why did you lose?

3117
02:10:40,670 --> 02:10:41,280
Okay, go ahead.

3118
02:10:41,790 --> 02:10:42,560
There's no water.

3119
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,600
I'm thirsty.

3120
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:47,320
Add some honey

3121
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:48,320
OK.

3122
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:53,600
I’ll pour it for you whether I lose or not.

3123
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:54,360
You lost on purpose.

3124
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:54,910
Thank you.

3125
02:10:54,910 --> 02:10:55,440
Yes.

3126
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:56,600
I knew you were going to add water.

3127
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:57,920
I saw it.

3128
02:10:59,550 --> 02:11:00,280
Because I was playing a game.

3129
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:01,760
I lost. Pour him some water.

3130
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,320
I think the atmosphere

3131
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:05,630
we get along.

3132
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:06,360
Yinbo.

3133
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:06,840
This...

3134
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:08,280
What else do you want to eat?

3135
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:09,950
I'll use mine first.

3136
02:11:09,950 --> 02:11:10,520
What do you want to eat?

3137
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:11,600
This one.

3138
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:12,510
Come on.

3139
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:14,720
The process of playing five-piece chess

3140
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:16,440
our relationship

3141
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:18,360
for us.

3142
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:19,160
Flowers too.

3143
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:19,800
Yeah.

3144
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:20,510
OK, Yinbo.

3145
02:11:20,510 --> 02:11:21,360
Let me get you some water.

3146
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:22,520
How is it?

3147
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:24,480
I feel relaxed and happy.

3148
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:25,520
I almost stepped on you.

3149
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:26,320
It's okay, Yinbo.

3150
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:28,190
I won’t blame you even if you step on me.

3151
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:35,230
Good night, Yinbo.

3152
02:11:35,230 --> 02:11:36,720
See you tomorrow.

3153
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,160
Good night.

3154
02:12:17,310 --> 02:12:19,120
When I saw that text,

3155
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:20,830
I felt that

3156
02:12:20,830 --> 02:12:22,520
I may have another chance

3157
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:24,640
to have more contact with Hua.

3158
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:25,470
more.

3159
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:28,120
So I chose this date.

3160
02:12:29,790 --> 02:12:31,800
With this confidence.

3161
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:34,110
I can only choose whether I go on a date.

3162
02:12:34,110 --> 02:12:35,480
And I chose

3163
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:36,240
to go on a date.

3164
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:38,360
I'll think

3165
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:40,510
Harry will go on a date too.

3166
02:12:44,030 --> 02:12:46,160
If you decide to go on a date alone,

3167
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:47,640
you can choose again.

3168
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:48,600
Of course.

3169
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:51,280
Definitely send it once.

3170
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:55,160
I'll send it to a date.

3171
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:57,120
That text said

3172
02:12:57,120 --> 02:12:58,910
if both of them choose not to go on dates at the same time,

3173
02:12:58,910 --> 02:13:00,640
neither of them will go on a date.

3174
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:01,720
But if both of them choose to go,

3175
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:03,200
there's still a chance to choose again.

3176
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:04,920
Then I choose to

3177
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:05,280
Right?

3178
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:06,520
At least I'll see if she's going.

3179
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:07,600
If she doesn't, I'll go directly.

3180
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:08,350
Isn't that better?

3181
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:13,720
Take it

3182
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:15,870
Let it go

3183
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,720
I think Harry and Tata

3184
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:20,030
have had a deep conversation.

3185
02:13:20,030 --> 02:13:21,630
And I think

3186
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:24,160
I don't talk to soup

3187
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:26,360
with soup soup.

3188
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:28,160
So I thought

3189
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:31,070
I should strive for this chance.

3190
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:38,240
No.

3191
02:13:42,910 --> 02:13:44,400
I thought about the second text.

3192
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,760
I thought a lot.

3193
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:46,590
Tata has no siblings.

3194
02:13:46,590 --> 02:13:47,550
So she will definitely go.

3195
02:13:47,550 --> 02:13:48,240
She must go.

3196
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:49,920
I don't think she'll be with Tae-seo.

3197
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:51,360
I'll think about

3198
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:52,560
How should I explain to Tata?

3199
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:53,470
Will Tata be mad at me?

3200
02:13:53,470 --> 02:13:54,200
I was in a dilemma.

3201
02:14:09,790 --> 02:14:10,480
In a relationship,

3202
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:12,670
I don't like people who are indecisive.

3203
02:14:12,670 --> 02:14:14,110
I like you for choosing someone firmly.

3204
02:14:14,110 --> 02:14:15,680
And the Tata letter also mentioned

3205
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:16,830
what I said.

3206
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:18,880
Then I chose to go.

3207
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:26,590
Although I know

3208
02:14:26,590 --> 02:14:27,640
my brothers

3209
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:29,040
fight for this chance.

3210
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,480
But I just...

3211
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,080
Okay, you try and I'll try.

3212
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:33,280
and see who will get it.

3213
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:35,160
If it doesn't work, then don't go.

3214
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:42,560
So annoying.

3215
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:43,520
I really...

3216
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:44,830
I want to kill Su Ziyi now.

3217
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:58,430
I'm speechless.

3218
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:00,760
You are really

3219
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:01,600
I really...

3220
02:15:08,350 --> 02:15:09,040
Really

3221
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:10,200
So funny

3222
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:11,550
Who knows family

3223
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:13,280
Really

3224
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:14,360
I haven't had a date for a long time.

3225
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:15,320
I want to go on a date.

3226
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:19,440
So annoying.

3227
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:20,830
I haven't been on a date for a long time.

3228
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:29,120
I'm so tired.

3229
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:39,390
I hesitated for the third time.

3230
02:15:39,390 --> 02:15:40,640
whether I should go

3231
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:42,000
give this opportunity to him.

3232
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,800
I think Harry and Tata

3233
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:45,440
Maybe after they

3234
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,390
after they left the house

3235
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:48,920
after leaving the house.

3236
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:50,960
The soup and I are stuffy and slow to warm up.

3237
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:53,840
I should fight for this chance.

3238
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:00,440
I thought about it.

3239
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:02,200
I think our relationship

3240
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,710
is a step closer

3241
02:16:03,710 --> 02:16:04,320
than my sister and soup.

3242
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:04,760
I said,

3243
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:05,240
Fine.

3244
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:06,640
Give my sister a chance.

3245
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:16,320
My first reaction is

3246
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:18,080
I want to make Tom happy.

3247
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:18,480
I think

3248
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:19,840
he should spend more time with Susu.

3249
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:21,720
because they had a quarrel two days ago.

3250
02:16:22,910 --> 02:16:23,920
But when I said

3251
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:25,720
I deleted those words

3252
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:27,120
I deleted it again.

3253
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:33,440
To be honest, I really want to go on a date with Tu.

3254
02:16:33,440 --> 02:16:34,590
I think...

3255
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:43,920
But after thinking about it,

3256
02:16:44,510 --> 02:16:45,440
I still

3257
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,190
I'm not going on a date.

3258
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:54,719
I feel a little sad.

3259
02:16:54,719 --> 02:16:56,600
But I still pressed it.

3260
02:16:56,600 --> 02:16:58,040
Because

3261
02:16:58,040 --> 02:17:01,280
I think when I choose between the two,

3262
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:02,680
I think I will put Tom

3263
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:03,840
in the first place.

3264
02:17:09,629 --> 02:17:10,200
To me,

3265
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,830
no one is more important than Tom.

3266
02:17:12,830 --> 02:17:14,559
He should be able to guess.

3267
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:19,840
I want her to go.

3268
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:22,320
But I don't think she'll choose her.

3269
02:17:27,799 --> 02:17:30,080
I do think she will choose me. I don't want to go.

3270
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:31,120
And I think

3271
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:33,280
I don't want both my sister and I to choose. I don't want to go.

3272
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:34,910
So I chose I want to go.

3273
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:48,480
What?

3274
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:49,400
Are you going on a date?

3275
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:54,110
Go.

3276
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:55,230
Okay?

3277
02:17:55,230 --> 02:17:56,559
I'm going to wash my hair again.

3278
02:17:57,680 --> 02:17:58,559
That's bad.

3279
02:17:58,559 --> 02:17:59,639
I'm going to be a sinner forever.

3280
02:17:59,639 --> 02:18:01,200
But it's okay.

3281
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:02,320
Maybe she understands.

3282
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:04,000
I think you can explain to her.

3283
02:18:05,309 --> 02:18:06,110
Because I know

3284
02:18:06,110 --> 02:18:07,870
he must have had a huge psychological fight.

3285
02:18:07,870 --> 02:18:11,389
Because he has to think about what Tata will think.

3286
02:18:11,389 --> 02:18:13,280
So I'm very grateful

3287
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:15,680
Harry gave me this chance.

3288
02:18:26,910 --> 02:18:29,719
My choice is to let my sister go.

3289
02:18:29,719 --> 02:18:32,030
I think she needs this chance

3290
02:18:32,030 --> 02:18:32,920
more than me.

3291
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:38,430
We have such a tacit understanding.

3292
02:18:38,430 --> 02:18:39,680
I think he will let me...

3293
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:44,190
Is she not here?

3294
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:21,280
When I saw her brother choosing between the two,

3295
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,000
I knew Xinxin wouldn't go.

3296
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:23,870
Actually,

3297
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:25,920
Whether I go or not is in my hands.

3298
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:26,799
I chose not to go.

3299
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:36,799
because my words and actions

3300
02:19:36,799 --> 02:19:37,719
and chose me to go on a date.

3301
02:19:37,719 --> 02:19:41,240
I texted Tae-seo when I came back.

3302
02:19:42,430 --> 02:19:44,000
I'm more angry than I like him now.

3303
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:54,560
I know Fatty very well.

3304
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:56,440
If he wants to go on a date,

3305
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:58,440
I chose not to go on a date

3306
02:19:58,440 --> 02:19:59,840
I chose not to go on a date.

3307
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:02,000
his date will be a success.

3308
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:11,280
What are you doing?

3309
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:12,320
Who is it?

3310
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:12,840
Me.

3311
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:14,600
Don't you have anything to tell me?

3312
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:15,280
I want to know.

3313
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:17,040
I want to tell you

3314
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:19,080
I'm the only one who's going on a date.

3315
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:21,840
Really?

3316
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:22,400
Then what?

3317
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:23,520
Because I chose not to go on a date,

3318
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:25,000
so you two can go on a date.

3319
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:25,760
Is it possible?

3320
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:29,760
Am I not important?

3321
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:30,880
I gave up my happiness.

3322
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:32,280
Indeed, I'm a man.

3323
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:33,640
But I want to know

3324
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:34,520
how many letters

3325
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:35,840
How many letters did you receive today?

3326
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:39,040
One.

3327
02:20:41,080 --> 02:20:42,000
Liar.

3328
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:43,880
Swear.

3329
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,040
I swear.

3330
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:47,680
Okay.

3331
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:48,680
I swear.

3332
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:49,640
Okay.

3333
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:52,800
Bye.

3334
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:55,840
Let's go.

3335
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:56,960
Just enjoy it secretly.

3336
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:17,400
Tata.

3337
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:25,440
What's wrong?

3338
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:26,960
I don't know.

3339
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:27,440
Why are you crying?

3340
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:28,800
What's wrong?

3341
02:21:30,280 --> 02:21:31,280
What?

3342
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:35,480
Just because my brother is not here,

3343
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:37,680
It's okay.

3344
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:42,960
No.

3345
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:44,040
It's okay.

3346
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:47,080
In the end,

3347
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:51,760
I could only be chosen or given up by Harry.

3348
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:54,160
And I don't have the initiative.

3349
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:56,240
So I cried

3350
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:58,560
The bigger reason is

3351
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:00,360
my own siblings were not around.

3352
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:01,720
I was alone

3353
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:03,880
alone.

3354
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:05,720
Anyway, I felt wronged at that time.

3355
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:07,360
Don't cry.

3356
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:23,520
It's dirty.

3357
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:27,320
I saw her

3358
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:29,240
her state and her eyes.

3359
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:31,400
I feel a little sad and guilty.

3360
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:34,160
I don't know why

3361
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,440
if I can go.

3362
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:37,640
We quarreled.

3363
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:38,600
We've been here for a long time.

3364
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:40,480
Yeah, I don't know what you're doing.

3365
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:41,760
I didn't know

3366
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:43,600
such a part.

3367
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:51,560
No.

3368
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:04,320
There are wrinkles.

3369
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:09,560
The more you cry, the more like Molly.

3370
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:10,600
It's swollen.

3371
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:16,680
I feel so wronged.

3372
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:18,360
Go upstairs?

3373
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:35,840
Why is she ignoring me?

3374
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:36,680
She's crying.

3375
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:37,960
His mouth is pouting to the sky.

3376
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:46,000
What are you doing?

3377
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:58,120
We feel so wronged.

3378
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:00,880
Sorry.

3379
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:02,080
It's not your fault.

3380
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:08,280
I'm sorry.

3381
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:14,080
Don't be angry.

3382
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:15,280
I'm not mad at you.

3383
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:17,160
Because the rule is

3384
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:18,880
I posted the first two times

3385
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:20,360
that I'm going on a date.

3386
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:21,840
I'm not mad at you.

3387
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:22,560
I know.

3388
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:24,520
If I post the last time

3389
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:26,040
I'm going on a date,

3390
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:27,560
we can't go on a date.

3391
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,120
And I think my sister

3392
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:30,720
won't change.

3393
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:31,200
Because

3394
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:32,840
You don't have to explain.

3395
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:33,800
They didn't do that.

3396
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:39,880
That's the reason.

3397
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:42,160
I know I'm not mad at you.

3398
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:43,120
Normally,

3399
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:45,760
I'll give this date to my sister.

3400
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:46,680
Because I think our relationship

3401
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:48,560
between us.

3402
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:50,360
Right?

3403
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:54,200
What are you doing?

3404
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:56,800
What?

3405
02:24:56,800 --> 02:24:58,400
Are you unhappy?

3406
02:24:58,800 --> 02:24:59,800
No.

3407
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:01,360
It's not your problem.

3408
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:03,360
Is it my problem?

3409
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:04,680
I have to explain it to you.

3410
02:25:04,680 --> 02:25:05,720
Let me tell you.

3411
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:09,120
Why are you so unhappy?

3412
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:11,680
So unhappy?

3413
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,640
No.

3414
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:14,640
I feel like I'm going to cry.

3415
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:16,920
I did.

3416
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:18,080
Really?

3417
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:18,880
Where did you cry?

3418
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:19,960
Crying in front of others makes me

3419
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:21,680
in your sister's arms.

3420
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:22,440
and cry in front of others.

3421
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:23,760
It's like I'm bullying you.

3422
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:24,360
You know?

3423
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:25,240
Why?

3424
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:26,640
Because I'm helping her.

3425
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:27,520
She's the "sinner".

3426
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:29,840
Okay?

3427
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:30,880
I'm not...

3428
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:32,480
I don't think

3429
02:25:32,480 --> 02:25:33,520
this choice.

3430
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:35,040
I think there's something wrong.

3431
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:38,040
Are you telling her not to go?

3432
02:25:38,040 --> 02:25:39,040
No way.

3433
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:40,000
If I was in a hurry,

3434
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,360
I told you not to go.

3435
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:42,520
Keep choosing.

3436
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:43,120
Don't go.

3437
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:44,200
Don't even think about it.

3438
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:49,200
Put on your coat and go out for a while.

3439
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:07,760
When he came to talk to us,

3440
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:09,760
I didn't think he wanted to go on this date.

3441
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:11,200
I don't understand.

3442
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:12,960
I don't think he came at that time.

3443
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:14,040
in front of my room.

3444
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:15,760
Yes, aren't you in my room?

3445
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:17,200
He doesn't really want to go on this date.

3446
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:19,040
Don't you think so?

3447
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:21,000
I don't think so.

3448
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,320
Have you ever thought of going on a date with me today?

3449
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:30,040
Yes.

3450
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:32,520
Xiao'er wants to be happy forever.

3451
02:26:32,520 --> 02:26:33,680
Okay.

3452
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:34,720
OK, Yinbo.

3453
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,480
Make yourself for me.

3454
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:38,840
Stay with you for me.

3455
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:40,960
You're back.

3456
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:43,160
How did it go, Tom?

3457
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:43,920
Great!

3458
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:44,600
Okay.

3459
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:45,680
I didn't feel it.

3460
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:47,920
He didn't say much in total.

3461
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:48,840
and took a photo for you.

3462
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:49,440
No.

3463
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:51,280
He's playing with him.

3464
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:52,040
I'm a little upset.

3465
02:26:52,040 --> 02:26:53,800
I think he doesn't want to continue.

3466
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:56,760
Hush.

3467
02:26:58,080 --> 02:26:59,920
Susu, are you eating?

3468
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:02,600
Is it that serious?

3469
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:17,400
