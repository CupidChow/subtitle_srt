A small party.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
A party with wild wine

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,360
It's like drinking wild wine

5
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,400
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

6
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,920

Love Sisters.

13
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,440
This show is called "Little Wild Wine",

14
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,000
I feel there will be a fruit immediately.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,680
exclusively sponsored.

16
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,240
This show is made of fluffy

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,520
(It's like a hot)

18
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,400
for the show.

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,360
We're a dating family.

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,400
I was so shocked last week.

21
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,000
A little.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
This romantic house

23
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,880
We can call it "romantic battlefield".

24
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,440
After going through the "romantic battlefield",

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,720
Hua hopes to have a chance

26
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,320
to get in touch with Tarri and Fatty.

27
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,040
to confirm their feelings.

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,360
Then each brother

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,400
between family and love.

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,760
Will our confidence date

31
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,640
will go as

32
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,440
as everyone expected?

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,079
We're going to

34
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,840
of this episode.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,560
It's time to coax him.

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,760
It sounds romantic.

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,120
It sounds like something happened.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
This is...

39
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,440
So cute.

40
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,320
It's rare for us to go on a date.

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,960
Since I like her,

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,520
I want to make a breakthrough.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
and take the initiative.

44
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,320
I want her to feel happy.

45
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,920
It feels like a surprise.

46
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,600
Make her feel different.

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
So cute.

48
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,920
He's so popular with pets.

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,880
My expectations for this date

50
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,680
than before.

51
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
I gave up this date because of my brother.

52
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,840
To help me.

53
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,200
You're going on a date.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,240
Let's go.

55
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,760
So I'm looking forward to his changes today.

56
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,760
Hello.

57
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm afraid this cat might run away.

58
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,760
I won't stand up.

59
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,240
So straight.

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,960
There are so many Mimi.

61
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,280
Play with the kitty stick for a while.

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,680
They will all pass.

63
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,400
I just saw a fat one.

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,960
Golden slowly.

65
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,760
This is the golden slowly layer.

66
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,360
Yes.

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,800
It's a golden layer without hair.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,920
It won't let me hold it.

69
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,680
So cute.

70
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,920
German.

71
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,720
The hair is so good.

72
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,040
How can you tell?

73
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,320
Yes, I have one at home too.

74
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,080
I want you.

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
I like it.

76
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,400
I want to take it home.

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,720
Because I had a dead cat

78
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,800
is the same species as it.

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,640
and black.

80
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,200
It turns out that you can only be remembered when you disappear.

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Fool.

82
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,160
I'm speechless.

83
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,760
I bought some cat food and put it here.

84
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,480
A cat.

85
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,920
What's this? Frozen dry.

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,400
Thank you.

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,400
It ate me.

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,640
It took it away.

89
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,040
Look at its eyes.

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,960
Blue.

91
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,800
Blue.

92
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,120
Really? Are you a foreign cat?

93
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:42,880
You are?

94
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,760
It's a mixed-blood cat.

95
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,159
Xinjiang Cat.

96
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,120
Viowl cats.

97
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,400
In Su's eyes, it's not this doll cat.

98
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,840
It's Tom Cat.

99
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,720
Come here.

100
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,920
Come here, Mimi.

101
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,440
Help me squeeze it.

102
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,320
I think Cat Cafe

103
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,920
is a very loving place.

104
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,840
Feel the vibe of love.

105
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,040
Looks like Susu likes cats.

106
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,360
She knows cats better.

107
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,160
Look at her.

108
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,600
She's so pretty.

109
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Did you

110
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
yesterday?

111
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,440
I'm not happy about anything.

112
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,760
No.

113
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,480
When I passed by your room,

114
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,320
What?

115
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,960
Actually,

116
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,280
I was filled with guilt.

117
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,440
Actually, I really want to go on a date.

118
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,400
I can't waste a good chance.

119
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,480
Because I knew

120
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,000
she would choose her not to go.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,720
In the end, she chose not to go.

122
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,640
I felt so guilty.

123
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,080
I feel so sorry for her.

124
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,040
How could she be so nice?

125
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,600
Yes, I guess something.

126
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,760
What are you looking at?

127
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
What are you looking at?

128
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,680
There's a kitten with a high tail.

129
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,600
It means

130
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,840
It thinks this is its territory.

131
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,720
It's very happy.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
Have you ever had a cat?

133
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,720
My sister is raising them.

134
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,520
You're not familiar with them.

135
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,360
Yes.

136
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,200
What cat?

137
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,440
There's a short cat.

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,320
and a garden cat.

139
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,280
What's your cat's name?

140
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,200
Kitty.

141
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,000
One is called

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,840
Three.

143
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,760
Because its butt has a black three.

144
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,880
Really?

145
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,640
Another one is called Wendy.

146
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,480
Wendy

147
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,000
(Wendy)

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,680
I made it randomly.

149
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,720
Then I used

150
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,840
my daughter's English name.

151
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,240
I adopted

152
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,080
adopted a stray dog.

153
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,400
I named it Hello.

154
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,240
So what?

155
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,720
Every time the guests come in

156
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,720
Hello

157
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,320
I often...

158
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,560
Hello where are you

159
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,800
I'm fully equipped today.

160
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Let me take a photo for you.

161
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,240
The kitten is on your leg.

162
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,800
How to do it?

163
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,640
I don't know how to do it.

164
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,000
It's okay. You don't have to do it. Suit yourself.

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,600
Really?

166
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,240
Yes.

167
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,800
Susu came prepared today.

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,320
looking for a topic.

169
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,920
Take photos for the soup.

170
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,360
Yes, they both took the initiative.

171
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Yes, good.

172
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,440
Photos.

173
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,120
Horizontal.

174
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Pat me and it.

175
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,200
Pat it.

176
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,360
Pat me and it.

177
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,560
This...

178
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,080
How to shoot this?

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,560
Good.

180
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,919
Don't you hold it too...

181
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,000
Why? The angle of death?

182
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,120
Did you look good?

183
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,640
Sit down.

184
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,280
Taking photos for your partner

185
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,320
is very important.

186
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,040
It's too important.

187
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,200
Okay, I'm just cooking.

188
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,800
No one will cooperate with you because...

189
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,040
Do I look good?

190
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,000
Is it pretty?

191
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,960
Let me see.

192
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,720
No.

193
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,280
Don't grab.

194
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,600
No, let me see.

195
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,320
Well...

196
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,080
I have something to do.

197
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't feel like talking right now.

198
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,440
What should I say?

199
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,360
Don't tell me.

200
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
Well,

201
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,120
I don't know why

202
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,480
become so rough.

203
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,000
Facial folding.

204
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,160
Unbelievable.

205
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
What was the name of that room?

206
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,040
Romantic House.

207
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,280
Will you go if I drive?

208
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Do you want me to go?

209
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,960
I just want you to go.

210
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,240
Full answer.

211
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,200
Then I'll go.

212
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,000
What can I do there?

213
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,560
I have to think.

214
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,920
I think...

215
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,120
What if we fail?

216
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,360
No one will come in.

217
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,120
What if someone comes in?

218
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,480
Then I'll leave.

219
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,600
I won't

220
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,920
I won't apply for this share.

221
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,800
I'll ask someone else to apply

222
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,440
to see if you will come out.

223
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,880
Fine, I'll go to your room to find you. Unbelievable.

224
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,080
When will you write me another letter?

225
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,080
Who will write to whom?

226
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
You can write it for me.

227
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,200
I can write to you.

228
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,600
I've never written a letter to anyone.

229
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,440
It's an honor.

230
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,080
Because I think

231
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,240
is too...

232
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,600
Very formal.

233
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,400
No one is worth writing.

234
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,000
So without the rules,

235
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,200
I don't think I can receive it.

236
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,400
Maybe.

237
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
So will you write it to me?

238
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,280
Anything.

239
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,880
Anything.

240
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,000
but I couldn't do anything.

241
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,880
You're sensitive too.

242
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,040
Great.

243
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm not the only sensitive one.

244
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,640
What? This is a good thing.

245
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,480
Let's compete.

246
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,320
The soup didn't notice her expression.

247
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,360
It's just my expectation.

248
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
We may be

249
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,960
relaxed.

250
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,520
Killing cats

251
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,120
Then sit there and drink and chat.

252
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,880
Maybe we can talk about something we haven't talked about before.

253
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,040
I want to know more about it.

254
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,800
But

255
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,560
I felt that they were a little tense.

256
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,000
I didn't say I was relaxed.

257
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,480
And it's a little

258
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,720
a little capable.

259
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,240
Yes.

260
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,680
This is Mimi.

261
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,480
This is you.

262
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,960
I thought you don't have a dog.

263
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,440
Who doesn't?

264
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,520
Do you raise them all?

265
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,720
Yes.

266
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,520
Don't you fight?

267
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,200
I told you before.

268
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
there are cats and dogs at home.

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,040
Say hello.

270
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,200
Oh no.

271
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,880
Who doesn't have a dog? You got it wrong again.

272
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,480
I have a dog.

273
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,240
I have a dog that has been raising for nine years.

274
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,800
I just told you

275
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
I picked up a stray dog to greet you.

276
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,880
You said I don't have a dog.

277
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,440
I only remember you have seven cats.

278
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,280
I said I picked up a stray dog.

279
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,840
Hello.

280
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,920
I just told him last second

281
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,280
I adopted a stray dog a while ago.

282
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
In the next second, he said in shock

283
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,560
you had a dog.

284
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,400
I thought you only have a cat.

285
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,200
His words

286
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,240
he wasn't listening to me.

287
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,160
He might be too nervous and thinking about something else.

288
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,480
She understood

289
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,640
You don't care what I said to you.

290
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,760
Don't take it to heart.

291
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,040
Oh no, bro, help me.

292
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,760
Everyone has fur.

293
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,440
I have it on my eyes.

294
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,920
Really?

295
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,560
Yes, come closer.

296
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,160
More than safe distance.

297
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
Really?

298
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,080
That's right.

299
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,560
It's like they're in an idol drama.

300
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,320
Yes.

301
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,120
Really?

302
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,680
Really?

303
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,200
I saw some hair on your eyes.

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,600
Really.

305
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,040
There's one here.

306
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,720
Is it fur?

307
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,280
You have a lot of hair.

308
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,240
Maybe your eyes are big.

309
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,640
It's easy to get hairs.

310
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,280
Your eyelids will be stuck.

311
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,680
Cut cat hair.

312
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,160
Your double eyelids will get cat hair stuck.

313
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,440
I think I have hair on my eyes too.

314
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,720
She has hair on her eyes.

315
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,480
Is this a hint?

316
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:58,880
Yes.

317
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
Would you like to take a look?

318
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:00,960
Yes.

319
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,160
Come closer.

320
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,480
Soup is a log of love.

321
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,440
She reached out just now.

322
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,120
Just say you'll help me.

323
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,960
The whole chatting atmosphere today

324
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,160
makes me feel less comfortable.

325
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,840
not that comfortable.

326
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,240
I didn't get to know each other more.

327
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,280
or we started something more profound.

328
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,360
I don't think we talked much today.

329
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,280
and I didn't meet my expectations.

330
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,480
I feel a little uncomfortable.

331
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,840
A little unhappy.

332
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,200
I think she has high expectations.

333
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Yes.

334
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,240
In general, I'm quite happy.

335
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,800
Being with the person I like

336
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,960
Although I have a lot of time to let go,

337
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
It's a bit long.

338
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,600
But in general, I'm happy.

339
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,040
Let's go.

340
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,960
Let's go.

341
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,920
This date

342
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,760
are different.

343
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,200
I think the location is wrong.

344
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,880
I should move more.

345
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,440
The ping-pong last time was great.

346
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,320
Yes.

347
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,520
Yes.

348
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,160
Because he's good at

349
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,280
and showed his charm.

350
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,600
Yes.

351
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,160
Teach her again?

352
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,320
Yes, just walk around.

353
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,760
Yes, go shopping.

354
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,560
Or somewhere?

355
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,640
Have some coffee or something.

356
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,920
But I think Susu is just like what Dan said.

357
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,520
the reason she expected so much

358
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,880
Harry gave her this chance.

359
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,560
And Tata cried.

360
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,840
So she has high expectations

361
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
for this date.

362
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,000
You have to live up to your expectations.

363
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,720
Tae-seo.

364
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,760
Flower is here.

365
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,720
My choice is to let my sister go.

366
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,560
I think

367
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,760
more than I do.

368
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,080
Hello.

369
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,480
I have another chance

370
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,640
to have more contact with Hua.

371
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,480
more.

372
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,760
When I saw Tae-seo,

373
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,440
I was happy too.

374
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,640
Because I thought yesterday

375
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,680
I wanted both of us to get in touch again.

376
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,360
You found this place.

377
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,240
I didn't know who it was before she came.

378
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,360
Thank you.

379
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,240
What are you doing?

380
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,240
I've found some maps.

381
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,720
Take a look.

382
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,760
I made this.

383
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,640
You need to do this.

384
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,000
Do this.

385
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,640
Yes.

386
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
I did a guide before I went there

387
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,920
I searched a lot of flowers.

388
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,360
I wanted to make a flower for her.

389
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,520
Thank you.

390
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,760
I'll make flowers.

391
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,920
You make flowers?

392
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,560
Sure.

393
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,000
Have you thought of going on a date with me today?

394
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,480
Yes.

395
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,480
She's sweet when she's with him.

396
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,120
Yes.

397
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Really?

398
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,280
Why did I think of

399
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,080
Who wrote this letter to me?

400
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,800
Who doesn't know?

401
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,120
Yes.

402
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,800
The letter I wrote to you.

403
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,960
But

404
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,160
I didn't receive it.

405
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,520
So I'll make you a flower today, okay?

406
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Okay.

407
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,480
Tae-seo is easy to coax too.

408
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,760
It's easy.

409
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,200
We can find the color first.

410
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,839
Okay.

411
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,079
White.

412
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,480
Is this okay?

413
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,560
I want this.

414
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,640
It's nice. You have long hands and legs.

415
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:17,760
Okay.

416
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,280
Let's start.

417
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,520
Did you cook well before?

418
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,599
I didn't do much.

419
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,520
Didn't I write you the letter yesterday?

420
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,240
At that time,

421
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,720
I wanted to give you a flower.

422
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
This simple love

423
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
is too hard.

424
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,520
I really can't learn it.

425
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,640
I tried my best.

426
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,200
Failed.

427
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,520
Then draw one.

428
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,200
I drew it from the beginning.

429
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,320
It was too ugly.

430
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,840
So I wrote another letter.

431
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,160
Did you receive a text

432
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,720
or "I'm not going on a date"?

433
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,640
I got it.

434
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,080
So you're just like me.

435
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,880
I want the bag, Yinbo.

436
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,880
How did you know it was me?

437
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
Maybe you were the only one who gave it to me.

438
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,400
So you only received one letter from me?

439
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,120
Yes.

440
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
Really?

441
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,920
Really?

442
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,800
to win his favor.

443
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,000
Every time they meet,

444
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,040
they take a small step forward.

445
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,560
Call me brother again.

446
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,920
I'll think I'm older than you.

447
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,440
But I think I'm really older than you.

448
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,520
Why can't I call you Yinbo?

449
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,120
Sure.

450
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
What do you want to call me?

451
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,560
Chen'er.

452
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,840
Chen'er.

453
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,960
Yinbo.

454
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,400
They are very relaxed.

455
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,560
Yes.

456
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,800
It's natural. It's natural.

457
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,000
Very comfortable.

458
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,320
Xiao'er wants to be happy forever.

459
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,160
Okay.

460
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,280
OK, Yinbo.

461
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,600
I got it.

462
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,400
But

463
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Like that album

464
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,600
I wasn't there

465
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,760
when you introduced me.

466
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,400
I'll show you the album later.

467
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,480
Okay.

468
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,000
In my album,

469
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,360
in my album.

470
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,880
My mom was with me when I was a kid

471
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,400
so I had a lot of photos.

472
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,400
My mom takes pictures for me when she's here.

473
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,880
So I'm grateful

474
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,440
for taking photos for me last time.

475
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,200
Because when I grew up,

476
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,960
when I grow up.

477
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,640
You're always there.

478
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,680
We need to take photos later.

479
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,120
Flower's expression

480
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,800
Tae-seo responds to everything.

481
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,200
He gives her positive emotions.

482
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,000
One, two, three, four.

483
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,520
Fight the tiger on the mountain.

484
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,040
I feel like I'm playing five-in-a-row chess.

485
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,840
I'm counting.

486
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,520
It's okay.

487
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,120
Slowly.

488
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,160
Slowly.

489
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,960
Don't rush me.

490
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,080
Why are you copying me?

491
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,720
I didn't want you to feel agitated.

492
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,720
She remembers that he said it was urgent.

493
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,960
One, two, three, four.

494
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,000
When we go back,

495
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,800
our eyes will turn into chicken eyes.

496
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,440
Can you do that?

497
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,720
I can.

498
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,120
So cute.

499
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,160
Me too.

500
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,440
But I won't perform.

501
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,880
You...

502
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,080
Yes?

503
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,760
It's me.

504
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,360
Is your eye cured?

505
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,280
Look.

506
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,120
Look.

507
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,880
I feel a little...

508
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,360
A little.

509
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,840
Much better.

510
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,920
It was so serious that day.

511
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,480
So you saw

512
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,320
we entered the romantic house, right?

513
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,360
I took a look at the door.

514
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,160
You two are enough.

515
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,120
I'm leaving.

516
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,840
I didn't even see you.

517
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,920
Really.

518
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,640
Secretly, Yinbo.

519
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,120
What?

520
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,560
I didn't disturb you.

521
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,320
Yes.

522
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,400
So what are you talking about inside?

523
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,360
Can we talk?

524
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,920
Yes.

525
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,240
Just a chat.

526
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,680
We just talked about the misunderstanding yesterday.

527
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,120
I didn't solve it.

528
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't think so.

529
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,480
Look at the flowers here. I don't think it's untied.

530
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,040
But the two brothers over there

531
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,960
have been untied.

532
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,240
I already rejected it.

533
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,800
I wish you were a few days late.

534
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,320
I'll give this to you as a birthday gift.

535
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,840
You too.

536
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,160
Okay.

537
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,480
I have a request.

538
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,880
You owe me a birthday gift.

539
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,760
Okay.

540
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,600
You just came in.

541
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,160
we were not very close.

542
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,000
You didn't ask me to play with you.

543
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,080
All right.

544
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
That's true.

545
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,000
Yes.

546
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,160
I have no choice.

547
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,720
You know it too.

548
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,600
passive.

549
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,160
passive boy.

550
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,720
Seriously.

551
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,160
Can't you change it?

552
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,160
Actually, I am.

553
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,120
These days,

554
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,600
I haven't taken the initiative.

555
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,160
Not enough.

556
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,320
You want to ask me?

557
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,040
Enough.

558
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,920
The meal I cooked for you yesterday.

559
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,200
Right?

560
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,400
What do you want to eat?

561
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Look at them.

562
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,360
naturally.

563
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,200
Yes.

564
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,760
What do you want to eat?

565
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,440
I'm going to cook.

566
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:50,840
Really?

567
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,280
Anything is fine.

568
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,360
Eat whatever you cook.

569
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,720
Do you want rice or noodles?

570
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,280
Rice or noodles.

571
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,240
Hua, what do you want to eat?

572
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,160
Anything.

573
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,800
Fried pork with chili.

574
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,600
It's not spicy.

575
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,760
It can be spicy.

576
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,000
What are you doing

577
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,880
Fried pork with chili.

578
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,720
I don't usually ask

579
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
What do you usually eat?

580
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,560
I'll just do it.

581
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,320
Let's eat.

582
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,640
Okay.

583
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,080
Like this.

584
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,320
Like this.

585
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
Do you think

586
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
favourite?

587
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,680
Yes, preference.

588
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
Is your fried pork with chili

589
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Do you learn how to teach?

590
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,560
It's my first time.

591
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,160
It's specially made for flowers.

592
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,600
A bonus. A bonus.

593
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,520
He can do anything he wants.

594
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,400
And he's very relaxed.

595
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,680
to say it casually.

596
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,000
and let them know how to put in effort.

597
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,960
No pressure.

598
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,360
Yes, no pressure.

599
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,200
You did a good job.

600
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,680
Chili fried pork is delicious

601
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Really

602
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,240
Because the dishes I made before

603
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,520
are basically not spicy.

604
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,360
It’s such an honor, Yinbo.

605
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,720
Is my cooking OK?

606
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,760
It's really delicious.

607
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,800
I’m worried I’ll fail.

608
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,880
Bobo is reserved.

609
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,080
Can’t you see it?

610
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,800
A little.

611
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,920
I'm not good at talking anyway.

612
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,040
I'm not good at expressing myself.

613
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,480
You can only do it, right?

614
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,840
Didn't I write all the letters to you?

615
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,600
Don't you think this is...

616
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,880
a friendly relationship?

617
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
No?

618
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,000
Aren't you going to take the initiative?

619
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,600
But I think

620
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,480
you are like writing to us.

621
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,480
Okay.

622
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,600
What impressed me the most

623
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,280
was the rushing and uneasy.

624
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,520
That's the truth.

625
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,560
I didn't expect

626
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,800
I would give you

627
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,120
and anxiety.

628
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,360
I didn't expect it at first.

629
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,760
Maybe because I was nervous,

630
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,200
If I go out with my friends,

631
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,720
when I go out with my friends.

632
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,320
It must be because Tae-ri likes her.

633
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:37,960
because Tae-seo likes her.

634
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,760
My first date.

635
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,080
That's why I'm nervous.

636
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,320
That's why.

637
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,200
Like this.

638
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,040
You should have told me earlier.

639
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,920
Can't you tell?

640
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,840
I didn't.

641
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,760
Okay.

642
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,200
I thought you would feel awkward.

643
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,880
I was looking for my own reason.

644
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,800
I said I didn't do well that day.

645
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,320
I knew you were like that.

646
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,920
That's my reason.

647
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,480
You already took the initiative

648
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,920
on that day.

649
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,520
I have no choice.

650
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,760
I'm sorry.

651
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,840
I'm sorry.

652
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
It's okay.

653
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,000
He's a comfortable

654
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,520
right?

655
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,440
You're comfortable with him.

656
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,480
and stable.

657
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,920
Let's have a chat.

658
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,720
Let's talk while doing it.

659
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,080
Don't be too immersed.

660
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,960
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

661
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,200
I'm afraid you can't be like me.

662
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,600
like me.

663
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,480
Can I do it?

664
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,760
What is one plus one?

665
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,040
Four.

666
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,840
Four plus four.

667
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
156 plus 253.

668
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,920
409.

669
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,080
You are really...

670
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,480
You confused me.

671
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,120
How are you doing these days?

672
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,840
I think

673
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,920
his question is so natural.

674
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes.

675
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,240
Straightforward and natural.

676
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,720
No pressure.

677
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,640
Is it better than before?

678
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,720
Yes.

679
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
I used to think you don't talk much.

680
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,000
Now,

681
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,080
you've become talkative.

682
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,920
Do you usually talk less in life?

683
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,480
Let's see who you're talking to.

684
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,240
I don't know what to say.

685
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,320
You will definitely wait

686
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,000
to talk to you.

687
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,920
It used to be.

688
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,160
Haven't you thought about

689
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,600
to take the initiative?

690
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,120
My friend said the same thing.

691
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,560
Yes.

692
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,080
He said, "Would you like to try it yourself?"

693
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,160
Change it.

694
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,040
But it's a little difficult.

695
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,360
For me,

696
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,600
So, Yinbo,

697
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,520
are you a fragile person?

698
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,640
Do you think...

699
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,720
I think it depends on the situation.

700
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,800
I'm quite fragile in love.

701
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,280
Because it's emotional.

702
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,960
Do you cry when you watch a movie?

703
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,840
It's okay.

704
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,080
But when you're in a relationship, I...

705
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,320
You're making me cry.

706
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Can't you tell?

707
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,280
Are you easy to be coaxed?

708
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,800
It's not easy to coax me.

709
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,120
I think

710
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
as long as you coax me,

711
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,640
I'll lose face.

712
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,360
You know too much.

713
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,040
Now in the small house,

714
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,600
you should know me best.

715
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,480
Really?

716
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,760
He said that you are my one and only.

717
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,080
and more preferences.

718
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,400
Are you feeling better?

719
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,480
Not yet.

720
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,880
I'll sort it out.

721
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
Do we want to make it into a fridge sticker

722
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,480
or a key chain?

723
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,640
Key chain.

724
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,080
There's a chain behind this wall.

725
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,520
You can choose.

726
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,200
Okay.

727
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,680
Don't drop it easily.

728
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,360
Okay.

729
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:06,880
Thank you.

730
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,360
It's okay.

731
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,320
It's pretty.

732
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,360
So pretty.

733
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,320
This is fun.

734
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
This is perfect for dating.

735
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,600
You're done.

736
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,080
It's okay.

737
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,320
Take your time.

738
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
Do you want to help me?

739
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,800
Tell me which one.

740
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,080
Fill in here.

741
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,960
I'll fill in here.

742
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,920
OK.

743
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,520
Yinbo is so good.

744
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,680
This is so close.

745
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,800
Yes.

746
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,000
And both of them focus

747
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,320
at the same time.

748
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,000
This is so intimate.

749
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,120
Isn't it great?

750
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,840
OK?

751
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,280
I'm going to press it.

752
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,080
Go ahead.

753
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Do you want to make fridge stickers

754
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,840
or a key chain?

755
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,440
Key chain.

756
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,840
What do you think?

757
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,320
Yes.

758
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,400
Thank you.

759
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,880
I'll give it to you.

760
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,680
Yours is so beautiful.

761
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,240
Right?

762
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,120
It can't be helped.

763
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,800
Me too.

764
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,640
I know you want the chain.

765
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,280
I think yours is too pretty.

766
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,400
It's wrapped.

767
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,840
I don't usually cook

768
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,400
handmade.

769
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,840
But today I found

770
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,720
I found my sense of accomplishment.

771
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,480
Being with Tae-seo

772
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,920
is definitely warmer

773
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,280
than before.

774
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,160
We had a great time together.

775
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,120
Dating sample.

776
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
If Fatty sees this,

777
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,120
he will reflect on himself.

778
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
He won't be too hasty and nervous.

779
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,320
I think this is what I want.

780
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,040
Exchange.

781
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,160
I think it's very meaningful.

782
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,400
In this date,

783
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,040
I asked her some questions.

784
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,840
I think

785
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,880
the difference between me and the last date.

786
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,360
I became less passive.

787
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,760
He's so happy.

788
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,680
He's smiling so happily.

789
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,520
Let's go.

790
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,600
You know what?

791
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,240
At first, I wanted you to do this.

792
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,000
I haven't even found the cat yet.

793
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,280
Yes.

794
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,480
When you see sunflowers, you like them very much.

795
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,320
Then you said,

796
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,080
you'll be the sunflower.

797
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,320
It means I'm the one

798
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,360
I found a piece of grass.

799
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,040
I will pick

800
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,360
my favorite flower.

801
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,680
I won't pick them until the end.

802
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,240
and regret the front.

803
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,840
Got it.

804
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,000
No.

805
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,080
I thought

806
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,080
you didn't talk much when you were alone.

807
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,440
I want you to be happy.

808
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,280
Like sunflowers.

809
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,600
And I'm the flower.

810
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,120
Right?

811
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Flower.

812
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,600
Be yourself and give it to me.

813
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,720
and stay with you for me.

814
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,640
But I still don't understand

815
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,000
The envelope yesterday

816
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,880
or "I don't want to go on a date."

817
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,520
What on earth

818
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,640
choose?

819
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,960
You mean you chose me.

820
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,120
I didn't.

821
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,480
Yes.

822
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,600
Although both of us

823
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,440
"I want to go on a date,"

824
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,720
But I gave you the letter.

825
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,640
You might have given it to someone else.

826
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,160
Whatever.

827
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,720
I can ask you out twice.

828
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,040
You can do it twice.

829
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,880
Take a nap.

830
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,280
It’s hard to coax him, Yinbo.

831
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,160
I can’t.

832
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,800
You're so handsome.

833
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,400
The sun shines on your face.

834
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,120
Again.

835
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,040
Give it to me.

836
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,880
Let's go on a date.

837
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,560
It's easy to coax.

838
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
Let's go on a date.

839
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,520
He's not on a date?

840
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,840
He's jealous.

841
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,200
But I think Tae-seo is quite confident.

842
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,960
Yes.

843
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,880
You have more tomorrow.

844
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,960
I don't know.

845
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,480
What if at night?

846
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,320
So urgent?

847
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,720
No.

848
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
You're in a hurry.

849
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,520
It's too urgent.

850
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,920
I'm still here.

851
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,120
Why are you sitting here?

852
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,920
Why are you so pretty?

853
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,800
Sit here.

854
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:28,960
I don't want to hear it.

855
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,120
I feel like

856
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,080
you're saying something like that.

857
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,800
Why does the sun suit you so well?

858
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,040
I don't want to hear it.

859
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,120
Look, the sun is blocking.

860
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,480
You suddenly became depressed.

861
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,360
Stop it.

862
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,160
Hua, you're so good.

863
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,000
It's bright and dark.

864
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,640
So beautiful.

865
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,960
Let me take a video for you.

866
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:45,840
Here.

867
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,880
Tidy up

868
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,200
So natural.

869
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,960
Pretend to sleep.

870
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,560
Is it pretty?

871
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,680
Good night.

872
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,240
Look at the sunshine.

873
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,120
So handsome.

874
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,480
So handsome, Yinbo.

875
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,360
You made me laugh.

876
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,080
Really.

877
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,120
The sun is just right.

878
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,320
They are so happy.

879
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,360
The frequency of Hana being cute with him

880
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,800
So high.

881
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,800
He'll trigger the cute side of Flower.

882
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,440
Yes.

883
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,880
Once more positive feedback,

884
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,800
they will express it bravely.

885
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
They're like hugging.

886
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,880
Say something and I'll answer.

887
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,760
I'll take it.

888
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,120
are approaching each other.

889
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,800
Do you think Hua and Fatty

890
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,280
and Tarri

891
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,240
Is there any difference?

892
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,080
Do they have a way to get along?

893
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,320
This is called "killing".

894
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,960
But obviously, after this date,

895
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,760
Tae-seo and Hwa-hwa

896
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,880
is getting warm.

897
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,000
The temperature is stable.

898
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,480
I think it's too late

899
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,440
to enter this stage.

900
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,040
You said Hwa met Tae-ri first.

901
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,160
Not necessarily. How could it be without comparison?

902
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,480
Yes.

903
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,720
You want to say goodbye to the wrong to meet the right one?

904
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,400
I forgot what mode Fatty and her are in.

905
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Who is Fatty?

906
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,600
Is there a mode?

907
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,840
No, I saw it.

908
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
But I forgot.

909
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,360
That means he doesn't remember anything.

910
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,960
Fatty is not bad actually.

911
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,360
The supermarket was really high

912
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,440
It was a bonus

913
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,520
Very good.

914
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,560
In the end, due to some misunderstanding,

915
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,800
he changed.

916
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,280
He can't handle things like this.

917
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,760
Yes.

918
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,160
You have to endure the contradiction.

919
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,600
Are you hungry?

920
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,960
Not bad.

921
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,080
We can have a signature

922
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,720
nutritious fried rice with egg.

923
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,640
Okay.

924
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,080
Both of them gave up their date opportunities.

925
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,200
Do you want green pepper?

926
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,960
Yes.

927
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,320
Okay.

928
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,160
Just don't put onions.

929
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,000
I'll eat everything else

930
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,400
Then I'll put some onions.

931
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,520
How dare you!

932
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,360
He's getting funny.

933
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,400
Let me learn how to cook.

934
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:35,960
Okay.

935
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,600
Look what's in the fridge.

936
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,840
Do you think it can be added?

937
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
What do you want to eat?

938
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,040
I don't think so.

939
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,600
You can take out some cabbage

940
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,680
Cabbage

941
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,360
You can add some tomatoes.

942
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,920
Okay.

943
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,240
You can add some meat.

944
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,920
(Harry can't go on a date.)

945
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,400
Harry, do you want to eat?

946
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,240
Harry.

947
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,360
(Harry)

948
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,600
Harry.

949
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,400
I'll cook it for him.

950
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,880
It's okay.

951
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,960
A sad boy passed by.

952
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,880
He's broken.

953
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,200
Egg.

954
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,120
Can you give me an egg?

955
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,240
Can you do it?

956
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,360
I...

957
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,160
will...

958
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
I'll try.

959
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,480
Okay.

960
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
I trust you.

961
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,200
Where's the egg?

962
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Over there.

963
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,960
Here.

964
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,880
Then add another egg.

965
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Eggs are more nutritious anyway.

966
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,760
It can make you 1.8 meters tall.

967
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,320
Poke the pain point.

968
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,360
Scary.

969
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,520
Cut the green pepper.

970
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,120
Let me do it.

971
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,160
I'll take this.

972
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,520
Give me a friction.

973
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,360
Smart.

974
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,160
It's you.

975
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,920
It's almost done.

976
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,320
OK.

977
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,239
Don't throw it on yourself.

978
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,320
Do you want to take the postgraduate entrance exam?

979
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,199
Actually, I'm a little hesitant.

980
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,480
I think so.

981
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,560
Are you going to stay in Zhejiang Media?

982
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,520
Come to Beijing Film Academy to find me.

983
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:31,880
OK.

984
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,639
Beijing Film Academy may not pass

985
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,320
(Love of Love)

986
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,840
The rhyme is still on the line.

987
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,280
My hands are sore.

988
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,520
We can switch.

989
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,440
Come on, you fry it.

990
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,440
I won't make it burnt.

991
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,440
I'll turn it on.

992
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,199
It's fine.

993
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
How?

994
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,800
Just flip.

995
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,560
Right?

996
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,520
Yes.

997
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,200
It's hard, isn't it?

998
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,760
Be careful when it goes out.

999
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,120
It's a little difficult.

1000
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,240
Move to the center.

1001
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,720
It's not fun.

1002
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,240
Take it back.

1003
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,640
Smells good.

1004
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,560
Take one for me.

1005
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,600
Look.

1006
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,880
Chef Wang's fried rice.

1007
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,200
Beijing Film Academy.

1008
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,120
and the cooking skills of Zhejiang Media

1009
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:28,960
How is it?

1010
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Shameless.

1011
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,200
But it looks good.

1012
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,720
Right?

1013
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,760
One last time stir-fry.

1014
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,200
You can start cooking.

1015
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,920
Countdown to ten seconds.

1016
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,560
19.

1017
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,200
Three, two, one.

1018
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,680
Out of the pot.

1019
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,880
I gave all the meat

1020
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,840
I can see.

1021
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,240
Understand?

1022
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,560
That's love.

1023
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,240
Start to do these maps.

1024
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
The "couple" is here.

1025
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,640
I smell it and come over.

1026
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,240
Come on

1027
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,440
Delicious.

1028
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,240
Do you want me to work more?

1029
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,200
Add some salt

1030
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,240
No need

1031
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,560
I can't open it.

1032
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,240
It's easy for boys

1033
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,960
in this matter.

1034
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,800
and try my best.

1035
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,320
OK, bro?

1036
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,960
It's okay.

1037
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,920
Don't open it.

1038
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,400
I'll try.

1039
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,720
Don't open it.

1040
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,280
Map.

1041
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,520
I'm so mad.

1042
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,360
There are only four of us at home today.

1043
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,320
Who knows?

1044
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,200
I hope you can stay at home.

1045
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,720
Yes.

1046
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,840
Yes.

1047
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,800
This is a dedication personality.

1048
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,120
Yes.

1049
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,200
Are you going out?

1050
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,600
Going to the supermarket.

1051
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,280
If we go grocery shopping,

1052
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,200
they will stay at home.

1053
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,800
So we went to the romantic house

1054
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,880
We have to go.

1055
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:09,840
Let's go.

1056
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,760
Let's go grocery shopping.

1057
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,280
I can slowly feel

1058
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,520
the little flame

1059
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,040
with Xiaoling.

1060
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,480
The inexplicable chemistry is coming out.

1061
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,160
I even speculated

1062
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,280
The map might be real.

1063
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,240
I'll start preparing for the exam.

1064
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,480
in Beijing Film Academy.

1065
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,880
He should be the most popular person

1066
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,360
in China.

1067
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
Yes.

1068
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,720
I'm still going to Beijing Film Academy ten years later.

1069
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,600
Come on, Tu.

1070
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,400
Come on!

1071
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,760
Let's go back with loads.

1072
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,240
Yes.

1073
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,200
Back to the happy house

1074
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,280
Let's eat the cake first.

1075
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,720
Let's put the cake first.

1076
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,880
You two are here.

1077
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,600
Thank you, sir.

1078
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,160
Slowly.

1079
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,720
Okay.

1080
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,240
We're back to where we've been apart for a long time.

1081
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,800
You're back.

1082
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,040
How did it go?

1083
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,920
Not bad.

1084
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,760
How was it, Tom?

1085
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,160
You'd better be happy.

1086
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,640
Your sister sacrificed herself.

1087
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,240
Great!

1088
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,440
Okay.

1089
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,360
I didn't feel it.

1090
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,400
Is it bad?

1091
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,440
I don't know.

1092
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,480
I don't know.

1093
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,280
How are you?

1094
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,960
I...

1095
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Let me see

1096
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,360
Are you okay?

1097
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,080
What? You're not good either.

1098
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,120
I can be fine if you're not.

1099
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,320
You can do it too.

1100
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,600
Is it fun?

1101
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,960
Not bad.

1102
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,040
Is it fun or not?

1103
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Did you talk?

1104
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,320
I have cameras phobia.

1105
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,920
Didn't you talk about what I told you last night?

1106
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,400
I did.

1107
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,840
Did you?

1108
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Did he talk to you?

1109
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,320
Did he?

1110
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,760
No?

1111
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,560
Really?

1112
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,080
We held hands.

1113
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,760
See?

1114
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,400
What?

1115
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,000
What?

1116
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,520
See what?

1117
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,440
They're holding hands.

1118
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,160
Really.

1119
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,400
Did you see that?

1120
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,800
Didn't you see it just now?

1121
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,480
What did you want to tell me yesterday?

1122
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,000
Tom.

1123
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,640
It's okay.

1124
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,520
What?

1125
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,960
Nothing.

1126
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,840
Go ahead.

1127
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,600
I don't want to.

1128
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,320
Why?

1129
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,440
Because I just don't want to.

1130
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,720
Go ahead.

1131
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,080
It's okay.

1132
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,680
I said I knew you would choose you. You don't want to go.

1133
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,200
It's not that I don't want to go.

1134
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,680
I gave up for you.

1135
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,160
I knew you would choose that option.

1136
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,760
If I choose that one too,

1137
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,400
no one can go with this.

1138
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,360
I knew it.

1139
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,280
Thank you for your sacrifice.

1140
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,720
Don't sacrifice yourself next time.

1141
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,120
Will there be a next time?

1142
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,320
If there is a next time, give it to me.

1143
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,760
I don't know.

1144
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,880
I'll give it to you next time.

1145
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,800
Actually, the soup is blunt today.

1146
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,760
He didn't notice it.

1147
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,600
Susu seems a little unhappy.

1148
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,720
Su Su expresses her emotions.

1149
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,080
He's still joking.

1150
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,960
Maybe the soup is relaxed after returning to the room.

1151
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,200
Yes.

1152
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,400
They were very tense when they were dating.

1153
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,600
He actually cares

1154
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,320
So

1155
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,920
When I'm alone

1156
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,120
I'm a little nervous.

1157
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,480
Let's go to the rock.

1158
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,200
I slipped.

1159
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,080
I hung it on my bag.

1160
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,320
Right now.

1161
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,040
This isn't a key chain.

1162
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,240
It's love.

1163
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,520
Susu.

1164
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,200
Any progress?

1165
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yes.

1166
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,040
Su Ziyi.

1167
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,360
Did you...

1168
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,640
Why not?

1169
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,720
I saw everything.

1170
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,280
I saw it just now.

1171
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,160
I really didn't.

1172
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,640
Girls are expecting it too, right?

1173
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,120
Yes.

1174
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,640
Is today the same as before?

1175
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,800
Any new progress?

1176
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,280
No, he was so nervous.

1177
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,080
He doesn't talk.

1178
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,920
He doesn't talk.

1179
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,480
I tried my best.

1180
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,880
But I...

1181
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,080
ten cameras were against me.

1182
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,360
I feel like I'm going to die there.

1183
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,120
I think this is

1184
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,200
his real performance.

1185
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,600
Yeah.

1186
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,120
There are many cameras.

1187
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,560
And there are many people.

1188
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,120
In public,

1189
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,080
I don't know

1190
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,800
how to contact the person I like.

1191
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,080
I'm very reserved.

1192
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,720
I feel uncomfortable because

1193
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,040
I feel uncomfortable.

1194
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,400
It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.

1195
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,880
He hasn't been numb with the camera yet.

1196
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,400
Yes.

1197
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,320
So he would think

1198
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,720
if I hold your hand

1199
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,400
hold your hand

1200
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,160
He might think it's a bit acting.

1201
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,200
Yes.

1202
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,360
Lu, as you said,

1203
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,920
he didn't take the initiative

1204
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,480
in front of the camera.

1205
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,640
There will be physical movements soon.

1206
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,920
I think we understand.

1207
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,200
is a bonus.

1208
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,280
Yeah.

1209
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,080
He has

1210
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,400
how he felt about this date.

1211
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,080
I'm happy

1212
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,320
I'm happy.

1213
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,520
As long as I'm with you,

1214
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,920
even if we drink water,

1215
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,560
it doesn't matter.

1216
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,520
I'm happy.

1217
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,080
Yeah.

1218
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,920
But he probably didn't expect

1219
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,960
he would have different feelings.

1220
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,960
In the process of growing,

1221
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,120
in the process of growing.

1222
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,240
So in a strange environment,

1223
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,560
when he builds a sense of security.

1224
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,440
So in front of so many cameras,

1225
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,360
it's normal for him

1226
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,240
is normal.

1227
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,520
Susu and soup are like

1228
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,720
what we talked about last time.

1229
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,640
they are experiencing

1230
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,200
in a vulnerable period.

1231
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,080
From a physiological point of view,

1232
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,240
your dopamine

1233
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,440
to attract you.

1234
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,600
to each other.

1235
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,080
But your skin

1236
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,320
makes you anxious.

1237
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,640
In such a

1238
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,480
attractive

1239
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,400
and low sense of security,

1240
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,680
Let's check the information tonight.

1241
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,280
Now you say I'm too curious.

1242
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,320
I can't tell you now.

1243
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,520
Shall we go?

1244
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,160
Not now

1245
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,960
What is this?

1246
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,080
We just bought it

1247
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,880
I was hungry.

1248
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,440
Do you want some?

1249
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,600
Sure.

1250
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,480
What did you eat for lunch?

1251
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,440
Nothing.

1252
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,360
No meal.

1253
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,000
Let's go.

1254
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,760
Let's go. Let's go eat.

1255
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,480
Let's have a light meal.

1256
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,400
Enjoy yourself.

1257
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,240
Did your date fail?

1258
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,280
Is there any progress between you two?

1259
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,640
You really...

1260
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,800
What does it have to do with me?

1261
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,160
What does it have to do with me?

1262
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:18,960
What about me?

1263
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,000
You made me work so hard.

1264
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,600
You won't have the chance anymore.

1265
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,000
He always

1266
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,600
He said he couldn't do anything with a camera.

1267
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,760
Why?

1268
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,240
So annoying. I'm listening.

1269
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:28,840
Really

1270
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,040
You are really

1271
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,720
I really...

1272
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,160
What does it have to do with me

1273
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,720
to do with me?

1274
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,480
He didn't talk to you.

1275
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,080
About what I told you yesterday,

1276
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,360
He said something.

1277
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,600
He said it today.

1278
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,240
less than ten seconds.

1279
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,960
I said I know.

1280
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,680
That's all.

1281
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
I'm speechless.

1282
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,680
It's hard for me.

1283
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,440
Today,

1284
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,760
I decided I won't talk to him today.

1285
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,680
Think about it.

1286
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,240
I feel like

1287
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
I would be angry if I were you.

1288
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,600
So he (Harry) got angry

1289
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,720
Is it because the progress is slow?

1290
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,360
He didn't expect it to happen.

1291
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,320
and hopes failed.

1292
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,160
because he may sacrifice.

1293
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,680
Yes.

1294
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,520
There's no progress.

1295
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,960
I sacrificed a date.

1296
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,760
Yes.

1297
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,200
Harry thinks I'm holding hands.

1298
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,080
Yes.

1299
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,560
Did you hold hands when you went out today?

1300
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,640
Did you do any body movements?

1301
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,400
But in this way,

1302
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,760
it may cause some emotional guidance to Susu.

1303
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,040
Yes, I will.

1304
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,560
To be honest, I'm a little angry.

1305
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,800
I was wondering

1306
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,960
made a wrong choice.

1307
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,840
It's a waste of the chance I gave them.

1308
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,240
Because what happened yesterday

1309
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,920
because of what happened yesterday.

1310
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,920
My brother gave up on this date.

1311
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,760
to help me.

1312
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,800
I feel that my date

1313
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,920
is not that good.

1314
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,400
I didn't meet other people's expectations

1315
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,320
or my own expectations.

1316
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,560
I feel a little uncomfortable.

1317
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,000
A little unhappy.

1318
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,720
I don't think it's good for him.

1319
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,520
I think

1320
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,440
I think he doesn't want to continue.

1321
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,520
or he wants to.

1322
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,520
But he doesn't dare.

1323
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,200
He really makes me speechless.

1324
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,280
If he doesn't take the initiative,

1325
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,600
He doesn't take the bag.

1326
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,760
If he doesn't take the clothes,

1327
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,840
He didn't follow me either.

1328
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,080
They are so close.

1329
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,120
Can you hear me?

1330
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,320
I think I heard it.

1331
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,000
Soup is sensitive.

1332
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,480
I told him every night

1333
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,800
you should take the initiative.

1334
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,480
You're the only one.

1335
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,440
He asked what you like.

1336
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,120
I said the only thing you can give me now

1337
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,400
is to take the initiative.

1338
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,480
to express your feelings.

1339
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,240
I really...

1340
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,160
Are you satisfied with your date today?

1341
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,360
Give him a score. A perfect score.

1342
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,680
Score him.

1343
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,400
No.

1344
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,120
What did you do today?

1345
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,760
Did you talk to Mimi?

1346
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,440
He's playing with her.

1347
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,280
But he doesn't open his mouth.

1348
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:40,960
Just stand there.

1349
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,000
He won't open his mouth.

1350
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,800
He doesn't talk.

1351
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,560
Just stand there.

1352
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,840
It's a watermark.

1353
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:46,920
You know?

1354
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,440
Water mark.

1355
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,200
I kept hearing them

1356
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,040
at the dining table.

1357
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,600
They are also loud.

1358
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,880
I can hear it even if I don't listen to it.

1359
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,320
For example,

1360
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,240
about my bad date.

1361
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,560
and laugh at me.

1362
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,440
He gave me too many cameras.

1363
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,120
Then you are...

1364
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,880
You're affecting my experience.

1365
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,240
Yes.

1366
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,840
Shouldn't your feelings be more important?

1367
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,600
Yes.

1368
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,440
How could there be a provocation?

1369
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,560
Now I really realize

1370
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,760
what intervention is.

1371
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,440
This is intervention.

1372
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,120
Brothers intervene.

1373
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm so mad.

1374
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,480
They thought it was a joke.

1375
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,760
But the soup doesn't think

1376
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,720
she was joking.

1377
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,320
And she...

1378
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,840
didn't deny it,

1379
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,560
the soup may

1380
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,680
your emotions.

1381
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,720
The soup

1382
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,920
a lot of pressure today.

1383
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,400
Very stressful.

1384
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,040
It's uncomfortable.

1385
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,880
He probably wants to move forward.

1386
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,280
But...

1387
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,840
That camera made him uncomfortable.

1388
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,960
He didn't. He was frustrated.

1389
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,000
Yes.

1390
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,800
You'll win if you leave.

1391
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,080
Really?

1392
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:08,640
Let's go this way.

1393
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,880
You're right.

1394
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,520
Tom.

1395
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,840
I don't know.

1396
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,280
My mind is clear today.

1397
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,480
Tom.

1398
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,280
Where did you go on your date?

1399
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,600
We went to Cat Cafe.

1400
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,560
How was it today?

1401
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,560
I don't know. I'm too nervous.

1402
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,400
You're nervous too.

1403
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,280
You're forcing a smile now.

1404
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,440
It's broken.

1405
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,480
I quit.

1406
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,280
I quit.

1407
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,280
I can't win.

1408
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,480
I don't feel well today.

1409
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,960
I need to rest today.

1410
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,400
In my opinion,

1411
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,320
two people who like each other

1412
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,720
At least they won't do this in public.

1413
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,560
in public.

1414
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,520
Actually I was sitting on the sofa

1415
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,920
I didn't listen to it too much.

1416
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,000
But it was loud.

1417
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,520
Did he take photos for you?

1418
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,920
A few.

1419
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,760
I took a photo for you.

1420
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,200
No.

1421
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,560
He's pulling you.

1422
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,960
This is the most intimate behavior today.

1423
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,320
That is...

1424
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,080
he might really care about it.

1425
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,160
but he didn't care about it.

1426
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,120
No, he didn't.

1427
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,000
He did it.

1428
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,840
He didn't pay attention to his actions.

1429
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,680
No matter what he did,

1430
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,320
or did nothing.

1431
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,400
I didn't feel it.

1432
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,040
Lower your voice.

1433
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,840
I didn't feel it. I just didn't.

1434
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:39,840
You know?

1435
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,000
I didn't feel it.

1436
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,360
No matter how much you love me,

1437
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:42,600
how much

1438
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:42,800
It's so much.

1439
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,280
Then I don't feel love means no love.

1440
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,560
Tom.

1441
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,000
You look tired today.

1442
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,240
I'm a little tired.

1443
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,520
I'm a little tired.

1444
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,560
Talk to your sister.

1445
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,600
No, I'm in a good mood.

1446
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,720
I'm just a little tired.

1447
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,880
Okay, Depression Tom.

1448
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,040
I know I want to

1449
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,880
with Susu,

1450
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,240
I heard her disdain

1451
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,280
and mocking,

1452
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,960
may all be in my heart.

1453
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,520
Look, he's running away.

1454
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,800
His emotions are shattered.

1455
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
Lie down.

1456
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,200
I want to go up too.

1457
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,440
I think she doesn't respect me.

1458
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,640
No.

1459
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,080
Misunderstanding.

1460
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,600
And I talked more and more.

1461
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,560
more and more.

1462
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,600
I want to leave.

1463
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,680
The soup is...

1464
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,440
Now you tell me his condition is

1465
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,120
more proactive than what he described to me.

1466
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,680
Do you think everyone is as active as you?

1467
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,480
Right?

1468
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,240
Yes.

1469
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,040
You can't do this.

1470
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,400
I don't want to see them like this.

1471
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,360
I feel sorry for them.

1472
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,680
Really.

1473
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,600
This should be a communication.

1474
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,840
How do you feel today?

1475
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,640
Now I suddenly

1476
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,840
to cricket you.

1477
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,760
Yes.

1478
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,520
She didn't do it. She didn't do it. She didn't do it.

1479
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,280
She didn't.

1480
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:47,960
Really?

1481
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,040
Laughing or something?

1482
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,040
Susu is fine.

1483
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,600
her brother

1484
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,600
laughed at me.

1485
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,760
Susu's statement.

1486
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,160
There might be nothing between them.

1487
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:55,640
It's nothing.

1488
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,320
I was just guided

1489
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,800
It was burned.

1490
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,840
In fact, if someone goes back and says,

1491
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,320
He said it.

1492
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:03,720
Yes.

1493
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,800
Actually, this is a very existent reason.

1494
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,920
No one is on his side.

1495
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,680
You add salt and vinegar.

1496
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,040
Are you telling them not to be together?

1497
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,280
What happened today?

1498
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,240
Calm down.

1499
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,760
Dodo, you're so cute.

1500
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,800
So cute.

1501
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,800
You see a kind expression on your face.

1502
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,160
Don't be angry.

1503
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,200
I was observing Dunhan just now.

1504
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,080
When we were so angry,

1505
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,560
Dunhan was always anxious.

1506
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,080
What should I do?

1507
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,640
Flower, I bought you milk tea.

1508
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,080
Are you happy today?

1509
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,120
Yes.

1510
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,480
Flower is the happiest today.

1511
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,720
Are you happy?

1512
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,680
Not bad.

1513
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,240
Not bad.

1514
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:49,880
Come on.

1515
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:50,840
Here you are.

1516
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,720
You bought it for me?

1517
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,640
For me?

1518
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,040
Bo Ba, a lot of pearls.

1519
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,160
He even bought you some mince.

1520
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,040
Brother.

1521
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,400
I also bought some sweet wine.

1522
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,280
Sweet wine?

1523
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,200
You can eat glutinous rice balls.

1524
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,000
That's great, my little brother.

1525
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,520
Bubble tea.

1526
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,560
I won't scold you anymore.

1527
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,280
I won't scold you anymore.

1528
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,360
You're not scolding me. It's cold violence.

1529
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,560
Who bought this strawberry?

1530
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,280
Fatty.

1531
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,840
There's strawberry cake here.

1532
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,320
The one you didn't eat that night.

1533
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,960
That's what I didn't eat that night.

1534
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,960
But I asked, it's gone.

1535
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,480
It's sold out.

1536
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,400
Where did you go?

1537
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,360
Yes.

1538
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,320
Why can you go on a date?

1539
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,560
No.

1540
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,840
We're going shopping.

1541
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,360
Purchase?

1542
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,240
Great.

1543
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,400
She's so talkative now.

1544
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,160
Girls in love are different.

1545
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,200
What were you guys doing?

1546
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,880
I went to Cat Cafe.

1547
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,440
What did you do?

1548
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,040
I made it.

1549
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,160
What did you make?

1550
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:43,840
Keykebabs.

1551
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,560
I want to do it too.

1552
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,160
It's okay. I'll get it tomorrow.

1553
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,560
Don't bother.

1554
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,600
Those who are prepared will prepare in advance.

1555
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,600
I'm going to rest.

1556
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,720
Good night in this world
