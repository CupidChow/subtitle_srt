1
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,200
It's called Tata. It's called Tata. It's called Tata. It's called Tata. Ta-da. Ta-da. Ta-da.

2
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,080
I like taking photos.

3
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,000
I like pets.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,960
I like walking dogs.

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,400
I like watching movies.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,080
When I was a sophomore,

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,520
my brothers took me into the industry.

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,840
and started to be a model.

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,120
My hands and feet are like

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,400
a cheerful boy.

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,520
I was three years older than her.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,840
I saw a photo by chance.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,640
I think it was when I was five.

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,880
with my family when I was five.

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,120
She was wearing sunglasses.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,920
and made a cute pose.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,039
That was the first time I realized

18
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,039
I had a sister.

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,400
We planned to get the second child.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,680
I told her when we got married.

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,759
I told her to have two children

22
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,200
Both daughters

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,600
Both sons and two children

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,800
Because when she gives birth to a daughter,

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,360
many people told her not to give birth.

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,240
I said no.

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,039
I want to give birth now.

28
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,240
The two of them are younger

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,640
They're smaller.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,080
and have two children.

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,720
Both have friends

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,640
That's how you consider giving birth to two kids

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,560
It didn't go so well when giving birth to a daughter

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,040
The delivery room

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
About five hours

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,520
Maybe four or five hours

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,560
I was very sad.

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,759
Then there was a power outage.

39
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,480
It's been over an hour. It's been a while. It's been a while.

40
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,760
It's more urgent

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,440
My family is outside

42
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,280
I don't know what happened.

43
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,720
But the nurse

44
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,160
told us that

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,800
It's okay.

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,440
The electricity came after the birth.

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,480
Our comrades just said

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,040
call her a power outage.

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,360
Children can be

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,040
One girl and one child.

51
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,440
It's good to have both children, right?

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,000
It's still full of happiness.

53
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,720
I've liked you since I was a kid

54
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,640
When I first saw her,

55
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,800
Touch her feet

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,320
Kiss her face

57
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,960
It's very warm.

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,680
Seeing this scene,

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,440
my daughter is a very beautiful

60
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,160
and adorable girl.

61
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,680
She's really a good girl.

62
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,560
In the eyes of others,

63
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,480
They are all very polite

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,960
From elementary school to college

65
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,480
from elementary school to college.

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,840
We work hard.

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,280
My family said

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,720
they are the top dishes of the Luo family.

69
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,040
The best dish.

70
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,320
The most beautiful dish.

71
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,360
That's what it means.

72
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,960
We fought a lot when we were kids.

73
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,280
Yeah.

74
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,320
Come on. Come on.

75
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,079
I don't have much

76
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,600
to play a brother.

77
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,720
When I was young, I was at home with him.

78
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,880
I had a

79
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,480
Mickey's watch.

80
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,000
He pretended to take a look.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
But he removed the Mickey on my watch

82
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,680
on my watch.

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,880
She cried at home

84
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,079
Then he told his mom to come here

85
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,480
It was memorable

86
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,120
Until now,

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,840
my Mickey watch.

88
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,000
I think you did it on purpose.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,440
Because I feel that every watch

90
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,760
was ruined by him.

91
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,680
My hand is really bad. My hand is really bad.

92
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,760
She bought an ice cream

93
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,520
She bought ice cream

94
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,080
I asked her if I could have a bite.

95
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
She said yes.

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
She said you could only bite a little.

97
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,560
Then I took a big bite on purpose.

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,800
Half of it.

99
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,760
Half of what?

100
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,120
She ate the whole ball.

101
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,000
Then she threw the ice cream

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,200
and left crying.

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,360
I liked playing Go back then.

104
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,680
I played Go with him at home.

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,840
And he

106
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,320
in the game,

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,920
he was a little naughty.

108
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,600
Then I just

109
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,840
I flipped the chess.

110
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,600
and opened it.

111
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,440
Then I left crying.

112
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
I was angry.

113
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,000
He lost. He lost.

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,640
Because he lost.

115
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,920
Then he retracted the game.

116
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,800
Maybe he's a bit "cheating".

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,080
to tease her.

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
After she graduated,

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,640
we're in the same industry now.

120
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,880
That's why

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,640
like a brother.

122
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,680
I don't have many friends in Shanghai.

123
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,760
I don't know

124
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,720
I don't know anyone.

125
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
Then he took me to make friends

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,560
his friends.

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,640
This is to expand my circle.

128
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,840
It makes my personality

129
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,920
more outgoing.

130
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,600
Only when you grow up

131
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,960
You know how important he is.

132
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,000
He can be best friends

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
and family love.

134
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,720
I can't tell my parents

135
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,280
to his parents.

136
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,600
with him.

137
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,280
and grow up together.

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,160
and company.

139
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
We can help each other

140
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,360
and help each other

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,800
friends or friends.

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,120
can also share

143
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,200
I can't tell my parents.

144
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,280
A confidant who shared her secret.

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,640
Isn't that what I just said?

146
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,520
Right?

147
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,360
Daddy has decided

148
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,480
I've decided

149
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,400
a father may

150
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,280
and education

151
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,240
and education.

152
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,120
Maybe

153
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,400
Mommy. Mommy.

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,600
Mommy will be more

155
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
Dad will be a part of it too.

156
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,200
Yeah. Yeah.

157
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,080
Like this. Like this. Like this.

158
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,800
Okay. Okay.

159
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,600
Right. Right.

160
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,680
If it's dad's red face

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,640
Mom will sing the white face

162
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,240
Mom sings red face and dad sings white face

163
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,200
I also learned calligraphy.

164
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,640
My family is all on my own.

165
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,680
I can learn whatever I want.

166
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,160
They won't force us.

167
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
But I gave up halfway.

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,040
After learning,

169
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,600
I don't want to learn it anymore.

170
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,280
Like this.

171
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,920
When I was a kid,

172
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,160
because they helped me

173
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,960
for me.

174
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,360
Street dance, taekwondo

175
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,400
But I took too much of my weekend time.

176
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,880
I was going to pay that time.

177
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,640
But I cried.

178
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,240
Then I didn't pay the bill.

179
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,920
Yes.

180
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,280
We were not at home once.

181
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
they drew

182
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
on the bedroom wall

183
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,360
a flower.

184
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,840
Right? When we came back,

185
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,600
I was angry.

186
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,840
But it was funny when I saw them

187
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,600
Because they felt

188
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,520
as if they did something wrong.

189
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,720
Scared of us.

190
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
But we can't

191
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,920
We don't usually

192
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,760
to their children, right?

193
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,040
That's how we laugh.

194
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,640
Tell him not to do this again.

195
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,520
Every week,

196
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,120
every week.

197
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,480
The owners there

198
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
They all know us

199
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,000
They also know us.

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,920
When we were young,

201
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,200
If I had a fight with him,

202
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,760
I'll throw things at home.

203
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,840
This is taboo

204
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,080
It's very serious. It's very serious.

205
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,440
Yes.

206
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,280
Once we fell something,

207
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,120
he asked us

208
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,440
to reflect on our mistakes.

209
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,120
and stop us from going to school.

210
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,200
Let us reflect on ourselves.

211
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,000
One is not to talk back to mom.

212
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,680
You can't touch these two

213
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,920
I usually nag a lot of kids.

214
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,440
She's not afraid of me.

215
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
Don't talk back to your mom

216
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,960
You can't touch it.

217
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,480
When his dad says something,

218
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
they were afraid.

219
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,960
I just corrected the big direction.

220
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,320
But when his dad talks too much,

221
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,480
when he talks too much.

222
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,680
I feel bad for my child.

223
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
I've been dancing

224
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,960
in class.

225
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,400
I may be worried

226
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,680
my parents worry about me

227
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,600
more than her.

228
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,320
They don't worry about my study.

229
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,360
I know how to watch mobile phones

230
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,960
watch TV and play mobile phones.

231
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,000
And sometimes

232
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,960
I'd peel the door quietly.

233
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
I used to be the role.

234
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,200
I saw him there secretly.

235
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,400
or there.

236
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,760
or playing with something.

237
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,280
or playing with my phone.

238
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,600
I'll snitch.

239
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,120
My sister often complained to us.

240
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,320
The elder brother bullied her.

241
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,720
That's it.

242
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,760
But we spoil our sister

243
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,920
more.

244
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,800
in his mind.

245
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,160
I think it's...

246
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,400
It's me. It's me.

247
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,120
(Dad!)

248
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,760
Dad! Dad!

249
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,520
He...

250
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,840
The younger sister

251
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,280
in front of her.

252
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,440
Everyone cares about her.

253
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,799
She is a kind

254
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,600
who loves pets.

255
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,000
It's cold in winter.

256
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
I'll make them a cat nest.

257
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,960
But my daughter can't take care of herself.

258
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,720
I fed her until seven years old.

259
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,280
Like grapes,

260
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,920
I peeled them one by one

261
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,520
in front of her.

262
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,840
For example,

263
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,200
we have a separate room.

264
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,920
She reserved the room first

265
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,280
Then her son will choose the rest.

266
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
A room that's not good enough

267
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,880
But we'll give her

268
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,840
and give her something better.

269
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
My daughter is her university entrance exam.

270
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,040
I couldn't help but

271
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,040
I hugged her and cried.

272
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,680
I was worried that she couldn't eat well or eat well.

273
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm afraid she'll catch a cold when she sleeps.

274
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,560
I was worried.

275
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,320
When I get home,

276
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,760
I've been in a bad state for days.

277
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,840
I was thinking about

278
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,000
with my daughter.

279
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,840
I cried for days.

280
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,720
I can't stop

281
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,160
can't calm down for a long time.

282
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,840
The way we express love

283
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,800
is to think about each other

284
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,720
about each other.

285
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,920
It's mainly when we walk on the street,

286
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,360
on the street.

287
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,720
We hold hands.

288
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,800
When he goes shopping,

289
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,560
when he sees something nice,

290
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,840
he would take a photo and tell me

291
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,480
"This is pretty."

292
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,960
Do you like it?

293
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,360
I'll buy it for you.

294
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,000
The four of us

295
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,240
in our family.

296
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,800
It's called "House of triumphant."

297
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,480
The kids are outside.

298
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,840
outside?

299
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
and life

300
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,200
talk inside.

301
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,480
Join us

302
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,160
share with us.

303
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,440
What did you do today?

304
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,680
To exercise.

305
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,240
or take a walk.

306
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,560
When are you going home?

307
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,520
Tell her

308
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,920
at home.

309
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,880
For example, grandpa and grandma.

310
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,040
How are you feeling?

311
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,680
We often chat like this in the group chat.

312
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,040
We should talk every day.

313
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,960
I'll be more straightforward with them.

314
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
I said I love you

315
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,760
They should be shy.

316
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,080
They're all in the form of photos

317
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,200
to answer like this.

318
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,640
Every New Year,

319
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,400
or when I have time to go home,

320
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,880
I always give them a big hug.

321
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Son or daughter, I miss you.

322
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,400
That's it.

323
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,440
My daughter.

324
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,240
What Mother's Day?

325
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,600
she wrote to me

326
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,680
or give me a little card.

327
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,280
and draw

328
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,680
of the four of us.

329
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,160
At the beginning,

330
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,720
didn't think highly of their parents.

331
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
I just think maybe my dad is too aggressive

332
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,160
and a little masculine.

333
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,520
We often joke.

334
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,760
At first, we were the least optimistic couple.

335
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,360
But I didn't let you down.

336
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,760
His company opened a hotel.

337
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,840
I was a receptionist there.

338
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,280
One day,

339
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,720
he and his staff

340
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,200
with his staff.

341
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,120
The first time I opened the door for him,

342
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,840
I didn't know why

343
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,960
when I saw him.

344
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,080
Then he came to eat many times.

345
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,920
I...

346
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,560
I wanted to avoid him several times.

347
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,000
That feeling.

348
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,280
My heart beats.

349
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,560
I blushed too.

350
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,320
Maybe it's love at first sight.

351
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,840
Then he might know

352
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,720
through his friends,

353
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,080
we'll be together like this.

354
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,440
We grew up

355
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,280
a happy family.

356
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,240
And I watched

357
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,360
how my parents come all the way here

358
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,040
tolerate each other

359
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,120
and take care of each other.

360
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,960
Dad will change himself because of his mom.

361
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,280
I think this is very important.

362
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,520
Before they got married,

363
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,040
at the beginning,

364
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,280
he was very stubborn

365
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,000
and tough.

366
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,040
But later

367
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,520
I got along with my mom.

368
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,320
All these years,

369
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
I have

370
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,720
has been made up by my mom.

371
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,800
Can I say that?

372
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
He is

373
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,080
a very gentle state.

374
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,160
I think

375
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,360
change yourself for each other.

376
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,120
This is actually a rare point.

377
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,680
I think good love is

378
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,000
tolerate each other

379
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,720
and help each other.

380
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,080
and accompany each other.

381
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,040
will affect

382
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,560
on our love view.

383
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,760
She would also share

384
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,080
about her love life.

385
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,000
For example, let me be the judge

386
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,280
or analyze this.

387
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,480
I'll give her some advice

388
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,440
and some feedback.

389
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,160
I don't know if he'll listen or not.

390
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,120
He's very objective.

391
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
Who can listen to this?

392
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,760
Because she probably

393
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,200
she would tell me after the deal was done.

394
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,160
I didn't participate in the process.

395
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,000
Because she is

396
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,240
a slow person.

397
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
is among a group of people.

398
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,440
if she is willing to talk to someone,

399
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
or share,

400
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,840
Maybe she is interesting.

401
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,400
Yes.

402
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,520
I hope she can become more independent and stronger.

403
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,640
and make the family less worried about her.

404
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,400
Yes.

405
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,280
Daughter, go to this show.

406
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,360
Dad and mom

407
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,480
are your strong support.

408
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,760
Come on.

409
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,640
I'll go first.

410
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,800
Grab your track.

411
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,960
Xiao Ling is so fierce.

412
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,200
I'm so happy. I'm back.

413
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,440
What's wrong with me?

414
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,800
I gave myself away.

415
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,200
will you give it to me?

416
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,920
Do you think

417
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,280
I'm here to help you?

418
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,400
What do you mean?

419
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,880
I will focus on observing

420
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,600
Susu and Xinxin.

421
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,280
Comedians don't have love

422
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,200
If he had been in contact

423
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,160
for a whole day.

424
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,040
I didn't think he would give me that day.

425
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,200
What does this mean?

426
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,680
What does it mean?

427
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,320
They started this date.

428
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,640
I want to know

429
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,360
Is it the same person you want?

430
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,440
Did you talk so much

431
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,640
when you went on a date last time?

432
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,640
Who did you date the other day?

433
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,320
Can I call it a cold war?

434
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,520
What kind of girl do you like?

435
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,360
Now there's a quiet girl

436
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,240
and a proactive girl.

437
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,280
who do you want to know more?

438
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,600
I brought a book of answers.

439
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,920
Go ahead.

440
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,520
Yes.

441
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,040
I think

442
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,080
she doesn't really like me.

443
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,320
I never

444
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,480
to meet many people.

445
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,040
Today we also want to welcome

446
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,680
the new member

447
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,040
Huang Hongfan.

448
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,400
Hello, everyone.

449
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,600
I'm singer Huang Hongfan.

450
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,240
Welcome.

451
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,200
Welcome Huang Hongfan.

452
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,400
Do you feel blunt in love?

453
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,760
Huang Zihong, you're a blunt person.

454
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,240
I still believe in details.

455
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
No wonder he rejected

456
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,520
was turned down by him.

457
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,360
You're a little blunt.

458
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,520
I can't be alone at all.

459
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,800
I just fell asleep.

460
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,760
In my dream,

461
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,080
I have friends with me.

462
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,760
I had many dreams.

463
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,640
You're too E.

464
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,440
So many dreams.

465
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,560
I'm the opposite of him.

466
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,560
I'm the opposite of them.

467
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,960
Try it. It feels good.

468
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,160
No.

469
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,520
Impossible.

470
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,960
It's amazing.

471
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,280
This scene is so confusing.

472
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,000
Wonderful.

473
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,880
Is the date that serious?

474
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,080
It's okay.

475
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,320
College students are at a good age to be sad.

476
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,000
He's just like me.

477
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,120
just like me.

478
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,320
So, please.

479
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,680
This episode

480
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,080
we are

481
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,920
too dramatic.

482
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,040
It's not like that.
