1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It's like drinking wild wine

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

6
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,840
Take part in it on Weibo #Love and Siblings

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
On Weibo. Participant #Love & Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game. You'll get a surprise reward.

8
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,320
Our date is quite rare.

9
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,960
Since I like her,

10
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,520
I want to make a breakthrough.

11
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
and take the initiative.

12
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,320
I want her to feel happy.

13
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,920
It feels like a surprise.

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,600
Make her feel different.

15
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,880
My expectations for this date

16
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,680
than before.

17
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,760
I gave up this date because of my brother.

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,840
To help me.

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,200
You're going on a date.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,240
Let's go.

21
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,760
So I'm looking forward to his changes today.

22
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,000
Susu is here.

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,760
Hello.

24
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,720
I'm afraid this cat might run away.

25
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,760
I won't stand up.

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,960
There are so many Mimi.

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,280
Play with the kitty stick for a while.

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,680
They will all pass.

29
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,400
I just saw a fat one.

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,960
Golden slowly.

31
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,760
This is the golden layer.

32
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,360
Yes.

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,800
It's a golden layer without hair.

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,920
It won't let me hold it.

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,920
German.

36
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,720
The hair is so good.

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,040
How can you tell?

38
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,320
Yes, I have one at home too.

39
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,079
I want you.

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
I like it.

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,400
I want to take it home.

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,720
Because I had a dead cat

43
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,800
is the same species as it.

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,640
and black.

45
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,200
It turns out that you can only be remembered when you disappear.

46
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,160
I'm speechless.

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,760
I bought some cat food and put it here.

48
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,480
A cat.

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,920
What's this? Frozen dry.

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,400
Thank you.

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,400
It ate me.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,640
It took it away.

53
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,040
Look at its eyes.

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,960
Blue.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
Blue.

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,120
Really? Are you a foreign cat?

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,880
You are?

58
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,760
It's a mixed-blood cat.

59
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,160
Xinjiang Cat.

60
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,120
Viorl cats.

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,720
Come here.

62
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,920
Come here, Mimi.

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,440
Help me squeeze it.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,400
Guolifang.

65
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,320
I think Cat Cafe

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,920
is a very loving place.

67
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,840
Feel the vibe of love.

68
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Did you

69
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
yesterday?

70
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,440
What am I unhappy about?

71
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,320
Guolifang.

72
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,760
No.

73
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,480
When I passed by your room,

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,320
What?

75
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,960
Actually,

76
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,280
I was filled with guilt.

77
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,440
Actually, I really want to go on a date.

78
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,400
I can't waste a good chance.

79
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,480
Because I knew

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,000
she would choose her not to go.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
In the end, she chose not to go.

82
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,640
I felt so guilty.

83
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,080
I feel so sorry for her.

84
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,040
How could she be so nice?

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,600
Yes, I guess something.

86
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,760
What are you looking at?

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
What are you looking at?

88
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,680
There's a kitten with a high tail.

89
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,600
It means

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,840
It thinks this is its territory.

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,720
It's very happy.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,120
Have you ever had a cat?

93
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
My sister is raising them.

94
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,520
You're not familiar with them.

95
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,360
Yes.

96
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,200
What cat?

97
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,440
There's a short cat.

98
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,320
and a garden cat.

99
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,280
What's your cat's name?

100
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,200
Kitty.

101
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,000
One is called

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
Three.

103
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,760
Because its butt has a black three.

104
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,880
Really?

105
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,640
Another one is called Wendy.

106
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,480
Wendy

107
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,000
(Wendy)

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,680
I made it randomly.

109
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,720
Then I used it.

110
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,120
Guolifang.

111
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,240
I adopted

112
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,080
adopted a stray dog.

113
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,400
I named it Hello.

114
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,240
So what?

115
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,720
Every time the guests come in

116
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,720
Hello

117
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,320
I often...

118
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,560
Hello where are you

119
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,800
I'm fully equipped today.

120
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
Guolifang.

121
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Let me take a photo for you.

122
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,240
The kitten is on your leg.

123
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,800
How to do it?

124
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,640
I don't know how to do it.

125
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,000
It's okay. You don't have to do it. Suit yourself.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Really?

127
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,240
Yes.

128
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,440
Photos.

129
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,120
Horizontal.

130
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Pat me and it.

131
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,200
Pat it.

132
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,360
Pat me and it.

133
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,560
This...

134
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,080
How to shoot this?

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,560
Good.

136
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,920
Aren't you holding it too...

137
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
Why? The angle of death?

138
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,120
Did you look good?

139
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,640
Sit down.

140
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,200
Okay, I'm just cooking.

141
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,800
No one will cooperate with you because...

142
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,040
Do I look good?

143
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
Is it pretty?

144
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,960
Let me see.

145
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,720
No.

146
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,280
Don't grab.

147
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,600
No, let me see.

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,320
Well...

149
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,080
I have something to do.

150
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't feel like talking right now.

151
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,440
What should I say?

152
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,360
Don't tell me.

153
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,800
Well,

154
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,120
I don't know why

155
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,480
become so rough.

156
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:41,760
It's so strong.

157
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,159
I'm impressed.

158
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,280
Guoli.

159
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,600
Guo Lifang.

160
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,440
Guo Liwan.

161
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
What was the name of that room?

162
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,040
Romantic House.

163
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,880
Guoli.

164
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,280
Will you go if I drive?

165
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,560
Guoli.

166
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Do you want me to go?

167
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,000
Guolifang.

168
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,960
I just want you to go.

169
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,560
Guolifang.

170
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,200
Then I'll go.

171
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,000
What can I do there?

172
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,560
I have to think.

173
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,920
I think...

174
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,120
What if we fail?

175
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,360
No one will come in.

176
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
What if someone comes in?

177
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,480
Then I'll leave.

178
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,600
I won't

179
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,920
I won't apply for this share.

180
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,800
I'll ask someone else to apply

181
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,440
to see if you will come out.

182
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,880
Fine, I'll go to your room to find you. Unbelievable.

183
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,080
When will you write me another letter?

184
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,080
Who will write to whom?

185
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
You can write it for me.

186
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
I can write to you.

187
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,600
I've never written a letter to anyone.

188
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,440
It's an honor.

189
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,080
Because I think

190
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,240
is too...

191
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,000
Very formal.

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,600
Yes, very formal.

193
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,400
No one is worth writing.

194
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,000
So without the rules,

195
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,200
I don't think I can receive it.

196
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,400
Maybe.

197
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,600
So will you write it to me?

198
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,280
Anything.

199
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,880
Anything.

200
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,000
but I couldn't do anything.

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,360
(You're so sensitive.)

202
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,880
You're sensitive too.

203
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,040
Great.

204
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,600
I'm not the only sensitive one.

205
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,640
What? This is a good thing.

206
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,480
You want to compete?

207
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,520
Guoli.

208
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,360
is expected.

209
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
We may be

210
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,960
relaxed.

211
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,520
Killing cats

212
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,120
Then sit there and drink and chat.

213
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
Maybe we can talk about something we haven't talked about before.

214
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,040
I want to know more about it.

215
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,800
But

216
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,560
I felt that they were a little tense.

217
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,000
I didn't say to be relaxed.

218
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,680
This is Mimi.

219
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,480
This is you.

220
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,960
I thought you don't have a dog.

221
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,440
Who doesn't?

222
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,520
All of them?

223
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,720
Yes.

224
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,520
Don't you fight?

225
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,880
Who doesn't have a dog? You got it wrong again.

226
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,480
I have a dog.

227
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
I have a dog that has been raising for nine years.

228
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,800
I just told you

229
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I picked up a stray dog to greet you.

230
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,880
You said I don't have a dog.

231
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,440
I only remember you have seven cats.

232
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,280
I said I picked up a stray dog.

233
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,840
Hello.

234
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
I just told him last second

235
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,280
I adopted a stray dog a while ago.

236
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
In the next second, he said in shock

237
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,560
you had a dog.

238
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,400
I thought you only have a cat.

239
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,200
His words

240
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,240
he's not listening to me.

241
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,200
Guoli

242
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,360
Guoguo

243
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,160
Guoli

244
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,440
Oh no, bro, help me.

245
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,200
Fruit L.

246
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,360
Die.

247
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,440
Fruits.

248
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,160
Everyone has fur.

249
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,800
Guoli

250
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,720
and die.

251
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:33,840
I have

252
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,200
Fruit rice.

253
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,320
Really?

254
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:40,920
GuoC.

255
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,840
Really?

256
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,240
Guoguo

257
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,640
Guoli

258
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,600
GuoC.

259
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,760
Guoli

260
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,520
Really?

261
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,080
Really?

262
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
I saw some hair on your eyes.

263
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,400
Where?

264
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,000
Really?

265
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,440
There's one here.

266
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,120
Is it fur?

267
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,680
You have a lot of hair.

268
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,640
Maybe your eyes are big.

269
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,040
It's easy to get hairs.

270
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,680
Your eyelids will be stuck.

271
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,080
Cut cat hair.

272
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,560
Your double eyelids will get cat hair stuck.

273
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,840
I think I have hair on my eyes too.

274
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,360
The whole chatting atmosphere today

275
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,560
makes me feel less comfortable.

276
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,240
I didn't feel that comfortable.

277
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,640
I didn't get to know each other more.

278
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,680
or we started something more profound.

279
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,760
I don't think we talked much today.

280
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,680
and I didn't meet my expectations.

281
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,880
I feel a little uncomfortable.

282
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,240
A little unhappy.

283
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,640
In general, I'm quite happy.

284
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,200
Being with the person I like

285
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,360
Although I have a lot of time to let go,

286
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,280
It's a bit long.

287
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,000
But in general, I'm happy.

288
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,440
Let's go.

289
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,360
Let's go.

290
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,520
My choice is to let my sister go.

291
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,360
I think

292
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,560
more than I do.

293
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,480
Information date.

294
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,240
Confidence date.

295
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,880
Hello.

296
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,280
I have another chance

297
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,440
to have more contact with Hua.

298
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,280
more.

299
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,560
When I saw Tae-seo,

300
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,240
I was happy too.

301
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,440
Because I thought yesterday

302
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,480
I wanted both of us to get in touch again.

303
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
You found this place.

304
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,160
Thank you.

305
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,040
What are you doing?

306
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,040
I've found some maps.

307
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,520
Take a look.

308
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,560
I made this.

309
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,440
You need to do this.

310
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,800
Do this.

311
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,440
Yes.

312
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,280
I did that before I went there.

313
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,720
I searched a lot of flowers.

314
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,160
I want to make a flower for her.

315
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,560
I'll make flowers.

316
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,720
You make flowers?

317
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,360
Sure.

318
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,800
Have you thought of going on a date with me today?

319
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,280
Yes.

320
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Really?

321
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,680
Why did I think of

322
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,480
Who wrote this letter to me?

323
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,200
Who doesn't know?

324
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,520
Yes.

325
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,200
The letter I wrote to you.

326
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,360
But

327
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,560
I didn't receive it.

328
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,920
So I'll make you a flower today, okay?

329
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Okay.

330
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,600
We can find the color first.

331
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,240
Okay.

332
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,480
White.

333
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,880
Is this okay?

334
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,960
I want this.

335
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,040
It's nice. You have long hands and legs.

336
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,160
Okay.

337
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,680
Let's start.

338
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,920
Did you cook well before?

339
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,000
I didn't do much.

340
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,920
Didn't I write you the letter yesterday?

341
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,640
At that time,

342
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,120
I wanted to give you a flower.

343
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
It's too hard.

344
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,920
I really can't learn it.

345
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,040
I tried my best.

346
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,600
Failed.

347
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,920
Then draw one.

348
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,600
I drew it from the beginning.

349
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,720
It was too ugly.

350
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,240
So I wrote another letter.

351
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,560
Did you receive a text

352
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,120
or "I'm not going on a date"?

353
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,040
I got it.

354
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,480
So you're just like me.

355
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,280
I want the bag, Yinbo.

356
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,280
How did you know it was me?

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
Maybe you were the only one who gave it to me.

358
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,800
So you only received one letter from me?

359
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,520
Yes.

360
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,360
Really?

361
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,320
Really?

362
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,960
Call me brother again.

363
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,320
I'll think I'm older than you.

364
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,840
But I think I'm really older than you.

365
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,920
Why can't I call you Yinbo?

366
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,520
Sure.

367
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,560
What do you want to call me?

368
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:06,960
Chen'er.

369
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,360
Brother Bo.

370
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,720
Xiao'er wants to be happy forever.

371
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,560
Okay.

372
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,680
OK, Yinbo.

373
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,000
I got it.

374
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,800
But

375
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,400
Like that album

376
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,000
I wasn't there

377
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,160
when you introduced me.

378
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,800
I'll show you the album later.

379
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,400
In my album,

380
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,760
in my album.

381
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,280
My mom was with me when I was a kid

382
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,800
so I had a lot of photos.

383
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,800
My mom takes pictures for me when she's here.

384
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,280
So I'm grateful

385
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,840
for taking photos for me last time.

386
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,600
Because when I grew up,

387
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,360
when I grow up.

388
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,040
I'm at your service.

389
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,080
We need to take photos later.

390
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,400
One two three four

391
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,920
Fight the tiger on the mountain.

392
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,440
I feel like I'm playing five-in-a-row chess.

393
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,240
I'm calculating.

394
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,920
It's okay.

395
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,520
Slowly.

396
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,560
Slowly.

397
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,359
Don't rush me.

398
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,480
Why are you copying me?

399
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,119
I don't want you to feel pressured.

400
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,359
One, two, three, four.

401
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,400
When we go back,

402
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,200
our eyes will turn into chicken eyes.

403
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,839
Do you know how to fight?

404
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,119
I can.

405
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,560
Me too.

406
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,840
But I won't perform.

407
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,280
You...

408
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,160
It's me.

409
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,760
Is your eye cured?

410
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,680
Look.

411
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,280
I think it's a little...

412
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,760
A little.

413
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,240
Much better.

414
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,320
It was so serious that day.

415
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,880
So you saw

416
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
we entered the romantic house, right?

417
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,760
I took a look at the door.

418
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,560
You two are enough.

419
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,520
I'm leaving.

420
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,240
I didn't even see you.

421
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,320
Really.

422
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,040
Secretly, Yinbo.

423
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,520
What?

424
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,960
I didn't disturb you.

425
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,720
Yes.

426
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,800
So what are you talking about inside?

427
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,760
Can we talk?

428
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,320
Yes.

429
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,640
Just a chat.

430
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080
We just talked about the misunderstanding yesterday.

431
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
I didn't solve it.

432
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,400
I don't think so.

433
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,200
I wish you were a few days late.

434
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,720
I'll give this to you as a birthday gift.

435
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,240
You too.

436
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,560
Okay.

437
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,880
I have a request.

438
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,280
You owe me a birthday present.

439
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,160
Okay.

440
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,000
You just came in.

441
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,560
we were not very close.

442
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,400
You didn't ask me to play with you.

443
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,480
All right.

444
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
That's true.

445
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,400
Yes.

446
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,560
I have no choice.

447
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,120
You know it too.

448
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,000
passive.

449
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,560
passive boy.

450
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,120
Seriously.

451
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,560
Can't you change it?

452
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,560
Actually, I am.

453
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,520
These days,

454
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,000
I haven't taken the initiative.

455
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,560
Not enough.

456
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,720
You still want to ask me?

457
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,440
Enough.

458
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,320
The meal I cooked for you yesterday.

459
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,600
Right?

460
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,800
What do you want to eat?

461
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,160
What do you want to eat?

462
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,840
I'm going to cook.

463
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,240
Really?

464
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,680
All right.

465
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,760
Eat whatever you cook.

466
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,120
Do you want rice or noodles?

467
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,680
Rice or noodles.

468
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,640
Hua, what do you want to eat?

469
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,560
Anything.

470
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,200
Fried meat with chili.

471
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,000
It's not spicy.

472
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,160
It's spicy.

473
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,400
What are you doing

474
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,280
Fried pork with chili.

475
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,120
I don't usually ask

476
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
What do you usually eat?

477
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,960
I'll just do it.

478
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,720
Let's eat.

479
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,040
Okay.

480
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,480
Like this.

481
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,720
Like this.

482
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Do you think

483
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
your fried pork with chili

484
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Do you learn how to teach?

485
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,960
It's my first time.

486
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,080
Fried pork with chili is delicious

487
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Really

488
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,640
Because the dishes I made before

489
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,920
are basically not spicy.

490
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,760
It’s such an honor, Yinbo.

491
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,120
Is my cooking OK?

492
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,160
It's really delicious.

493
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,200
I’m worried I’ll fail.

494
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,280
Bobo is reserved.

495
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,480
Can’t you see it?

496
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,200
A little.

497
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,320
I'm not good at talking anyway.

498
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,440
I'm not good at expressing myself.

499
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,880
You can only do it, right?

500
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,240
Didn't I write all the letters to you?

501
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't you think

502
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,280
a friendly relationship?

503
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
No?

504
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,400
Aren't you going to take the initiative?

505
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,000
But I think

506
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,880
you are like writing to us.

507
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,880
Okay.

508
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,000
What impressed me the most

509
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,680
was the rushing and uneasy.

510
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,920
That's the truth.

511
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,960
I didn't expect

512
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,200
I would give you

513
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,520
and anxiety.

514
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,760
I didn't expect it at first.

515
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,160
Maybe because I was nervous,

516
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,600
If I go out with my friends,

517
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,120
between me and my friends.

518
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,600
Like this.

519
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,440
You should have told me earlier.

520
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,320
Can't you tell?

521
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,240
I didn't.

522
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,160
Okay.

523
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,600
I thought you would feel awkward.

524
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,280
I was looking for my own reason.

525
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,200
I said I didn't do well that day.

526
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,720
I knew you were like that.

527
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,320
That's my reason.

528
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,880
You already found many topics

529
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,320
on that day.

530
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,920
I have no choice.

531
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,160
I'm sorry.

532
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,240
I'm sorry.

533
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
It's okay.

534
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,320
Let's talk.

535
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,120
Let's talk while doing it.

536
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,480
Don't be too immersed.

537
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,360
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

538
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,600
I'm afraid you can't be like me.

539
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,000
like me.

540
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,880
Can I do it?

541
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,160
What is one plus one?

542
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,440
Four.

543
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,240
Four plus four.

544
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
156 plus 253.

545
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,320
409.

546
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,480
You really

547
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,880
You confused me.

548
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,520
How are you doing these days?

549
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,240
Do you think

550
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,040
better than before?

551
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,120
Yes.

552
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,880
I used to think you didn't like to talk.

553
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
Now,

554
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,480
you've become talkative.

555
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,320
Do you usually talk less in life?

556
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,880
Look who you're talking to.

557
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,640
I don't know what to say.

558
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,720
You will definitely wait

559
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
to talk to you.

560
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,320
It used to be.

561
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,560
Haven't you thought about

562
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,000
to take the initiative?

563
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,520
My friend said the same thing.

564
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:10,960
Yes.

565
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,480
He said, "Would you like to try it yourself?"

566
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,560
Change it.

567
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,440
But it's a little difficult.

568
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,760
For me,

569
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,000
So, Yinbo,

570
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,920
are you a fragile person?

571
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,040
Do you think...

572
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,120
I think it depends on the situation.

573
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,200
I'm quite fragile in love.

574
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,680
Because it's emotional.

575
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,360
Do you cry when you watch a movie?

576
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,240
It's okay.

577
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,480
But when you're in a relationship, I...

578
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,720
You're making me cry.

579
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Can't you tell?

580
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,680
Are you easy to be coaxed?

581
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,200
It's not easy to coax me.

582
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,520
I think

583
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
if you coax me,

584
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,040
I'll lose face.

585
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,760
You know too much.

586
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,440
Now in the small house,

587
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,000
you should know me best.

588
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,880
Really?

589
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,800
Are you recovered?

590
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,880
Not yet.

591
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,280
I'll sort it out.

592
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,960
Do we want to make it into a fridge sticker

593
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,880
or a key chain?

594
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,040
Key chain.

595
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,480
There's a chain behind this wall.

596
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,920
You can choose.

597
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,600
Okay.

598
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,080
Don't drop it easily.

599
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,760
Okay.

600
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,280
Thank you.

601
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,760
It's okay.

602
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,720
It's pretty.

603
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,000
You're done.

604
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,480
It's okay.

605
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,720
Take your time.

606
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,760
Do you want to help me?

607
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,200
Tell me which one.

608
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,480
Fill in here.

609
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,360
I'll fill this side.

610
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,120
Here.

611
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,520
Great, right?

612
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,240
OK?

613
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,680
I'm going to press it.

614
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,480
Go ahead.

615
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Do you want to make fridge stickers

616
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,240
or a key chain?

617
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,840
Key chain.

618
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,240
What do you think?

619
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,720
Yes.

620
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,800
Thank you.

621
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,280
I'll give it to you.

622
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,080
Yours is so beautiful.

623
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,640
Right?

624
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,520
It can't be helped.

625
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,200
Me too.

626
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,040
I know you want the chain.

627
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,680
I think yours looks too good.

628
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,800
It's wrapped.

629
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,240
I don't usually cook

630
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,800
handmade.

631
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,240
But I found my sense of accomplishment

632
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,120
I found my sense of accomplishment.

633
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,880
Being with Tae-seo

634
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,320
with Tae-seo

635
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,680
than before.

636
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,560
Because we get along very well.

637
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
I won't be too hasty and nervous.

638
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,720
I think this is what I want.

639
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,440
Exchange.

640
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,560
I think it's very meaningful.

641
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,800
In this date,

642
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,440
I asked her some questions.

643
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,240
I think

644
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,280
the difference between me and the last date.

645
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,760
I wasn't so passive.

646
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,920
Let's go.

647
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,000
You know what?

648
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,640
At first, I wanted you to do this.

649
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,400
I haven't even found this cat yet.

650
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,680
Yes.

651
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,880
When you see the sunflower, you like it very much.

652
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,720
Then you said,

653
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,480
you're the sunshine flower.

654
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,720
It means I'm the one

655
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,760
I found a piece of grass.

656
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,440
I will pick

657
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,760
my favorite flower.

658
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,080
I won't pick them until the end.

659
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,640
and regret the front.

660
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,120
Okay.

661
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,240
Got it.

662
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,400
Okay. Okay.

663
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,480
I thought

664
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,480
you didn't talk much when you were alone.

665
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,840
I want you to be happy.

666
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,680
Like sunflowers.

667
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,000
And I'm the flower.

668
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,520
Right?

669
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Flower.

670
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,000
Be yourself and give it to me.

671
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,120
and stay with you for me.

672
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,040
But I still don't understand

673
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,400
The envelope yesterday

674
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,280
or "I don't want to go on a date."

675
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,920
What on earth

676
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,040
choose?

677
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,360
You mean you chose me.

678
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,520
I didn't.

679
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:23,880
Yes.

680
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,000
Although both of us

681
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,840
"I want to go on a date,"

682
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,120
But I gave you the letter.

683
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,040
You might have given it to someone else.

684
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,560
Whatever.

685
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,120
I can ask you out twice.

686
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,440
You can do it twice.

687
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,280
Take a nap.

688
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,680
It’s hard to coax him, Yinbo.

689
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,560
I can’t.

690
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,200
You're so handsome.

691
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,800
The sun shines on your face.

692
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,520
Again.

693
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,440
Give it to me.

694
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,280
Let's go on a date.

695
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,960
It's easy to coax.

696
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Let's go on a date.

697
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,920
Aren't you on a date?

698
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,280
You have more tomorrow.

699
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,360
I don't know.

700
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,880
What if at night?

701
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,720
So urgent?

702
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,120
No.

703
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
You're in a hurry.

704
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,920
It's too urgent.

705
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,320
I'm still here.

706
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,520
Why are you sitting here?

707
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,320
Why are you so pretty?

708
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,200
Sit here.

709
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,360
I don't want to hear it.

710
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,520
I feel like

711
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,480
you're saying something like that.

712
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,200
Why does the sun suit you so well?

713
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,440
I don't want to hear it.

714
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,520
Look, the sun is blocking.

715
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,880
You suddenly became depressed.

716
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,760
Stop it.

717
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,400
It's just bright and dark.

718
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,040
So beautiful.

719
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,360
Let me take a video for you.

720
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,240
Here.

721
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,280
Clean up your clothes.

722
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,360
Pretend to sleep.

723
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,960
Is it pretty?

724
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,080
Good night.

725
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,640
Look at the sunshine.

726
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,520
So handsome.

727
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,880
So handsome, Yinbo.

728
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,760
You made me laugh.

729
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,480
Really.

730
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,520
It's sunny.

731
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,200
Are you hungry?

732
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,560
Not bad.

733
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,680
We can have a signature

734
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,320
nutritious fried rice with egg.

735
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,240
Okay.

736
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,800
Do you want green pepper?

737
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,560
Yes.

738
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,000
Okay.

739
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,920
Okay.

740
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,760
Just don't put onions.

741
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,600
I'll eat everything else

742
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,000
Then I'll put some onions

743
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,000
Let me learn how to cook.

744
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,560
Okay.

745
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,200
Look what's in the fridge.

746
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,440
Do you think it can be added?

747
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,720
What do you want to eat?

748
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,640
I don't think so.

749
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,200
You can take out some cabbage

750
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,280
Cabbage

751
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,960
You can add some tomatoes.

752
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,520
Okay.

753
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,840
You can add some meat.

754
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,000
Harry, do you want to eat?

755
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,840
Harry.

756
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,960
I can't hear you with your earphones on.

757
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,200
Harry.

758
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,000
I'll cook it for him.

759
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,480
It's okay.

760
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,800
Egg.

761
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,720
Can you give me an egg?

762
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,840
Can you do it?

763
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,960
I...

764
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,760
will...

765
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
I'll try.

766
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,080
Okay.

767
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
I trust you.

768
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
Where's the egg?

769
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Over there.

770
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,560
Here.

771
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,480
Then add another egg.

772
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
Eggs are more nutritious anyway.

773
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,360
It can make you 1.8 meters tall.

774
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,960
Scary.

775
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,120
Cut the green pepper.

776
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:41,720
Let me do it.

777
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,760
I'll take this.

778
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,120
Give me a friction.

779
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:46,960
Smart.

780
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,760
It's you.

781
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,520
It's almost time for dinner.

782
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,920
OK.

783
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,840
Don't throw it on yourself.

784
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,920
Do you want to take the postgraduate entrance exam?

785
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,800
Actually, I'm a little hesitant.

786
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,080
I think so.

787
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,160
Are you going to stay in Zhejiang Media?

788
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,120
Come to Beijing Film Academy to find me.

789
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,480
OK.

790
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,240
Beijing Film Academy may not pass.

791
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,880
My hands are sore.

792
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,120
Let's change our hands.

793
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,040
Come on, you fry it.

794
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,040
I won't make it burnt.

795
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,040
I'll turn it on.

796
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,800
It's fine.

797
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
How?

798
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,400
Just flip.

799
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,160
Right?

800
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,120
Yes.

801
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,800
It's hard, isn't it?

802
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,360
Be careful when it goes out.

803
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,720
It's a little difficult.

804
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,840
Move to the center.

805
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,320
It's not fun.

806
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,840
Take it back.

807
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,240
Smells good.

808
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,160
Take one for me.

809
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,200
Look.

810
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,480
Chef Wang's fried rice.

811
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,560
What do you think?

812
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,440
Shameless.

813
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,800
But it looks good.

814
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,320
Right?

815
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,360
One last time stir-fry.

816
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,800
You can start cooking.

817
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,520
Countdown to ten seconds.

818
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,160
19.

819
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,680
Three, two, one.

820
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,280
Out of the pot.

821
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,480
I gave all the meat

822
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,440
I can see.

823
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,840
Understand?

824
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,160
That's love.

825
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,840
Come on.

826
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,040
Delicious.

827
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,840
Do you want me to work more?

828
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,800
Add some salt.

829
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,000
No need.

830
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,160
I can't open it.

831
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,920
OK, bro?

832
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,560
It's okay.

833
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,520
Don't open it.

834
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,000
I'll try.

835
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,320
Don't open it.

836
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,880
Map.

837
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,120
I'm so mad.

838
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,960
There are only four of us at home today.

839
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,920
Who knows?

840
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,800
I hope you can stay at home.

841
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,320
Yes.

842
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,440
Yes.

843
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,400
He's a dedicated person.

844
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,720
Yes.

845
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,800
Are you going out?

846
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,200
Going to the supermarket.

847
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,880
If we go grocery shopping,

848
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,800
they will stay at home.

849
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,400
We'll stay in the romantic house.

850
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,480
Let's go

851
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,440
Let's go.

852
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,360
Let's go shopping.

853
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,120
Let's go back with loads.

854
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,600
Yes.

855
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,560
Back to the happy house

856
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,639
Let's eat the cake first.

857
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,080
Let's put the cake first.

858
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,239
You two are here.

859
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,960
Thank you, sir.

860
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,520
Slowly.

861
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,080
Okay.

862
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,600
We're back to where we've been apart for a long time.

863
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,159
You're back.

864
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,400
How did it go?

865
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,280
Not bad.

866
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,120
How was it, Tom?

867
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,520
You'd better be happy.

868
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,000
Your sister sacrificed herself.

869
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,600
Great!

870
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,800
Okay.

871
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,719
I didn't feel it.

872
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,760
Is it bad?

873
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,800
I don't know.

874
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,840
I don't know.

875
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,639
How are you?

876
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,320
I...

877
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
Let me see

878
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,720
Are you okay?

879
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,440
What? You're not good either.

880
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,480
I can be fine if you're not.

881
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,680
You can do it too.

882
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,960
Is it fun?

883
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,320
Not bad.

884
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,400
Is it fun or not?

885
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
Did you talk?

886
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,680
I have cameras phobia.

887
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
Didn't you talk about what I told you last night?

888
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,760
I did.

889
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,200
Did you?

890
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Did he talk to you?

891
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,680
Did he?

892
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,120
No?

893
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,920
Really?

894
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,120
See?

895
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,760
What?

896
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,360
What?

897
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,880
See what?

898
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,800
They're holding hands.

899
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,520
Really.

900
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:53,760
Did you see that?

901
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,160
Didn't you see it just now?

902
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,840
What did you want to tell me yesterday?

903
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,360
Tom!

904
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,000
It's okay.

905
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,880
What?

906
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,320
Nothing.

907
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,200
Go ahead.

908
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,960
I don't want to.

909
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,680
Why?

910
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,800
Because I just don't want to.

911
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,080
Go ahead.

912
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,440
It's okay.

913
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,040
I said I knew you would choose you. You don't want to go.

914
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,560
It's not that I don't want to go.

915
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,040
I gave up for you.

916
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,520
I knew you would choose that option.

917
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,120
If I choose that one too,

918
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,760
no one can go with this.

919
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,720
I knew it.

920
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,640
Thank you for your sacrifice.

921
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,080
Don't sacrifice yourself next time.

922
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,480
Will there be a next time?

923
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,680
If there is a next time, give it to me.

924
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,120
I don't know.

925
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,240
I'll give it to you next time.

926
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,240
Tarri, go back to your room.

927
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,600
Let's go to the rock.

928
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,320
I slipped.

929
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,640
Susu.

930
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,320
Any progress?

931
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Yes.

932
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,160
Su Ziyi.

933
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,480
Did you...

934
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,760
Why not?

935
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,840
I saw everything.

936
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,400
I saw it just now.

937
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,280
I really didn't.

938
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,760
Is today the same as before?

939
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,920
Any new progress?

940
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,400
No, he was so nervous.

941
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,200
He doesn't talk.

942
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,040
He doesn't talk.

943
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,600
I tried my best.

944
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,000
But I...

945
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,200
ten cameras were against me.

946
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,480
I feel like I'm going to die there.

947
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,240
There are many cameras.

948
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,680
And there are many people.

949
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,240
In public,

950
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,200
I don't know

951
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,920
how to contact the person I like.

952
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,200
I'm very reserved.

953
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,840
I feel uncomfortable because

954
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,160
I feel uncomfortable.

955
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,520
It makes me feel a little sad.

956
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,640
Let's check the information tonight.

957
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,240
Now you say I'm too curious.

958
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,280
I can't tell you now.

959
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,480
Shall we go?

960
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,120
I won't tell you now.

961
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,920
What is this?

962
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,040
We just bought it

963
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,840
I was hungry.

964
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,400
Do you want some?

965
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,560
Sure.

966
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,440
What did you eat for lunch?

967
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,400
Nothing.

968
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,320
Have you eaten?

969
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,960
Let's go.

970
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,720
Let's go. Let's go eat.

971
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,440
Let's have a light meal.

972
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,360
Enjoy yourself.

973
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,200
Did your date fail?

974
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,240
Is there any progress between you two?

975
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,600
You really...

976
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,760
What does it have to do with me?

977
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,120
What does it have to do with me?

978
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,920
What about me?

979
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,960
You made me work so hard.

980
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,560
You won't have the chance anymore.

981
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:13,960
He always

982
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,560
He said he couldn't do anything with a camera.

983
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,720
Why?

984
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,200
So annoying. I'm listening.

985
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:19,960
Really.

986
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You're really...

987
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,680
I really...

988
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,120
What does it have to do with me

989
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,680
Does it have anything to do with me?

990
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,440
He didn't talk to you.

991
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,040
About what I told you yesterday,

992
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,320
He said something.

993
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,560
He said it today.

994
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,200
less than ten seconds.

995
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,920
I said I knew.

996
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,640
That's all.

997
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
I'm speechless.

998
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,640
It's hard for me.

999
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,400
Today,

1000
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,720
I decided I won't talk to him today.

1001
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,640
Think about it.

1002
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,200
I feel like

1003
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I would be angry if I were you.

1004
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,160
To be honest, I'm a little angry.

1005
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,400
I was wondering

1006
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,560
made a wrong choice.

1007
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,440
It's a waste of the chance I gave them.

1008
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,840
Because what happened yesterday

1009
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,520
because of what happened yesterday.

1010
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,520
My brother gave up on this date.

1011
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,360
to help me.

1012
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,400
I feel that my date

1013
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,520
is not that good.

1014
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,000
I didn't meet other people's expectations

1015
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,920
or my own expectations.

1016
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,160
I feel a little uncomfortable.

1017
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,600
A little unhappy.

1018
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,320
I don't think it's good for him.

1019
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,120
I think

1020
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,040
I think he doesn't want to continue.

1021
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,120
or he wants to.

1022
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
But he doesn't dare.

1023
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,800
He really makes me speechless.

1024
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,880
If he doesn't take the initiative,

1025
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,200
He doesn't take the bag.

1026
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,360
If he doesn't take the clothes,

1027
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,440
He didn't tell me either.

1028
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,880
I told him every night

1029
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,200
you should take the initiative.

1030
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,880
You're the only one.

1031
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,840
He asked what you like.

1032
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,520
I said the only thing you can give me now

1033
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
is to take the initiative.

1034
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,880
to express your feelings.

1035
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,640
I really...

1036
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,560
Are you satisfied with your date today?

1037
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,760
Give him a score. A perfect score.

1038
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,080
Score him.

1039
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,800
No.

1040
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,520
What did you do today?

1041
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,160
Did you talk to Mimi?

1042
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,840
He's playing with her.

1043
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,680
But he doesn't open his mouth.

1044
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,360
He just stands.

1045
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,400
He won't open his mouth.

1046
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,200
He doesn't talk.

1047
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,960
Just stand there.

1048
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,240
It's a watermark.

1049
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,320
You know?

1050
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,840
Water mark.

1051
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,600
I kept hearing them

1052
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,440
at the dining table.

1053
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,000
They are also loud.

1054
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,280
I can hear it even if I don't listen.

1055
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,720
For example,

1056
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,640
about my bad date.

1057
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,960
and laugh at me.

1058
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,840
He gave us too many cameras.

1059
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,520
Then you are...

1060
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
You're affecting my experience.

1061
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,640
Yes.

1062
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,240
Shouldn't your feelings be more important?

1063
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,000
Yes.

1064
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,880
You'll win if you leave.

1065
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,160
Really?

1066
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,720
Let's go this way.

1067
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,960
You're right.

1068
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,600
Tom.

1069
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,920
I don't know.

1070
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,360
My mind is clear today.

1071
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,560
Tom.

1072
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,360
Where did you go on your date?

1073
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,680
We went to Cat Cafe.

1074
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,640
How was it today?

1075
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,640
I don't know. I'm too nervous.

1076
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,480
You're nervous too?

1077
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,560
I quit.

1078
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,360
I quit.

1079
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
I can't win.

1080
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,560
I'm not in the mood today.

1081
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,040
I need to rest today.

1082
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,480
In my opinion,

1083
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,400
two people who like each other

1084
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,800
At least they won't do this in public.

1085
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,640
in public.

1086
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,600
I was sitting on the sofa,

1087
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,000
I didn't listen to it too much.

1088
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,080
But it was loud.

1089
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,600
Did he take photos for you?

1090
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,000
A few.

1091
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,840
I took a photo for you.

1092
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,280
No.

1093
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,640
He's pulling you.

1094
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,040
This is the most intimate behavior today.

1095
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,400
That is...

1096
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,160
he might really care about it.

1097
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,240
but he didn't care about it.

1098
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,200
No, he didn't.

1099
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,080
It's his behavior.

1100
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,920
He didn't pay attention to his actions.

1101
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,760
No matter what he did,

1102
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,400
or not,

1103
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,480
I didn't feel it.

1104
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,120
Lower your voice.

1105
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,920
I didn't feel it. I just didn't.

1106
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:25,920
You know?

1107
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,080
I didn't feel it.

1108
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,440
No matter how much you love me,

1109
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,000
how much

1110
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,360
Then I don't feel that love means no love.

1111
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,640
Tom.

1112
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,080
You look tired today.

1113
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,320
I'm a little tired.

1114
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,640
Talk to your sister.

1115
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,680
No, I'm in a good mood.

1116
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,800
I'm just a little tired.

1117
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,960
Okay, Depression Tom.

1118
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,120
I know I want to

1119
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,960
with Susu,

1120
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,320
I heard her disdain

1121
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,360
and mocking,

1122
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,040
may all be in my heart.

1123
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Go up and lie down.

1124
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,280
I want to go up too.

1125
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,520
I think she doesn't respect me.

1126
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,680
She talks more and more.

1127
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,640
more and more.

1128
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,680
I want to leave.

1129
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,760
The soup is...

1130
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,520
Now you tell me his condition is

1131
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,200
more proactive than what he described to me.

1132
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,200
Hua, I bought you milk tea.

1133
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,640
Are you happy today?

1134
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,680
Yes.

1135
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,280
Are you happy?

1136
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,240
Not bad.

1137
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,800
Not bad.

1138
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,440
Come on.

1139
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,400
Here you are.

1140
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,280
You bought it for me?

1141
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,200
For me?

1142
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,600
Bo Ba, a lot of pearls.

1143
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,720
He even bought you some mince.

1144
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,600
Brother.

1145
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,960
I also bought some sweet wine.

1146
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,840
Sweet wine?

1147
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,760
You can eat glutinous rice balls.

1148
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,560
That's great, my little brother.

1149
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,080
Bubble tea.

1150
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,120
I won't scold you anymore.

1151
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,920
You're not scolding me. It's cold violence.

1152
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,120
Who bought this strawberry?

1153
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:58,840
Fatty.

1154
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,400
Here's a strawberry cake. Come on.

1155
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,880
The one you didn't eat that night.

1156
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,520
That's what I didn't eat that night.

1157
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,520
But I asked, it's gone.

1158
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,040
It's sold out.

1159
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:08,960
There they are!

1160
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,920
Yes.

1161
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,880
Why can you go on a date?

1162
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,560
No date.

1163
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,400
We're going shopping.

1164
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:15,920
Purchase?

1165
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,800
Great.

1166
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,760
Where did you go?

1167
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,440
I went to Cat Cafe.

1168
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,000
What did you do?

1169
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,600
I made it.

1170
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,720
What did you make?

1171
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,400
Keykebabs.

1172
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,120
I want to do it too.

1173
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,720
It's okay. I'll get it tomorrow.

1174
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,120
Don't bother.

1175
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,160
Those who are prepared will prepare in advance.

1176
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,160
I'm going to rest.

1177
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,280
Good night in this world.

1178
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,520
Su Zihao.

1179
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,520
Have you finished?

1180
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,000
Come up after that.

1181
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,240
Come with me.

1182
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,120
Let's go.

1183
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,880
Why should I go?

1184
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,360
Let's go.

1185
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,160
She's calling you.

1186
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,040
Hurry up.

1187
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,680
She's calling you.

1188
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,160
Hurry up.

1189
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,600
Is it possible that she doesn't need me?

1190
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,240
I need you.

1191
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,640
So cool, Harry.

1192
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,320
Thank you.

1193
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,040
Thank you.

1194
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,160
Are you the "boss" Harry

1195
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,120
He's "Mr. Xiao".

1196
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,480
It's okay.

1197
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,600
Bye.

1198
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,240
Maybe that's who he is.

1199
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,840
that kind of person.

1200
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,760
And he can't say it's bad.

1201
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,280
He also said

1202
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,640
if I go to

1203
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,680
you're going to

1204
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,560
the romantic house.

1205
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,080
He said if I were the landlord,

1206
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:37,920
would you go?

1207
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,680
Do you want me to go?

1208
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,320
He said yes.

1209
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,080
He always says but he doesn't do it.

1210
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,320
For example, what will he say?

1211
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,800
He'll make it look like a man and a woman like him.

1212
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,760
If I don't go with someone else,

1213
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,480
he said he would leave.

1214
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,720
But he didn't say anything bad.

1215
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,720
But

1216
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,360
I didn't think there was anything.

1217
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,960
But now that you mention it,

1218
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,040
It's not because I think it's a waste.

1219
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,400
I gave you two a chance.

1220
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,720
That's why I'm angry.

1221
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,240
Especially yesterday, I kept telling him

1222
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,720
until 4 a.m.

1223
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,360
I said my sister didn't need anything.

1224
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,280
But I think what you can give her

1225
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,400
you can take more initiative.

1226
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,320
You make her feel your feelings.

1227
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,040
and the initiative.

1228
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,600
I can feel your feelings from the text,

1229
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,960
But I can't feel it from real life.

1230
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,520
being together

1231
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,120
Not bad.

1232
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,320
I just want to be with you.

1233
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,600
to be together.

1234
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,360
But

1235
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,520
you must be happy to be together.

1236
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,640
That's what you get in return.

1237
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,040
I don't think you did much.

1238
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,920
Yes.

1239
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,160
That's the feeling.

1240
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,120
I don't know if I was too anxious

1241
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,800
or too anxious.

1242
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,000
Actually, I'm not in a hurry.

1243
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,240
It's not about whether I'm in a hurry or not.

1244
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,560
You need to start from zero.

1245
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,520
But he didn't

1246
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,760
the next move.

1247
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,880
No progress. Yeah.

1248
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,240
It sounds like

1249
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,000
a few days ago.

1250
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,560
Tell me.

1251
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,240
You were in the same state the first two days.

1252
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:00,720
Yes.

1253
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,240
You're progressing slowly.

1254
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,840
If he doesn't move,

1255
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,640
You'll be anxious and annoyed.

1256
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,120
If you're anxious, that's how you feel.

1257
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,520
it means you care about it.

1258
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,120
If he doesn't make any progress,

1259
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,480
you will slowly persuade him to leave.

1260
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,000
I really...

1261
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,600
I don't know.

1262
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,320
I'm confused right now.

1263
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,360
I'm very irritated right now.

1264
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,880
No, calm down.

1265
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,360
I think...

1266
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:19,760
I'm annoyed.

1267
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,640
I think you should calm down.

1268
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,560
Sometimes when you're emotional,

1269
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,680
I'm not emotional.

1270
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,960
I'm very calm.

1271
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,240
It's his problem.

1272
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,320
I don't think you need to find fault with Susu.

1273
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,240
In my impression,

1274
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,160
I don't like it if I don't take the initiative.

1275
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,440
Right.

1276
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:36,960
Right?

1277
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,760
It's not enough.

1278
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,800
I can't say you don't like it at all.

1279
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,160
It's not enough.

1280
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,000
Because if you really like it,

1281
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
you can't help but take the initiative.

1282
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,080
Yes.

1283
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:44,880
Yes.

1284
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,520
Because I think

1285
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,000
no matter how passive they are.

1286
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,680
Really?

1287
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,520
I suggest we date someone else.

1288
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,320
I don't recommend it.

1289
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,760
I don't know how to change.

1290
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,280
No, just make him angry.

1291
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:55,920
No.

1292
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,840
No.

1293
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,360
You have to change your attitude.

1294
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,120
To be honest,

1295
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,160
You really need to change.

1296
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,240
Yes, I won't upset him.

1297
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,200
I don't have to send it.

1298
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,360
but I won't send it to others.

1299
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,800
This will make the misunderstanding

1300
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,520
I think this will deepen the misunderstanding.

1301
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,640
If I knew

1302
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,640
I was interested in him,

1303
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,360
I wouldn't send it to others.

1304
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,440
But I don't have to.

1305
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,320
Yes, me too.

1306
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,040
Gosh.

1307
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,920
I'll get ready.

1308
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,480
I said

1309
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,400
I think you only care about your heart.

1310
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,480
You may never consider

1311
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,120
what I think.

1312
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,960
or how I feel.

1313
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,640
Do you think he likes you?

1314
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,240
Yes, but that's not enough?

1315
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,360
I can't say I don't like it.

1316
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,000
Yes.

1317
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,320
Because he still...

1318
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,000
Because of you,

1319
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,680
will affect his emotions.

1320
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,000
But he cares more about his feelings.

1321
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,800
He likes himself more than you.

1322
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,400
Yes, I like myself more.

1323
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,440
But I think many people

1324
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,640
There's nothing wrong with that.

1325
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,560
You don't have to say that.

1326
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,440
Yes, people like themselves more.

1327
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,240
Yes.

1328
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,160
Just...

1329
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,480
I'm tired.

1330
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,080
Do you still want to go on a date with him?

1331
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,600
I may be emotional now.

1332
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,600
I won't make any decision.

1333
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,360
Actually on my way back,

1334
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,760
on my way back.

1335
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,760
After coming back,

1336
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,760
we analyzed

1337
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,280
Then you spit it out and summarize

1338
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,080
and recall the whole process, right?

1339
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,520
The more I think about it, the weirder I feel.

1340
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,160
Yes, it's weird.

1341
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,440
The more I think he didn't pay, right?

1342
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,360
The more I think about it, the weirder it is.

1343
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,800
The more I think about it, the more upset I feel.

1344
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,400
After hearing that,

1345
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,760
I feel even more upset, you know?

1346
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,200
Are you going to sleep?

1347
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,640
Okay.

1348
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,560
I'm leaving.

1349
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,960
Is he asleep already?

1350
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,080
What about the gift box?

1351
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,600
I think in life,

1352
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,280
in life.

1353
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,320
and romantic.

1354
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,120
Sometimes surprise

1355
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,120
doesn't mean how precious this gift is.

1356
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,440
It's just that

1357
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,800
Did you listen to her feelings?

1358
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,960
Or did you listen to

1359
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,640
what she said to you before?

1360
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,120
This kind of surprise is real.

1361
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,400
I think it's romantic.

1362
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,680
The most proactive thing he has done to you is

1363
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,920
After you told him his question,

1364
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,000
he came to talk to me.

1365
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,360
Does this count?

1366
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,640
Please stop this conversation.

1367
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,520
Let's go.

1368
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,280
Bye.

1369
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,880
Take care of yourself.

1370
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,760
Calm down.

1371
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,400
Okay, I'll take a rest.

1372
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,320
He's asleep.

1373
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,200
I know he's sleepy.

1374
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,840
Mr. Wang.

1375
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,800
Did you see the text?

1376
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,320
Yes.

1377
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,640
I'm speechless.

1378
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,880
Hua, I really...

1379
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,120
I'm really speechless.

1380
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:49,960
A man and a woman.

1381
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,640
I'll go in now.

1382
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,440
Let's see what you'll do.

1383
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,000
I'll kick you out.

1384
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,400
Go, Hua.

1385
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,680
Tata wants to go in, right?

1386
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,240
I won't give him a chance.

1387
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,200
Tata, you haven't gone yet?

1388
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:00,840
I'll go now.

1389
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,680
Go, Hua. Run.

1390
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,640
Hua, run!

1391
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,040
Run, Hua!

1392
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,400
Hua.

1393
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,400
What female running champion?

1394
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,000
Hua has entered.

1395
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,000
Hua has to go to the romantic house every day.

1396
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,560
No matter

1397
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,720
Romantic battlefield.

1398
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,880
I'm leaving.

1399
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,400
The flower lock is locked.

1400
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,240
Locked?

1401
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,160
You're not welcome.

1402
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,040
Please go back.

1403
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,560
Do you want to see it?

1404
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,760
Harry, come in.

1405
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,880
Harry, come in.

1406
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,040
You can't change it.

1407
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,480
You can't change it.

1408
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,520
I can't change it.

1409
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,880
Why didn't we have a TV yesterday?

1410
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,080
I applied.

1411
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,320
Time starts.

1412
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:52,920
Go away.

1413
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,200
Open it.

1414
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,600
Yes.

1415
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,360
So annoying.

1416
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,120
Bye.

1417
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,440
I'm leaving.

1418
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,480
Hwa-hwa.

1419
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,720
It's so bright.

1420
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,840
So funny.

1421
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,600
So bright.

1422
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,480
This is for you.

1423
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,160
Open it.

1424
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,800
Really?

1425
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,480
What is it?

1426
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,120
In a hurry.

1427
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,760
So cute.

1428
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,000
What is this?

1429
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,520
Dog.

1430
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,000
Yes.

1431
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,480
You said I look like a dog.

1432
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,360
So I bought you a dog.

1433
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,160
This.

1434
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,040
Don't you know this

1435
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,040
It's...

1436
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,720
What?

1437
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,680
I don't know.

1438
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:41,960
Thank you.

1439
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,760
No because I wanted to buy

1440
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,960
I just wanted to buy flowers.

1441
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,640
But I can't bring it back, you know?

1442
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,400
And this thing can be brought back

1443
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,960
and Chengdu.

1444
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,680
Just buy this.

1445
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,400
Why are you eating again?

1446
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,200
I haven't started yet.

1447
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,200
None of your business.

1448
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,920
I watched a TV series recently.

1449
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,400
It's pretty good.

1450
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,480
Do you want to watch it with me?

1451
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,760
Sure.

1452
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,760
What drama?

1453
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,680
It's called "White Moon Van Star".

1454
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,800
We can watch it on kiwi TV.

1455
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,400
This one.

1456
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,040
A full screen?

1457
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,840
You have to open this when you watch it.

1458
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,840
Min Ki Video MAX.

1459
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,880
It's clear.

1460
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:32,920
White deer.

1461
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,240
It's quite clear.

1462
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,920
The color is also cool.

1463
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,160
So cool

1464
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,400
Just like the cinema.

1465
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,000
Yes.

1466
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,840
I used this.

1467
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,000
Min Ki Pictures MAX.

1468
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,400
I watched so many episodes in one go.

1469
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,080
This TV is really...

1470
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,640
So sweet.

1471
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,000
I love this TV.

1472
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,480
Should we watch this or which one first

1473
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,400
Didn't you say to look at this

1474
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,280
Look at this first?

1475
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:54,840
Are you sure?

1476
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,320
Yes.

1477
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,600
Are you sure you want to watch this first?

1478
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,000
To be honest, it's kind of scary.

1479
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,840
Haven't you seen it before?

1480
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,600
Yes.

1481
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,960
It's not scary if you've seen it, right?

1482
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,320
Actually, I haven't seen it.

1483
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,600
I don't think it's scary.

1484
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,400
Are you nervous?

1485
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,680
No.

1486
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,680
No.

1487
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,440
Are you cold?

1488
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,600
Are you hot?

1489
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,640
He said that mom did it.

1490
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:41,960
I think today

1491
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,480
a perfect day today.

1492
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,160
We've been watching movies and watching TV.

1493
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,160
We've been sitting together

1494
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,280
and keep talking,

1495
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,520
being with each other,

1496
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,520
I'm already very satisfied.

1497
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,040
Today is

1498
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,640
more than the first time

1499
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,960
than my first date with her.

1500
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,680
Do you want to continue?

1501
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,680
Yes.

1502
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,520
I'll change it.

1503
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,280
I've been writing for two hours.

1504
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,800
Today is the first time

1505
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,760
watch a movie together.

1506
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,200
At the romantic house,

1507
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,880
there was only me and him.

1508
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,280
watching a movie on the sofa,

1509
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,280
I feel at ease.

1510
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,360
and happy.

1511
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,600
I feel comfortable

1512
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,080
with him now.

1513
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,720
a good day.

1514
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,640
Come on, chat with me.

1515
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,520
It's so hard, Fatty.

1516
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,200
Say something.

1517
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,400
Actually, I can't let go of my date.

1518
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,440
Too many people.

1519
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,200
I asked Harry the night before.

1520
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:28,600
I said,

1521
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,760
is Susu very against

1522
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,280
physical contact?

1523
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,240
Because

1524
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,520
for a long time.

1525
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,160
I can't help but want to approach her.

1526
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,320
or hold her hand.

1527
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,920
But we didn't do anything

1528
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,480
at Cat Cafe.

1529
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,560
After I came back,

1530
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,480
Harry thought there was no progress between us.

1531
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,200
He might want to help.

1532
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,480
He and Susu went to the dining table.

1533
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,200
And Tarri and I

1534
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,680
are at the piano.

1535
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,720
Harry told Susu

1536
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,720
about the soup.

1537
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,680
I don't know if you will resist.

1538
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,680
If he wants to

1539
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,320
physical contact with you,

1540
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,920
I heard

1541
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,440
Susu said it had something to do with me.

1542
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,560
Is there any progress between you two?

1543
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,560
Are you really...

1544
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,720
have to do with me?

1545
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,440
Maybe I was angry.

1546
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,160
But I was very sad.

1547
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:32,640
I was sad.

1548
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,560
Then...

1549
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,240
Then...

1550
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,280
Listen to me first.

1551
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:36,760
Then...

1552
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,400
Then...

1553
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,560
Maybe Harry asked her

1554
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,720
what she did on today's date.

1555
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,440
She might say

1556
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,440
I can't let go.

1557
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,000
What? What?

1558
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,920
Stand there like a human-shaped watermark.

1559
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,560
And

1560
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,560
they were there.

1561
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,320
I don't know why they are laughing.

1562
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,720
It's quite ironic.

1563
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,840
It's...

1564
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,280
I thought it was a joke.

1565
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,960
What did you do today?

1566
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,680
Just talking to Mimi, right?

1567
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,480
He's playing with her.

1568
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,120
But he doesn't open his mouth.

1569
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:04,840
Just stand there.

1570
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,840
He won't open his mouth.

1571
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,640
He doesn't talk.

1572
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,400
Just stand there.

1573
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,200
It's a watermark.

1574
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:10,840
You know?

1575
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,480
Water mark.

1576
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,440
If you really like me,

1577
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,960
I don't think

1578
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,600
the things you like do as a joke.

1579
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,800
In public,

1580
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,440
I think

1581
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,440
very disrespectful.

1582
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,240
I laughed for a long time.

1583
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,520
I was so upset that I went upstairs.

1584
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,400
I really don't understand.

1585
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,200
Do you want to hear my opinion?

1586
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,000
In my opinion,

1587
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,640
in love,

1588
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,160
in love.

1589
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,240
If you can't feel it,

1590
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,240
you can't feel it.

1591
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,000
You have to be firm.

1592
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,600
The power is mutual.

1593
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,840
OK. After this question,

1594
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,440
is a joke you mentioned.

1595
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,120
I think everyone is kind.

1596
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,440
She subconsciously shared that with her brother.

1597
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,360
First, I think Susu

1598
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,760
she doesn't mean subjective consciousness

1599
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,600
to hurt you

1600
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,360
to hurt you.

1601
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:20,880
right?

1602
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,480
Maybe she's a joker.

1603
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,680
You don't have to think about this.

1604
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:28,000
But this behavior has offended you

1605
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,200
or hurt you.

1606
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,080
You can think about it.

1607
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,680
This is what I've been thinking

1608
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,640
I've been thinking about

1609
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,720
in this room.

1610
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,760
In fact, I thought people were similar.

1611
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,400
My deepest feeling here is

1612
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,240
living environment.

1613
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,760
Family environment

1614
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,880
has changed too much.

1615
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,480
Susu's family environment

1616
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,480
is very happy.

1617
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,760
Their family can make jokes.

1618
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,360
They are a harmonious family.

1619
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,080
They are open-minded.

1620
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,280
Look at her father.

1621
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,480
He said his daughter was ugly at the beginning.

1622
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,880
and Harry is ugly.

1623
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,480
If one day your mom tells you

1624
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,440
you were born ugly,

1625
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,440
Then you might listen.

1626
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,000
But in their eyes,

1627
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,400
a joke.

1628
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,560
Do you understand now?

1629
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,280
Everyone has a different level.

1630
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,400
The soup in my eyes

1631
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,880
is a joke to friends.

1632
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,800
But in love,

1633
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,920
soup is not a joke.

1634
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,120
So you think it hurts

1635
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,920
may sting in your eyes.

1636
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,320
In fact, you are delicate.

1637
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,800
but I may also say you are too sensitive.

1638
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,240
It's so hard.

1639
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,200
I feel I'm happy and sad every day.

1640
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,800
Happy, sad.

1641
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,520
Every day.

1642
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,680
I want to

1643
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,600
ask you what you think.

1644
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,920
Do you want to

1645
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,760
in this place?

1646
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,200
You think everyone has

1647
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:02,880
I should have one.

1648
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:09,240
Or I really like

1649
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,320
a real

1650
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,720
a complete Susu.

1651
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,880
I became so serious.

1652
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,000
Maybe it's because

1653
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,680
I may not

1654
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,800
know her well.

1655
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,800
But I do like her.

1656
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,560
I have no choice.

1657
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,360
I just want to chase her.

1658
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,400
and get close to her.

1659
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,920
Maybe the answer I got

1660
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,280
she likes me too.

1661
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,200
Did you ask her?

1662
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,520
She said she likes you.

1663
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,680
It's vaguely said

1664
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,520
if she expresses that she likes you,

1665
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,880
did you ask her

1666
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,640
if you like me,

1667
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,600
why don't you consider my feelings?

1668
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,400
Have you asked this question?

1669
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,360
Not yet.

1670
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,280
I'm going to ask first.

1671
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,480
It's me.

1672
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,520
I really don't know.

1673
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,080
What do you think

1674
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,760
after you ask this question?

1675
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,640
I can't imagine it.

1676
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,000
The answer I want to get is

1677
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,880
she knows.

1678
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,320
She knows I'm unhappy.

1679
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,560
She knows I'm upset.

1680
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,920
You pursue perfection too much.

1681
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,360
It's different from playing ping-pong.

1682
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,240
It doesn't have

1683
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:15,920
What point?

1684
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,760
Feelings keep changing.

1685
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,920
You can't find

1686
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,440
the most suitable point

1687
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,840
to touch it.

1688
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,440
It has changed.

1689
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,200
She can like you today.

1690
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,080
When a new person comes out,

1691
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,320
she'll create a wave again.

1692
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,880
You can only

1693
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,680
your own balance

1694
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,080
in the waves.

1695
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,880
You can't always pursue

1696
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,000
the highest point in the wave.

1697
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,160
You'll be very unhappy.

1698
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,280
Actually, I'm much better now.

1699
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,920
I really...

1700
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,840
I think you can do this.

1701
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,240
understand each other.

1702
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,560
Don't have so many questions.

1703
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,440
You always ask

1704
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,800
In summary,

1705
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,640
I personally think every chat

1706
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,240
every quarrel,

1707
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,120
every time

1708
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,560
has a result.

1709
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,520
If there is no result,

1710
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,280
you're wasting

1711
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,480
You're wasting your emotions.

1712
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,680
Make a summary

1713
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,320
in the past few days.

1714
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:11,760
Don't be so fast.

1715
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,360
in such a hurry.

1716
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,400
This is not training ping-pong.

1717
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,680
Don't worry.

1718
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,320
I think there's something wrong.

1719
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,960
Talk to your brothers.

1720
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,880
and your friends.

1721
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,480
After that,

1722
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,000
You're much better now.

1723
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,200
I don't know.

1724
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,960
You just think she doesn't care about you.

1725
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,200
You've only been together for a few days.

1726
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,080
Indeed.

1727
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:38,720
Yeah.

1728
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,360
Are you too demanding for others?

1729
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,680
too high for yourself?

1730
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,640
Ten days.

1731
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,280
Do you have to go like that?

1732
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,480
She wasn't born to be your wife.

1733
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,400
right?

1734
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,400
There's nothing we can do about it.

1735
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,760
You've been trained

1736
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,960
to achieve this.

1737
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:00,840
People are like this too.

1738
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,600
They keep getting along.

1739
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,000
You're asking too much.

1740
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,160
It's been more than ten days.

1741
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,120
I don't think there's such a person.

1742
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,040
Indeed.

1743
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,160
You want it to be perfect.

1744
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,840
I think so too.

1745
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,240
Relax.

1746
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,440
You have to relax.

1747
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,360
Because you're a man.

1748
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,720
You're a boy.

1749
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,720
Keep your eyes off me.

1750
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,360
To be honest,

1751
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,720
I think so too.

1752
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,600
They are not very happy today.

1753
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,080
Not very happy.

1754
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,080
I have a chance.

1755
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,040
I have a chance.

1756
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:41,480
Sister

1757
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,440
Call me sister.

1758
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,960
Sister

1759
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,320
Time to put on makeup.

1760
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,240
Here's the soup.

1761
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,000
No.

1762
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,080
I'm just tired from dating too much.

1763
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:51,880
I don't know.

1764
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,760
I'll find out later.

1765
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,520
Two people in their own world every day.

1766
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,520
in our own world.

1767
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,720
It's an ambiguous period.

1768
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,680
and then in love,

1769
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,320
It'll take at least three months.

1770
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:05,840
Xin.

1771
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,440
What are you doing?

1772
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,440
You scared me.

1773
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,439
What?

1774
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:17,520
Are you giving a lesson?

1775
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,279
For whom?

1776
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:20,560
Give it to my eldest disciple.

1777
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,200
Map?

1778
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:21,439
No.

1779
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:22,279
That's the second disciple.

1780
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,080
Soup.

1781
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,760
What's wrong with the soup?

1782
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,760
Are you unhappy with the soup?

1783
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:27,840
Yes.

1784
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,640
Why?

1785
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,640
But the class is over.

1786
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,200
No.

1787
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,120
Why didn't I know about this?

1788
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,120
Yes, we were just talking.

1789
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,359
Tom.

1790
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:39,960
What?

1791
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,640
Come out.

1792
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,800
What's wrong?

1793
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,920
What's wrong?

1794
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,479
What?

1795
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:52,640
Are you okay?

1796
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,200
Did your date not go well?

1797
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,040
Listen to me.

1798
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,120
I asked Harry last night.

1799
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,439
Because I think Susu and I

1800
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,200
like each other.

1801
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,880
I asked Harry,

1802
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,479
if Susu is very against

1803
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,279
physical contact?

1804
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:13,840
When I came back,

1805
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,240
I don't know.

1806
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,279
Harry told her about this.

1807
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:18,640
She said it has nothing to do with me.

1808
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,359
Susu said that.

1809
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:31,120
They said

1810
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,960
on the dining table.

1811
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,120
It sounds like

1812
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,520
judge and mock.

1813
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,920
as a joke.

1814
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,080
And I think

1815
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,479
I was sincere.

1816
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:47,960
I felt very sad.

1817
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,000
Then I talked to Fatty.

1818
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,359
Fatty also said

1819
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,640
No, it's so stuffy here.

1820
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,200
It makes sense

1821
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,600
I think it makes sense.

1822
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,560
I don't want

1823
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,280
to make it so stressful.

1824
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,440
No.

1825
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,160
My heart is beating so fast.

1826
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,320
I can't stay any longer.

1827
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,040
My hair is about to stand up.

1828
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,920
Why?

1829
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,760
Okay, nothing.

1830
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,080
I'm actually fine.

1831
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,400
I need to get some fresh air.

1832
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,160
I can't stand it.

1833
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,000
It's too stuffy.

1834
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,160
Let me get some fresh air.

1835
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,440
I'm going to get some air. I can't stand it.

1836
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,640
The most irritating thing for me is

1837
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,960
this is what Susu said.

1838
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,840
It has nothing to do with her.

1839
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,120
In my opinion,

1840
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,640
she's interested in the soup.

1841
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,360
Since she's interested,

1842
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,360
If you care about each other's feelings,

1843
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,840
why did you say that?

1844
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:24,680
I'm a little...

1845
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,840
sad, angry,

1846
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,040
and some don't understand.

1847
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,800
I think this matter will affect my attitude

1848
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,800
affect my attitude towards Susu.

1849
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,600
From my perspective,

1850
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,240
her words

1851
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,080
hurt the soup.

1852
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,920
Is she worth it?

1853
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,600
my brother to be so sincere?

1854
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,520
Mimi.

1855
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,280
Mimi, come here.

1856
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,120
Okay.

1857
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:32,960
Sit.

1858
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,800
Don't...

1859
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,800
It's okay. I want to cry too if you cry.

1860
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,680
What's wrong, baby?

1861
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,200
It's not that serious.

1862
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,320
What's wrong?

1863
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,160
What?

1864
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,000
Why are you crying?

1865
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,400
I was scolded and cried.

1866
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,000
I cried because of the soup.

1867
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,880
What?

1868
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,720
Dude.

1869
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:35,880
What's wrong?

1870
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,400
No.

1871
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:39,720
Nothing.

1872
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,000
She's fine.

1873
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,120
Don't cry.

1874
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,080
It's okay.

1875
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:49,960
They were playing Go.

1876
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,160
Then you suddenly cried.

1877
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,480
Do you think they are not as good as you?

1878
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,040
My sister hugged me when I cried yesterday.

1879
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:58,760
Come and hug her.

1880
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:01,880
Hurry up.

1881
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,800
Give me a big hug.

1882
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,560
Hug her.

1883
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,320
I want to cry even more.

1884
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,560
I want to cry even more.

1885
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,360
In my opinion,

1886
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,840
brothers are more important than friends.

1887
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,680
So this is the first time

1888
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,760
I cried because of my own brother.

1889
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,360
Actually the soup

1890
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,480
when he hugged me.

1891
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,160
I feel sad.

1892
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:04,640
and feel secure.

1893
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,200
Two strange emotions

1894
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,680
mixed together.

1895
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,840
I feel like my family is next to me.

1896
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,560
My injured brother

1897
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,920
is comforting me.

1898
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,880
But what I told you

1899
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,240
is just my subjective idea.

1900
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,480
Why?

1901
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,080
This is just his subjective consciousness.

1902
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,280
It's not objective enough.

1903
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:26,800
Actually,

1904
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,360
is not objective enough.

1905
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,720
We need time to give the answer.

1906
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:31,360
It's nothing.

1907
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,560
I've seen it through. Don't cry.

1908
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,480
It's okay.

1909
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,000
How could she do that?

1910
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,320
Okay, it's okay.

1911
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,160
I'll block it for you.

1912
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,720
I'll help you.

1913
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,040
It's okay.

1914
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,240
I'm really fine.

1915
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,320
I don't think she can do that.

1916
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,080
But it's just subjective consciousness.

1917
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,000
But I still feel bad.

1918
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,840
It's okay.

1919
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,680
Why were you crying yesterday?

1920
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:17,560
I cried today.

1921
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,000
Yes.

1922
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,600
Why are we really...

1923
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,360
We didn't

1924
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,880
cry because of ourselves.

1925
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,360
We always cry because of others.

1926
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,680
Why?

1927
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,040
It's okay.

1928
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:28,960
I'll help you.

1929
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:48,400
It's okay.

1930
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,720
I'm fine.

1931
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,200
It's okay. Just cry.

1932
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,840
The comfort he gave me today

1933
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,880
I feel

1934
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,520
my heart calmed down.

1935
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,720
Because he came to me

1936
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,080
right away.

1937
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,600
Then he patted my shoulder and said,

1938
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:03,440
It's okay

1939
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,480
And he keeps giving me tissues.

1940
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,880
In the room, besides soup,

1941
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:08,880
other than soup.

1942
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,640
For example, drawing.

1943
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,120
He cares about my emotions.

1944
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,560
Take a deep breath.

1945
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:18,480
Let's go.

1946
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,720
Let's go eat. Let's go.

1947
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,360
Let's go.

1948
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,560
Stop looking.

1949
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,640
Let's not...

1950
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:27,760
Have some water.

1951
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,280
Drink all the tears back.

1952
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,160
Drink coke.

1953
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,640
You like Coke.

1954
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:34,760
Thank you.

1955
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,320
Have a seat.

1956
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:40,640
It's okay.

1957
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:46,920
Feeling better?

1958
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,560
Actually, I...

1959
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,000
I saw you crying.

1960
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,320
You only cry because of that.

1961
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,840
You won't cry for anything else.

1962
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,080
Then tell me why I cry.

1963
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:56,680
OK.

1964
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,520
I'll see if you're right.

1965
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:01,560
Yes.

1966
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,800
I got it.

1967
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,600
The ice queen is crying.

1968
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,080
Let it be.

1969
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,280
Help!

1970
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,360
Show me the map.

1971
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,080
his ultimate skill.

1972
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,920
Let's go eat something.

1973
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,640
I think we cry

1974
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,680
because of ourselves.

1975
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,720
It's all about your own brother.

1976
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,200
So I think

1977
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,760
we are kind of like

1978
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,200
my negative emotions.

1979
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,360
has been overwhelmed

1980
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,680
by this high happiness.

1981
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,600
Mr. Tu is my happy fruit

1982
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,680
I’m Happy Guoer.

1983
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,080
I'm not angry.

1984
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,640
I just feel a little wronged.

1985
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,480
Harry told me

1986
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,280
about the soup.

1987
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,360
Will Susu hate

1988
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,200
physical contact?

1989
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,520
I think this kind of thing can happen naturally.

1990
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,080
You can't do it on purpose.

1991
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,280
Maybe he pulled me

1992
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,160
just to show Harry.

1993
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:31,880
See?

1994
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,680
I'm doubting this point.

1995
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,600
Maybe because they talked a lot

1996
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,680
talked about this last night.

1997
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,520
It's kind of like completing a mission.

1998
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,240
Okay.

1999
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,000
Dinner is here.

2000
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,240
Tom, come and eat.

2001
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Put it away. Right away.

2002
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,400
Thank you.

2003
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:26,920
I'll go.

2004
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,320
I'll go get Susu.

2005
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,400
Eat something.

2006
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,400
Susu.

2007
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,360
I may not be able to feel it in my world.

2008
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,240
I just don't.

2009
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,080
If I don't take the initiative, I don't like it enough.

2010
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,800
After talking a lot,

2011
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,840
I can still come back to these two sentences.

2012
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,560
Because in this small house,

2013
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,320
if we have any misunderstanding or problems,

2014
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,200
I want to know about him.

2015
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,000
If he wants to know me,

2016
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,240
may be spread through Harry's mouth.

2017
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,680
I thought

2018
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,480
we came back to our real life.

2019
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,400
If we want to keep in touch,

2020
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,040
if Harry doesn't

2021
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,680
without Harry,

2022
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,680
how do we get to know each other?

2023
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,640
I'm the one who takes the initiative.

2024
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,120
I'm the one who takes the initiative.

2025
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,800
I don't know what to do.

2026
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,480
I don't know how to solve it.

2027
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,680
I don't think

2028
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,080
he did anything wrong.

2029
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,880
I don't think I did anything wrong.

2030
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,400
But

2031
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,720
some emotions piled up there.

2032
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,480
Then I wanted to escape.

2033
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,400
I'm scared.

2034
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,360
I don't want to face it.

2035
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:24,920
He

2036
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:34,560
He's not here.

2037
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,240
They are still playing ping pong.

2038
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:52,840
Why are there so many people?

2039
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,040
I'm sorry.

2040
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,160
I miss you.

2041
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,520
I'm going upstairs now.

2042
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,960
Nobody cares

2043
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,000
Harry is back.

2044
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,520
Nobody cares

2045
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:12,080
Let it be.

2046
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,440
Don't let anyone in.

2047
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,200
Who?

2048
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:17,880
No, I was busy just now.

2049
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:18,320
Busy.

2050
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,480
It's our choice not to enter.

2051
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,400
It's your problem

2052
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,160
is your problem.

2053
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,520
You brought a pot of flowers back.

2054
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,240
Aren't you supposed to be at 9:30?

2055
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,320
I miss you.

2056
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,840
I don't believe it.

2057
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,960
Really.

2058
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:33,680
Where is my sister?

2059
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,680
I called her just now.

2060
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,160
But it seems no one is in her room.

2061
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,080
She didn't go in?

2062
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:39,360
No.

2063
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:39,920
What should we do?

2064
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,160
Who can go in and call her?

2065
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:41,960
Huahua.

2066
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,360
Where are you going?

2067
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,680
Call Susu.

2068
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:45,680
If you don't,

2069
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,240
how can I enter a girl's room?

2070
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,200
The map went into my bathroom yesterday.

2071
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:50,840
Guolifang.

2072
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:52,400
Really?

2073
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,640
He rushed into my toilet that day.

2074
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,520
I said,

2075
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,760
Stop it in time.

2076
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:02,960
Go down and eat.

2077
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,160
Go.

2078
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,520
Are you still unhappy?

2079
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,920
He was not happy just now.

2080
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,280
Didn't you feel

2081
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,840
Didn't you feel it?

2082
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,320
He asked you to come for dinner.

2083
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,720
No.

2084
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,320
Let's go.

2085
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:18,760
I'll go later.

2086
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,440
I'm tired.

2087
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,120
Come on.

2088
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,120
Go down alone.

2089
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,560
It's okay.

2090
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,120
Don't...

2091
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,200
Don't be sad.

2092
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,600
Don't.

2093
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:36,760
It's okay.

2094
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,320
You need to fix your makeup when you cry.

2095
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:46,240
Don't cry.

2096
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,280
It's okay.

2097
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,480
Really.

2098
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,160
I think

2099
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,920
a waste.

2100
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,840
I feel sorry for Su Zihao and Tata.

2101
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,400
Why do you think so much?

2102
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,840
You should do it.

2103
01:24:58,840 --> 01:24:59,560
Look.

2104
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,360
They got along so happily today.

2105
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,160
They stayed in Romantic House for four hours.

2106
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,920
No.

2107
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:12,480
It's not necessarily good to go on a date.

2108
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,600
I think it's normal to have contradictions.

2109
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,480
We know each other better, right?

2110
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,360
Don't think too much.

2111
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,120
I'm tired.

2112
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,640
He asked me to ask you to eat.

2113
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,360
I'll be right there.

2114
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,800
Let me calm down.

2115
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,480
Okay.

2116
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,600
Take it easy.

2117
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,000
Hurry up.

2118
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,280
Or it'll be too late for dinner.

2119
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:41,640
Go down.

2120
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:42,080
Okay.

2121
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,000
Take your time.

2122
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,640
Okay.

2123
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:44,440
It's okay.

2124
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,400
It's okay.

2125
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,000
I feel

2126
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I haven't sorted out my emotions.

2127
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:03,800
I don't want people to see

2128
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,920
that I'm feeling down.

2129
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:09,960
I don't know what I'm thinking.

2130
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:10,680
I'm just scared.

2131
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,960
I don't want to go down.

2132
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,920
I just feel like I'm running away.

2133
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,840
Escape?

2134
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,040
See the soup.

2135
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,160
She'll come back later.

2136
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,400
What is she doing?

2137
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,760
Go upstairs.

2138
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:46,000
Did you sleep long?

2139
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
You slept for a while

2140
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,920
But I'm up now.

2141
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,760
I'm going up.

2142
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:53,240
I need to go up too.

2143
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:11,360
What?

2144
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,040
What?

2145
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,560
Thinking.

2146
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,400
What?

2147
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,880
Thinking.

2148
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,000
Talking

2149
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,600
You feel so sad after a sleep.

2150
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,320
I just feel wronged.

2151
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,320
If you think

2152
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,440
that you've wronged yourself,

2153
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,440
just forget it.

2154
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,240
No, I think

2155
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:48,120
it has nothing to do with him.

2156
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,240
He did nothing wrong.

2157
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:53,000
If everyone is unhappy,

2158
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,280
why go on a date?

2159
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,320
To steal other people's opportunities.

2160
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,240
Then come here.

2161
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,360
I was unhappy.

2162
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,240
Why should I go?

2163
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,240
Do you want me to ask

2164
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,720
if he's happy?

2165
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,240
What do you mean?

2166
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,200
Isn't he happy?

2167
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:07,640
I feel...

2168
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,560
Didn't he say anything to you when he came back?

2169
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:20,920
But it feels like

2170
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,280
if he comes to you now,

2171
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:25,040
you can make things clear.

2172
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,360
After all, both of you are in a bad mood.

2173
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:26,840
There must be something.

2174
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:27,480
I don't know

2175
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,040
I don't know what to say.

2176
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,560
Just tell him you don't know what's wrong with you.

2177
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,600
Tell him you think he's unhappy.

2178
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,400
But I don't want you

2179
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:38,080
to take the initiative every time.

2180
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,560
Although I want him to come to you,

2181
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:40,320
but I don't want

2182
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,960
to ask him to come to you

2183
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:43,280
as your friend.

2184
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,560
If he can't feel my emotions,

2185
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:47,360
why

2186
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,160
to remind him?

2187
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,680
Will someone remind him later?

2188
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,920
It sounds like

2189
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:01,240
not good at dating.

2190
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,200
It feels like this.

2191
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:07,800
What should I do?

2192
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,200
What can we do now?

2193
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,360
We didn't take the initiative.

2194
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,800
but he knows it himself.

2195
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:12,840
And he can...

2196
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,680
Stop thinking about it.

2197
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,040
Dream on?

2198
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,240
Delusion?

2199
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:19,720
Go downstairs and eat.

2200
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,880
Don't avoid him.

2201
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,200
Just go to him.

2202
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,560
I'm serious.

2203
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,000
I'm so twisted.

2204
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,200
Stubborn.

2205
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,880
I can't stand myself anymore.

2206
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:36,080
If you want to break this trap,

2207
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:39,520
I can bring him here for you two to talk.

2208
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,280
It's us again.

2209
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,200
Let him do it.

2210
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,480
Yes, why me again?

2211
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:46,040
Why is it always me?

2212
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:46,880
I'm the one who's unhappy.

2213
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,320
I'm the one who's unhappy.

2214
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:53,880
I'm so mad.

2215
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:54,720
I'm so worried.

2216
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:55,680
I'm so pissed.

2217
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:56,350
I'm so worried.

2218
01:29:57,470 --> 01:29:58,560
Do you want to eat something?

2219
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,830
Get yourself together.

2220
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:03,160
Just do what we should do.

2221
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,960
You're just more sensitive than him.

2222
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,040
I think

2223
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:10,960
He's sensitive too.

2224
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,400
Soup is sensitive too.

2225
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,470
Taurus.

2226
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:14,480
Taurus.

2227
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,390
I'm sensitive.

2228
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,200
Me again?

2229
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,440
Why?

2230
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,400
I'm a sensitive little stone.

2231
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,640
I posted a Moment

2232
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,400
I want to become a stupid stone.

2233
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,870
Let's go.

2234
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:33,120
Let's play.

2235
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,270
Let me play the piano.

2236
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,240
I think he's depressed too.

2237
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,120
Now I feel uncomfortable all over

2238
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,800
Now I feel like an ant is crawling on me.

2239
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,800
Are you okay?

2240
01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:41,040
What's wrong? You're so flustered.

2241
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,680
You're flustered.

2242
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:46,680
What would you do if it were you?

2243
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:48,280
Am I Susu?

2244
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,960
Put yourself in this position.

2245
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,760
If it were me,

2246
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,840
I would still take the initiative.

2247
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,960
I'll ask you directly.

2248
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:02,400
You're right.

2249
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,720
But only if I care about him very much.

2250
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,470
So you really care about me.

2251
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:11,360
Yes.

2252
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:15,200
Cut.

2253
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:19,640
Well,

2254
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:23,440
You really don't know how to choose a place.

2255
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,440
So annoying.

2256
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:25,470
Indeed.

2257
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:26,480
I'm hanging up.

2258
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,520
I want some water.

2259
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,390
Drink water. Do it.

2260
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,200
What are you doing?

2261
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,110
Let me pour you some.

2262
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:35,230
Get me a glass of water.

2263
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:36,320
She's already there.

2264
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,240
Help!

2265
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,670
It's okay.

2266
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,080
It's okay.

2267
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:48,800
You're guilty.

2268
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:05,920
Text time

2269
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,080
Sit, Sunny.

2270
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,150
I'll sit here.

2271
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:12,640
I want to sit

2272
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,160
where I can sit alone.

2273
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,560
I don't want to be close to him.

2274
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,560
I'm afraid I'll miss him again.

2275
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,440
I'm just thinking

2276
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,230
if he would sit next to me.

2277
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:28,960
But I'm afraid after thinking about it,

2278
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,480
he didn't come to sit next to me.

2279
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,480
What?

2280
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:27,390
Up.

2281
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:41,630
I received a message from my heart today.

2282
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:43,230
It must be from Terri.

2283
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:43,920
After watching it,

2284
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,670
Of course I'm happy.

2285
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:45,630
I'll hang it up soon.

2286
01:34:45,630 --> 01:34:46,480
Action.

2287
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,680
I texted Hua today.

2288
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,720
I'm very satisfied with this date.

2289
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:56,160
I think the sunflower you made for me

2290
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:57,790
is really meaningful.

2291
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:02,320
Soup.

2292
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,280
Flower made it.

2293
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:06,800
Tofu.

2294
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,640
Yes, with beans.

2295
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:09,470
Are you happy today?

2296
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:10,640
Yes.

2297
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:12,000
Just handmade

2298
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:12,830
Over there.

2299
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:13,790
See?

2300
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:15,360
It's on the bag. Let me show you.

2301
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:16,400
It's made of flowers.

2302
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:19,710
In her own words,

2303
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:21,040
she wants me to be happy every day.

2304
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,000
I think every time I see this,

2305
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:23,760
I think of her.

2306
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,830
I received a text from Hua today.

2307
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:46,840
Her feelings were obvious.

2308
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,280
But when she said she liked me,

2309
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,950
and complained about me.

2310
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:52,400
Although it's not as good as mine,

2311
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,760
but I still like it.

2312
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,110
I'll text Tae-seo today.

2313
01:35:58,110 --> 01:35:59,120
And today's relationship

2314
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,480
is definitely warmer

2315
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,790
than before.

2316
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:03,120
So I hope

2317
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:05,520
to spend more time with each other.

2318
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:36,000
Tonight, it's still for Xiaoling.

2319
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,470
First, I comforted her.

2320
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:38,430
I understand

2321
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:41,080
how she feels about her brother.

2322
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:43,070
I just experienced it yesterday.

2323
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:44,160
So I think

2324
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,950
you can comfort him.

2325
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:48,160
But don't be too sad.

2326
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,720
I have to be optimistic.

2327
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,320
I think I wrote a lot

2328
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:00,440
I wrote a lot.

2329
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,790
Because today,

2330
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,520
to tell the map.

2331
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,120
Today I get along with Tu

2332
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,720
with Tu Tu.

2333
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:07,840
I feel happy

2334
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,920
with him.

2335
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,710
He sent me a long paragraph.

2336
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:41,600
And part of it

2337
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,120
the text he edited last night.

2338
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,680
He knew I was sad.

2339
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:47,870
After he got emotional,

2340
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:50,640
he did some self-reflection.

2341
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,790
He also told me how to make me happy today.

2342
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:55,390
When I saw this part,

2343
01:37:55,390 --> 01:37:56,350
I was quite touched.

2344
01:37:58,430 --> 01:37:58,910
I think today

2345
01:37:58,910 --> 01:38:00,400
a perfect day today.

2346
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,110
We've been watching movies and watching TV.

2347
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:04,160
We kept talking

2348
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,830
and

2349
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:06,080
I'm happy

2350
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,550
I'm satisfied with that.

2351
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:08,190
I think

2352
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:09,720
sometimes

2353
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,680
this kind of plain companionship

2354
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,080
will be more effective than going out to play.

2355
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,760
and know more about each other.

2356
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:28,760
Actually,

2357
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,200
spend the whole day with him,

2358
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,520
I felt very happy.

2359
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:32,480
In the message,

2360
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,430
in the text message.

2361
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:36,640
Actually the content I sent today is short.

2362
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:38,040
But I think

2363
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,510
can include my mood all day.

2364
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,160
I hope he will come to me

2365
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:08,800
he should come to talk to me.

2366
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,910
I can't see

2367
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:14,590
any details.

2368
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,720
makes me feel that he doesn't like me that much.

2369
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,160
Since I like her,

2370
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,430
I might try again

2371
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:45,360
to make a breakthrough.

2372
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:48,320
I'm thinking

2373
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,560
when will you

2374
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,360
When will you talk to me?

2375
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,360
What will I talk about later?

2376
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,480
to face him

2377
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,280
to face him.

2378
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:09,360
Do you think my sister

2379
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,040
did she send the soup today?

2380
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:13,790
I think I sent it to him.

2381
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,360
I never thought of not sending it to him.

2382
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:36,480
I don't think I should.

2383
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,840
I won't send it to others.

2384
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,400
Even if we didn't have a good time today,

2385
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,880
or I feel wronged.

2386
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,680
But I think my feelings are clear.

2387
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:46,560
My feelings

2388
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,120
to him.

2389
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,110
I received a text message today.

2390
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:31,800
And I'm from Susu.

2391
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,880
I'm not surprised.

2392
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,070
Because I think

2393
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:37,040
he gets along well with Susu.

2394
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,230
I think Susu still likes him.

2395
01:41:39,230 --> 01:41:41,310
So I'm not surprised that he received the message.

2396
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:43,520
But I still want to know the story.

2397
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,520
Do you want to play a game?

2398
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,200
No, I'm eating.

2399
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,070
Can I sit here?

2400
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:57,040
Wait.

2401
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,240
So many people.

2402
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,080
I'm not chatting with you here.

2403
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,360
Sit here for a while.

2404
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,190
Let's go upstairs.

2405
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:10,520
Leave it to them.

2406
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,480
It's spicy.

2407
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,190
Do you want water?

2408
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:17,680
Thank you.

2409
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,440
It's spicy.

2410
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:42,590
Let's go.

2411
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:44,160
You're not eating?

2412
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:58,110
Sit here.

2413
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:09,280
A House of Feelings.

2414
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:16,400
Actually...

2415
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,150
Say something.

2416
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,910
Actually...

2417
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:20,000
Say something.

2418
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:22,640
I asked Harry last night

2419
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:25,080
Because I want to get close to

2420
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,000
to get close to her,

2421
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,630
or even hold her hand.

2422
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,160
I asked Harry,

2423
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,360
if I had some physical contact

2424
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,360
with Su Su,

2425
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,040
Will she be very uncomfortable?

2426
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:40,600
Actually, I didn't ask him to ask you.

2427
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,000
I...

2428
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,070
He didn't ask me.

2429
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:47,280
But when I came back today,

2430
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:49,150
you were at the dining table.

2431
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:50,240
Didn't he ask you?

2432
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:51,360
No, he didn't.

2433
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:53,040
Did he say you had physical contact?

2434
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,240
I said no.

2435
01:44:58,270 --> 01:44:59,960
What I heard was...

2436
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,120
Tell me.

2437
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:04,990
What does it have to do with me?

2438
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,800
Well, I think...

2439
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:12,800
No.

2440
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,040
I didn't say anything.

2441
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:14,320
Really?

2442
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,160
He didn't even ask this question.

2443
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,280
You really...

2444
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,000
I really...

2445
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,280
You're here.

2446
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,440
has nothing to do

2447
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,150
has anything to do with me?

2448
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:23,480
He didn't talk to you about

2449
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:23,920
what I told you yesterday.

2450
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,360
he said something.

2451
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:26,720
A House of Feelings.

2452
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,520
I didn't say anything.

2453
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,360
He didn't ask this question.

2454
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,920
What were you talking about at the dining table?

2455
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,160
Is there any progress?

2456
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:38,110
any physical contact?

2457
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:39,160
Like...

2458
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:40,800
I said no.

2459
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,960
I might hear

2460
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:47,320
about our date.

2461
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,560
You may

2462
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,520
some of my mistakes

2463
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:52,830
as a joke to them.

2464
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:55,680
You think my behaviour is ridiculous.

2465
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,070
I don't think you're funny.

2466
01:45:59,070 --> 01:46:01,560
Why do I think you're ridiculous?

2467
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:06,110
First,

2468
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:09,040
I don't take it as a joke.

2469
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:12,560
I just want to express my feelings.

2470
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:13,950
And I don't know

2471
01:46:14,590 --> 01:46:16,440
you could still hear it from so far away.

2472
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:16,920
I don't think

2473
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,560
it's funny.

2474
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:22,080
I didn't know he heard that.

2475
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,040
And I think

2476
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,720
he might have heard it wrong.

2477
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:25,950
Did the date fail?

2478
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:28,000
Did you two make any progress?

2479
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:32,350
You really...

2480
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:33,520
have to do with me?

2481
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,200
Because

2482
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,680
in the way we get along,

2483
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,920
we always make some heavy things

2484
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,320
some serious things

2485
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:41,680
to express it.

2486
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,640
He might think what I said

2487
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:45,950
or mocking him.

2488
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:47,640
But I didn't think of that at all.

2489
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,150
I didn't mean that.

2490
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,240
A House of Feelings.

2491
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,920
What do you think I did wrong

2492
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:53,840
or something else,

2493
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,600
you can tell me.

2494
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,120
Even if you and Harry

2495
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:58,840
You two can complain about it.

2496
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,160
It's not good if Tata is here.

2497
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:01,240
I don't care at all.

2498
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:03,280
But you told me

2499
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,240
you're actually very sensitive.

2500
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:07,320
You care about others' feelings

2501
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:09,400
than your own feelings.

2502
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:14,080
I think after coming back today,

2503
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,120
you didn't

2504
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,750
care about your feelings.

2505
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:20,830
You didn't consider my feelings at all.

2506
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:22,360
I don't know.

2507
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:23,710
I thought on my way back,

2508
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:24,720
on my way back.

2509
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,600
But they asked me

2510
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:26,480
After that, I said,

2511
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,000
The more I said, the more I felt wronged.

2512
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,760
The more I say it, the more I feel nothing is right.

2513
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,840
I wanted to cry when I was on the table.

2514
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,720
But I thought there were many people.

2515
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:35,200
You were there too.

2516
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,360
Then I made a joke

2517
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:39,320
in a joke.

2518
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,830
I don't want to make it too serious.

2519
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:41,760
or

2520
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,880
I need someone to comfort me

2521
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:43,840
or something like that.

2522
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:44,880
Then,

2523
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:49,240
So I called them up later.

2524
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:50,910
Actually, I didn't want to invite them up.

2525
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:51,600
I just want to find Harry.

2526
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,400
But Harry and Tata

2527
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,630
together now.

2528
01:47:53,630 --> 01:47:54,320
Then I can only

2529
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,190
to both of them.

2530
01:47:56,190 --> 01:48:00,160
and tell them how I feel.

2531
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,870
Maybe after I said it,

2532
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,680
after I said it.

2533
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:10,800
and made Harry angry.

2534
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,600
He thought

2535
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:14,360
wasted his chance

2536
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:15,640
or something.

2537
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,640
I feel sorry for them.

2538
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:20,920
And I think

2539
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:22,680
I can't feel many things.

2540
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:31,160
The two key points

2541
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:32,960
the two key points of our chat

2542
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:35,520
I don't feel it.

2543
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:36,720
Not proactive enough.

2544
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:39,480
If you don't take the initiative, you don't like it enough.

2545
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,560
You mean in Cat Cafe?

2546
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:55,600
Yes.

2547
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:02,480
A House of Feelings.

2548
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,550
I think a good relationship

2549
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:05,200
is a bonus.

2550
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:07,520
When two people are together,

2551
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:08,670
more happy

2552
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:09,470
than being alone.

2553
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:12,190
more comfortable and happier.

2554
01:49:12,190 --> 01:49:14,680
instead of

2555
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:15,870
burden.

2556
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:19,360
A House of Feelings.

2557
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:29,080
Actually, when she cries,

2558
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,920
I wanted to comfort her.

2559
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:35,320
But I don't know how to do it.

2560
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,630
So I think I didn't do it well.

2561
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,920
In my way of life or

2562
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,680
compared to my old self,

2563
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:57,840
I'm already very active.

2564
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,920
So I want to ask you

2565
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,680
what kind of state

2566
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,920
you want.

2567
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:08,760
It doesn't mean

2568
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:09,920
you can become

2569
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,680
what I want you to be.

2570
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:15,200
This is not the real you.

2571
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:18,800
I'm also confused.

2572
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,120
I don't know

2573
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:22,720
how to take the initiative in the next development.

2574
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,310
Because we know each other.

2575
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:27,520
I don't know what I can ask you.

2576
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,360
There's nothing I want to know.

2577
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,680
That's why.

2578
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:32,440
Because you think we know enough.

2579
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:39,000
I think I really want to ask you

2580
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,670
In terms of three views,

2581
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:42,910
But these things often involve

2582
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:44,120
related to family.

2583
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,400
If I asked you,

2584
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:47,390
you answered me,

2585
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:50,590
But I didn't answer you when you asked me.

2586
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:52,670
I think it's impolite.

2587
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:55,550
But I don't want to talk about

2588
01:50:55,550 --> 01:50:58,000
about my family in the show.

2589
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,560
If we can't talk about life and values,

2590
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:05,120
we can only

2591
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:07,600
your opinion on certain things.

2592
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:09,600
about certain things.

2593
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:16,400
Actually, I don't know

2594
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:17,440
what I should know about you.

2595
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,200
I can talk about what I've changed

2596
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,080
after I came here.

2597
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:23,280
Actually chatting with Fatty

2598
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,640
with Fatty.

2599
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:26,040
I didn't know you two had a chat.

2600
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,760
Maybe he just wanted me

2601
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:31,680
to try to relax.

2602
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:38,960
Will you

2603
01:51:39,870 --> 01:51:42,960
When I'm free and you're free,

2604
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,670
when I'm free?

2605
01:51:48,190 --> 01:51:49,520
You never came to me.

2606
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,800
Because I don't know if you're willing.

2607
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,240
Because of me.

2608
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:53,600
Why didn't you ask?

2609
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,760
I'm afraid you'd be embarrassed to say no.

2610
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,150
But you don't like it.

2611
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,160
Well...

2612
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,800
I think it's okay to ask now.

2613
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:24,670
I thought

2614
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:25,760
I thought you drank water.

2615
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,000
You can drink so much.

2616
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:29,470
Okay.

2617
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:32,350
I think I've already taken the initiative.

2618
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:34,680
I'm too proactive.

2619
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:36,320
I hate myself.

2620
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,110
What?

2621
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,200
I should be

2622
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,960
in real life.

2623
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:43,640
More boring.

2624
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:45,040
I've never taken the initiative.

2625
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,200
Growing up

2626
01:52:47,230 --> 01:52:48,830
Almost.

2627
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,640
But you are a boy.

2628
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,040
I'm a girl.

2629
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:53,920
Okay.

2630
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,310
I'm trying to change.

2631
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:58,520
I didn't see it.

2632
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:00,480
Su Zihao told me

2633
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,920
he talked a lot with you every day.

2634
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,040
He asked you to take the initiative every day.

2635
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,400
But you didn't change at all.

2636
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:05,560
You only care about your feelings.

2637
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:06,750
You don't care about my feelings.

2638
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:07,870
That's all.

2639
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:12,190
I only care about my feelings.

2640
01:53:12,190 --> 01:53:12,990
I just told you

2641
01:53:12,990 --> 01:53:14,520
I adopted a stray dog.

2642
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:15,360
Say hello.

2643
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,720
Ask me next second

2644
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,160
Do you still have a dog?

2645
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,600
You really don't care what I say.

2646
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:22,270
I didn't know

2647
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:23,360
The left ear goes in the right ear

2648
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,400
or left ear?

2649
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:25,880
before it goes in.

2650
01:53:29,950 --> 01:53:32,240
I'll focus 100 percent from now on.

2651
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,720
No, I just feel that you're distracted.

2652
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:37,880
I was wondering why there were so many cameras.

2653
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:38,270
Yes.

2654
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:39,480
So we can't be immersed in it.

2655
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:41,360
That's what we should do, right?

2656
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:42,880
But...

2657
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:43,680
on the day we played ping-pong,

2658
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,560
there were many cameras.

2659
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,480
Maybe in the familiar environment,

2660
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,880
And my teacher is here.

2661
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,320
Actually,

2662
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:54,720
I think he's more like my parent.

2663
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:56,800
for three years.

2664
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,360
In an environment,

2665
01:53:58,360 --> 01:54:00,560
in an environment,

2666
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,520
I might relaxed.

2667
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:05,200
Maybe I haven't been to Cat Cafe much.

2668
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:07,200
I don't know what to do.

2669
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,030
Because you're not immersed

2670
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:09,150
so I won't be immersed.

2671
01:54:09,150 --> 01:54:09,790
Because it's mutual.

2672
01:54:09,790 --> 01:54:11,360
No date is

2673
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:13,560
One is happy and the other is unhappy.

2674
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:16,320
You can't do this.

2675
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,280
It's usually

2676
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:21,880
the same thing.

2677
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:23,440
Right?

2678
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:26,640
Su Zihao told me

2679
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:29,630
you said

2680
01:54:29,630 --> 01:54:30,720
some physical contact.

2681
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:32,760
You pulled me.

2682
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:33,240
I think

2683
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:34,720
you're showing it to him.

2684
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,960
You showed him that you're completing the mission.

2685
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:37,950
You're doing a mission.

2686
01:54:37,950 --> 01:54:39,040
Brother.

2687
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,080
I'm afraid you'll dislike it.

2688
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,520
That's what I think.

2689
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:44,000
Stop it.

2690
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:44,670
How about tomorrow?

2691
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:46,110
I have something to do tomorrow.

2692
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:47,870
I'm sorry you can't see me.

2693
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,550
I have to get out of here.

2694
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:52,160
Okay.

2695
01:54:52,830 --> 01:54:53,520
Okay.

2696
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,360
Can I say you're not allowed to leave?

2697
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:57,310
Are you the boss?

2698
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,680
What about the day after tomorrow?

2699
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:01,680
Think about it the day after tomorrow.

2700
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:03,480
Okay.

2701
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:05,200
I won't come back tomorrow.

2702
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:12,830
Why do you and Su Zihao

2703
01:55:12,830 --> 01:55:14,430
have so much to say?

2704
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:19,920
I don't know. Maybe he talks too much.

2705
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,360
I talk a lot too.

2706
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:22,640
I talk a lot too.

2707
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:25,120
I only reply when he says three sentences to me.

2708
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:27,320
I'll ask him.

2709
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:28,280
Why is he so talkative?

2710
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,160
Let me learn philosophy.

2711
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:32,640
I think

2712
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:34,880
in this situation,

2713
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:36,600
Su Zihao is willing to

2714
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:37,520
talk to you every day

2715
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:38,750
or answer questions

2716
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:40,800
or something like that.

2717
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,000
or if there's any misunderstanding,

2718
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,630
through him.

2719
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:47,390
But we won't have people like him anymore.

2720
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:53,760
It's okay. I won't talk to him anymore.

2721
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,320
I'll talk to you directly.

2722
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:57,400
But without him,

2723
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:58,240
where would I go

2724
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:00,030
get your real thoughts.

2725
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,430
I can't imagine

2726
01:56:06,430 --> 01:56:07,870
Without him,

2727
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:08,920
we might...

2728
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:13,400
Maybe...

2729
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:15,000
it's impossible.

2730
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,630
Maybe I won't send it to you on the first day.

2731
01:56:17,630 --> 01:56:18,680
Maybe.

2732
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:26,000
If you don't mind, I'll go to you.

2733
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Wait for another two days.

2734
01:56:32,830 --> 01:56:33,440
He thinks

2735
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,110
he's already

2736
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:35,360
is doing his best.

2737
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,800
He's already the one

2738
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:37,840
or the most.

2739
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:40,160
is different from before.

2740
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:43,040
But I'm still not satisfied.

2741
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:47,870
I hope he will take the initiative.

2742
01:56:47,870 --> 01:56:50,200
I hope he can change.

2743
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:51,440
What changes?

2744
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,240
I think

2745
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:54,590
if you like someone,

2746
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:56,400
I might need to make some changes.

2747
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:00,080
Maybe I didn't feel

2748
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,640
I didn't feel it.

2749
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:05,920
I want to try

2750
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,360
to make a breakthrough.

2751
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:08,600
Take the initiative.

2752
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:25,790
You rejected my date, right?

2753
01:57:25,790 --> 01:57:26,720
Sit here and talk.

2754
01:57:27,230 --> 01:57:28,000
Don't you think

2755
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,000
Aren't you weird?

2756
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:31,870
About what?

2757
01:57:31,870 --> 01:57:33,440
After that,

2758
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:35,680
I wrote it in the next second.

2759
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:37,080
How do you want others to do it?

2760
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:38,800
I mean I respect your choice.

2761
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,080
You can refuse.

2762
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:43,360
I didn't say anything.

2763
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,560
No, I didn't refuse because...

2764
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,640
It's not because...

2765
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:50,000
I thought you didn't write that letter.

2766
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,910
That's why I refused.

2767
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:53,880
You think I didn't write that letter?

2768
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:54,520
Yes.

2769
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,960
Who wrote it for you?

2770
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,110
I think

2771
01:57:58,110 --> 01:57:59,040
might not be a misunderstanding.

2772
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,240
but bad information.

2773
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:01,400
We never

2774
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:03,070
sit down and talk.

2775
01:58:03,070 --> 01:58:04,000
Let's go.

2776
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:06,800
Where are we going?

2777
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:07,760
Let's talk.

2778
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:15,800
You've always been like this.

2779
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:25,240
Why? Why do you think I didn't write it?

2780
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:27,640
Because your words and actions are different.

2781
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:31,960
You're not very consistent.

2782
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:32,440
I think anyone

2783
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:33,360
can say that I'm inconsistent.

2784
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:35,120
But you can't say that I'm inconsistent.

2785
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:38,160
Where is the point?

2786
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,230
I told you yesterday

2787
01:58:39,230 --> 01:58:41,680
I didn't approve

2788
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:42,160
your explanation in the room.

2789
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,320
I even thought

2790
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:44,960
I felt like I was led.

2791
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:47,280
I think you're quite stupid.

2792
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,080
Think about it.

2793
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:54,840
Let's check the timeline.

2794
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:56,080
The next day I came,

2795
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:59,160
That means I have a good impression.

2796
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:01,310
The next day,

2797
01:59:02,110 --> 01:59:03,200
it was you.

2798
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:04,760
I actually sent it to you on the first day.

2799
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:06,430
You sent me the first day.

2800
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:11,070
You didn't text me on the first day.

2801
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:11,920
The next day.

2802
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:13,040
The next day is like

2803
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,110
the first day.

2804
01:59:14,110 --> 01:59:14,840
Is it you?

2805
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:15,870
It's me.

2806
01:59:15,870 --> 01:59:17,240
I sent you the next day.

2807
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:18,680
Yes.

2808
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:19,520
When we were on a date,

2809
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:20,670
we reached a consensus

2810
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:22,110
to meet new people?

2811
01:59:22,110 --> 01:59:22,720
Yes.

2812
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:23,160
Right?

2813
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:23,760
Yes.

2814
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:27,070
So the next day,

2815
01:59:27,070 --> 01:59:28,990
Tarri and Tata entered.

2816
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:30,240
The third day.

2817
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:30,720
Yes.

2818
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:32,480
Yes, and I sent it to Tata.

2819
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:33,360
You sent it to Terri.

2820
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,840
Yes, the sports day.

2821
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:37,280
But you didn't contact Tata.

2822
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:39,160
You sent it to Tata at night?

2823
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:41,080
I did.

2824
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:42,720
You're with Xiaoling all day during the sports day.

2825
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:43,710
How do you get in touch with her?

2826
01:59:43,710 --> 01:59:45,200
The first man Tata met was me.

2827
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:57,880
He didn't let me hear it.

2828
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:02,480
Because I actually have an answer in my heart.

2829
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:03,550
Just write a letter

2830
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:04,560
Romantic house

2831
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:05,840
The misunderstanding between Fatty and her

2832
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,000
between Fatty and her.

2833
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,120
instead of

2834
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:10,430
Hua wants to get closer to Fatty

2835
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:11,230
with Fatty

2836
02:00:11,230 --> 02:00:12,440
and develop.

2837
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:13,840
I just want to verify my answer.

2838
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,360
I don't think so.

2839
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:19,070
Didn't you notice that

2840
02:00:19,070 --> 02:00:20,600
after the sports day?

2841
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:21,630
I didn't see it.

2842
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:23,280
your mouth

2843
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,760
You said you came to our wedding.

2844
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:26,910
and then with Xiao Ling.

2845
02:00:26,910 --> 02:00:28,080
If you're the one who killed Xiao Ling,

2846
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,560
I'm willing to do it.

2847
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:31,160
I think you're "poisonous".

2848
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:34,080
It's my fault.

2849
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:34,910
I have a mouth.

2850
02:00:34,910 --> 02:00:36,030
Yes, I think you're "poisonous".

2851
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:36,640
And you...

2852
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,080
But you've been following me.

2853
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,000
Xiao Ling and I were watching.

2854
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,990
I think you're in contact.

2855
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:43,040
So what I want to tell you

2856
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,600
This is...

2857
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:45,790
You... I don't know why.

2858
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:47,000
Maybe it's because

2859
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,110
my mouth

2860
02:00:50,110 --> 02:00:52,400
You misunderstood that I was

2861
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:54,560
I think I'm clinging to you again and again.

2862
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,480
It's very shaky.

2863
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:56,670
Yeah. And I think

2864
02:00:56,670 --> 02:00:58,270
And I even think

2865
02:00:58,270 --> 02:00:59,550
I might be a little narcissistic.

2866
02:00:59,550 --> 02:01:01,310
Do you think you're doing this on purpose?

2867
02:01:01,310 --> 02:01:03,440
If you say something like that in front of me,

2868
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:04,280
I would think

2869
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:06,640
this man is really interesting.

2870
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:10,320
Maybe it's about his three views.

2871
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:11,230
You can see that

2872
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:13,280
Xinxin and I are very good at joking.

2873
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:14,430
Maybe

2874
02:01:14,430 --> 02:01:15,600
Look at Xin's jokes

2875
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:17,120
every day.

2876
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,430
Actually, we are the same people.

2877
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:20,920
We just like to pick up this joke.

2878
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,270
Although I told you to choose,

2879
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:27,280
I did it myself.

2880
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:28,920
I asked you to go, right?

2881
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,880
During this period, it's true that Terri

2882
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,800
He was rejected by Susu several times.

2883
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,400
I had no choice.

2884
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:36,480
We are alike.

2885
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:37,120
What do you mean?

2886
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:40,510
The abandoned children warm up together.

2887
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:41,520
I suddenly found that

2888
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:42,960
have some feelings for each other.

2889
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:45,720
We just happened to get together.

2890
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:48,670
We think it's good for each other.

2891
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:49,600
We get along well

2892
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:50,720
and get along well.

2893
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,000
But in my mind,

2894
02:01:52,830 --> 02:01:54,400
The map also told me many times

2895
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:56,760
to respect my feelings

2896
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:58,000
That's why I wrote that letter.

2897
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:58,960
I thought

2898
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:01,520
you might think I'm a little selfish.

2899
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:03,360
You want to get in touch with both of them.

2900
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:04,670
That's what I think.

2901
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:05,240
That's what I did.

2902
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:06,720
So I wrote you that letter.

2903
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,280
And

2904
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:09,150
I think you're right in the room.

2905
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:10,840
So I sent Terry

2906
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:11,640
last night.

2907
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:12,480
Then I said

2908
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:14,520
I said I was hesitating

2909
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:15,120
between you and Fatty.

2910
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:16,280
Because I think

2911
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:18,270
I need someone who takes the initiative

2912
02:02:18,270 --> 02:02:19,320
to my life.

2913
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,920
But Terri always told me

2914
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:22,840
he's a passive person.

2915
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:24,000
Although I can take the initiative,

2916
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,240
but I want to be in a relationship.

2917
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:29,360
I want to be...

2918
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:30,400
Well...

2919
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:31,680
How do you know

2920
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:32,880
I take the initiative in love?

2921
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,110
At least I feel

2922
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:35,640
you took the initiative to me.

2923
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:38,160
But I might be the one who takes the initiative to Tae-seo.

2924
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:39,320
I might need to guide him.

2925
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:40,600
That's true.

2926
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:41,840
Then I'll take the initiative. Okay.

2927
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:42,360
Yes.

2928
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:44,160
I'm also grateful to the romantic house

2929
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:46,430
for telling me this.

2930
02:02:46,430 --> 02:02:47,550
I thought I should say it.

2931
02:02:47,550 --> 02:02:48,960
So I just texted him yesterday.

2932
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,520
texted yesterday.

2933
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,280
I talked to Tae-seo directly in this room.

2934
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:53,950
I said I was struggling between you and Fatty.

2935
02:02:53,950 --> 02:02:55,200
I wrote to Fatty.

2936
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:56,600
So I guess tomorrow

2937
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:57,760
I might have two dates tomorrow.

2938
02:02:57,760 --> 02:02:58,840
You chose me.

2939
02:02:58,840 --> 02:02:59,440
Then I choose Fatty.

2940
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,280
No, you didn't have two dates.

2941
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,360
Yes, I don't know.

2942
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:02,910
Yeah.

2943
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:04,000
I just found out.

2944
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:04,560
Do I have no face?

2945
02:03:05,950 --> 02:03:06,520
Okay.

2946
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:07,800
You just told me in the house

2947
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:09,360
you wanted to keep in touch with Tae-seo.

2948
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,800
Right? That's the truth.

2949
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:11,070
Yes.

2950
02:03:11,070 --> 02:03:11,760
Do it now. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

2951
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:12,400
Next second,

2952
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,240
write me this letter.

2953
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:14,110
Do you think I can accept it?

2954
02:03:14,110 --> 02:03:15,360
I think you're acting weird.

2955
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,310
You don't understand the rules, do you?

2956
02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:19,280
You send a message to comfort your friends,

2957
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,920
and apologize on a date.

2958
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,280
I think you're really weird.

2959
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:26,080
I didn't say I was going on a date. I'm sorry.

2960
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,710
I said I'll get to know you again.

2961
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:30,840
But your behavior is one?

2962
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:33,280
You told me about a date last second.

2963
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,000
and you texted them about your feelings.

2964
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,280
I find it very strange.

2965
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:36,920
You were there.

2966
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:37,760
Because he is passive.

2967
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:39,840
So you coax him in the message.

2968
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:40,600
and send it to him.

2969
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:41,720
And I'm

2970
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:42,640
with passion.

2971
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:45,150
Should the one who takes the initiative

2972
02:03:45,150 --> 02:03:46,360
become

2973
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:47,200
I didn't say I should.

2974
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:47,840
So I said it.

2975
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,760
So I think

2976
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,480
So you made me feel

2977
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:51,600
I feel very sad.

2978
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:53,630
So what I did yesterday was...

2979
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:56,400
You don't have to choose. I'll say goodbye myself.

2980
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:57,360
I'll retreat myself.

2981
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:58,270
I don't want you to choose.

2982
02:03:58,270 --> 02:03:59,160
Okay, I know.

2983
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:00,400
I accept your feelings.

2984
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:01,440
Do you know how angry I was that day?

2985
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,110
Did you see that?

2986
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:03,960
Yes.

2987
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:04,800
That's why I...

2988
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:07,200
That's why I asked Tu to coax you.

2989
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:08,560
But in your place,

2990
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:10,080
I'm showing my feelings for you.

2991
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:11,480
I thought you were upset at that moment.

2992
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:13,240
You know what?

2993
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:14,560
after you asked Tu to coax me,

2994
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:15,520
I'm worse.

2995
02:04:16,510 --> 02:04:17,600
Okay, I didn't know you were such a person.

2996
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:18,240
I know now.

2997
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:19,040
It's weird.

2998
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:19,960
You knew

2999
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:21,920
I would be angry.

3000
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:23,000
And I personally think

3001
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,720
when you can comfort someone,

3002
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:26,000
And you sit next to him.

3003
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,190
Ask him out for a drink in the house.

3004
02:04:28,190 --> 02:04:29,520
or have a chat.

3005
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,840
I think it's comforting.

3006
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:32,920
You made me a "licker".

3007
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:34,640
I feel very embarrassed.

3008
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:35,200
Really.

3009
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:39,870
I always feel that the two of us

3010
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:41,840
I think you've been

3011
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:42,880
the lead.

3012
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,320
It makes me passive.

3013
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:47,320
And it makes me look a little anxious.

3014
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:48,120
So why did you...

3015
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:49,400
I don't know if the map told you

3016
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:49,950
why he cried.

3017
02:04:49,950 --> 02:04:50,800
I think...

3018
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,190
Because he was passive yesterday.

3019
02:04:52,190 --> 02:04:54,080
in your perspective yesterday.

3020
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:55,760
He thinks what you said is reasonable.

3021
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:57,310
What I said is unreasonable.

3022
02:04:57,790 --> 02:04:58,880
Yes.

3023
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:00,670
It makes me look unstable.

3024
02:05:00,670 --> 02:05:02,480
But I'm actually very calm.

3025
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:03,760
I just think...

3026
02:05:04,670 --> 02:05:06,840
I just think that you always

3027
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:07,960
in the wrong way.

3028
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:09,280
I'd better have the ability.

3029
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:11,870
Actually, you have the ability.

3030
02:05:11,870 --> 02:05:12,670
Including that day in the house,

3031
02:05:12,670 --> 02:05:13,200
I don't have the ability.

3032
02:05:13,950 --> 02:05:15,120
Then why did Tu and I

3033
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:16,030
with Tu Tu yesterday?

3034
02:05:16,030 --> 02:05:17,560
Because I felt it.

3035
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:18,880
Feel what?

3036
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:21,200
If you feel that I'm guiding you,

3037
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:22,520
if I had the ability to guide you,

3038
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:24,800
you wouldn't have sent that text that day.

3039
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:25,760
to comfort Tae-seo.

3040
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:26,240
I have the ability.

3041
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:27,800
I've guided you to send it to me.

3042
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:31,760
Don't you have your own ideas?

3043
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:33,440
I have my own thoughts.

3044
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:33,950
Yeah.

3045
02:05:33,950 --> 02:05:34,680
But I think

3046
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:36,190
you grilled me on fire.

3047
02:05:36,190 --> 02:05:38,400
You think it's my behavior

3048
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,000
pushed you

3049
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:40,880
at the edge of the storm.

3050
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:42,430
Yes, that's what it means.

3051
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:44,440
So yesterday I was

3052
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:45,790
a little out of control yesterday.

3053
02:05:45,790 --> 02:05:47,000
Not a little. You just lost control.

3054
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:47,920
I didn't want to talk.

3055
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:48,510
Later I thought

3056
02:05:48,510 --> 02:05:50,480
you pushed me to an explosion point.

3057
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,680
Do you know

3058
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:52,800
Do you know after the dinner?

3059
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,160
I thought if you had a better temper,

3060
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:55,680
this wouldn't have happened.

3061
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:56,720
I tried my best to change.

3062
02:06:00,030 --> 02:06:00,960
It turns out that

3063
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,720
I changed a lot.

3064
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:03,230
I hope so.

3065
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:05,520
I didn't feel it.

3066
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:07,200
You don't know who I was.

3067
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:09,200
How do you know I haven't changed?

3068
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:11,520
I just feel that our conversation

3069
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:12,670
we might have

3070
02:06:12,670 --> 02:06:14,200
better than yesterday,

3071
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,640
I didn't want to talk about it yesterday.

3072
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:17,840
Come in.

3073
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:20,670
I've made myself clear.

3074
02:06:20,670 --> 02:06:22,320
I'm telling you clearly now.

3075
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:23,960
From tomorrow onwards,

3076
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:24,600
and Tae-seo

3077
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:25,120
with Tae-seo.

3078
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:26,720
You don't agree, right?

3079
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:29,120
I can't agree to contact at the same time.

3080
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,840
I can only promise you to contact one first.

3081
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:32,440
Okay.

3082
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:34,360
You can choose to contact Tae-seo first.

3083
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:35,000
Okay.

3084
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,440
We'll talk later.

3085
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:36,830
Okay.

3086
02:06:36,830 --> 02:06:38,520
Okay, you mean

3087
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:39,680
I'm telling you now.

3088
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:40,670
I'm telling you clearly.

3089
02:06:40,670 --> 02:06:42,590
I'm between you and Tae-seo.

3090
02:06:42,590 --> 02:06:43,710
between you and Tae-seo.

3091
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:45,760
And you think I should stop

3092
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,680
I should

3093
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:48,240
I should contact Tae-seo for two days.

3094
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:49,920
I don't want to grill you anymore.

3095
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:50,680
Thank you.

3096
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:53,360
Is that what you really think?

3097
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:54,560
Yes.

3098
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:55,760
You're so cool.

3099
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:58,520
Because we talked a lot yesterday,

3100
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:01,240
So you chose two people.

3101
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:02,200
Which one do you like?

3102
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:04,670
instead of considering so many factors.

3103
02:07:04,670 --> 02:07:05,760
So I refuse you.

3104
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:06,360
including ignoring you.

3105
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:07,920
I face my heart.

3106
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:09,470
Because I was in that situation.

3107
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:10,720
But I don't regret it.

3108
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:13,880
So when I was packing,

3109
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:15,040
the more I collected it,

3110
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:17,040
I still can't regret it.

3111
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,110
I have to make it clear.

3112
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:21,440
Of course I respect his choice.

3113
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,960
I think this chat

3114
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,600
made me realize a new chubby guy.

3115
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,960
I think

3116
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:30,590
his charm in me

3117
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:33,630
in my heart.

3118
02:07:33,630 --> 02:07:34,880
Let's put aside the impression.

3119
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:36,990
but I think his charm has increased a lot.

3120
02:07:36,990 --> 02:07:38,800
She's very mature.

3121
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:39,920
and mature.

3122
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:42,320
I was really touched at that moment.

3123
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:43,280
But

3124
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:44,960
I want to calm myself down.

3125
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:47,440
Don't do anything

3126
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:48,830
anything impulsive.

3127
02:07:48,830 --> 02:07:50,750
So I think today is

3128
02:07:50,750 --> 02:07:52,120
sleepless night.

3129
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:53,150
I think

3130
02:07:53,150 --> 02:07:54,520
in my mind.

3131
02:08:31,230 --> 02:08:32,160
Actually, I've thought about it.

3132
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:33,440
or a girl.

3133
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:34,320
Just like Harry.

3134
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,350
But after thinking about it,

3135
02:08:36,350 --> 02:08:38,640
if I write about a girl,

3136
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:39,960
I might not come to Huahua.

3137
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:42,200
I think the more people write,

3138
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:44,480
the error rate will be higher.

3139
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:57,360
I bought some drinks today.

3140
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:58,680
I also prepared

3141
02:08:58,680 --> 02:09:00,350
My cat's signboard.

3142
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:01,840
Kitty.

3143
02:09:02,590 --> 02:09:03,710
I'd like to invite you

3144
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:05,520
to eat and drink together.

3145
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:07,040
and have fun chatting.

3146
02:09:24,510 --> 02:09:26,270
Tae-seo opens a romantic house today.

3147
02:09:26,270 --> 02:09:27,760
I think

3148
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,240
a proactive signal.

3149
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:30,590
Because I used to think

3150
02:09:30,590 --> 02:09:31,640
a little passive.

3151
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:33,040
But I think this is the initiative.

3152
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:35,230
To the romantic house?

3153
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:36,880
Sure.

3154
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:37,470
Okay.

3155
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:39,680
What are you doing?

3156
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:40,760
Have some fries.

3157
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:41,600
Let's go together.

3158
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:42,750
I want to go too.

3159
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:48,280
Good evening.

3160
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:49,880
Welcome.

3161
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,960
Three VIPs.

3162
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:52,830
Three.

3163
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:56,190
Welcome to the cat.

3164
02:09:57,790 --> 02:09:58,680
Didn't you see it?

3165
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,440
This is called "Drawing".

3166
02:10:02,750 --> 02:10:04,190
You even made a sign.

3167
02:10:04,190 --> 02:10:05,600
So sweet.

3168
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:06,590
Can I drink this?

3169
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:07,160
You can drink it all.

3170
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:08,080
I just made it.

3171
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:08,350
Really?

3172
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:09,470
Before you come.

3173
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:11,800
Good.

3174
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:17,720
Come on.

3175
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:20,600
The landlord starts the topic.

3176
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:23,960
What was your first impression of me?

3177
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:26,040
Huahua, Huahua first.

3178
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:28,400
So high.

3179
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:29,310
Yes.

3180
02:10:29,310 --> 02:10:31,000
I think you're taller than soup.

3181
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:31,840
Almost.

3182
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,470
10 points.

3183
02:10:33,470 --> 02:10:34,270
How many points?

3184
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:37,440
How much?

3185
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,230
How much did you give me?

3186
02:10:39,230 --> 02:10:40,510
I asked you first.

3187
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:42,800
7 to 8.

3188
02:10:43,230 --> 02:10:44,190
Seven to eight.

3189
02:10:44,830 --> 02:10:45,950
Is that so?

3190
02:10:45,950 --> 02:10:47,360
How many points?

3191
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:48,320
Not yet.

3192
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:52,800
Okay.

3193
02:10:53,470 --> 02:10:54,590
We have to keep getting to know him.

3194
02:10:58,200 --> 02:10:58,750
Okay.

3195
02:10:59,160 --> 02:10:59,550
What?

3196
02:10:59,550 --> 02:11:00,440
Go.

3197
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:01,760
Really? I don't want to know.

3198
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:02,200
I don't want to know.

3199
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:03,550
I flinch immediately

3200
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:10,590
Of course I'm unhappy after hearing it.

3201
02:11:10,590 --> 02:11:11,280
I think even if

3202
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:12,640
if you say more than eight,

3203
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,920
I think

3204
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:15,550
I've been with him for so long.

3205
02:11:15,550 --> 02:11:16,600
In his heart,

3206
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,480
in his heart,

3207
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:20,720
I think it's lower than I expected.

3208
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:24,350
I may have a long observation period

3209
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:25,880
for a long time.

3210
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:27,440
That's true

3211
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:28,560
in my heart.

3212
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,200
I gave her seven to eight points.

3213
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:30,960
Before,

3214
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:32,160
For example, before our first date,

3215
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:33,040
I might only get three points

3216
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:34,560
or four or five.

3217
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:35,390
Yes.

3218
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:37,360
The points are increasing.

3219
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:39,550
She didn't say it's going down.

3220
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:42,430
She might not be satisfied with the score.

3221
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:44,440
Then tell me.

3222
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,840
about 8.5 or 9.

3223
02:11:50,110 --> 02:11:51,070
I feel so bad right now.

3224
02:11:51,070 --> 02:11:52,480
Seven points.

3225
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:54,400
Six to seven, right?

3226
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,190
Seven to eight.

3227
02:11:56,190 --> 02:11:57,150
It's not that good.

3228
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:01,520
Because it's almost time.

3229
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:02,750
Not much.

3230
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:04,280
So do you think

3231
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:05,470
is necessary?

3232
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:07,230
Yes.

3233
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:10,680
We'll never see each other again.

3234
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:12,240
Although it's a long-distance place,

3235
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:13,440
I might go, right?

3236
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:14,680
You may also come to Shanghai.

3237
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:16,440
Me too.

3238
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:17,600
Come to Beijing later.

3239
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:19,070
Didn't you say you want to go to Beijing?

3240
02:12:19,070 --> 02:12:20,880
At least at this stage,

3241
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:23,800
we are getting along with each other.

3242
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:27,710
So you can

3243
02:12:27,710 --> 02:12:28,960
about age.

3244
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:31,520
I can go up about one round.

3245
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:32,190
Anything is fine.

3246
02:12:32,190 --> 02:12:34,680
But I can't be the next year.

3247
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:35,550
Really.

3248
02:12:35,550 --> 02:12:36,600
or a month.

3249
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:40,440
He is indeed one month younger than you.

3250
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:41,280
What about you?

3251
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:42,400
I'll know his age first

3252
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:43,360
before I contact him.

3253
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:44,760
Aren't you...

3254
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:45,150
Yes.

3255
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:46,240
I don't know now

3256
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:47,710
What if you find that you like him

3257
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:48,510
But he's younger than you.

3258
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:50,000
I'm praying not to.

3259
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:50,910
Okay.

3260
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:52,440
Where's Xiao Ling?

3261
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:54,560
The boys I met before are older than me.

3262
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:56,190
Can you accept younger ones?

3263
02:12:56,190 --> 02:12:57,520
I think this will be

3264
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:58,400
I need to think about.

3265
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:04,240
I can't be more than five years old.

3266
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:05,360
No more than five years old.

3267
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:05,840
Yes.

3268
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:07,160
I liked you when I was young.

3269
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:09,080
you would change.

3270
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:11,360
You can't be too big.

3271
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:13,790
Maybe within five years old.

3272
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:16,920
You broke up before.

3273
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:18,110
Do you know what it is?

3274
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:19,840
I dare not ask.

3275
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:24,440
The last one is the real reason.

3276
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:25,950
Because when you get old,

3277
02:13:25,950 --> 02:13:28,280
I may think about getting married.

3278
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:30,750
Maybe

3279
02:13:31,480 --> 02:13:32,670
her family doesn't like me very much.

3280
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:34,320
Before that,

3281
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:36,480
when I was young,

3282
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:37,840
I was impressed.

3283
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:40,600
We might quarrel a lot.

3284
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:41,630
And then?

3285
02:13:41,630 --> 02:13:44,120
But after the fight,

3286
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:45,280
this problem hasn't been solved.

3287
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:46,880
We broke up because we couldn't continue.

3288
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,080
So every time

3289
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:50,270
for a long time.

3290
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:55,960
In fact, my previous relationships

3291
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:59,120
with my heart every time.

3292
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:01,470
But there's no good result.

3293
02:14:01,470 --> 02:14:04,120
So I'm more pessimistic

3294
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:05,560
in love.

3295
02:14:06,430 --> 02:14:07,230
Actually, I always think

3296
02:14:07,230 --> 02:14:08,990
Bobo and I

3297
02:14:08,990 --> 02:14:10,560
were left behind.

3298
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:11,480
left again.

3299
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:11,920
Yes.

3300
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:13,120
So I don't contact Fatty anymore.

3301
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:13,470
No.

3302
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:14,720
I first met Fatty.

3303
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:16,120
Then he met Xiaoling.

3304
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:17,400
Did you contact Fatty first?

3305
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:18,520
Of course.

3306
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:20,190
On the third day,

3307
02:14:20,190 --> 02:14:20,960
Fatty will go on a date.

3308
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:21,950
Have contact?

3309
02:14:21,950 --> 02:14:22,640
Yes.

3310
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:24,640
Then on the fifth day, Tae-seo came in.

3311
02:14:25,150 --> 02:14:26,590
And then?

3312
02:14:26,590 --> 02:14:29,080
I was abandoned.

3313
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:30,880
Am I?

3314
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:32,190
So you contact me now

3315
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:34,640
because Xiaoling has a drawing in the house?

3316
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:35,600
The soup has Susu.

3317
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:36,920
Xinxin might...

3318
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:37,560
What's wrong?

3319
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,360
If I really like him, why can't I grab it?

3320
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:41,400
would you take it?

3321
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:42,400
Why not?

3322
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:42,960
Really?

3323
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:44,760
The feeling you gave me.

3324
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:45,520
I always

3325
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:47,520
I feel like

3326
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:48,880
Like what?

3327
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:49,720
To warm us up.

3328
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:50,750
I'm in a group again.

3329
02:14:50,750 --> 02:14:51,070
Yes.

3330
02:14:51,070 --> 02:14:52,190
And then it comes out.

3331
02:14:52,190 --> 02:14:54,520
to cherish each other.

3332
02:14:55,390 --> 02:14:56,400
Besides,

3333
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,160
because you gave me a mark, right?

3334
02:14:58,160 --> 02:14:59,840
You said you don't like me that much.

3335
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,950
But I did send you

3336
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:02,840
to you, right?

3337
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:04,480
Yes, they gave me their dates.

3338
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:05,470
So,

3339
02:15:05,470 --> 02:15:07,000
you want to

3340
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,240
to have a partner

3341
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:11,040
to have a partner?

3342
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:12,480
Dok-mi.

3343
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:13,400
Yes.

3344
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:15,200
That's what I mean.

3345
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:16,600
I don't have Dok-mi.

3346
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:18,200
What's there to explain?

3347
02:15:23,390 --> 02:15:24,280
I think

3348
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:26,240
I think his answer is quite clever.

3349
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:26,880
He said,

3350
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:28,000
if I really like someone,

3351
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,240
I can't take it?

3352
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:30,040
I feel that

3353
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:31,520
he is good to everyone.

3354
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:32,000
He just

3355
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,880
in me.

3356
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,030
It's not like

3357
02:15:36,030 --> 02:15:37,840
only interested in me.

3358
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:40,120
So I didn't answer him.

3359
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:41,360
with his answer.

3360
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:45,240
Let's go back.

3361
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:45,790
Go.

3362
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:51,160
How do you feel these days?

3363
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:53,400
I'm a little confused.

3364
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:55,360
Friendship or love?

3365
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:56,280
Friendship?

3366
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:56,670
Two days ago,

3367
02:15:56,670 --> 02:15:59,480
you had some problems with Fatty.

3368
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:00,990
He's my roommate.

3369
02:16:00,990 --> 02:16:02,110
I don't know

3370
02:16:02,110 --> 02:16:05,280
how to measure their relationship.

3371
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:06,910
Don't think too much.

3372
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:08,920
Let's look at it from another angle.

3373
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:09,840
Let me think.

3374
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,840
Just like this Guoli.

3375
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:13,200
and make new tricks.

3376
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:14,590
Try it.

3377
02:16:14,590 --> 02:16:15,360
Brave heart.

3378
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,320
This is for you.

3379
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:17,400
to make you braver.

3380
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:17,720
How is it?

3381
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:19,160
Drink this.

3382
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:19,840
Indeed.

3383
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:21,520
We have to face the problem bravely.

3384
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:22,000
Yes.

3385
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:22,840
There's no problem.

3386
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,960
It can't be solved by a fruit stand.

3387
02:16:25,950 --> 02:16:27,550
Cheers.

3388
02:16:27,550 --> 02:16:28,350
Brave man.

3389
02:16:28,350 --> 02:16:30,080
Let's enjoy the world.

3390
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:31,320
Cheers.

3391
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:01,559
I know it must be soup

3392
02:17:01,559 --> 02:17:02,840
I'd feel like

3393
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:04,350
I wonder what happened between us.

3394
02:17:04,350 --> 02:17:06,430
What does he want to tell me?

3395
02:17:13,950 --> 02:17:16,480
A House of Feelings.

3396
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:16,990
Good evening.

3397
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:19,070
Sorry, I'm late.

3398
02:17:19,070 --> 02:17:21,120
I couldn't find my phone.

3399
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:22,799
It's okay. I heard you were looking for it.

3400
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:28,830
I bought it for you.

3401
02:17:28,830 --> 02:17:29,760
Thank you.

3402
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:33,920
What's wrong?

3403
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:35,549
Nothing.

3404
02:17:35,549 --> 02:17:37,440
I want to give this to you.

3405
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,200
This is...

3406
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:42,750
I think we are too bored.

3407
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:44,719
If you're angry,

3408
02:17:44,719 --> 02:17:45,879
just slap it twice.

3409
02:17:45,879 --> 02:17:46,840
Put it on my bed.

3410
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:48,510
I knew I would come to you.

3411
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:51,520
Really?

3412
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:52,160
Okay.

3413
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:54,110
Can't I just slap you two first?

3414
02:17:56,879 --> 02:17:58,360
I don't know if it's in the house.

3415
02:17:58,360 --> 02:17:59,200
I'm afraid there's someone in your room.

3416
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:02,240
It's too cheesy to say it.

3417
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:03,389
I'm here to tell you.

3418
02:18:07,230 --> 02:18:08,120
Thank you.

3419
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:09,680
I'll hold it.

3420
02:18:11,959 --> 02:18:13,150
I think this is very useful.

3421
02:18:13,150 --> 02:18:15,070
Sometimes when I'm unhappy,

3422
02:18:15,070 --> 02:18:16,600
when I'm unhappy.

3423
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:17,440
I can

3424
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:19,070
as a bridge to communicate.

3425
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:21,360
I think it's quite cute.

3426
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:22,160
GOD Q

3427
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:22,719
House of Feelings.

3428
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:24,799
You always bring us lemon tea.

3429
02:18:25,719 --> 02:18:27,389
How much sugar does she want?

3430
02:18:27,389 --> 02:18:28,240
No.

3431
02:18:29,879 --> 02:18:30,840
Only for me. OK.

3432
02:18:32,030 --> 02:18:32,480
Su Zihao.

3433
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:33,719
has told me several times.

3434
02:18:33,719 --> 02:18:34,910
Why didn't you bring it to him?

3435
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:44,030
He took the initiative to ask me out

3436
02:18:44,030 --> 02:18:45,840
and became more careful.

3437
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:47,320
Because he ordered

3438
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:48,440
Lemon tea.

3439
02:18:48,440 --> 02:18:49,120
To him,

3440
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:50,910
for him.

3441
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:52,510
Great.

3442
02:18:52,510 --> 02:18:53,440
Very good.

3443
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:54,840
Keep up the good work.

3444
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:56,639
A House of Feelings.

3445
02:18:56,639 --> 02:18:57,840
Can we only take one?

3446
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:58,750
You can take two.

3447
02:18:59,549 --> 02:19:00,190
Hold it like this.

3448
02:19:00,670 --> 02:19:01,920
My wrist.

3449
02:19:02,879 --> 02:19:03,440
Like this.

3450
02:19:03,639 --> 02:19:05,200
Do you think you can do it on your own?

3451
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:05,790
Yes.

3452
02:19:05,790 --> 02:19:07,840
House of Feelings.

3453
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:11,360
House of Feelings.

3454
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:15,920
Strike in the middle.

3455
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:16,639
Close.

3456
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:20,240
The House of Feelings.

3457
02:19:39,799 --> 02:19:40,799
Go upstairs.

3458
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:42,480
What?

3459
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,280
Why do you want to come up there?

3460
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:54,760
Love tea.

3461
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:55,720
Have a seat.

3462
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:02,440
Have you talked to her?

3463
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:03,760
Have you decided to be friends?

3464
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:04,680
No.

3465
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:06,520
You two have solved the problem.

3466
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:08,440
you decide to continue to understand.

3467
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:10,320
No.

3468
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:12,320
Hello.

3469
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:13,920
So what?

3470
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:18,240
You're making me cry again.

3471
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:19,120
No.

3472
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:20,160
No.

3473
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:24,880
Well,

3474
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,000
You know,

3475
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:27,880
I can't say it.

3476
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:30,960
Good or bad.

3477
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:35,160
Well...

3478
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,280
What?

3479
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:44,200
Well...

3480
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:51,920
Didn't you cry yesterday?

3481
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:55,400
But...

3482
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:56,360
I didn't.

3483
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:58,600
I didn't hug you right away.

3484
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:05,680
You scared me.

3485
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:08,280
I think

3486
02:21:23,640 --> 02:21:24,280
Well...

3487
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:26,800
I think

3488
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:28,680
in my mind.

3489
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:30,120
No.

3490
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:35,600
No.

3491
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:37,200
Why are you crying?

3492
02:21:37,200 --> 02:21:37,600
No.

3493
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:40,760
I feel sorry for you.

3494
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:47,040
It's okay.

3495
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:48,200
You...

3496
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:50,600
But you cried because of me.

3497
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:51,960
So what?

3498
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:54,120
I don't know.

3499
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:57,880
I know you love me.

3500
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:02,760
Because I know that soup and Susu

3501
02:22:02,760 --> 02:22:04,360
might go to the House of Satisfaction.

3502
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:05,880
He said he wanted to talk.

3503
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:07,400
Then I guess

3504
02:22:07,400 --> 02:22:10,000
something bad happened.

3505
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,200
Is there any new problem?

3506
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:15,000
When they were talking,

3507
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:15,840
your eyes turned red.

3508
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:18,280
Then my eyes were filled with tears.

3509
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:20,280
and said he felt sorry for me.

3510
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:22,720
He said

3511
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,520
on someone else.

3512
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:25,240
Not me.

3513
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:26,560
he felt sorry for me.

3514
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:28,200
My first reaction was

3515
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:29,640
That's it.

3516
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:31,600
If I look back now,

3517
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:32,480
I can feel

3518
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:34,320
the soup didn't comfort me at the first time.

3519
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:35,120
His reaction

3520
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:37,000
he was stunned.

3521
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:41,440
and cried in front of him.

3522
02:22:41,440 --> 02:22:42,920
To be honest,

3523
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:45,200
The last time

3524
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:46,640
for almost ten years.

3525
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:52,920
I didn't expect

3526
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:54,880
I didn't expect that.

3527
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:56,400
My first reaction was an accident.

3528
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:58,320
But then I was very happy.

3529
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:00,480
I feel

3530
02:23:01,400 --> 02:23:03,600
I didn't take it seriously.

3531
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:04,920
This...

3532
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:06,640
The way we get along

3533
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:08,720
is like this.

3534
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:09,680
No.

3535
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:14,120
You can't do it.

3536
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:25,760
Do you want to see

3537
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:27,200
how happy your sister is now?

3538
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:30,880
It's okay.

3539
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:36,800
Don't cry.

3540
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:39,160
Men don't cry easily.

3541
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:40,520
Wipe it.

3542
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:47,200
It's okay.

3543
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:48,120
I...

3544
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:51,840
I'm sorry.

3545
02:23:52,480 --> 02:23:53,200
Why are you sorry?

3546
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,720
You think the first reaction

3547
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:56,720
to hug me,

3548
02:23:56,720 --> 02:23:57,440
and told me

3549
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,000
"Don't cry."

3550
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,640
to stop crying?

3551
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:00,600
But...

3552
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:02,280
Think about it.

3553
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:04,240
the way we usually get along?

3554
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:08,800
Others do that.

3555
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,960
Is what others do right?

3556
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,440
No.

3557
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:13,800
I don't know

3558
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:15,360
why I did that.

3559
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:19,720
I think it's quite normal.

3560
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:21,880
We're not that close.

3561
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:24,000
It doesn't mean we're not close.

3562
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,080
or something else.

3563
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:27,520
It's not any sign.

3564
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:29,080
If you make us so clingy,

3565
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:30,640
I'm not used to it.

3566
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:31,600
And I think...

3567
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:36,200
But I feel guilty.

3568
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:38,880
Then play with me more every day.

3569
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:44,400
It's okay.

3570
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:47,000
Because the way we get along

3571
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,080
many people may think

3572
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:49,840
you don't interact much.

3573
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:50,760
You don't talk much.

3574
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:53,240
You only send messages three or four times a month.

3575
02:24:53,240 --> 02:24:56,920
But this is how we get along.

3576
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:58,400
Since college,

3577
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:00,080
we've been staying at home every holiday,

3578
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:02,440
but I didn't feel like

3579
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:03,520
like this.

3580
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:05,120
We've been together for so many days.

3581
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:07,120
we can see each other during the day and night.

3582
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:15,160
Xiao Ling is so fierce.

3583
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:17,120
I'm afraid Xiao Ling will fall out.

3584
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:24,760
When will you comfort me?

3585
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:26,480
You never cried at my place.

3586
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:27,440
Cry and let me see.

3587
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:28,560
I'll comfort you.

3588
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:29,680
I'll punch you.

3589
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:33,000
Are you okay?

3590
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:33,680
I'm fine.

3591
02:25:50,480 --> 02:25:51,560
It's okay.

3592
02:25:57,840 --> 02:25:59,840
If we talk like this today,

3593
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:02,920
I don't think

3594
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:04,120
since college.

3595
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:05,880
Now you want me to remember

3596
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:07,000
what it is to cry because of me.

3597
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,760
I might not remember.

3598
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:09,000
Yes.

3599
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,480
So he suddenly came here today.

3600
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:11,280
I will...

3601
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:13,160
OK.

3602
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:13,960
Not bad.

3603
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:14,240
Yeah.

3604
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:15,680
I'm happy.

3605
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:22,440
Actually, I'm having a hard time staying in this room.

3606
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:27,840
In this room,

3607
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,120
in this room.

3608
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:32,880
So I want

3609
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:34,360
what I want the most.

3610
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:38,040
But I think everyone is different from me.

3611
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:39,880
So what?

3612
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:44,280
But I think I'm the only one

3613
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:47,200
in this room.

3614
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:50,880
I'll tell you my real thoughts.

3615
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:52,320
It's fine if you're angry.

3616
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:53,440
But I think

3617
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:55,800
a little boy now.

3618
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:58,280
But I think it's normal.

3619
02:26:58,280 --> 02:27:00,120
Because you're a university student now.

3620
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:03,880
You're still in school.

3621
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:04,880
So I think

3622
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:07,440
I'm a little boy. So what?

3623
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:12,080
Yeah, but I think I need to improve.

3624
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:13,600
But I don't know

3625
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:17,000
I should

3626
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,280
I'm going to break through what I'm suffering.

3627
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:21,400
I'll just let it be.

3628
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:23,640
But I'm contradicted every day.

3629
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:25,320
From your point of view,

3630
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:27,640
you wouldn't want these problems

3631
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:28,600
to bother you again and again.

3632
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:30,200
So you will

3633
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:31,400
to solve it.

3634
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:32,920
Your subconscious

3635
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:35,080
will help you solve this problem.

3636
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:36,440
So my suggestion is

3637
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:38,520
Okay, you've realized the problem.

3638
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:39,320
Next,

3639
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:40,480
in the future,

3640
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:43,280
you can try to think from different angles.

3641
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:45,280
But you can try.

3642
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,360
If you're still sick,

3643
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:47,400
then return it completely.

3644
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:48,120
It doesn't matter at all.

3645
02:27:48,120 --> 02:27:49,840
Because it can't be done at once.

3646
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:52,040
I've always been like this.

3647
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:54,640
You won't.

3648
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:56,360
If you're always like this,

3649
02:27:56,360 --> 02:27:58,240
you'll face more problems.

3650
02:27:58,800 --> 02:27:59,760
What should we do?

3651
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:00,680
If you encounter more problems,

3652
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:02,120
I'll force you.

3653
02:28:02,120 --> 02:28:02,920
You have to change.

3654
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:04,960
So you have to change.

3655
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:05,600
Do you think

3656
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:08,440
I think even if you don't change yourself,

3657
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:09,880
you will be forced to change.

3658
02:28:09,880 --> 02:28:11,280
You'll be forced to grow up.

3659
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:12,960
So I think it's not a bad thing

3660
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:14,280
is not a bad thing.

3661
02:28:14,280 --> 02:28:16,480
Just like you cried again today.

3662
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:21,160
So when you encounter problems,

3663
02:28:21,160 --> 02:28:23,120
You will encounter the problems you should encounter.

3664
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:26,240
You have a storm, so do I.

3665
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,800
Everyone has a storm.

3666
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:28,760
What is a storm?

3667
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:32,360
What's the sudden emotional cover?

3668
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:33,120
That kind of thing

3669
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:36,480
I'm saving up

3670
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:38,280
to a certain extent.

3671
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:39,440
I used to save up.

3672
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:40,640
But now I think

3673
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:41,120
that

3674
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:42,320
If I think

3675
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:43,760
I might not be able to take this anymore.

3676
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:44,880
I can't hold it anymore.

3677
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:46,520
Then I'll tell Tom or Xinxin

3678
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:47,400
or tell anyone.

3679
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:49,160
Yes.

3680
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:50,080
Okay.

3681
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:51,240
Come to me more often.

3682
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:53,400
I haven't met 100 percent yet.

3683
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:54,200
It's something

3684
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:56,000
that you need to know right away.

3685
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:56,680
How about this?

3686
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:58,840
If it exceeds 30 percent,

3687
02:28:58,840 --> 02:28:59,760
I'll come to you.

3688
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:01,760
Then you come to me

3689
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:02,520
you came to me.

3690
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:10,440
I think he has heard it.

3691
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:11,680
Because he is

3692
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:12,800
a serious person.

3693
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:13,760
I'll tell him at the end.

3694
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:15,480
Come on, let's throw the slippers down.

3695
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:17,000
I'll throw them first.

3696
02:29:19,480 --> 02:29:20,400
I want to go down first.

3697
02:29:28,480 --> 02:29:30,120
You need to raise your butt.

3698
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:35,480
Why are you so stiff?

3699
02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:38,920
Because your weight will be bigger.

3700
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:40,080
so your butt will be hurt.

3701
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:46,560
Normally,

3702
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:48,360
he would never do this with me.

3703
02:29:48,360 --> 02:29:50,360
I think this is a good start.

3704
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:51,560
So it's a good thing.

3705
02:30:01,800 --> 02:30:03,200
I haven't heard this voice for a long time.

3706
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:09,440
What?

3707
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:10,240
What's wrong?

3708
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:12,200
We're going to Tianjin.

3709
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:18,320
This weekend is a two-day trip.

3710
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:19,440
The destination is Tianjin.

3711
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,560
Next, choose the room

3712
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:25,000
the room.

3713
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:26,840
suite.

3714
02:30:26,840 --> 02:30:27,440
We're the same.

3715
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:29,720
Maybe

3716
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:31,400
some new stories.

3717
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:34,640
We're at the beach.

3718
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:36,920
Why are you so good-looking?

3719
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:40,360
I feel very happy.

3720
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:41,320
and happy.

3721
02:30:41,360 --> 02:30:42,200
Let's take a photo.

3722
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:43,760
This is good.

3723
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:45,280
represents my unknown love.

3724
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:47,640
Unknown love.

3725
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:49,520
I feel like I'm declaring the sovereignty.

3726
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:50,880
Sit with my sister.

3727
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,040
I dare to sit here.

3728
02:30:55,640 --> 02:30:56,480
I'm scared.

3729
02:30:56,480 --> 02:30:57,680
Why are you so handsome even when you're scared?

3730
02:30:57,680 --> 02:30:58,880
I'll be there at any time.

3731
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:12,680
Every Thursday at 18:00 p.m. Members will enjoy the reproduction of "Sibling Defense Diaries".

3732
