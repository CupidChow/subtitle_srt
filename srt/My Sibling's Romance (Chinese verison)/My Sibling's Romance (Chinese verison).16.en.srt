1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,240
Gather around.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,400
Let's go.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,280
Let's go.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,560
Susu, Tata.

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,680
Coming.

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,840
Tata, did you give the invitation card?

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,480
I did.

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,240
Who did you give it to?

9
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,120
Harry.

10
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,760
Do you have two?

11
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,720
How many?

12
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,600
One.

13
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,000
But I gave it to her.

14
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
They're done. Let's go out.

15
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,880
Bye.

16
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,480
We have six left.

17
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,440
Harry, are you sure to give it to Xinxin?

18
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,600
Harry is for Esther.

19
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,440
So Harry chose Xinxin.

20
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,640
He didn't choose Tata.

21
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,240
When I went out,

22
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,920
I found out

23
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,440
Harry has an invitation card too.

24
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,640
and sent it to Xinxin.

25
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,240
I've already admitted

26
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,680
I formed a team with Harry.

27
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,880
I'm a little surprised.

28
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,560
Just the four of us.

29
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,480
Just the two of us.

30
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:43,800
Okay.

31
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,960
Can I?

32
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,520
Yes.

33
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's go.

34
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,120
It's easy.

35
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,040
Let's go.

36
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,440
This is our first group trip.

37
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,280
Everyone.

38
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

39
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,880
Yes.

40
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Let's go.

41
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,239
Here we are.

42
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,800
Let's go.

43
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,720
The Avengers attack!

44
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,880
Go, go, go.

45
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,440
Snow!

46
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,600
Don't fall.

47
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,120
It's easy to get physical contact if it's so slippery.

48
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,560
They have unique skills.

49
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,600
You scared me.

50
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,840
Help me.

51
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,000
So scary.

52
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
Be careful.

53
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,759
I can't stand a slight fall.

54
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,320
Really.

55
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,039
Brother

56
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:38,680
Get lost.

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,880
Slow down.

58
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,840
The Avengers.

59
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,000
Hua, be careful.

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm fine.

61
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,320
Help me.

62
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Really hold it

63
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,280
It's true to fall here.

64
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,640
I...

65
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,200
Hello, Xiao Niao.

66
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,000
No.

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,040
They are the funniest.

68
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,600
Let me tell you.

69
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
his chassis are too high.

70
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,079
I'm so scared.

71
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,600
My bones are crispy.

72
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
Let me help you.

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,240
How about this way?

74
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,920
The snow with traces won't slide.

75
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,480
Our Guoli.

76
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,240
(We joined hands with Weibo)

77
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,360
on Weibo.

78
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,800
the "Ice and Snow" activity.

79
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,440
We've gathered

80
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,320
(on Weibo.)

81
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,640
Ice Snow Sports.

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,320
I hope the guests

83
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,160
in the snow world.

84
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,160
There's a text.

85
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,760
Got it?

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,240
Yes.

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,240
To members of the house.

88
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,920
The five groups

89
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,560
will be determined through different projects.

90
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,840
the team with the highest points.

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,560
Friendship first.

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,640
No, competition first.

93
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,800
Friendship comes first.

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,000
Competition first.

95
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,320
Friendship second.

96
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,600
Let's set the rules first.

97
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,000
Because if we

98
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,040
If we battle in two pairs,

99
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,400
there will be an extra pair.

100
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,440
Let's do this.

101
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,400
Rock, paper, scissors.

102
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Whoever wins will be left out.

103
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,200
If you win, you can choose to play or advance directly.

104
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,280
Okay.

105
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,800
Rock, paper, scissors.

106
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,240
Rock, paper, scissors.

107
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,760
Rock, paper, scissors.

108
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,079
Scissors.

109
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,800
It's okay.

110
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,240
We won.

111
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,200
The power of a birthday girl

112
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,200
Drive slowly.

113
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,680
We're not in a hurry.

114
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,920
We don't need to win.

115
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,440
Do you want to win?

116
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,160
No.

117
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,080
That's impossible. No.

118
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,800
You're an athlete.

119
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,880
How could you not want to win?

120
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,120
I'm not strong.

121
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,760
I'm afraid of death.

122
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,200
I think I will win.

123
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,720
So confident?

124
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,520
Just kidding.

125
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Let's go faster.

126
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,120
Slow down.

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,760
Slowly.

128
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,240
Okay.

129
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,600
I don't want to win.

130
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:18,920
Okay.

131
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,000
They look great together.

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,040
Couple shirts.

133
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Yes, their clothes.

134
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,480
Come on, soup.

135
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,320
Let's go.

136
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,320
I want to go home.

137
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,640
Trust my driving skills.

138
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,440
You can do it.

139
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,720
From here to here.

140
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,800
Just one circle?

141
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,760
One or two?

142
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Two circles.

143
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Be careful.

144
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,360
We'll win if we get here as soon as possible.

145
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,520
Okay, referee.

146
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,400
Don't hit the car.

147
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,840
Go!

148
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,840
Go!

149
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
So fierce.

150
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,960
Wait.

151
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,640
Good luck, Soup.

152
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm scared.

153
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,000
that love will warm up in this environment.

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,720
Yes.

155
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,960
Be careful.

156
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
The map seems quite strong.

157
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
I've never seen him so manly.

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,240
Mom.

159
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,600
We won!

160
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,720
The Avengers!

161
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
Run!

162
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,840
This is very manly.

163
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,240
and drifting.

164
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
I just...

165
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,640
When he started,

166
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,960
I'll step on it to the end.

167
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,120
Come on, get in.

168
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,159
Let's go.

169
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,040
To be honest, I'm scared.

170
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,520
Ready.

171
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Go.

172
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,240
It's a sense of rules.

173
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's go outside.

174
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,480
You've really made a big circle.

175
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,760
Make the biggest circle.

176
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
Round?

177
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,840
We'll definitely lose if we try our best.

178
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,760
You're right.

179
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,560
It's really fun.

180
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,320
This.

181
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
We're overtaken.

182
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,000
Fatty.

183
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,200
Safety first.

184
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,080
The road is too rough.

185
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,720
Slow down.

186
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,920
I think we won too easily.

187
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,880
They're already behind.

188
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,600
Yes.

189
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,280
Just don't drop me.

190
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,040
No.

191
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,840
Victory is

192
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,680
is easy to get.

193
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,159
The red car is the top.

194
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,720
Okay.

195
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,440
It's so cold.

196
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,920
Do we have a final round?

197
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,440
Let's...

198
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,760
The final round.

199
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,320
You do it.

200
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,240
Let's change a car.

201
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,760
Or...

202
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,320
Okay.

203
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,560
We decide to drive a car for the final.

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,000
OK.

205
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,120
The four of us will have a car race.

206
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,880
Sure.

207
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
Shouldn't the final be with us?

208
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,120
Yes, the final is ours.

209
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Not yet.

210
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,920
After the meeting,

211
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,440
Okay.

212
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,120
I'll shout.

213
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,640
Let's go.

214
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,360
Xiao Ling, come on!

215
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,520
Xiao Ling is so fierce.

216
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm afraid Xiaoling will fall out.

217
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,520
Fatty.

218
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,760
Fatty looks like a big crab.

219
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,440
Slow down.

220
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,000
Come on, Tata.

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
I'll go first.

222
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,040
The map is really for fun.

223
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,560
Yes.

224
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,160
It's stuck.

225
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,280
You're strong.

226
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,440
You're the first.

227
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,800
The one who can't drive is the strongest.

228
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,760
You're too strong.

229
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,720
And you drive very well.

230
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,080
You know?

231
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,440
I'm about to fly.

232
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,120
It's the steadiest.

233
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,480
So you're a racer.

234
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,320
Fly like this from now on.

235
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,640
Why are you so good?

236
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,400
I don't know how to drive.

237
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,120
That's why I'm strong.

238
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,480
Really all-rounder, right?

239
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,200
Come on.

240
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,640
The final is coming.

241
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,840
One-on-one first.

242
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,600
Boys and boys.

243
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,640
Girls and girls.

244
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:02,920
Okay.

245
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,680
My red horse will have to fight with you.

246
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,760
Go!

247
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,960
Come on.

248
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,240
Fatty, come on.

249
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,600
Stop flipping.

250
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,440
Xiao Ling is so cool.

251
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,040
Xiao Ling's charm has increased.

252
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,920
Come on, the final round.

253
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,360
Let me do it.

254
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,120
What is this?

255
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
Yu Shi versus Dilraba?

256
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,240
Go.

257
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,640
Grab your track.

258
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,960
Where is Tae-ri?

259
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,920
Did he go home?

260
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,720
Xiao Ling is so fierce.

261
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,640
Xiao Ling is really good at riding.

262
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,400
Amazing.

263
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,640
She's amazing.

264
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,400
I must take a photo.

265
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,320
Awesome.

266
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,880
Come on.

267
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,120
We're going to win.

268
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,880
I'm so happy.

269
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,760
Happy.

270
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
Awesome.

271
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,400
Dilraba is better than Yu Shi.

272
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,560
Really.

273
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,040
This is so professional.

274
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,600
See?

275
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,360
What do you mean?

276
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,320
Come to our second project.

277
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,640
Let's go.

278
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Let's go over there.

279
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,600
Don't fall.

280
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,120
Slow down.

281
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,680
Okay.

282
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,720
Slide from above.

283
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,640
The one who slips to the farthest wins.

284
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,880
There are five tracks.

285
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,320
Boys have a round.

286
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,240
Then the girls will compete.

287
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,520
and the final round.

288
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,320
Xiaoling, I brought you a bigger one.

289
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,360
Okay, thank you.

290
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,920
I'll do it.

291
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,520
I can do this.

292
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,360
Don't fall down.

293
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,000
Okay.

294
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,680
Pull it up.

295
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
I've never played this before.

296
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,240
This must be fun.

297
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,080
Let me help you.

298
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,440
It's okay. Let me do it.

299
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,280
It's okay. I can do it. Go get yours.

300
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Try it first.

301
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,320
Try it.

302
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,440
Wait.

303
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,360
Help me.

304
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
Help me.

305
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,440
Harry.

306
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,640
I've never

307
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,120
such a funny thing in my life.

308
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,960
Help me.

309
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,800
Somebody help me

310
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,800
Come on.

311
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,040
Try it, OK?

312
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,800
Not bad.

313
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,680
It won't go far.

314
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,160
Okay, the first team is out.

315
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,400
I pushed you.

316
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,840
I pushed you to that floor. Did you see that?

317
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,240
I'm scared. Don't do this.

318
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,040
Okay.

319
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
Hold these two sides.

320
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
Tata, go.

321
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,320
Do you want to win?

322
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,800
No.

323
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,240
Do you want to win?

324
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,680
No.

325
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't want to wrestle.

326
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,120
Harry, are you going to kick Xinxin out?

327
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,320
I'm so scared.

328
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
Are you going to shoot it?

329
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
I'm scared.

330
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,280
So gentle.

331
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,360
Soup.

332
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,680
He's so gentle.

333
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,960
No, I have to push harder.

334
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,840
No, I'm scared.

335
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,280
You didn't even debut.

336
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,720
The track is not out.

337
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,840
Okay, don't move. The second one.

338
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,080
Kick it down.

339
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,840
One kick.

340
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,880
Do you hate Xinxin?

341
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,280
She's still inside.

342
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,520
It's useless.

343
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,400
Come on, let's...

344
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,600
You did it ruthlessly.

345
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,160
Yes.

346
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,560
We seem to be the best.

347
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,720
Hua.

348
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,680
What do you mean?

349
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,600
Don't move.

350
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,720
Okay, don't move.

351
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,080
Next.

352
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,960
I'm ready.

353
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,880
Why should I turn?

354
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,760
How do I turn?

355
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,440
Oh no, it's slanted.

356
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,120
The curve of her track

357
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,200
Good.

358
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,000
We have a chance.

359
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,640
We're in second place.

360
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,440
As champions,

361
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,280
we must show you

362
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,640
I'm a little scared.

363
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,200
Here.

364
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,000
Watch your feet.

365
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,680
She's the first and I'm the second.

366
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,120
Four, five.

367
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,000
The soup.

368
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,560
How do I get down?

369
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,440
I'll save me like Harry did just now.

370
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,320
I'll push you.

371
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,720
What?

372
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,320
I'll push you.

373
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,160
Okay.

374
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,480
Why are you a little heavy?

375
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,120
Can you move forward?

376
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,320
Let's go.

377
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,680
OK. Three, two, one.

378
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,120
Why are you so slow?

379
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,720
It's stuck.

380
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,640
We saw you move.

381
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,080
Move on your own.

382
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,040
We saw it.

383
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,320
Don't move.

384
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,440
Cheating.

385
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,320
Show us the face brake.

386
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,839
This is good.

387
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,920
Help me.

388
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,200
So far.

389
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,480
You're still moving.

390
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,520
No need.

391
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,080
Trust me, Tata.

392
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,040
Come on.

393
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,840
Tata is a very serious girl

394
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,280
and responds.

395
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,040
She looked up immediately.

396
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,000
The moment her heart flutters.

397
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
They were very young.

398
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,960
Yeah.

399
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,920
He's so passionate.

400
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,720
Really.

401
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,120
Trust me, Tata.

402
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,720
The map stood on the slope

403
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,680
and yelled at me.

404
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,240
He said, "Trust me, Tata."

405
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,680
He'll do his best

406
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,440
to make me believe that he will win the first place.

407
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,680
His behavior touched me.

408
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,280
Because I'm not a person

409
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,240
who would express his emotions.

410
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,600
I think he's cute.

411
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,240
His legs are too long.

412
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
You can't lie down.

413
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,680
Go.

414
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,400
I'll push you first.

415
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:13,960
Then you push me.

416
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,720
Okay.

417
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,560
Okay, come on.

418
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,960
Come on.

419
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,560
An old man came down.

420
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,480
Grandpa

421
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,800
Move.

422
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,520
Your butt.

423
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,480
Move.

424
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,640
More than soup.

425
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,880
Your butt.

426
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,120
You can't do this.

427
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,280
It's the finale.

428
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,640
Don't destroy the props.

429
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,520
Let's go.

430
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,320
Why doesn't it feel like falling?

431
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,120
Don't get stuck in the middle of the slope.

432
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,440
Is it stuck?

433
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,840
It's stuck.

434
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,840
It's stuck.

435
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,600
Okay.

436
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,960
It's stuck.

437
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,080
The map.

438
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,120
Drawing! Drawing!

439
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,680
He's using his hands.

440
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,400
Good, second.

441
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,880
Good.

442
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,880
You can use your hands.

443
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,120
You've voted for him.

444
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,160
You're not as fast as him.

445
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,680
Who's the first?

446
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,360
You were the first.

447
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,080
I was the first.

448
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,480
She was the first and I was the second.

449
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,120
We are the third.

450
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,160
They should be number one.

451
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,480
They always get the first place.

452
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,960
Trust me, Tata.

453
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,080
Right?

454
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,680
So passionate.

455
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,600
The charm points of sports

456
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,120
more charm.

457
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,080
Yes.

458
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,040
I can tell from the game

459
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,280
some boys have different personalities.

460
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,840
Harry is naughty.

461
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,880
A flying kick kicked a girl out.

462
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,600
I have to play with him.

463
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,920
If it were me, I would be very angry.

464
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,040
Because when I was scared,

465
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,480
he kicked me again.

466
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,600
Yes.

467
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,080
Yes.

468
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,880
I will be very angry.

469
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,720
Yes.

470
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,680
The soup was gentle.

471
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,760
He pushed Susu down gently.

472
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,040
Yes.

473
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,760
What about the boys?

474
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,920
When you are in love,

475
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,160
when you are in love?

476
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,360
I think it depends on this girl.

477
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,840
You need to know more about her.

478
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840
You know what she likes

479
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,240
is to cooperate.

480
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
What about you?

481
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,520
It's weird to say I'm gentle.

482
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,720
We agree.

483
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,000
Agree.

484
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,760
Totally agree.

485
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,440
He's gentle.

486
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,080
Huang Hongfan must be

487
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,920
naughty.

488
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Yes, naughty.

489
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,000
He's the happy type.

490
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,040
Just kidding.

491
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,880
I'll kick you out.

492
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,400
I will

493
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,440
their feelings.

494
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,520
and

495
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,320
Borderline.

496
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,600
All kinds of things.

497
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,040
But under such conditions,

498
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,240
then kick it away.

499
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,360
The boys will announce their scores.

500
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,080
Three points for our team.

501
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,600
Awesome.

502
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,240
I think I can feel

503
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
what I feel

504
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,200
more joy.

505
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,560
Because we just focus on playing.

506
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,760
We had fun.

507
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,560
This is what I feel the most.

508
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,520
Harry.

509
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,760
Five points.

510
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,560
I think he did a good job

511
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,240
in the sports day.

512
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,760
And he's very considerate.

513
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,920
He's been blocking the wind by my side.

514
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,880
We got five points too.

515
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,080
Awesome.

516
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,000
I think there will be sparks

517
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,320
I think there will be sparks.

518
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Because we are

519
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,960
moving forward for the same goal.

520
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,560
And we went up to get the tires together.

521
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,240
He's afraid I can't carry it.

522
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,000
He will take the initiative to carry two hands.

523
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,960
Like this.

524
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,960
Five points.

525
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,400
He's quite careful with the soup.

526
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,840
Because today's ice noodles are slippery,

527
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,800
as long as I'm walking,

528
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,400
he kept reminding me

529
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,720
to be careful not to fall.

530
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,920
When I fell down,

531
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,000
when I fell down.

532
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,880
I think

533
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,120
he's quite considerate.

534
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,840
The soup is gentle.

535
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,960
Nine points for our team.

536
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,680
The winner today is Tata.

537
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,360
or the map?

538
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,000
No, we worked together.

539
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,240
I'm very happy.

540
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,560
Because I think

541
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,280
work together.

542
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,560
We did a great job.

543
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,120
Thank you.

544
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
It suits me now.

545
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,600
It feels like a campus relationship.

546
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,960
It's the first time I've played this kind of ice project.

547
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,640
I feel very fresh.

548
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,840
And with the map,

549
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,680
He worked so hard

550
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,720
to win the first place.

551
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,240
The feeling of winning the first place.

552
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,440
The whole process is very happy.

553
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,080
The winner gets the mission card.

554
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,920
Congratulations.

555
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,520
You're the most valuable team member

556
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,280
of winter festival.

557
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,360
You'll become the king of the little house.

558
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,720
and enjoy two liters of clothes.

559
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,960
A sip of fruit juice wine.

560
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,560
You can appoint a male member

561
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,680
to make a non-date request.

562
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,600
You can't refuse the designated ones.

563
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Invite him to lift the fruit jar together

564
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,440
and complete the assignment.

565
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,080
The designated ones

566
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,400
needs to complete the requirements within 12 hours.

567
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,040
It means she can ask others to do something.

568
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,640
I've decided to give this grapefruit-flavored fruit jar

569
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,840
to you.

570
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,600
A map.

571
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,640
You worked too hard, right?

572
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,280
Yes, Tu is tired today.

573
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,160
Yes.

574
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,520
I'll think about

575
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,040
I'll think about it and tell you.

576
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,600
Okay.

577
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,440
Let's take a photo together.

578
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,000
Hua is helping her brother.

579
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,920
Yes.

580
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,040
One, two, three.

581
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,560
I'm so happy. I'm back.

582
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,760
We're finally here.

583
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,880
We're home.

584
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,840
I caught a wild one today.

585
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,720
Slow down.

586
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,160
I caught a wild girl today.

587
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,920
Xiaoling became more cheerful.

588
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Yes.

589
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,000
It's so comfortable at home.

590
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,480
Where is my little kitty?

591
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,000
Mimi.

592
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,760
Have you lost weight?

593
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,440
You look

594
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,320
You even lost weight. I think it ate too much.

595
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
I'm going down.

596
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,600
Okay.

597
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,040
Do you want it?

598
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,880
No.

599
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,600
I'm going to eat dinner later.

600
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,640
She's going to cook noodles later.

601
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,120
It's our turn today.

602
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,520
Yes.

603
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,360
When I came back,

604
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,800
The floor was slippery.

605
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,400
I almost fell over there.

606
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,760
Then he came to catch me.

607
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,560
I did stand firm.

608
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,600
He fell down.

609
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,120
Soup?

610
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,880
He...

611
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,880
Then he asked me to cook him a bowl of noodles.

612
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,080
Then I said, "I'll eat a bowl of noodles."

613
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,560
She told me that's all you can do.

614
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,360
Are you hungry?

615
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,320
I'm fine.

616
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,680
You're not hungry?

617
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,280
I didn't eat this morning.

618
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,480
I think I can eat this bowl of noodles now.

619
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,560
I'll cook it now.

620
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,840
Anyone wants instant noodles?

621
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,680
Are you going to make instant noodles?

622
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,560
Me too.

623
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,760
Do you want some? I'll cook for you.

624
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,080
Why would he cook for me?

625
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,440
Harry cooked it for me.

626
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,120
So I made two packs.

627
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,960
I'll cook for someone.

628
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,680
Cook for Xinxin.

629
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,720
No, Tu and Xinxin.

630
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,320
I'll cook for them. I don't want to eat.

631
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,000
You're betrayed.

632
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,200
No, I'm not eating.

633
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,080
I'm just doing you a favor.

634
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,640
It seems to be unstable.

635
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,920
Yes, it's a bit unstable.

636
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,200
I'll do it. You go.

637
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,920
You have to live up to your bottom.

638
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,560
I am.

639
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,520
I think if you don't cook well,

640
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,200
I feel sorry for it.

641
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,600
Not only that,

642
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,560
but also your stomach.

643
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,480
Yes.

644
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,360
Why is someone cooking with sunglasses on?

645
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,440
Take it off.

646
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,760
Cool.

647
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,600
Unfortunately, the person I want to show is not here.

648
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,080
I'm hungry.

649
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,320
Xin, what do you want to add?

650
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,560
What?

651
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,400
Did you cook it for me?

652
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,840
We're helping you.

653
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,000
Can't you tell?

654
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,640
No.

655
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,160
It's hard for you, right?

656
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,720
Let me tell you.

657
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,640
People need to grow in training.

658
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,080
Is it mine?

659
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,720
There's a picture.

660
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,960
Fatty is helping her.

661
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,720
Yes.

662
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,680
Not the only one.

663
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,760
Eat them all.

664
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,160
This is delicious.

665
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,320
Eat this first.

666
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,760
Look.

667
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,400
We shared it.

668
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,640
Why didn't you share it with him

669
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,320
Oppa said you guys eat

670
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,800
Is the noodles ready

671
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,040
I'll eat a little.

672
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,080
Then...

673
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,080
Map.

674
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,840
Give some to Susu.

675
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,880
Okay, I got it.

676
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,640
I can't eat that much.

677
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,080
Let's put it on first.

678
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,840
Okay.

679
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,560
Whose bowl is this?

680
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,480
Yours.

681
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,440
So many.

682
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,480
Thank you, Chef.

683
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,920
Ling'er, why do you have such a big bowl?

684
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Fatty got it for me.

685
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,520
Who cooked this for you?

686
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,480
Fatty.

687
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,280
He's afraid she can't eat enough.

688
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,520
Xin is helping her brother.

689
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,760
Yes.

690
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,160
Map.

691
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,200
Hurry.

692
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,640
Wait. Let go.

693
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,880
Give this to Tata.

694
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,280
I'll cook it for you.

695
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,520
Excuse me.

696
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,040
Let Tata eat first.

697
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,200
I'll cook it.

698
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,320
Tata.

699
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,840
Who's calling me?

700
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,760
Do you want noodles?

701
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Put it on.

702
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,680
No.

703
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,800
I don't need it now.

704
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,920
No, I have to go out later.

705
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,880
You're going out?

706
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,920
Have a bite.

707
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,960
It's ready.

708
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,240
Really?

709
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,640
Yes.

710
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,040
Okay.

711
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Harry and others just made it. You eat first.

712
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,080
What about you?

713
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,760
You gave it to someone else.

714
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,360
I did.

715
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,360
Don't ask me to cook for you anymore.

716
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,360
What's wrong?

717
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
My heart was broken.

718
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,000
I cooked for him and he gave it to someone else.

719
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,640
He gave it to Tata.

720
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,280
He borrowed the flower to present the Buddha.

721
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,600
I gave the map to Tata.

722
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,200
What do you want? You eat hang noodles.

723
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,880
I want to eat more.

724
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,800
Don't.

725
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,880
Let's have dinner later.

726
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,160
I want to eat too.

727
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,480
Okay.

728
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,480
Just say it doesn't taste good.

729
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,520
It's okay.

730
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,440
I'm not full.

731
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,960
Hua has been serving you.

732
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,920
Huahua is so considerate.

733
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,040
Here.

734
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Don't feed Xiao Ling too much tonight.

735
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,560
Call Terri.

736
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,040
Go get him. It'll get soggy.

737
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,280
Tae-seo.

738
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,560
What?

739
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,200
I cooked yours.

740
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,760
I cooked yours. Have a bite.

741
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,640
Eat.

742
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,360
It's not spicy.

743
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:39,960
Yes.

744
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,120
Sure.

745
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,880
Is it good, Xiao Ling?

746
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,720
Yes.

747
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,840
Is Tae-ri good?

748
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,200
It's good.

749
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,000
It's so delicious.

750
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
Can we play games? Is there enough people?

751
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,080
Yes.

752
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,120
Just the six of us?

753
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,840
Yes, only six left.

754
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,400
What about the others?

755
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,640
Cupid's date.

756
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,240
Really?

757
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,720
Yes.

758
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,080
I saw Susu getting changed and going out.

759
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,480
No.

760
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,000
She's definitely not going on a date.

761
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,960
It's just...

762
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,040
Because she

763
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,480
She didn't wear that dress a few days ago.

764
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,480
No wonder you don't eat.

765
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,600
Yes.

766
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,160
They are in a hurry for dinner.

767
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,680
Yes.

768
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,160
They started this date.

769
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,880
So, Tata will...

770
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,720
Tata is going.

771
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,360
Tata went to

772
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,840
Tae-ri left.

773
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,800
I'm so stupid.

774
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,240
I even forced others to eat noodles.

775
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,760
Yes.

776
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,400
I even gave it to others.

777
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,160
No wonder they said they weren't hungry.

778
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,800
So Harry left too.

779
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,200
He went on a date.

780
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,680
Yes.

781
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Are you sad?

782
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,800
Are you sad?

783
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,440
Why would I be sad?

784
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,400
I can go on a date too.

785
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,120
No one asked me out.

786
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,080
No wonder he was unhappy sitting there.

787
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,240
They all went out.

788
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,080
Maybe not yet.

789
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,120
I'll go take a look.

790
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
I...

791
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,680
I'm outside.

792
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,520
What are you doing?

793
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,920
Are you going out?

794
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,600
Yes.

795
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,720
Okay.

796
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,040
We won't have dinner tonight.

797
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,320
We have to.

798
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,080
No.

799
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,040
Didn't you go out for dinner?

800
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,520
Just like

801
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,680
when I was rejected this afternoon.

802
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,600
It's complicated.

803
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,840
Because she doesn't know me.

804
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,240
Maybe she knows soup better.

805
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,120
They moved in a few days earlier than us.

806
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,800
I want to change my impression

807
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,200
to change her impression of me.

808
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,960
Good evening.

809
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,600
Good evening.

810
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,240
Have a seat.

811
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,680
Okay.

812
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,400
She's avoiding me.

813
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,720
A little awkward.

814
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,400
Yes.

815
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,080
What do you think?

816
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,880
Are you surprised?

817
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,040
It was an accident at first.

818
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,560
Really?

819
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,280
Yes very

820
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,880
Yes.

821
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,240
Because I might have something

822
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,160
I think

823
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,840
more words.

824
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:47,920
Yes.

825
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,000
Yes, the first time I entered the house,

826
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,520
Right?

827
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,760
Because at that time,

828
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,120
When you came,

829
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
my wisdom tooth was inflamed.

830
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,240
I have a toothache. I don't want to talk.

831
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,440
Yes.

832
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,840
I thought you were quiet.

833
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,720
Is today your second date?

834
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,200
Right?

835
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,920
Yes.

836
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,240
Yes.

837
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,280
How did you know?

838
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,160
Because when we entered the room,

839
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,960
everyone said

840
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,760
the first time a girl chose a boy.

841
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Right. Right.

842
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,640
And...

843
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,880
I want to know

844
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,440
Is it the same person you want?

845
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
You don't have to say anyone.

846
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,240
You're great.

847
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Susu, you're great.

848
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,880
Okay, got it.

849
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,680
It's a coincidence.

850
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,000
But you didn't guess

851
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,240
Harry is Xin's (brother).

852
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,600
When I first moved in,

853
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
they kept talking.

854
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,760
Then Xinxin felt

855
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,240
when talking to Harry,

856
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,280
She's very oppressive.

857
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,960
It's pressure

858
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,440
So you were very sure.

859
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,640
Yes, I was very sure.

860
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,880
You thought you were too smart.

861
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,640
Yes, I think I'm too smart.

862
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,520
Because you don't talk and sit next to me.

863
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,880
How do you want me to guess?

864
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,200
I'll be the first to exclude you.

865
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,120
I'm introverted.

866
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,760
Me too.

867
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,960
So you're always passive.

868
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,199
Thank you.

869
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,159
Whether it's a relationship

870
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,080
or in daily life,

871
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,800
are passive.

872
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,400
It's like a blind date organized by parents.

873
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:16,840
Right?

874
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,480
I want to talk to you about something.

875
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,400
She doesn't seem to have

876
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,880
when she's with the soup.

877
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,960
I think Tae-seo is too straightforward.

878
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,320
Yes.

879
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,520
In that state.

880
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,360
He was too eager to attack.

881
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,840
Yes.

882
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,880
If I can feel

883
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,440
a very determined choice,

884
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,040
I will walk towards him.

885
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,360
But if I feel

886
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,280
and he walks,

887
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,600
10, 20, 30.

888
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,080
I can be indifferent. Right.

889
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,600
You need a firm choice, right?

890
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,480
Almost the same. Me too.

891
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,640
I'm usually passive.

892
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,240
And

893
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,680
they might give me some signals.

894
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,880
I might

895
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,200
We're just friends, right?

896
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,240
Me too. Yes.

897
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,160
Yes, mutual.

898
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,160
You didn't look at Susu.

899
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,720
When we had dinner yesterday, he said

900
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,480
He was also

901
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,640
passive.

902
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,040
Yes.

903
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,480
When they asked me about my first impression,

904
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,600
he gave me five.

905
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,280
I thought it was.

906
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,680
I was passive when I was in a relationship.

907
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,800
And he said

908
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,080
I thought it was because of this high-five

909
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,880
And then

910
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,200
I said you were the first.

911
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,920
Then he explained

912
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,000
and explained.

913
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,320
Yes.

914
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,960
He said he was clapping for this reason.

915
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,000
Are you embarrassed?

916
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,760
I'm fine.

917
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,800
Then we...

918
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,280
to compete fairly.

919
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,440
I think boys

920
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,320
Just say whatever you want.

921
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,160
There's no need to be embarrassed.

922
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
It's kind of like an assistant.

923
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,440
I'll sacrifice myself.

924
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,960
The soup suits you so well.

925
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,800
Because I'll return it to you today.

926
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,720
I was really torn about

927
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,560
Why?

928
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,680
So I always

929
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,520
to the end,

930
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,720
I made the choice.

931
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,480
Someone told me on our way there today

932
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,320
I gave you the soup first.

933
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,120
Yes.

934
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,240
So do you really think so?

935
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,040
Yes.

936
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Well,

937
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Maybe I was busy

938
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
so I didn't deliver the soup fast.

939
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,400
Yes.

940
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,080
But

941
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,240
I didn't expect you to send it to me.

942
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,800
Because you can't remember my name.

943
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm sorry.

944
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,800
Everyone except me remembers it.

945
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,040
I thought

946
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,560
I'm sorry.

947
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
It's okay.

948
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,520
So you really forgot.

949
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,680
I really forgot.

950
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,960
The brain crashed.

951
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,680
Really crashed

952
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,520
I really forgot

953
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,440
Everyone's name

954
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,800
There are too many names.

955
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,800
I was thinking

956
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,040
Is it AA or BB or CC?

957
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,560
I don't remember either.

958
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,560
Because I may

959
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,200
I'm a little avoided.

960
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,120
A aversion personality.

961
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,600
The more I care,

962
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,000
the less I feel.

963
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,960
Yes.

964
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,640
My best friend is Gemini.

965
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,200
She said

966
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,800
it's really hard to talk to you.

967
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,920
I don't want to talk to you.

968
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,360
You're so boring.

969
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,880
My friend kept saying that I was boring.

970
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,600
And then

971
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,440
when I introduced myself,

972
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,000
I said,

973
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,760
I think I'm a boring person.

974
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm also a boring person.

975
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,400
But I'm very confident.

976
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,200
I always find things to do at home.

977
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,160
Even if I open a package,

978
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,000
is my way of self-destruction.

979
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,960
Do you know how exaggerated

980
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,440
in New York?

981
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
I just went there.

982
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,720
I had no friends.

983
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,840
I was so exaggerated that I found a cafe

984
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,560
I sat there all afternoon watching people.

985
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
So many people come and go.

986
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,480
Loneliness.

987
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:51,880
No.

988
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,800
I can't stand this loneliness.

989
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,160
I never eat alone.

990
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,880
But I can't

991
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,280
be alone in the same environment.

992
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,680
If I see

993
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,240
see others there,

994
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,200
I feel much better.

995
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,600
I can't stay at home alone.

996
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,280
I really need someone

997
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
who needs company.

998
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,600
Yes, you don't have to say anything.

999
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,960
But I need someone to arrange things.

1000
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,560
I have to ask him out if no one asks me out.

1001
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,240
All right.

1002
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,040
What are you doing today?

1003
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,720
What are you doing tomorrow? What are you doing tonight?

1004
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,840
Yes.

1005
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,400
What do you want to do?

1006
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,440
Do you want to come to my house?

1007
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,560
Yes.

1008
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,640
All right.

1009
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,080
After the overall chat,

1010
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,240
we are similar.

1011
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,000
Similar.

1012
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,680
I have a lot to say today.

1013
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,480
Our chat

1014
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,040
in a relaxing way.

1015
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,920
They had a good chat.

1016
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
I'm curious

1017
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,280
the last time you had a date with Cupid,

1018
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,480
when you went on a date last time?

1019
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,440
Or will it be dry?

1020
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm trying my best to get to the point.

1021
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,920
So today, I'm looking for...

1022
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,560
No.

1023
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,280
I responded very actively.

1024
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,800
When I knew

1025
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
she was the one

1026
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,480
when she was looking for the topic.

1027
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,320
I'm actually

1028
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,960
in my heart.

1029
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,720
Because today,

1030
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,160
she said she was a passive person.

1031
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,640
Since she's willing to make soup,

1032
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,520
she took the initiative to talk about it.

1033
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,040
And to me,

1034
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,600
I'm looking for the topic.

1035
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,320
I feel a gap.

1036
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,680
We can see some changes in a date.

1037
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,760
Yes.

1038
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,200
Actually, Susu mentioned

1039
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,120
that she can't be alone at all.

1040
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,160
She needs someone in her family.

1041
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,560
What kind of characters are you?

1042
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,880
I can't be alone at all.

1043
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,120
I just fell asleep.

1044
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,440
In my dream, I have friends with me.

1045
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,120
I had many dreams.

1046
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,000
You're too E.

1047
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,840
So many dreams.

1048
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,920
During the holiday in school,

1049
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,360
I opened my eyes.

1050
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,040
I only have two things to think about today.

1051
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,280
Either find someone to play at home,

1052
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,800
or I go out to play.

1053
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,240
It's scary to be alone.

1054
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,360
I'm the opposite of him.

1055
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,840
I really like

1056
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,240
staying at home alone.

1057
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,320
Except for work,

1058
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,640
as long as I go to a crowded place,

1059
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,720
in a crowded place.

1060
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,960
We are two extremes.

1061
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,040
You are...

1062
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,080
I'm the opposite of them.

1063
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,480
I can do anything.

1064
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:03,920
Anything.

1065
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,640
Yes.

1066
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,560
One person can also

1067
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,040
Yes.

1068
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,760
I want to have some space

1069
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,560
I hope I can have some space alone

1070
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,480
and come back by myself.

1071
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,520
Yes, after this Spring Festival,

1072
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,720
Because during the Spring Festival, my husband and I

1073
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,680
to play with two kids.

1074
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,120
Then I asked my husband

1075
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,760
I said I wanted to go to a hotel alone

1076
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,560
for two or three days.

1077
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,120
and get the energy back.

1078
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,440
Yes.

1079
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,000
I enjoy being alone.

1080
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,360
Actually, I can't accept

1081
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,240
eating alone.

1082
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,600
But recently,

1083
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,840
watch a movie alone.

1084
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,360
I'm studying.

1085
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,040
Why should I learn this?

1086
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,600
It's something I've never touched.

1087
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,800
I want to try it.

1088
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,440
It's horrible.

1089
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,560
I don't think

1090
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,760
no cinema.

1091
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,320
But it's cool to try it.

1092
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,520
No.

1093
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:46,880
Impossible.

1094
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,760
I can't even find the cinema.

1095
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,440
I'm alone.

1096
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,880
I live in a cinema when I have friends.

1097
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,400
But I feel

1098
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:52,720
It's like E.

1099
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,560
The difference between I (introverted).

1100
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,920
It's not introverted or outgoing.

1101
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,560
Yes, I know.

1102
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,480
It's the way to gain energy.

1103
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:57,960
Yes.

1104
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,600
And I (introverted).

1105
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,920
I charge when I'm alone.

1106
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,600
Yes.

1107
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,200
Let's play a game.

1108
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,200
Okay.

1109
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,680
Do you like that girl now?

1110
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,240
Do you think she's older than you?

1111
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,560
I think I like her type.

1112
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,640
She has more looks.

1113
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,120
But it's usually very important

1114
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,960
at first sight.

1115
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,200
Did you have fun with Tata today?

1116
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,600
Yes.

1117
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,640
So Tata is the girl

1118
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,360
you would like at first sight?

1119
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,800
I think so.

1120
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,400
If the person you like

1121
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,880
her feelings have changed,

1122
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
will you continue to express your feelings to her

1123
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,240
or change it right away?

1124
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,400
What a sharp question.

1125
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,320
Is this question specifically for soup?

1126
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,040
I'll try.

1127
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,200
But

1128
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,520
I just want to fight for it.

1129
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,880
or try your best.

1130
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,840
I think

1131
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,760
he hesitated.

1132
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,240
This problem is set for him.

1133
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,040
I think with the speed of this house,

1134
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,120
I feel that in two to three days,

1135
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,160
Huang Zihong is like this.

1136
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,160
I'll return it if I don't receive the signal.

1137
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,000
Yes.

1138
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,480
Stream.

1139
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,640
It's the first time I've heard the fluid description

1140
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,240
This house feels like it's only for one day

1141
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,240
like ten days outside.

1142
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,880
Yes.

1143
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,640
What if both sides are responding?

1144
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,480
I think it might not be two or three days.

1145
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,800
Then maybe stretch back a little.

1146
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,240
When she accepts two people,

1147
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,040
when she accepts two people.

1148
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,960
No, I think she has the right

1149
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,720
to meet more people.

1150
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,360
It's her.

1151
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,600
Great.

1152
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,000
Great.

1153
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,760
The soup is great.

1154
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,920
Hua is asking this question.

1155
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,040
and telling herself

1156
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,640
Because she's also in this situation.

1157
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,720
Yes, that's right.

1158
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,440
But the soup still hurts. Look.

1159
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,520
Definitely.

1160
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,680
I'm nervous now.

1161
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,880
The soup is depressing

1162
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,200
You don't even play with your phone

1163
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,160
It's like being alone in the house.

1164
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,760
Time passes slowly.

1165
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,920
It's so hard.

1166
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,080
The soup is sincere.

1167
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,320
I only have one impression of him.

1168
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,240
My first impression was

1169
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,560
I had a good eye.

1170
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,160
I just want to

1171
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,360
get to know each other more.

1172
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,600
Tata gave the Cupid invitation card.

1173
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,440
Harry.

1174
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,280
Good evening.

1175
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,000
Good morning.

1176
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:48,920
Good morning.

1177
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,760
We meet again

1178
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,000
We meet again.

1179
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,560
Do you know I'm on a date with you today?

1180
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,560
I know.

1181
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,280
How do you know?

1182
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,040
Because there's only

1183
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,960
Tae-ri and you.

1184
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,200
I can't go on a date with Tae-seo, can I?

1185
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,920
Naughty.

1186
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,800
Is it for me?

1187
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,040
Really?

1188
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,080
You're...

1189
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,680
Because you have a Cupid date.

1190
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,920
It's a letter from your brother.

1191
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,920
I was the kind of person

1192
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,600
by you

1193
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,200
Or did you just want to give me

1194
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,160
I guessed.

1195
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,160
Here.

1196
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,760
Susu.

1197
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,720
Great.

1198
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,960
This is actually a signal.

1199
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,240
Yes.

1200
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,640
Okay.

1201
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,400
Raise your mouth.

1202
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,840
Shy.

1203
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,440
I've never seen Harry so shy.

1204
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,440
Tata's expression and pose.

1205
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,120
No one can stand this.

1206
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,360
Eat.

1207
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,280
Who did you date the other day?

1208
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,320
Can I ask that?

1209
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:08,960
Sure, no problem.

1210
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,560
I can tell you.

1211
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,360
Who did you meet?

1212
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,960
Xiao Ling.

1213
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,920
It's also a date.

1214
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,200
It's like having dinner with friends.

1215
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,920
I said I found my confidant.

1216
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,600
Yes.

1217
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,360
Yes.

1218
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,480
Harry's smile

1219
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,320
Why is he smiling so ambiguous?

1220
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,880
Yes.

1221
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,960
So can you eat spicy food?

1222
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,640
I can eat spicy food.

1223
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,280
Yes.

1224
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,320
Did I really remember it wrong?

1225
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,200
You really got it wrong.

1226
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,040
I didn't order spicy food today.

1227
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,240
I don't know what to say now.

1228
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,440
This is the first time I feel I can't answer the phone.

1229
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,840
You know what?

1230
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,200
I think Xiao Ling got it wrong last time.

1231
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,160
Harry's taboo, right?

1232
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,040
Yes.

1233
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,840
A similar history.

1234
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,160
What is this?

1235
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,560
It's root powder.

1236
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:52,920
Wait.

1237
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,440
Do you need help?

1238
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,200
Then you do it.

1239
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,440
Tae-seo, learn from him.

1240
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,800
Look at their interaction.

1241
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,360
Yes.

1242
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360
I can't pick it up.

1243
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,040
Then you do it.

1244
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:07,840
No, I can't.

1245
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,600
I really can't.

1246
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,120
They all look different.

1247
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,240
Why does Harry have this atmosphere

1248
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,680
with everyone?

1249
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,560
Wait.

1250
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,680
Are you really from the north?

1251
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,680
What do you mean?

1252
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,800
What are you doing?

1253
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,760
Because there's a difference between the South and the North.

1254
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,520
Really?

1255
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,240
Look.

1256
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,360
I put the bowl on the plate.

1257
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,960
This is the bone disc.

1258
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,400
But you put it in the vegetable.

1259
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,440
It's okay.

1260
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,320
No.

1261
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,200
So what?

1262
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:49,880
No.

1263
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,680
So what?

1264
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,280
Yes.

1265
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,040
Let's talk.

1266
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,680
Why did you

1267
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,880
the invitation card today?

1268
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,360
Xin.

1269
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,520
Tata is very active.

1270
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,800
Tarri and Tata are the same type.

1271
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,640
Can I have some water?

1272
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,200
Give me some water.

1273
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,320
Why are you nervous?

1274
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,000
I want some water.

1275
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,840
My mouth is a bit dry.

1276
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,080
Tata is also very straightforward.

1277
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:15,920
She's cute.

1278
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,240
She's straightforward and cute.

1279
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,360
Yes.

1280
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,480
Harry ran away.

1281
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,720
Harry met his opponent.

1282
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,560
It's hot.

1283
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,480
It's hot.

1284
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,360
Sincerity is the ultimate move.

1285
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,320
I think Tata still likes him.

1286
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,160
Yes.

1287
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,400
Go ahead.

1288
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,440
I feel like I've been tricked.

1289
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,120
Let me ask you a question.

1290
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,120
Do you think love at first sight

1291
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,880
is love at first sight?

1292
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,360
Will you choose

1293
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,040
or will you choose to fall in love as time goes by?

1294
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,640
Actually, I believe in love at first sight.

1295
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,200
Just like me.

1296
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,640
But I can also accept the battle

1297
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,520
between masters.

1298
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,920
Let's talk about this.

1299
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,800
Because we are slightly opposite.

1300
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,360
Because I just think

1301
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,960
if it's love at first sight,

1302
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,840
it could be

1303
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,760
a little bit.

1304
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,640
or because of her skin.

1305
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,320
Yes.

1306
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,240
I think it's too shallow

1307
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,280
to a man.

1308
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:22,920
Shallow.

1309
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,520
It's...

1310
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,240
If we don't get along,

1311
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,840
if you don't get along with each other,

1312
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,080
I don't respect you and others.

1313
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,080
So

1314
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,520
to get to know her.

1315
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,240
Right? That's what it means.

1316
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:35,600
Yes.

1317
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,160
After all, we've been together for longer.

1318
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,480
That's a sincere answer.

1319
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,600
Yes, I think it's right.

1320
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,760
Actually I thought you and Xinxin

1321
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,640
were siblings.

1322
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,000
Because yesterday,

1323
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,160
didn't lie to me once.

1324
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,040
I hesitated.

1325
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,840
I'm a fool.

1326
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:49,720
Yes.

1327
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,400
In the end,

1328
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,280
Susu.

1329
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,720
is quite smart.

1330
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,200
But

1331
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,240
I saw you two

1332
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,480
with each other yesterday.

1333
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,920
I'm familiar with everyone.

1334
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,360
I'm familiar with everyone.

1335
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,240
Don't you think so?

1336
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,120
Are we close?

1337
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,720
Are we close?

1338
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,120
Okay, it's fine.

1339
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,360
Try to get familiar with each other after this meal.

1340
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:10,920
and be more familiar with each other.

1341
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,840
Two masters.

1342
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,400
They have high EQ.

1343
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,120
Yes.

1344
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,280
Awesome.

1345
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,800
Okay.

1346
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,560
I love high-end games.

1347
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,880
I've never seen Harry eat so nervous.

1348
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
Today,

1349
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,000
I can't catch up with what you said.

1350
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,520
What do you think

1351
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,880
what kind of person do you think I am?

1352
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,360
Tata is a straight shot.

1353
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,560
But she's not

1354
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,560
offensive or offensive.

1355
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,600
It's very sincere.

1356
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,280
Yes.

1357
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,520
I think you are

1358
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,480
a passive person.

1359
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,200
And I think

1360
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,720
If you like someone,

1361
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,960
if you like someone.

1362
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,600
Look at one more person.

1363
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,640
If you like someone,

1364
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,120
when you like someone.

1365
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,920
subconsciously.

1366
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,360
I need to think about it.

1367
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,200
Is it like this?

1368
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,480
I think

1369
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,480
in this aspect.

1370
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,640
I was really passive.

1371
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,920
Because he felt

1372
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,080
So he's been trying to be positive.

1373
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,560
to talk to me.

1374
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,320
Do you think your other half

1375
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,920
are complementary or similar?

1376
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,760
Do you think it's better?

1377
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,000
better?

1378
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,960
It's the same as asking me this question.

1379
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,080
Because I am

1380
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,360
who can change with my other half.

1381
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,240
You think you can change yourself?

1382
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,480
I think I can change.

1383
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,240
I think boys can change.

1384
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,320
No.

1385
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,880
It's hard to change your personality.

1386
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,480
If you really like someone,

1387
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,920
why don't you change it?

1388
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,880
I have to change it if it doesn't suit me.

1389
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,560
Am I wrong?

1390
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,320
You won't.

1391
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,440
I think

1392
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,280
a lot.

1393
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,000
This will change as the other person does.

1394
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,760
In this case,

1395
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,760
which is the real me?

1396
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,360
Do you think our current state

1397
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,960
is the same as my state in the room?

1398
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,040
Not really.

1399
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,160
Which one do you think is the real me?

1400
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,480
A little house.

1401
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,280
The one in the small house is more relaxed, right?

1402
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:07,960
To be precise,

1403
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,240
It's stretching now, right?

1404
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:09,840
A little.

1405
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,320
How should I put it? It's the same frequency.

1406
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,320
I think

1407
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,320
complementary

1408
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,320
It's not that certain.

1409
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,800
It depends.

1410
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,960
personality or hobby.

1411
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,040
Do you think it's a hobby that requires frequency?

1412
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,600
But I think

1413
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,280
we should complement each other.

1414
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,120
Personality complementary.

1415
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,080
I think we should have the same hobby.

1416
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:32,680
Yes.

1417
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,880
Surprisingly, he said

1418
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,520
he would change himself

1419
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,480
because of his personality.

1420
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,880
I think

1421
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,560
is

1422
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,080
to me.

1423
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,800
When I hear this answer,

1424
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,320
when I hear this answer.

1425
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,760
The two of them are so important for this meal.

1426
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,080
They have a future.

1427
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,600
It's impossible if they don't have a good chat.

1428
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,200
Yes.

1429
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,160
Can I apply for clothes?

1430
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,640
What kind of boy do you like?

1431
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,680
A more delicate boy.

1432
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,640
He's gentle.

1433
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,840
That's him.

1434
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:11,960
That's all.

1435
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,440
This is very important.

1436
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,960
Personality is very important.

1437
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,800
I think

1438
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,640
meticulous,

1439
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,880
in some details.

1440
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,320
and have a good temper.

1441
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,320
Be good-tempered.

1442
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,760
Because in love,

1443
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,320
in love.

1444
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,280
Do you think I have a good temper?

1445
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,320
I should have a little temper.

1446
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,480
I have a little temper.

1447
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:42,720
I think

1448
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,640
you will lose your temper.

1449
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,040
It's not that you don't have a temper at all.

1450
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,440
I have no temper at all.

1451
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,040
Seriously?

1452
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,280
I'm very easy-going.

1453
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,080
I really have no temper.

1454
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,120
If I had a temper,

1455
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,600
I would hold it back.

1456
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,360
I'll be exhausted.

1457
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,840
But only in front of strangers

1458
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,280
in front of strangers.

1459
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,640
No, I don't know people I know either.

1460
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,560
If I'm in a relationship, I'll say

1461
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:04,920
How about this?

1462
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,440
Give me a few days to calm down.

1463
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,960
I'll talk to her after I calm down.

1464
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,200
Can I call it a cold war?

1465
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,280
Calm doesn't mean you don't reply to my texts.

1466
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,320
Yes.

1467
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:18,840
It's you.

1468
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,640
Calm down.

1469
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,080
I won't discuss

1470
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,960
or discuss the truth with her.

1471
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,120
Let's put this problem aside.

1472
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,000
Yes, put it down first.

1473
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,080
It must have put it in.

1474
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,560
It won't take more than an hour.

1475
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,160
Then I'll come back

1476
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,120
to deal with this.

1477
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,560
Harry is quite mature.

1478
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,040
Yes.

1479
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,280
I don't fight with anyone.

1480
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,200
Aren't you bored?

1481
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,280
Aren't you

1482
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,080
very boring.

1483
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,600
What's wrong?

1484
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,840
You're so dull.

1485
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,640
Right?

1486
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,800
Silly.

1487
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,480
Shallow, right?

1488
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,560
Shallow.

1489
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,640
I'm the kind of person who needs guidance.

1490
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,680
I seldom set up a party

1491
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,560
or ask someone out for fun.

1492
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,280
But if you call me,

1493
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,000
I'll basically go.

1494
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,480
It's complementary with Harry.

1495
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,200
Okay, let me ask you

1496
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,600
What kind of girl do you like?

1497
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,000
I can't avoid her.

1498
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,160
I think

1499
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:07,920
if that girl

1500
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,920
I would take the initiative.

1501
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,520
If that girl

1502
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,440
is a proactive girl,

1503
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,960
I'll listen to her a little bit.

1504
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,880
Now there's a quiet girl

1505
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,800
and a proactive girl.

1506
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,440
You...

1507
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,880
You're sticking your face.

1508
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,880
You're really...

1509
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,920
Who do you want to know more?

1510
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,800
If I have to choose,

1511
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,680
I would choose

1512
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,880
a quiet girl.

1513
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,880
Be quiet

1514
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,160
It's just a meal.

1515
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,640
The house is a mess.

1516
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,800
The Bloody Bloody Bloody Bloody Bloody Bloody Gala starts now.

1517
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,520
OK.

1518
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,160
I feel that

1519
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,720
a little rebellious

1520
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,400
in life.

1521
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,640
This is a little different from me.

1522
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,440
I follow the rules.

1523
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,960
He's a little naughty.

1524
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,800
I'm just a little worried.

1525
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,320
that during the conversation tonight,

1526
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,680
will my passive

1527
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,240
will cause him trouble.

1528
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,800
But he chose

1529
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,600
He said to be quiet.

1530
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,840
to be quiet.

1531
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,880
After meeting Tata today,

1532
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,400
more cheerful and cheerful than before.

1533
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,840
and talk more.

1534
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,840
I think her feelings

1535
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,200
and life.

1536
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,800
might overlap with my thoughts.

1537
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,360
and more frequent.

1538
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,480
such a Cupid date.

1539
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,760
I think the first one is more like

1540
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,920
Like how we get along with Xiaoling as friends.

1541
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,160
Second, she just

1542
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,640
really like someone.

1543
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,720
I want to know more about you.

1544
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,520
It's a pity,

1545
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:45,800
Their "lightning thunder" answer

1546
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,600
their "lightning thunder".

1547
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,240
But I think they are good.

1548
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,920
I think Harry

1549
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,920
can be with anyone.

1550
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,760
He's amazing.

1551
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,760
Yeah, he has a different sense of teamwork.

1552
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,760
Because he said he could change for the other.

1553
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,160
Yes.

1554
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,640
He actively changes his identity.

1555
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,960
I can feel that Harry likes Tata

1556
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,560
quite high.

1557
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,520
Really?

1558
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,160
Yes.

1559
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:04,920
I think so too.

1560
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,240
he has many details.

1561
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,280
For example, the first one.

1562
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,640
Tata asked a sharp question.

1563
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,200
Why did you cancel my card

1564
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,680
Then you accepted Xin's card.

1565
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,760
Harry asked for a glass of water.

1566
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,040
Then he went there to drink water.

1567
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,000
to avoid this problem.

1568
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,600
Yes.

1569
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,360
Then he gave another question to the other person.

1570
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,160
Then we talked about

1571
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,440
mutual complementary or similar?

1572
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,560
He didn't answer.

1573
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,760
He said I could do anything.

1574
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,600
What's the subtitles?

1575
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,440
I don't know if you like complementary

1576
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,680
or similar.

1577
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,360
So I...

1578
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,760
give you a standard answer.

1579
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,800
What if it's wrong?

1580
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,520
Look at you.

1581
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,160
The third is to calm down.

1582
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,320
Just observe.

1583
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,440
Tata said,

1584
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,200
Are you going to give him a cold war?

1585
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,080
Let's see how he reacts.

1586
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,360
If he starts looking back,

1587
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,560
it means in his heart,

1588
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,080
Tata has a good impression.

1589
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,840
It's just some details.

1590
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,400
He tried to avoid

1591
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,280
his negative image in Tata's heart

1592
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,520
or his frequent images

1593
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,000
That's how he expressed it.

1594
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,960
Smart man.

1595
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,360
Shut up and observe.

1596
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,360
After a meal,

1597
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,640
Xinxin, the sky has collapsed.

1598
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,400
Let's have a chat.

1599
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,160
She came to talk to her brother.

1600
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,440
I'm having a hard time right now.

1601
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,480
Do you have someone you want to post today?

1602
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,160
Just follow your heart.

1603
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,920
My heart is a mess right now.

1604
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,880
I just feel

1605
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,680
I'm with Hua.

1606
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,320
Like

1607
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,800
when I'm with Xiaoling.

1608
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,120
Do you think...

1609
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,120
I think you and Xiaoling

1610
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,040
with Xiaoling,

1611
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,360
I don't feel that intimacy.

1612
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,280
in the same picture.

1613
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,160
But they are more natural with Hua.

1614
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,040
and relaxed.

1615
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,680
Don't think too much.

1616
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,000
At this moment,

1617
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,680
who do you think you're getting along with?

1618
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,560
I'll definitely send it to Xiaoling today.

1619
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,280
Don't talk about others. Who do you want to send it to?

1620
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,240
That's good.

1621
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,000
So you and Harry are like this.

1622
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,520
Do you think he'll be shaken?

1623
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,360
Maybe.

1624
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,920
Do you think he'll give it to me today?

1625
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,320
I think he will.

1626
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,520
If he didn't give it to me,

1627
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,480
I would've cried.

1628
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,880
Who will you text today?

1629
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,920
Who will you send it to?

1630
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,800
She asked him

1631
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,800
She asked directly.

1632
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,880
I think she must have received

1633
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,880
received Harry's message.

1634
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,200
It must be Harry.

1635
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,040
If we like each other,

1636
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,160
there shouldn't be such a situation.

1637
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,480
Today,

1638
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,640
share a love miracle with you.

1639
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,680
So,

1640
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,360
I think

1641
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,360
love can change someone.

1642
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,440
So look at him.

1643
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,120
has been

1644
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,160
by his love.

1645
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:42,960
is different from before.

1646
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,600
It's getting romantic.

1647
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:01,760
