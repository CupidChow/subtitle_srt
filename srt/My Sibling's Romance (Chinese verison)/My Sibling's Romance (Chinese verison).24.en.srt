The progress of the cabin is almost over.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,160
And last week, our boys

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,960
went through the interview at the Mirror House,

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,360
I also completed the invitation to protect my date.

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:50,800
Yes.

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,240
Drawu, a fat protective date.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,360
It's all done.

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,680

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,880

(Can I)

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360
keep their relationship warm?

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,840
the update of this episode.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,840
Is the protective result as you wish?

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,920
Look at the corners of his mouth.

45
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,760
He can't even suppress the corners of his mouth.

46
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,960
Dating Tata is very happy.

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,720
I think

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,560
if I value one thing,

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,800
I would have prepared a lot in advance.

50
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,520
Their food

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,960
are good.

52
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,360
I think it's a local specialty in Beijing.

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,200
It can also express my feelings.

54
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,600
Sit down and laugh.

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,480
Why are you so happy?

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm happy just thinking about it.

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,480
It means he really met

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,040
a girl in his heart.

59
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
You can't hide your love.

60
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,120
Yes.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm a little nervous.

62
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,800
Because I'm afraid this date will be ruined.

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,960
or make her hate it.

64
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,640
He really cares.

65
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
So he was nervous.

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Yes.

67
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,519
This pose

68
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,160
He's like the receptionist now.

69
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,000
Will he bite me?

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,400
Coming.

71
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,960
The temperament of a supermodel.

72
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,560
Yes.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,080
Hey.

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,360
I almost thought

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,640
You're already a receptionist.

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,240
Let's go.

77
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
Did you wait long?

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,880
Did you wait long here?

79
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
Yes, here.

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,240
I waited here for a while.

81
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,320
It's finally your turn to wait for me.

82
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,840
I waited for you many times.

83
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,880
You waited for me many times.

84
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,480
Yes.

85
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,640
Just once.

86
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,800
Twice.

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,640
The first time counts.

88
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,920
Let's sit inside.

89
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,480
Have you eaten?

90
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,440
Did you

91
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,600
Did you cook noodles?

92
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,400
Yes.

93
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,600
He left some noodles, right?

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's start.

95
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,280
Are you nervous?

96
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,560
Yes.

97
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,040
I'm not asking you.

98
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,520
Are you nervous?

99
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,040
At first,

100
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,960
I'm fine.

101
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,600
He's really nervous.

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,640
It means he really likes it.

103
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,600
You know? I'm starving.

104
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
I haven't eaten all day.

105
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm fine.

106
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,720
I ordered a lot.

107
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,320
Did you choose the place?

108
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,320
Of course.

109
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,280
Choose carefully.

110
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,040
Wait.

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,600
Take a look.

112
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I have a small note.

113
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,040
A small note?

114
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,160
Why are you taking notes?

115
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,680
I don't know what to do.

116
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,520
You know?

117
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,920
I don't have any notes.

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,160
Did your brother choose this date?

119
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,080
Or will he communicate with you

120
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,680
with you.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
So you heard what I said.

122
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,760
He told me.

123
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,000
and lied to him.

124
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,800
I don't think I can tell him.

125
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,240
Do you know how fast I speak?

126
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,480
I speak faster

127
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,040
faster.

128
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,840
He said you're more serious than usual.

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
more serious than usual.

130
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm too serious.

131
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,200
I don't think I've been so serious in my life.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,159
I was so embarrassed

133
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,680
with the mirror.

134
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
I kept touching here.

135
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,600
I didn't know it was a one-sided mirror.

136
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,640
I can't see him at all.

137
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,360
So you don't know who's opposite.

138
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,320
I thought it was you.

139
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,520
and him.

140
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,000
I feel like I'm being interviewed.

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,720
I'm very upright.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,400
I've never been so upright in my life.

143
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,120
Why?

144
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,760
Why are you nervous about him?

145
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,080
I'm nervous about you two.

146
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,360
I thought you two

147
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,880
you won't be nervous when I'm not around.

148
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,080
I feel better without you.

149
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
Yes.

150
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,680
Why?

151
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,600
Because I'm telling the truth.

152
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,360
I meant it.

153
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,440
Brother.

154
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,080
Tata is good at asking questions.

155
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,480
Yes.

156
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,840
Every question

157
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,400
on point.

158
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,200
Yes.

159
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,880
I got some information.

160
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,240
What information?

161
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,480
First, when you're in a relationship,

162
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,280
you're very clingy.

163
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,920
He said that.

164
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,320
He said in a relationship,

165
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,360
when you're in love?

166
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,200
So I said,

167
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,160
I'll think about it.

168
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,240
I see.

169
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,360
Hey.

170
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,320
You're definitely clingy.

171
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,440
So your answer is based on

172
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,000
based on his question?

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,480
Or are you the real response?

174
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
So good at asking.

175
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,560
My real answer

176
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,880
You're also very clingy.

177
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,400
You know that?

178
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
He told me.

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,320
I just

180
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,800
to answer my true thoughts.

181
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,040
I'm so real.

182
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,200
I know.

183
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,920
How clingy.

184
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,840
I don't know.

185
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,800
You don't know either.

186
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,200
I'm actually the kind of person

187
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,640
everything I do.

188
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,400
Why did you choose me?

189
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,760
What do you think?

190
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,400
Don't ask me

191
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,520
Why?

192
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,200
Guess who else we interviewed.

193
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,200
Map.

194
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,960
What else?

195
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,480
No.

196
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,560
Do you think

197
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,240
from the drawing?

198
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:28,840
No.

199
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,800
Answer my question first.

200
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
before I answer your question.

201
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,720
Whatever.

202
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,159
Answer me first.

203
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,200
Whether it's love

204
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,960
or my family,

205
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,799
I seldom express my true thoughts.

206
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,000
Because it's not necessary.

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,720
When we have feelings,

208
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,640
we're already together.

209
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,240
I'll be more secretive.

210
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,200
and consuming.

211
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,280
Even if

212
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,080
it's really

213
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,560
You're actually quite exhausted.

214
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:54,840
Yes.

215
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,600
In that room,

216
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,200
in the room

217
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,240
everything.

218
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,280
I think

219
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,720
I can do.

220
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,080
I can do

221
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,920
in words.

222
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,520
For now.

223
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,640
He's good at expressing himself.

224
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,760
So maybe

225
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,320
he really touched Tae-seo.

226
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,760
He thinks it's Tae-seo.

227
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,440
Yes.

228
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,920
In fact, your answer

229
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,080
is more sincere than the map.

230
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
And I think

231
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,800
want this chance more.

232
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,480
Just this once?

233
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,400
That means...

234
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,520
Who knows if you'll do it again?

235
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,480
You have an interview next time, right?

236
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,040
Sincerity is the killer verse.

237
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,120
Where's my meal?

238
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,840
Did you order?

239
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
Yes.

240
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,720
Four or five hours ago.

241
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
I've ordered everything.

242
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,400
I prepared everything in advance.

243
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,520
Before our date.

244
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,080
I fell asleep at four last night.

245
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,560
I've been doing a lot of strategies.

246
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,520
Really.

247
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,160
So tired.

248
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,960
Thank you.

249
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,200
So attentive.

250
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,200
Wait.

251
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Pinky swear.

252
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,640
Let me see.

253
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,920
Let me show you.

254
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
Is it too much?

255
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,520
No.

256
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm not asking a question.

257
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,960
Just a little.

258
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,320
I know.

259
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
This is your little task.

260
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,320
I gave it to myself.

261
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm afraid I'll say I forgot it.

262
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,600
I forgot it.

263
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,440
including order.

264
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,840
I wrote it down too.

265
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,800
In case I forget.

266
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,240
This one too.

267
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,080
Don't be shy.

268
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,680
You're not hot.

269
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,520
I'm fine.

270
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,560
I just came in.

271
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,320
I'm sweating.

272
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,080
Really.

273
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,200
Are you nervous?

274
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,480
Which time are you the most nervous?

275
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,440
I'm the most nervous this time.

276
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,760
This time,

277
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,640
You said yesterday

278
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,440
I was most nervous yesterday.

279
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:45,760
No.

280
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,240
I'm the most nervous this time.

281
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,880
Do you know why?

282
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,840
Why?

283
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,240
Today is your birthday.

284
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,040
From my point of view,

285
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,320
the ceremony may be very important.

286
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,120
And I'm afraid you'll choose me.

287
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,840
and I couldn't arrange it well.

288
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,800
I feel pressured.

289
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,520
It's okay.

290
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,760
Whether it's a date or a birthday,

291
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,280
I feel pressured.

292
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,360
I'm so stressed.

293
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,520
He'll put pressure on himself.

294
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,240
It's internal consumption.

295
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm struggling.

296
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,920
You know what?

297
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,800
Birthday.

298
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,280
Every day is my birthday.

299
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
We celebrate our 18th birthday every day.

300
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,880
Don't put pressure on him, right?

301
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,360
It's his birthday every day.

302
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,160
I'm so nervous.

303
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,960
Don't be nervous.

304
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,000
Really, no water.

305
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,840
Should I add some water?

306
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,640
You can drink it strategically.

307
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,840
I wonder if he's going to

308
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,320
a sense of ritual.

309
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,120
Yes.

310
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,480
What surprise?

311
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
What is it?

312
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There are many people who are very transformed.

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,720
Yes.

315
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,040
The window is open.

316
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
OK. Romantic is coming.

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,600
Why is the window open?

318
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,560
Because I want to watch that

319
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,720
Beijing Opera performance.

320
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,160
She's alone.

321
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,480
I've been to this shop.

322
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,080
A few times.

323
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,720
I often came here.

324
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,920
Who did you come with

325
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,840
Mom and dad.

326
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,320
I don't believe it.

327
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,000
I swear.

328
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,960
she thought he brought another girl here.

329
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,320
This is good.

330
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,560
Because he wants her to know his childhood.

331
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,040
Yes.

332
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,320
So it's very meaningful.

333
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,760
Yes.

334
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,400
Yes.

335
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,200
I understand his nervousness.

336
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,520
Maybe he's afraid that she doesn't like it.

337
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,640
Yes.

338
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
And he saw the list

339
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,160
in the list.

340
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,480
It's a bit noisy, to be honest.

341
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,280
Can you let her go down?

342
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,520
I want to talk.

343
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,440
But she's a bit noisy.

344
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,920
This is our second date.

345
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,320
Do you think

346
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
pick me?

347
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,360
In other words, it depends on the answer

348
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,600
or the answer?

349
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,560
It depends.

350
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,480
The latter.

351
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,360
It depends on the performance.

352
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,960
If

353
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,120
Go ahead.

354
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,720
I'll close the window first.

355
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,080
No one can disturb my date.

356
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,000
You two talk.

357
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Is there anyone else

358
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,200
Is there anyone else you want to know?

359
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
No.

360
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,400
In a relationship,

361
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
in love,

362
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,640
or

363
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,240
a receptive personality.

364
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,680
I may accept more than you.

365
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,960
But I will also

366
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,360
more.

367
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,920
For example,

368
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,960
70 percent.

369
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,560
60.

370
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,240
I don't know.

371
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,880
Do you know what I said?

372
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,040
You said you're devoted.

373
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,440
I mean 100 percent.

374
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,160
Sometimes it's not.

375
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,000
I said I was...

376
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,520
Serve.

377
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,920
Isn't it a bit sudden?

378
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,320
Come in.

379
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,400
The back is cold.

380
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,840
But you can't get it like this.

381
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,040
Why? Can't you get it for me?

382
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,800
Sophie.

383
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,000
I can get it for you.

384
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,240
Isn't it 30 or 40 percent

385
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,520
a dedicated personality?

386
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,400
I'm sorry.

387
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,720
I'll clip it.

388
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,760
This is so clever.

389
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,520
Yes.

390
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,120
Awesome.

391
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,920
Master.

392
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,640
Are you in love?

393
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,840
What do you think?

394
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,560
I don't know.

395
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
But I think

396
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,880
are usually lovers.

397
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,280
Right?

398
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,320
I'm obviously a romantic person.

399
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,880
including my mom and dad would say

400
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,080
that I'm special.

401
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,760
When I get stuck in the whirlpool of love,

402
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,120
I...

403
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,440
I can't help myself.

404
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,800
Really.

405
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,960
Eat.

406
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
Can you eat when I watch you eat?

407
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,600
No.

408
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,320
Why?

409
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,120
I'm nervous.

410
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,160
You said you weren't nervous.

411
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,680
Look at me.

412
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,240
Why am I not nervous?

413
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,840
I'll watch you eat while eating.

414
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,440
and watching you eat.

415
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,800
Your birthday

416
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,240
your birthday.

417
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,960
Again.

418
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
Too many.

419
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,880
We have to eat Peking Duck in Beijing.

420
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,880
I feel Harry.

421
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,120
I really want to

422
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,840
in front of the tower.

423
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Yes, I've been recording it.

424
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,040
Very much.

425
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,400
every ring.

426
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,200
You're shy.

427
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,360
You're shy.

428
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,840
What's wrong?

429
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,680
You're shy.

430
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm not shy.

431
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,680
and not nervous.

432
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
After the interview,

433
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,040
do you think I will choose you?

434
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,720
How many percent do you have?

435
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,440
That low.

436
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,160
So pessimistic.

437
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,400
Why?

438
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,960
I'm the kind of person

439
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,280
and tell me something,

440
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,080
I would take the initiative.

441
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,480
But I didn't receive any signal.

442
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,800
I still

443
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,840
I won't pretend to be fat

444
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,040
Not confident.

445
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,840
So,

446
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,920
some people need to

447
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,360
take the initiative.

448
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,960
Give me a hint.

449
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,560
One with big eyes narrowed.

450
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,760
You're good at flirting.

451
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,800
Didn't I ask you about the bracelet yesterday?

452
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,320
I went to buy you bracelets today.

453
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,440
So I got up so early.

454
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,320
There was a traffic jam.

455
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,720
You don't know how traffic is.

456
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,160
I haven't seen so many people in a long time.

457
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,080
And...

458
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,120
where did you buy it?

459
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,360
I bought it at Yonghe Palace.

460
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,720
Really

461
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,520
It takes a long queue.

462
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,680
Two hours.

463
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,280
It's just a meeting.

464
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,800
Thank you.

465
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,640
Green.

466
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,520
Thank you.

467
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,800
Tired.

468
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,720
So tired.

469
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,880
Touch my head.

470
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,840
Thank you.

471
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,880
Just so so

472
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,720
It must be hard.

473
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,920
I think many things

474
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,880
surprised me.

475
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,520
This kind of surprise

476
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,599
So cute.

477
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,960
So cute?

478
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,040
It's not that big

479
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,960
very grand.

480
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,880
Yes.

481
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,440
A small cake for two people.

482
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,200
Three.

483
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,320
Wait.

484
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,280
Great

485
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,800
Eat the noodles.

486
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,920
Longevity noodles.

487
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
It's not as good as your cooking.

488
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,280
Really?

489
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,520
You're so good at comforting me.

490
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,680
He started to respond to Tata.

491
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,480
Yes.

492
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,200
Single people study hard

493
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,720
Really.

494
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,560
Right?

495
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,120
Flower.

496
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,840
Do you know what peony is?

497
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,880
This is peony.

498
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,520
It's pretty.

499
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,400
Three.

500
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,640
The finale...

501
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,600
Don't change anything.

502
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,520
Awesome! Harry is awesome!

503
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,120
All surprises

504
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
So attentive.

505
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,320
Harry is showing

506
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,560
how much he cares about this date.

507
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,000
From a girl's perspective,

508
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,960
it should be a bonus.

509
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,240
I think what you did

510
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,120
to say

511
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,840
is quite important.

512
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,200
Sometimes what we did

513
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,760
we did.

514
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,280
Let others know in time

515
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,520
there are many details that others don't know.

516
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,320
We admire giving silently.

517
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Yes.

518
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,200
But don't keep silent.

519
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Momo, you're also exhausted.

520
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,480
He doesn't know you're more consuming.

521
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,600
I'm envious of him saying everything.

522
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,840
I can't do that.

523
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,120
But what he said makes me comfortable.

524
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Some people

525
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,720
would say, "Look."

526
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,560
I'm proud.

527
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,160
Yes, I'm proud.

528
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
I've done so much.

529
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,880
but you still don't understand.

530
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,800
Yes.

531
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,120
But he sounded so natural and peaceful.

532
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,960
This is good.

533
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,680
Yes, you have to say this.

534
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,560
In the end,

535
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,840
she didn't know.

536
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,760
She didn't react.

537
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,240
You still think that I've done so much

538
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,760
She doesn't feel it at all.

539
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,960
"Love top student."

540
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,520
Let's go.

541
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,160
Can it do it?

542
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,920
Should I hug it?

543
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,800
It can...

544
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,120
bring a dog here.

545
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,240
You know what?

546
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,640
the girls like

547
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
that girls like.

548
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,120
Yes.

549
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,960
Stay here, Bai.

550
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,400
But it's not overloaded.

551
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,040
It won't make you feel

552
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,880
feel pressured.

553
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,240
Yes.

554
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,720
Is it enough (Surprise)

555
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,000
I thought about it for a long time yesterday.

556
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,560
It reminds me of four in the morning, you know?

557
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,600
It's stressful.

558
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,800
You make me a little embarrassed.

559
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,880
His body is leaning over.

560
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,200
Find a chance to kiss him.

561
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,920
Hurry up.

562
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,080
Let's go.

563
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,040
Stop laughing.

564
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,800
Welcome.

565
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,440
Hello.

566
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:17,960
Welcome to

567
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,840
the Natural Education Theme Hall at the Startle.

568
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,160
We can show you around.

569
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,720
Can we do something now?

570
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,600
Yes.

571
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,040
We can make some specimens here.

572
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,360
Let's take a look

573
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,480
and then decide.

574
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,560
Our main move is to go upstairs first.

575
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,800
Next floor.

576
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,320
I smell insects.

577
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,480
Like this ORK.

578
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,720
Like this.

579
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,000
The biggest feature of our centre.

580
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,480
These three pots are...

581
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,920
Chameleons.

582
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:45,720
Yes.

583
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,360
This is a Colorful Chameleon.

584
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,440
It's also the best color

585
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,680
in the world.

586
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,840
This is a national second-level protective animal.

587
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,840
This year is not the Snake Year, right?

588
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,560
It's the Snake year.

589
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,800
It's a representative species.

590
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,280
The snakes here

591
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
This experience

592
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,600
I think we can all try.

593
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,520
He brought me here. I can smash this shop.

594
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,360
It's fine.

595
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,480
The tennis python

596
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,280
in China.

597
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,840
It's a protective animal.

598
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,960
Really?

599
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,120
Then why is it called the tennis python?

600
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,840
Because it was frightened

601
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,960
or in danger.

602
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,840
It reacts like a turtle shell.

603
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,440
It shrinks into a ball shape.

604
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,520
So I call it a tennis python.

605
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,840
Harry shows his boyfriend power.

606
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,800
He's quite cute.

607
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,440
Here.

608
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,360
No.

609
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,960
Put it back.

610
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,560
Here.

611
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,640
Really?

612
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,720
I can't.

613
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,480
I think the eyelashes guard the palace is the cutest.

614
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,320
But I didn't raise it.

615
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,440
I'll show you something more interesting

616
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:41,960
Interesting.

617
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,840
Fat tail guard the palace.

618
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,680
No, Titan Guard.

619
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,880
It's too ugly.

620
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,400
But it feels good.

621
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,680
It's definitely better than eyelashes guarding the palace.

622
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,880
I don't want to touch it.

623
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,920
It may not look good.

624
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,200
But the texture is the texture of silk.

625
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,840
Yes.

626
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,920
They dare touch each other.

627
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Yes.

628
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
I knew it would want to dance.

629
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,160
It's okay.

630
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,640
Why do they have this skill?

631
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,280
Because their origin

632
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,680
jumped from this tree to another tree.

633
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,040
Yes, they're just sitting on a tree.

634
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,840
Here you go.

635
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,600
I don't want it.

636
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,560
You don't want it?

637
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,800
I don't know what to say.

638
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,760
He's a bit ugly.

639
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
You scared me.

640
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Let's go this way.

641
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,560
There are some

642
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,960
in this area.

643
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,440
Maybe girls like it.

644
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,520
Let me show you one.

645
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,920
At present,

646
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,080
in the market.

647
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,840
Dragon Cat.

648
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,800
My scientific name is Mouse.

649
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
It's also called South America Chestnut Mouse.

650
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,320
It's so active.

651
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,680
This is cute.

652
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,160
Cute.

653
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,200
Three, two, one.

654
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,160
Just like you, Iron Head.

655
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,120
What a strange feeling.

656
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,320
Tata is amazing.

657
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,600
The first reaction is

658
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,960
I was a little against and scared.

659
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,200
We seldom

660
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,720
in life.

661
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,480
But I think he basically

662
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,560
know everything.

663
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,080
And many of them have been raised by themselves.

664
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,800
The experience is very new.

665
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
Look, they're in sync.

666
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,800
Yes.

667
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,560
Let's go.

668
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,240
After the overall talk,

669
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,480
quite good.

670
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,640
It's not as awkward and nervous as before.

671
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,320
He really wants to give me

672
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,880
a memorable birthday.

673
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,800
He wants to make me happy.

674
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,120
And he will put what he wants

675
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,800
to his actions.

676
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,560
Dating Tata

677
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,920
I was very happy.

678
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,040
I can't tell you about this date.

679
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,200
100% satisfied.

680
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,600
But it's a very good approach.

681
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,240
It's a date that keeps going up.

682
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,840
I like it.

683
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,920
She's already so happy.

684
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,240
It's worth it.

685
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,520
It's worth doing everything.

686
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,120
Yes.

687
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,800
I think he dedicated

688
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,000
a perfect date like a textbook.

689
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,240
Really

690
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,160
Yes.

691
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,600
Awesome.

692
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,400
This one.

693
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,200
is impeccable.

694
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,120
And Harry is very straightforward.

695
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,600
If there's space between the two,

696
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,960
he took a step forward

697
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,440
and keep approaching the tower.

698
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,280
and give her a signal.

699
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
Like dancing.

700
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,960
Yes.

701
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,560
Dating tango

702
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,000
Always moving forward

703
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,880
A bulldozer.

704
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,440
Yes.

705
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,680
I've been pushing.

706
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,920
Yes, move forward.

707
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,160
Awesome.

708
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,000
Good evening.

709
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,920
It's too cold.

710
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,560
Thank you.

711
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,240
Did you miss me?

712
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,720
What?

713
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,440
Did you miss me?

714
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,160
Yes.

715
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,960
Linlin!

716
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,120
I've been waiting for you.

717
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,440
What's wrong?

718
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
Waiting for you.

719
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,320
because you were waiting for us?

720
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,720
Do you know what we were doing today?

721
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
What did we do?

722
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Let me show you later.

723
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,080
What did I do today?

724
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,440
Show.

725
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,600
Wait.

726
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,320
I have a gift for you. Wait.

727
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,840
It's not me.

728
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,960
I just took off my clothes.

729
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,480
Not me.

730
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,720
I'm going to put something down.

731
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,800
and give her a gift.

732
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,440
Fatty.

733
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,360
Good evening.

734
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,480
What is this?

735
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,080
I made this.

736
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,480
You didn't even look at it.

737
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,040
Let me see what it is.

738
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,880
ecological tank.

739
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,880
Ling'er.

740
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,360
Did you see it?

741
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,960
Did you see the gift I brought you?

742
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,400
The ecosystem box.

743
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,920
Are you kidding me?

744
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,360
You two are awesome.

745
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,400
Do you have any male friends?

746
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,840
You said it was good?

747
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,200
A very good man.

748
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,920
a very good male friend.

749
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,800
How good are you?

750
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,000
So good that

751
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,520
she asked me to think about it.

752
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,400
How?

753
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,480
you and your male friends

754
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,080
are friends.

755
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,440
What are they talking about?

756
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,320
About what?

757
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,040
you think we can't talk anymore?

758
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,080
I never talk to her.

759
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,880
I only talk when I'm out.

760
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,240
Where are you?

761
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,040
Are we there?

762
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,560
Or if there's any problem,

763
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,880
I won't look for her.

764
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,040
I don't look for anyone when I encounter problems.

765
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,960
I will digest it myself.

766
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,200
I won't find anyone else.

767
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,760
So you will...

768
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,160
It's impossible to be alone.

769
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,080
How do you know what I'm asking?

770
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,920
It's impossible to be alone.

771
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,880
What is it?

772
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,360
I want to tell you something.

773
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,200
But I can't tell you.

774
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Tell me.

775
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,120
What is it?

776
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,560
What is it?

777
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,520
Acting cute.

778
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,880
It's okay.

779
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,320
I didn't ask you to tell me what it is.

780
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,160
About what?

781
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,920
About what?

782
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,720
It's about the house.

783
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,240
Thank you.

784
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Tell me about the model next time.

785
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,640
What?

786
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,160
Tell me next time.

787
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,480
about your model.

788
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,680
I'm fine.

789
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,440
Thank you.

790
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,960
It's the weekend.

791
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,760
Let's have fun together.

792
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,480
It's like a "bomb".

793
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,760
A is one.

794
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,560
Wang is fourteen.

795
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,600
The king is 15.

796
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,280
For example, I got 4.

797
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,080
So I started to say one.

798
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,680
You can tell a number or two numbers.

799
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,480
Whoever calls "Lei" will lose.

800
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,960
Got it.

801
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,320
If anyone loses,

802
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,680
we have to follow this

803
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,720
on this.

804
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,440
OK. Come on.

805
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,320
The first round.

806
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,800
Two, three.

807
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,640
Awesome.

808
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,400
I choose grapefruit juice and grape juice.

809
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,080
Two, three.

810
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,040
Four.

811
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,160
Five, six.

812
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,640
Seven.

813
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,440
It exploded.

814
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,960
You're blown up.

815
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,080
I got fruit cubes and soda.

816
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,720
OK. Come on.

817
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,160
This number is a little difficult.

818
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:08,920
Three.

819
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,480
Four.

820
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:09,880
Five.

821
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,320
Six.

822
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,040
Seven.

823
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,920
Nine.

824
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,640
Ten.

825
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,880
Twelve.

826
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,520
Thirteen.

827
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,760
Fourteen.

828
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,840
That's me.

829
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,760
Fifteen.

830
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,920
Yes.

831
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,600
You exploded.

832
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,520
The king is 15.

833
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,400
This is...

834
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,480
Fried wine.

835
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,440
You know what?

836
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,360
It's so easy to come here.

837
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,240
Yes.

838
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,080
Not bad.

839
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,960
Sure enough, everything tastes good.

840
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,000
Amazing.

841
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,440
I was “blown”.

842
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
I found that through this drinking game,

843
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,760
I feel that everyone is more relaxed

844
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,960
They're more relaxed.

845
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,440
They are really good at playing.

846
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,040
They drink differently every time.

847
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,400
Yes.

848
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,200
This game looks very interesting.

849
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,320
I've got it.

850
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,960
I can try it with my friends next time.

851
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,760
Jiang Dunhao,

852
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,360
you need to stock up more fruit cubes.

853
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,800
Next time when we get together,

854
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,120
we'll mix and fry and play. Let's get high.

855
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,440
OK?

856
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:04,960
Okay.

857
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,320
Okay.

858
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,520
No problem.

859
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,880
Let's go.

860
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,440
A big bag.

861
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:16,960
What?

862
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,000
I mean big bags

863
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,320
It's really shopping.

864
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,720
It's okay.

865
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,920
We brought you some gifts.

866
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,760
No one cares

867
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,360
No one cares

868
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,400
I brought you food.

869
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,080
Okay.

870
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,680
Where have you been?

871
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,640
What took you so long?

872
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,440
Yes.

873
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,000
Far.

874
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,520
Very far.

875
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,400
Traffic jam.

876
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,320
There's a doorbell.

877
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,920
No mission.

878
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,720
There are flowers.

879
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,520
There are flowers.

880
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,080
Yes.

881
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,040
Tata.

882
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,280
And flowers.

883
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,000
What?

884
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,080
And a card.

885
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,800
Really

886
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,440
I'm so jealous.

887
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,160
Why isn't Terri here?

888
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,440
Tata, happy birthday.

889
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,760
Brother.

890
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,160
I'm so jealous.

891
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,440
Tata's Life album.

892
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,880
Come on.

893
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,960
We need to continue.

894
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,760
What?

895
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,560
It's going to be revealed.

896
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Finally.

897
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,360
This is her.

898
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,560
Liberation.

899
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,040
Tell us.

900
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,840
Don't read it yourself.

901
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,360
Take a look.

902
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,800
She was so cute when she was young.

903
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,720
Kitty.

904
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,760
I don’t remember this photo.

905
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,320
So cute.

906
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,320
This is the photo they took for me

907
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,520
they took for me.

908
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,760
I still remember I choked on water when I went down the sea.

909
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,520
This is a photo taken

910
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,400
when I was a kid.

911
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,640
I learned it for six or seven years when I was young.

912
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,560
folk dance.

913
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,640
This was before.

914
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,960
I didn't see it.

915
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,120
So ugly.

916
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,400
Stop looking.

917
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,520
I didn't see it.

918
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,120
Let me see it again.

919
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,560
So ugly.

920
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,360
Stop looking, please.

921
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,640
Take a look.

922
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,480
Don't act like an elder brother.

923
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,000
I'll expose you right away.

924
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,360
Nice.

925
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,960
Beautiful.

926
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,160
Yes it's pretty

927
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
When you have long hair,

928
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,880
She's always so thin.

929
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,720
This is when the show is on.

930
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,400
So cool.

931
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,000
Awesome.

932
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,800
This is the photo on the press conference.

933
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,160
No wonder it looks so familiar.

934
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,040
Have you seen it?

935
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,960
Really?

936
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,680
This is my mom and dad.

937
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,920
and my brother.

938
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,880
Let me see what your brother looks like.

939
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Your brother?

940
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,960
Let me see.

941
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,520
Okay.

942
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,320
My brother and I are next.

943
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,480
I should be three years old.

944
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,600
When I was a kid,

945
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,360
I liked to be three

946
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,080
Because you're three years old.

947
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,280
His brother looked like

948
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,240
looks like Tae-seo now.

949
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,040
Yes.

950
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,280
The hairstyle was the same as now.

951
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,080
The bangs were welded.

952
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,640
Welding.

953
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,160
Yes, iron bangs.

954
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,120
Okay. And...

955
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,080
What is this?

956
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,160
This is

957
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,800
my brothers and I.

958
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,360
We've been eating since childhood.

959
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,440
We won't be modest to each other.

960
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,960
We just want this piece of cake.

961
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,080
What is this?

962
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,160
I found it.

963
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,920
He's not Tae-ri.

964
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,560
My brother.

965
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,560
I fooled you all.

966
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,280
So this flower

967
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,720
is my real brother.

968
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,600
I was fooled.

969
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,840
Harry is the worst.

970
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,000
You've been nice to him for so long.

971
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,600
You ate my egg tart for free.

972
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,440
Yes. Egg tarts.

973
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,400
Don't tell anyone.

974
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,800
I only gave it to you.

975
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,960
I don't want to give it to anyone now.

976
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,160
Don't tell others.

977
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,200
Really?

978
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,960
Yes.

979
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,120
Tae-seo isn't her brother.

980
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,600
I was quite shocked.

981
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,600
My first reaction was that I didn't believe it.

982
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,680
But the more they said it,

983
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,320
the evidence was in front of you.

984
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,480
I have to believe it.

985
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,680
I think

986
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,320
Think about the past few days.

987
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,840
It was really fun.

988
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,680
I was surprised

989
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,480
But because

990
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,400
Tata told me two days ago

991
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
I have something to tell you in two days.

992
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,040
A little bit of 20 percent

993
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,160
to 30 percent.

994
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,120
But I'm sure

995
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,160
Surprise is more than my guess.

996
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,680
Yes.

997
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,600
Is that what you want to tell me?

998
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,840
Really.

999
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,800
You made me speechless.

1000
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,160
What are you talking about?

1001
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,280
Next.

1002
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,200
Look, this is what her brother looks like now.

1003
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,040
This is a photo

1004
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,360
outside the show.

1005
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,800
Let me see.

1006
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,239
Let me see.

1007
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,440
So handsome.

1008
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,719
The soup is embarrassing again.

1009
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,600
Really

1010
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,120
This is so cool.

1011
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,159
Tae-ri or my brother?

1012
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,679
Why are my ears blocked?

1013
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,840
So handsome.

1014
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,679
My brother and I

1015
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,480
He's a model too.

1016
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,159
He doesn't have time.

1017
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,560
It looks great.

1018
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,199
So pretty.

1019
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,040
Get off work, bro.

1020
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,159
I've been pretending these days.

1021
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,800
No, I know her brother very well.

1022
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,480
I...

1023
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,760
But we didn't know

1024
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,400
we would meet here.

1025
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,360
Yes.

1026
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,040
Her brother took her

1027
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,360
had a few meals with me.

1028
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,719
Only a lot of us.

1029
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,040
Look me in the eyes and say.

1030
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
You didn't lie to us, did you?

1031
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,360
Does it look like it?

1032
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,120
No.

1033
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,600
No.

1034
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,440
Indeed not.

1035
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,120
This is similar.

1036
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,719
So will the post-production come?

1037
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,080
This question is...

1038
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,560
Guess.

1039
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,600
Yes.

1040
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,280
Is it possible that two people come in every time

1041
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,760
the situation will be turbulent?

1042
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,120
We will.

1043
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,360
Do you want him to come?

1044
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
Yes.

1045
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,600
The soup is starting to get depressed again.

1046
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,680
The soup is warm.

1047
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,160
I can't sleep at night.

1048
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,680
Just kidding.

1049
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,560
I hope

1050
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,200
we want one more person to take care of Tata.

1051
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,040
I'm a good talker.

1052
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,080
Even if it's a joke,

1053
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,920
he will take it seriously.

1054
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,600
Yes.

1055
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,760
Okay.

1056
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,200
In my eyes,

1057
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,720
you've always been kind

1058
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,480
and considerate.

1059
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,120
and considerate.

1060
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,680
Sometimes, you'd rather suffer losses

1061
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,760
than let others suffer losses.

1062
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,160
But I want to say I'm one year older today.

1063
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,760
Happy birthday.

1064
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,640
Think more about yourself.

1065
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,800
Maybe in your memory,

1066
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,520
I liked teasing you since childhood.

1067
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,000
I only know how to grab your ice cream.

1068
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,920
and never shed tears for you.

1069
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,680
But actually,

1070
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,920
the day we sent you to college,

1071
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,760
When we parted,

1072
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,440
I quietly wiped my tears.

1073
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,520
This is the first time you left home.

1074
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,040
Go to a strange city

1075
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,760
to face life alone.

1076
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,480
Because of my work,

1077
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,000
because of my work.

1078
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,960
I'm worried about you

1079
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,640
I was worried about you.

1080
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,120
But I thought my sister was so good.

1081
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,080
and excellent,

1082
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,560
I'm sure I can get along with everyone.

1083
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,320
So I don't want to

1084
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
I don't need to care too much about the result.

1085
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,040
and neglect the happiness in the journey.

1086
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,400
and experience every day in the house.

1087
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,040
I believe in the end

1088
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,440
in the end.

1089
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,000
Happy birthday, sister.

1090
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,880
Are you touched?

1091
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,160
I feel a little touched.

1092
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,840
It's sour.

1093
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,240
It's okay.

1094
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,280
We're okay.

1095
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,360
Good.

1096
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,480
It's so pretty.

1097
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,160
Thank you.

1098
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,320
It's so pretty.

1099
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,920
To be honest, it's a little short.

1100
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,320
Not as short as mine.

1101
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,720
Yes, his three lines.

1102
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,720
Really?

1103
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,400
I think it's simple.

1104
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,680
But it's good enough.

1105
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,640
He is

1106
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,840
who can't express his emotions.

1107
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,080
When reading this letter,

1108
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,760
I was still touched.

1109
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,440
I still miss him.

1110
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,520
Okay, my turn.

1111
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,600
My turn.

1112
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,720
Guess if I'm a sister or a sister.

1113
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,920
Sister.

1114
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Sister.

1115
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,800
Sister

1116
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,320
Definitely.

1117
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,720
Okay.

1118
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,600
You win.

1119
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,320
I told you.

1120
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,560
So will your sister come?

1121
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,920
She asked me. Let me introduce her first.

1122
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,600
This is a photo of me when I was about one year old.

1123
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,960
So cute.

1124
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,040
Next one.

1125
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,440
Let me take a look.

1126
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,520
Let's not look at this.

1127
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,200
Take a look.

1128
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Look.

1129
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,040
I'm really ugly.

1130
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,680
I can't stand it.

1131
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,800
It's okay.

1132
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,840
A flash.

1133
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,240
This is not like you.

1134
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,320
This is my high school.

1135
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,640
I went on a trip with my sister.

1136
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
She took it for me.

1137
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,880
It doesn't look like her.

1138
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,200
It's so different.

1139
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,440
He looks like a good student.

1140
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,640
Yes, he looks like a straight-A student.

1141
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,320
Yes.

1142
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,120
I went on a business trip with you before

1143
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,200
It's a bit similar now

1144
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,560
Yes, my sister took it for me.

1145
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,200
This one.

1146
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,080
This is so cool.

1147
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,760
Work photos.

1148
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,920
The New York Fashion Week.

1149
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,800
It was the first show.

1150
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,720
Alexander.

1151
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,320
Everyone on the stage

1152
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,880
They're all here.

1153
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,560
There are many supermodels.

1154
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,440
This is the magazine I took before.

1155
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,040
This is for Elle Mon Ye.

1156
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,680
Cool.

1157
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,480
This is the scene of my shoot.

1158
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,360
during the shoot.

1159
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,400
Nice.

1160
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,360
They are all formal clothes.

1161
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,320
Because this is my style.

1162
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,120
Actually he and my brother

1163
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,200
are the same model.

1164
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,560
They often compete for a client.

1165
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,440
Like this.

1166
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:22,920
competitors.

1167
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,560
They are competing.

1168
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,080
Project?

1169
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,520
This time, I came in his place again.

1170
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,920
This is my cat.

1171
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,000
German.

1172
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,960
I have two Germans.

1173
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,880
I took a picture with my cat.

1174
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,960
So cute.

1175
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,560
This is my sister.

1176
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,200
And me.

1177
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,120
So cool.

1178
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,080
So cool.

1179
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,880
So cool.

1180
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Susu, do you remember

1181
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,480
when I had dinner with you,

1182
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,160
Didn't you want to be a match?

1183
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,720
My sister is a matching artist.

1184
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,800
She was the editor-in-chief of the magazine.

1185
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,760
No wonder.

1186
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,320
If you really want to do this,

1187
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,440
she may give you some good advice.

1188
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,400
Yes.

1189
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,400
The soup is still on the face.

1190
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,200
And this is

1191
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,160
and my parents

1192
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,440
with my parents.

1193
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,880
Because my family doesn't like taking photos.

1194
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,600
So I didn't have many photos when I was young.

1195
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,320
Yes.

1196
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,800
That's all.

1197
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,360
(You're recording the show.)

1198
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,760
How do you feel now?

1199
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,720
When you left for Beijing,

1200
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,760
I was teasing you

1201
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,400
Don't go there. The crew found you're not special.

1202
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,360
and get rejected.

1203
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,920
and came back in a daze.

1204
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,720
You were very dissatisfied.

1205
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,480
and sent me

1206
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,280
the screenshots of others praising you.

1207
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,480
and say,

1208
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,600
Who are you looking down on?

1209
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,200
So arrogant.

1210
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,760
My sister and I always argue.

1211
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,000
To be honest,

1212
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,560
when you told me the process of the recording,

1213
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,680
I was nervous

1214
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,440
I was nervous.

1215
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,360
As a staff behind the scenes,

1216
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,960
I always feel that

1217
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,560
with me.

1218
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,200
But I believe

1219
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,320
you're used to being in front of the camera.

1220
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,400
You'll get used to it soon.

1221
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,240
Both my parents and I

1222
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,800
we've been restraining

1223
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,880
the emotions.

1224
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,200
It's pouting.

1225
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,320
All you say is mocking.

1226
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,640
But the real thoughts are hidden in our hearts.

1227
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,760
We love each other with actions.

1228
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,080
I don't know

1229
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,240
is a little cheesy.

1230
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,600
In my eyes,

1231
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,880
what kind of brother are you?

1232
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,160
Maybe

1233
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,280
we have never talked about this

1234
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,960
we never talked about this together.

1235
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,280
When I was young,

1236
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,920
I always thought all the elders in the family

1237
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,760
is biased.

1238
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,440
Mom said

1239
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,120
"Your brother is younger than you, so you have to give in to him."

1240
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,880
It keeps lingering in my head.

1241
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,480
I felt very uneasy.

1242
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
But that experience

1243
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,120
made me completely forget about it.

1244
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,600
The boss always gets criticized.

1245
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,400
I forgot how old I was.

1246
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Maybe we were both in primary school.

1247
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,800
Grandma scolded me for something.

1248
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,480
I started crying because I felt wronged.

1249
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,680
I thought

1250
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,160
you couldn't escape a beating,

1251
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,080
you stood in front of me.

1252
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,200
Then you cried with me.

1253
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
and told Grandma not to beat me.

1254
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,640
You may not remember this,

1255
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,440
But...

1256
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,240
But I remember

1257
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,800
they said

1258
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,960
Wait.

1259
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,320
It's okay.

1260
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,800
It's okay.

1261
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,280
But I remember they say

1262
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,360
will fade away as time goes by.

1263
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:29,960
What you can remember

1264
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,000
must have strong feelings.

1265
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,760
That touched me so much

1266
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,800
A little man will protect you

1267
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,920
It's good to have a younger brother.

1268
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,720
So in my eyes,

1269
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,960
besides being handsome,

1270
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,440
but also sincere, hard-working.

1271
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,120
diligent, wisdom and responsible.

1272
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,920
Although I brought you into the model industry,

1273
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,280
you made the achievements

1274
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,120
step by step.

1275
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,200
I'm proud of you as my brother.

1276
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,560
Now you can take care of yourself

1277
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,360
and take good care of yourself.

1278
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,040
Very good.

1279
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,720
Let me tell you.

1280
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,640
Every time

1281
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,760
when I mention you in front of my friends,

1282
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,040
in front of my friends.

1283
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,160
They even recommend you

1284
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,920
recommend you

1285
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,480
a pro model who is positive.

1286
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,400
Hold on.

1287
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,800
I'm about to cry. What should I do?

1288
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,400
Let me take a break.

1289
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,200
It's okay. I'll be fine.

1290
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,600
I believe that's what my parents think.

1291
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,920
Although they communicate with us

1292
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,160
are all denial.

1293
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,040
criticizing education.

1294
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,160
But in front of relatives, they always say

1295
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,960
we were good.

1296
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,760
My sister and I think

1297
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,320
my parents have been taking care of us.

1298
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,360
They didn't give us any sense of love.

1299
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,360
But maybe

1300
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,000
grow up without encouragement.

1301
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,080
They don't know how to express love.

1302
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,720
So after a long time, I've let it go.

1303
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,400
I'm happy to have you

1304
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
I'm glad to have you as my brother.

1305
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,560
We all rely on ourselves

1306
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,400
a satisfactory life.

1307
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,160
You can't change others.

1308
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,320
Even the closest person,

1309
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,040
I can only digest it myself.

1310
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,320
This thing

1311
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,920
It's not bad now, right?

1312
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,000
As time makes us mature,

1313
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,440
I don't think we're siblings.

1314
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,680
We are more like

1315
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,160
who have known each other for years.

1316
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,120
can have a trip

1317
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,960
and go on a trip.

1318
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,120
I also think about buying gifts for my parents

1319
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,240
when I buy gifts for my parents.

1320
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,320
But in love,

1321
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,560
we are still like siblings.

1322
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,880
(We're still looking for)

1323
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,160
in the sea of people.

1324
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,520
I often tell my friends

1325
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,560
the standard of finding a boyfriend

1326
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,400
should be based on my younger brother.

1327
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,640
There will be a crush male guest.

1328
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,320
It's my first time to look at my brother.

1329
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,240
But the funny thing is

1330
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,640
the standard line is a bit high.

1331
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,400
This is also a compliment for the change

1332
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,960
Hee hee

1333
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,320
What do you think?

1334
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,800
In my heart, you have an extraordinary position, right?

1335
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,800
That's enough.

1336
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,800
It's been a month.

1337
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,360
I've been filming for weeks,

1338
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,800
I'm really impressed

1339
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,520
It's really amazing.

1340
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,040
Please give me a round of applause.

1341
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,720
Finally, my silly little brother,

1342
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,840
My parents and I will always support you.

1343
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,040
Come on.

1344
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,400
I'm so happy.

1345
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,040
I really couldn't control myself.

1346
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,000
It's okay.

1347
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,200
My letter is also my brother.

1348
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,640
He stood in front of me and protected me.

1349
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,840
I wrote it carefully.

1350
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,920
This letter my sister wrote to me

1351
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,960
has a huge gap

1352
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,440
a huge gap.

1353
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,960
My family is not good at expressing it.

1354
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,960
We may not even type

1355
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,000
say this.

1356
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,960
For the first time,

1357
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,360
I couldn't hold myself back.

1358
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,480
I think

1359
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,040
I have to take that step.

1360
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,000
I think we still need to

1361
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,960
to express our love.

1362
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,320
If I have something to say to you later

1363
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:45,760
Like before,

1364
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,240
I might keep it to myself.

1365
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,040
But I may not

1366
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,000
express my feelings in the future.

1367
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,640
Girls' words are really delicate.

1368
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,480
Because my sister

1369
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,040
never said this to me.

1370
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,040
My family wouldn't say that.

1371
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,200
So I can't hold it.

1372
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,520
Almost.

1373
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,320
My brother didn't say that to me.

1374
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,680
I cried a lot that day. 1992.

1375
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,000
Yes.

1376
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,440
It's raining heavily.

1377
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,200
Who cried so loudly that day?

1378
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,800
That's true.

1379
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,960
Because my brother is good at it.

1380
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:18,840
we'll lose a lot.

1381
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,360
Neither Tata nor I saw it.

1382
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,800
Yes, you missed eight.

1383
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,120
Why don't you read it again?

1384
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,760
After reading the letter,

1385
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,520
I never opened it again.

1386
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,000
Me too.

1387
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,080
I won't open it either.

1388
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,080
I was going to take a photo.

1389
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,120
but I didn't have the courage to open it.

1390
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,880
We're not good at expressing our feelings.

1391
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,960
We have to.

1392
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,520
When Tarri was young,

1393
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,080
Maybe my family values men more than women.

1394
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,120
like me.

1395
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,440
The younger brother may be favored.

1396
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,640
And when she gets scolded,

1397
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,240
the younger brother will stand up to protect her.

1398
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,880
I think he's talking about my story.

1399
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,920
I resonated with him.

1400
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,120
So when he said that,

1401
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,960
I looked at my brothers.

1402
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,640
Then we looked at each other.

1403
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,160
Because I look at my brothers.

1404
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,840
Actually, both of us are so good now.

1405
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,240
I have something to tell you.

1406
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,120
Tell me.

1407
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,560
It wasn't Tae-ri who interviewed you.

1408
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,320
It's your brother.

1409
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,840
I knew it.

1410
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,760
I guessed it just now.

1411
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,640
What are you doing?

1412
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,280
Didn't you guess it during the interview?

1413
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:24,760
No.

1414
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,120
I really didn't.

1415
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,640
Harry, did you guess it?

1416
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,080
Actually, I think

1417
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,440
during the process.

1418
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,000
Any doubts?

1419
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,320
Yes.

1420
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,840
Because every time I ask him about Tae-seo,

1421
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,480
about you,

1422
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,160
he said

1423
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,320
he didn't know, right?

1424
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,000
It's not that he doesn't know.

1425
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,160
Let him ask you.

1426
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,560
He said you should ask him yourself.

1427
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:39,800
Yes.

1428
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,760
Actually, he knows nothing about me.

1429
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:41,840
Yes.

1430
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,400
How interesting.

1431
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,600
I told you my little secret.

1432
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
What secret?

1433
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,240
That's it.

1434
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,240
I told you.

1435
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,360
No.

1436
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,760
I've added more for you.

1437
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,920
You?

1438
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,640
Didn't I add the interview for you?

1439
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,640
You don't know.

1440
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,200
I think someone with a brain

1441
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,560
You should know.

1442
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,560
Bye.

1443
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,600
I learned it from Harry.

1444
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,840
Use your eyes

1445
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,320
and body language.

1446
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,440
He's like this.

1447
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,000
But we kept a little distance.

1448
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,480
But it's close.

1449
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,000
Yes.

1450
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,320
Everything is just right.

1451
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,800
The ambiguous distance.

1452
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,400
Yeah, we can't get too close.

1453
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,160
Because some people

1454
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,840
can't judge the social distance.

1455
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,280
He's so close to people.

1456
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,920
It's really awkward for others.

1457
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,880
They always look at each other.

1458
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,680
Stay away from me.

1459
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,760
My eyes are a little blurred.

1460
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,720
It's coming down.

1461
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,480
Get some water.

1462
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,880
The soup doesn't feel good.

1463
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,560
It's good.

1464
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,280
I'm so happy.

1465
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,160
Can't you tell?

1466
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,640
I can't.

1467
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
Are you nervous tomorrow?

1468
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,920
Whatever.

1469
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,320
What happened?

1470
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,120
I can't tell you.

1471
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,840
We need to care about him.

1472
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,040
I'm going to sleep.

1473
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,120
I don't want to talk.

1474
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,240
He ignores his sister.

1475
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,080
He's so angry.

1476
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,040
I'm really angry.

1477
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,960
I can see.

1478
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,960
But for what?

1479
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,760
It's different

1480
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,320
When I was sitting,

1481
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,080
he was different

1482
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:25,920
he's different.

1483
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,240
Maybe

1484
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,320
because of Susu.

1485
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,080
Is it the photo album of Tata?

1486
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,600
What?

1487
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,600
Don't you have

1488
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,120
Tata's brother?

1489
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,520
Who said he wanted her brother to come?

1490
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,800
And Susu said yes.

1491
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,000
But I think

1492
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,760
I think it's okay.

1493
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,560
But I can remember

1494
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,320
about him.

1495
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,680
His sister understands him.

1496
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,680
So handsome.

1497
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,000
Do you want him to come?

1498
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,880
Yes.

1499
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,320
I know a lot

1500
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,920
I know a lot of things.

1501
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,560
But maybe I just

1502
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,720
because things have been so tense these days.

1503
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,480
and I didn't get the correct feedback I thought.

1504
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,800
So I will be very tense.

1505
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,600
I can't be so insecure.

1506
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,480
It'll be painful.

1507
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,440
He's suffering from loss and loss.

1508
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,480
Yes.

1509
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,000
Susu is very simple.

1510
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,800
She's just joking.

1511
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,400
Cool.

1512
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,200
Come on.

1513
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,680
Yes.

1514
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,400
But the soup is used to

1515
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,720
to others.

1516
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,440
In a relationship,

1517
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,640
he also wants

1518
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,640
such flawless emotions.

1519
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,400
But it gives pressure to each other.

1520
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,400
Yes.

1521
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,960
In psychology,

1522
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,400
in psychology.

1523
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,880
He always thinks too much

1524
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,720
and lack communication.

1525
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,600
He always thinks

1526
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,840
if he's not good enough.

1527
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,760
He's like a spider web.

1528
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,200
The net will get bigger and bigger.

1529
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,320
The more he thinks,

1530
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,520
the more complicated it is.

1531
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,520
If you meet someone

1532
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,200
in love,

1533
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,920
you'll suddenly feel insecure.

1534
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,680
Like soup?

1535
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,800
I think this is born.

1536
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,840
Sometimes there are.

1537
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,440
No means no.

1538
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,080
It's my own.

1539
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,880
It's like I communicate with my friends.

1540
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,280
In a relationship,

1541
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,600
in a relationship.

1542
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,720
I suddenly found that

1543
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,760
a sense of security.

1544
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,440
He was born with a sense of security.

1545
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,680
Yes.

1546
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,680
How can I make you feel insecure?

1547
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,920
Maybe

1548
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,280
all the reactions

1549
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,880
all the time.

1550
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,520
One day, suddenly,

1551
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,040
Change?

1552
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,600
Change or change.

1553
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,160
I thought I had been controlling

1554
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,360
these extreme things.

1555
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,160
I have another

1556
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,280
very rational.

1557
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,800
I've been pulling it like this.

1558
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,560
That's why I'm not as extreme as my brother.

1559
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,000
Soup, you have to walk out on your own.

1560
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,840
We said you can do it.

1561
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,680
We can't play this game well either.

1562
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,160
Good luck, Soup.

1563
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,040
Go, Soup!

1564
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,320
I hope everyone like you can do it.

1565
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,280
Yes.

1566
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,600
I want to ask you a question.

1567
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,640
What is it?

1568
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,480
You know what the problem is, right?

1569
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,840
What question?

1570
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,360
XX.

1571
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,040
What?

1572
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,520
What happened between you two?

1573
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,040
Nothing happened.

1574
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,200
Then why did you change after the date?

1575
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,120
I chose another one.

1576
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,840
No.

1577
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,640
Why?

1578
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,080
What?

1579
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,240
Why?

1580
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,240
There are many reasons.

1581
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,840
It's simple.

1582
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,480
If you want to say something shallow,

1583
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,040
your face is on my point.

1584
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,200
And if you look deeper,

1585
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,680
I had a date before.

1586
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,720
a Cupid date.

1587
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,320
The day we talked a lot.

1588
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,640
I liked it in the end.

1589
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,160
I think it's suitable.

1590
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,440
Interested.

1591
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:48,720
Very suitable.

1592
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,320
It depends on your feelings.

1593
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,840
So I can understand you no matter what you do.

1594
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,760
I'm sincere.

1595
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,920
There's nothing else.

1596
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,000
You've done your best.

1597
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,480
I really won't change now.

1598
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,760
I like his honesty.

1599
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,040
Yes.

1600
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,120
He's not avoiding at all.

1601
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,800
Yes.

1602
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,760
Will you change?

1603
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,600
I...

1604
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,240
I, Sakura,

1605
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,200
I'll change Son Goku 981.

1606
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,840
Will you change your mind if there's a new one?

1607
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,880
No.

1608
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,520
Never

1609
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,840
give everything.

1610
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,640
I told you

1611
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,960
whether it's Tata

1612
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,640
or Xinxin,

1613
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,120
I think action will represent me.

1614
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:30,840
my words.

1615
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,440
Because I'm clear now

1616
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,560
I want to be with Tata.

1617
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,080
So I won't think about anything else.

1618
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,200
I just think

1619
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,640
how to make her happy.

1620
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,200
Be together.

1621
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,280
Can I have a word with you?

1622
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,520
Tell me now.

1623
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,120
The soup is very angry.

1624
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,880
Very angry

1625
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,640
Why?

1626
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,520
Because of you.

1627
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,720
Why?

1628
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,800
Because I said Tata's brother is handsome?

1629
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,360
I don't know.

1630
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,720
I think so. I don't know either.

1631
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,120
He's angry anyway.

1632
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,400
I thought about it.

1633
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,000
But...

1634
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,800
he was very angry.

1635
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,240
I don't know.

1636
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,480
He looks younger than me.

1637
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,640
I'm really supportive.

1638
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,280
I complimented Tae-seo too.

1639
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,200
I said the same thing.

1640
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,000
I said you were

1641
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,920
That's who I am.

1642
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,280
I said maybe

1643
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,440
I said it's just a support.

1644
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,160
There are too many misunderstandings every day.

1645
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,440
Lower your voice.

1646
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,000
Fine.

1647
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,160
Will she coax him?

1648
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,880
I think I got into trouble again.

1649
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,800
I'm speechless.

1650
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,200
Why?

1651
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,520
I think the soup is angry.

1652
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,080
Why?

1653
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,680
Because I think Brother Tata is handsome.

1654
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,640
I don't know.

1655
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,560
They're on a date.

1656
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,280
They went out.

1657
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,040
Maybe a lot has happened these days.

1658
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,120
I'll try to

1659
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,520
the way we used to get along.

1660
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,240
I want to show her about my growth experience,

1661
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,680
including things I care about.

1662
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,760
Will I see him play ping-pong?

1663
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,480
Really.

1664
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:20,840
Hello
