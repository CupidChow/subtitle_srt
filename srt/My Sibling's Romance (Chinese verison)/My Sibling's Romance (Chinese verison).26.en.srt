1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
A party with wild wine

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull and refreshing as breathing.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It's like drinking wild wine

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

6
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:00,560
Lambose is good.

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,239
Zero sugar tastes good. Young and carefree.

10
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,320
There's a text message.

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,440
(Every member of the house)

12
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,880
Every member of the cabin can be the questioner

13
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,080
to the Mirror House

14
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,039
to have an anonymous secret conversation.

15
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,560
We only have one chance

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,320
to invite the opposite sex.

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,680
So you don't have to use it, right?

18
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,120
You don't have to use it.

19
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,200
So this is actually

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
to test their feelings.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,160
They can meet the person they want to ask.

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,280
Go into the Mirror Room.

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,800
But the person who answered

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,920
I don't know who's asking him.

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,440
Yes.

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,960
Mirror Room is a natural

27
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,960
a very ceremonial place.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,479
He can only see himself.

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,160
Yes.

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,240
So it's more about self-shooting.

31
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,000
This is a good opportunity.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,720
to torture each other.

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,760
Maybe on a date,

34
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,320
you don't want to answer,

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,280
you may get through it.

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,800
But there's no escape.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
I can ask questions secretly later.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,280
Then I want to ask

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,840
five to seven questions.

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Think about it for me.

41
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,680
A question?

42
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Ask her.

43
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,800
Which one do you like

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,280
Which one do you like?

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,280
After your date today,

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
do you think

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,920
do you prefer dating Fatty

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
or Tae-ri?

49
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
I think it's better

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
I should ask myself.

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
Ask her if she's happy today.

52
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,280
She'll definitely say she's happy.

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,160
That's what I thought.

54
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,800
With her personality, she would say she's unhappy.

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,040
Which one is happier?

56
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,640
What do you mean?

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,840
I made a wrong date with her.

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
You can be happy if you make a mistake.

59
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,000
Why can't I be happy?

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
Which date

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,440
or the last date?

62
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,160
Yes.

63
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,360
Ask her some details.

64
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,320
to make her feel that you didn't ask.

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,480
Just some of her real thoughts.

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,040
You are

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
when it comes to love.

68
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,560
Yes.

69
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Then you have to ask her

70
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,079
if you are

71
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,280
If a man has feelings for you,

72
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,640
you'll feel pressured.

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,360
Do you think

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
you think

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,000
you must give him feedback.

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,400
or

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,480
you will give feedback immediately

78
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,160
or a resolute person who can make it clear?

79
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,120
who keeps the boundary.

80
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,000
It's obvious that

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,480
I can feel that she's a friendly person.

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,720
She's kind of friendly.

83
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,960
Just ask this question again.

84
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,640
Is your feedback subconsciously

85
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,480
Or do you think

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,160
you feel guilty

87
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,840
You feel guilty without feedback.

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,800
The question just now is

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,480
if the boy is feeling pressured.

90
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
She's obviously stressed out.

91
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,560
I knew it yesterday.

92
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,240
You saw it?

93
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,920
might be her subconscious.

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,880
But if she answered you herself,

95
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,760
I still have to ask.

96
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,240
Yes.

97
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,200
Because what she said to you

98
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,640
what she really thinks.

99
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,600
is different from her subconscious.

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
It's too hard.

101
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,640
I feel

102
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:46,840
It's amazing.

103
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,200
There was a mirror in front of me.

104
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,280
And I took a look.

105
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,360
I also did my hair.

106
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
Later I found out

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,680
the other side can see what I'm doing.

108
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,200
I want to ask Hua the most.

109
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,920
I've thought about many things.

110
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,840
How should I ask?

111
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,320
Do you want to be relaxed

112
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,400
or ask

113
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,960
what you want to know.

114
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,760
I'll ask you a few questions.

115
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,080
Let me ask you something simple.

116
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,560
Did you have a good date today

117
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,240
or did you have a good date before?

118
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,640
We went to two places today.

119
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,320
We had a date before.

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
I think

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,159
I think today's date might be more fun.

122
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,280
Okay.

123
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,480
The second question.

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,240
Are you a friendly person?

125
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,640
Yes.

126
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,280
If two boys are nice to you,

127
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,400
will you choose to accept

128
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,720
or discrimination?

129
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,320
If she says she wants to do it at the same time,

130
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,920
I'll probably know

131
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,680
it takes more time to contact.

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,720
If she says discrimination,

133
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,120
those days,

134
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,040
or tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,

135
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,760
I knew I was

136
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm the one who's different.

137
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,880
or the other one?

138
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,560
There will be discrimination.

139
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,960
In a relationship,

140
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
in a relationship

141
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,520
and control your desire?

142
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,600
Yes.

143
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,720
Can you accept your other half

144
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,120
the same as you?

145
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,400
I can accept it.

146
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,440
I have a question.

147
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,880
if there were two or three girls

148
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,760
if he has two or three girls

149
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,840
and let him go,

150
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,800
He did the same thing as you.

151
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Can you accept it?

152
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,320
What I'm doing now is

153
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,360
I'm meeting everyone equally.

154
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,640
Yes.

155
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,440
I think it's okay at the beginning.

156
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,159
But I can't accept it later.

157
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,920
Got it.

158
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,600
Got it.

159
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,080
Okay.

160
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,360
No problem.

161
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,800
This tone is fat.

162
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
He almost exposed himself.

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
I can tell.

164
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,000
When he asked questions,

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,240
from the first question,

166
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,920
his mood wasn't that high.

167
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
From his pause,

168
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,720
and the way he questions,

169
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,200
I think I should be fat.

170
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,680
I think this answer

171
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,280
is a bit official.

172
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,640
but also

173
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,280
a little sincere.

174
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,840
I think

175
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,480
this may not be the best answer in my heart.

176
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,800
It's not the answer he wants.

177
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,640
Yes.

178
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
Who will Tae-ri date?

179
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,760
He must be asking Hwa.

180
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,000
Are you going to date her again?

181
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,159
Yes.

182
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
I went to the Mirror Room today

183
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
because it's a one-sided glass.

184
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,040
I can see her

185
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,320
her movements and expressions.

186
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,960
She can't see it.

187
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,080
Through some questions,

188
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,000
and her facial expressions,

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,320
are you nervous?

190
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,880
I wonder if I can see something.

191
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,200
Wow, Tae-seo.

192
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,880
I want to ask you some questions.

193
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,760
I want to ask you some questions.

194
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,680
Okay.

195
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,840
About today's...

196
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,560
date today,

197
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,200
Are you satisfied that I made this choice for you?

198
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
The choice you made for me

199
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,840
is today's date.

200
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,200
Isn't he the date I chose for you?

201
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,280
He's a blueprint.

202
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,000
I asked her questions as her brother.

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,159
because I think

204
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,280
she would let her guard down.

205
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,440
She may be more sincere.

206
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,120
Satisfied.

207
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,559
The second boy is dramatic.

208
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,480
He's pretending to be my brother.

209
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,120
Why would he ask me to go to the Mirror House?

210
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,080
Besides,

211
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
he doesn't know there's a sibling house.

212
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,560
This thing?

213
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,840
I'll definitely ask him.

214
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,160
I think it's funny.

215
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,520
But I still pretended

216
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,600
you were my brother.

217
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,400
I answered you.

218
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,480
Yes.

219
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
So childish.

220
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,360
We have siblings.

221
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,520
Are you happy today?

222
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,040
I might be happier today.

223
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,280
First date is eating

224
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,000
And this date

225
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,480
except eating.

226
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,960
It's been recorded for a day today.

227
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,480
How do you think he cares about you?

228
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,720
Actually, I think everyone is different.

229
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,800
Some people

230
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,600
is a little reserved.

231
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,480
I'll make you breakfast

232
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,040
or bring you food.

233
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,720
and care if you eat it or not.

234
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
But some people

235
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
express

236
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
more passionate.

237
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,440
I'll give it to you.

238
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,680
Just you.

239
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,840
These two are divided into

240
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,640
One is initiative.

241
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,960
and the other is passive.

242
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,920
which one

243
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,600
which one do you prefer?

244
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
The latter

245
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,080
Just give it to me.

246
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,520
Okay.

247
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,320
Do you have

248
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
you want to know more about?

249
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,400
Yes.

250
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,280
Since when?

251
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,680
Recently or before

252
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,760
Recently?

253
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,840
In the past few days,

254
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,600
Terri is quite naive.

255
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,600
He really thinks the other side thinks he's a map.

256
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,160
In my opinion,

257
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,920
this person may be me.

258
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,720
Because I'm the only one

259
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,840
is me.

260
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,480
Something happened that made you

261
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,680
change your mind.

262
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,480
Because in the past,

263
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,120
I tend to take care of others.

264
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,760
But I think

265
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,600
I might be taken care of recently.

266
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
and a lot.

267
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,320
So Hua hasn't decided on someone yet.

268
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
Because others

269
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,280
have never decided on her.

270
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,960
So when you choose freely,

271
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,080
Through these answers,

272
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,280
I want to confirm

273
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,360
what she thinks

274
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,160
at this stage?

275
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,880
Today's thought

276
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,080
has changed a few days ago, right?

277
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,280
I think I might be

278
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,200
a little hesitant.

279
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,480
A little.

280
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,680
The dilemma

281
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,200
The problem is

282
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,640
I can compare myself.

283
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,880
Because I had two dates.

284
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I didn't meet the same person.

285
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,280
I think he has been

286
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,200
about

287
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,920
how I feel.

288
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
She might be testing me.

289
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640
Actually, she knew

290
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,480
another guy.

291
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,040
Maybe when she comes to me recently,

292
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,760
she might have

293
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,680
in her heart.

294
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,840
may be changing.

295
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,920
I haven't decided yet.

296
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,160
There must be a bonus for today's date.

297
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,440
But she's still observing.

298
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,520
She still wants to know more about me

299
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,800
or another guy.

300
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,440
Okay.

301
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,520
That's all.

302
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,160
Okay.

303
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,480
After I asked him today,

304
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,400
I think Hua is still

305
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,280
between the two boys.

306
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,880
I'm usually passive.

307
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,760
I think I might do something

308
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,480
a little straight.

309
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,520
Because she said today

310
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,080
One is to bring the food to you.

311
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,480
and say you'll give it to me.

312
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,600
One is asking if you want it.

313
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,040
She might prefer the former.

314
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,000
I belong to the latter.

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,400
But I may

316
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,440
try to change.

317
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,400
I'll be more straightforward later.

318
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,840
He's asking for the manual.

319
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,320
Terri wants to open the paper right.

320
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,000
He went after you.

321
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,800
I'll ask you now.

322
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,960
How do you want me to pursue you?

323
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,920
Then I followed it.

324
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,320
Maybe he thinks

325
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
It's too short.

326
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,200
I want to know the way as soon as possible.

327
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,600
and focus on her heart.

328
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,400
You can use your own understanding.

329
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,560
In fact, many mistakes

330
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,480
I might miss this person.

331
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,440
Yes.

332
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,880
Because they have time limit,

333
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,200
So I think it might be better

334
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,680
it might be better.

335
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,960
Because the question before Fatty

336
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,920
is still

337
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,400
Do flowers have feelings for me?

338
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,720
But Tae-seo already asked.

339
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
Do you like to take the initiative or passive?

340
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,600
What do you need me to do?

341
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,960
He might be more clear.

342
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,800
Yes.

343
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,280
So Secret Mirror House is interesting.

344
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,080
I remember last time

345
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,280
to interview Terri and Fatty.

346
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,840
Today, I became

347
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,000
Fatty and Terri came to interview Hua.

348
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,240
They came to verify it with Hua.

349
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,160
So I think

350
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,840
the relationship between the three is formed.

351
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,280
There's something

352
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,040
to ask the person I want to ask.

353
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,080
So I sent it that I need this place

354
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,320
to have a conversation.

355
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,760
Is he fat?

356
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
Why? I think it's fatty.

357
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
I think so too.

358
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
If Fatty says he likes her now,

359
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,040
will she like Fatty?

360
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
Because they were

361
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,200
relatively ambiguous.

362
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,440
She should want to ask

363
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,840
how Fatty feels about Xiaoling.

364
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,280
or how you feel these days.

365
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,880
Yeah.

366
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,800
They didn't talk about it.

367
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,440
We're locked between Fatty and Terri.

368
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,920
right?

369
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,280
Yes.

370
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,720
I think so.

371
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,000
Who will she

372
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,640
to chat with in the Mirror House?

373
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,960
Please make your guess.

374
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,800
and write your answers in your notebook.

375
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Those who guess wrongly

376
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,920
will be punished by the netizens on Weibo.

377
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,600
On the day of the show,

378
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,320
on his Weibo.

379
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,520
Fatty.

380
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,000
Only Zun and I chose Terri.

381
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,760
Yeah.

382
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,480
Yeah, I don't think Fatty has a chance.

383
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,120
I think so too.

384
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,560
You're out.

385
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes.

386
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,880
How do you know she's out?

387
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,560
Because in the past two or three days,

388
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,760
she has nothing to do with Fatty.

389
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,280
Why do I feel

390
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,120
there's a follow in his eyes.

391
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
Because I think Tae-seo

392
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,360
obviously showed his affection.

393
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,840
Yes.

394
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,120
I always remember Hua.

395
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,960
She sent her feelings

396
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,200
in three days.

397
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
So I think if Tae-seo is nice to her,

398
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,560
she'll accept it.

399
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,040
Yes.

400
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,120
But three days,

401
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,480
the day she texted her.

402
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,960
she replied

403
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,200
She answered Fatty's question the day before.

404
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,600
She asked her the other day

405
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,640
if you could fix my face.

406
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,560
She said she can fix your face.

407
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,360
Do you think they're texting me?

408
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,400
I have to reply.

409
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,120
This is a sincere message.

410
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,080
Whatever it is,

411
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,960
it represents her feelings.

412
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,160
Who will Hua

413
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,000
to chat with in the Mirror Room?

414
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,240
Let's take a look.

415
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,920
Fatty.

416
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,400
Really.

417
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,440
I invited Fatty.

418
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,360
Because Fatty and I argue a lot every day.

419
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,720
But we seldom sit down and chat.

420
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,560
Except for the first date,

421
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,840
I think it must be Hua.

422
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,840
My reaction was

423
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,560
Oh no.

424
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,520
I'm going to be judged by my soul.

425
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,200
Be content. I can still think of you.

426
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,640
That means you still have a chance.

427
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,320
Yes.

428
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,000
Because I think

429
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
she's firm towards Tae-seo.

430
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,080
She knows what Terri is thinking.

431
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,760
but she has regrets about

432
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,640
She has regrets.

433
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,240
Yes.

434
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,800
There are some questions.

435
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,920
Even if she cut it off,

436
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,240
she wants to

437
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,920
a clean end.

438
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,280
Okay.

439
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,560
If Fatty is really talking about her,

440
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,600
I really like her.

441
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,480
So the flower will be confused again.

442
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,600
So Zun and I were wrong.

443
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,680
Only you got it wrong.

444
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,480
Zun just wants to be punished.

445
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,760
What about the wrong guests?

446
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,640
need to post on Weibo

447
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,280
on Weibo

448
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,240
to support your partner.

449
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,800
Support?

450
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,040
Who is your partner?

451
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,960
You'll see.

452
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,480
I'm under control.

453
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Yes.

454
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
If you want to control us, you'll get caught.

455
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,280
Yes.

456
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,920
Do you feel happy

457
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,720
these days?

458
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,800
Yes.

459
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,040
Are you unhappy?

460
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,040
Yes.

461
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,520
Not much.

462
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,880
What makes you unhappy?

463
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,600
Because of my brother.

464
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,600
Have you ever been unhappy?

465
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,040
Not really.

466
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,400
I don't think so.

467
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,400
Don't talk too much.

468
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,880
What are you doing?

469
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,000
He said he's basically not unhappy.

470
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,520
I was thinking

471
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,120
that is

472
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,200
when I met other boys,

473
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,800
he didn't feel unhappy.

474
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,680
So at the moment,

475
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
I feel a little disappointed.

476
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,800
Oh no.

477
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
I touched her minefield.

478
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,840
He doesn't care.

479
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,680
Then you are

480
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,720
fall in love at first sight?

481
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,600
or love at first sight?

482
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,480
I fell in love at first sight, right?

483
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,440
He gave up on himself.

484
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,200
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

485
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
you fell in love at first sight

486
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,000
you fell in love at first sight.

487
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,079
Will you keep in touch with her

488
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,560
or every girl

489
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,160
and compare them.

490
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,359
The one in the room

491
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,839
the one I told you at first sight

492
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,400
at first sight.

493
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,319
I think love at first sight

494
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,560
it must be built

495
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,160
a little bit.

496
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,360
It's love at first sight.

497
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,440
It's not that

498
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,760
It's love at first sight.

499
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,320
Right?

500
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,240
He's avoiding the question.

501
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,560
Will you

502
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,480
express your feelings for everyone?

503
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,280
Not really.

504
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,240
It's obvious that I like someone.

505
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,360
Have you ever expressed it to the people in the house?

506
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,960
Yes.

507
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,640
What did you do?

508
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,240
or what kind of things

509
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,480
to make her feel it?

510
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,160
I'll observe her every move.

511
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,840
And...

512
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,360
I'll listen to what she says.

513
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Can you say something

514
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,160
to express?

515
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,960
Yes.

516
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,800
Do you think

517
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,840
she felt

518
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,120
your feelings for her?

519
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,960
I feel it.

520
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,800
If you have a crush on a girl,

521
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,840
she didn't give you a response,

522
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,120
Will you keep fighting or step back?

523
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,560
I will keep fighting.

524
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,960
How long will it take for you?

525
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,920
I'll keep trying.

526
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,840
If she doesn't reply to you,

527
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,880
A week.

528
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
If the girl you like

529
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
she knows what others do,

530
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,080
She's just touching someone.

531
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,280
Will you be angry?

532
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,080
I won't.

533
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,320
Will you retreat?

534
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,520
I won't.

535
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,600
You want her to choose you

536
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,240
and choose you,

537
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,640
or she has always chosen you.

538
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,200
I think this is the right of a girl.

539
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,160
I will respect her.

540
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,880
It feels like a punch on the cotton.

541
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,520
Because

542
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,400
this thing is one-sided.

543
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,640
It's not that I like her

544
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,120
just because I like her.

545
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,280
At this stage,

546
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,000
you can do

547
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,920
what you want to do.

548
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,840
Respect.

549
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,960
I didn't expect his answer.

550
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,200
I think Fatty is quite confident.

551
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
He hopes the person he likes

552
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,560
to get in touch with everyone

553
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,040
and choose him.

554
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
He wants to respect the girls.

555
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,760
I think

556
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
I have changed my view on him.

557
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,040
If you see her going on a date with someone else,

558
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,840
you will

559
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
by yourself.

560
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,640
or

561
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,480
in front of her,

562
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,960
or let her see

563
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,920
Let her see.

564
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,600
First,

565
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,920
digest it yourself, right?

566
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,680
As a mature person,

567
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,640
you will choose to do the first thing.

568
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,760
Do you think

569
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,240
a mature person?

570
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,040
I think I am.

571
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,600
At least in the small house.

572
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,120
I understand.

573
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,480
Do you think

574
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,120
a half-minded person?

575
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
After entering the house,

576
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,320
after entering the house,

577
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,920
I wasn't half-minded.

578
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,560
Because I haven't made a choice yet.

579
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,520
Fatty, what are you doing?

580
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,800
In fact, Fatty knows it's Hua.

581
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
but you haven't

582
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,400
you haven't made a choice.

583
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,960
Really?

584
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,040
I'm here.

585
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,720
After the sports day,

586
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,240
after the sports day.

587
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,640
I get it.

588
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,440
He means he has no feelings for Xiao Ling.

589
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,960
Yes.

590
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,760
The other one can't hear it. Right.

591
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,520
Yes.

592
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,640
We went to the sports day together.

593
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,360
And you have a date too.

594
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,720
Do you think dating is more fun

595
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,040
or the sports day?

596
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,320
Date?

597
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,440
(Let's go on a date.)

598
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,800
Date?

599
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,160
That's all for my question.

600
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,640
Okay.

601
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,840
After the sports day,

602
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,040
I texted her.

603
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,880
Don't you know how she feels?

604
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm sure she can feel my feelings.

605
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
She's a smart person.

606
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,680
Actually, I didn't understand.

607
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,440
He said after the sports day,

608
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,160
after the sports day.

609
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,640
But I asked him

610
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,040
or the sports day.

611
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,280
Because the date is me.

612
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,400
It's Xiao Ling.

613
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,440
But he said after the sports day,

614
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,800
after the sports day.

615
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,400
After meeting Xiaoling,

616
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,200
he was sure of his feelings.

617
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,400
He also sent it to Xiaoling that day.

618
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,240
So I don't know

619
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,200
whether he's telling the truth or lying.

620
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,560
I think

621
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,120
he has a different mind.

622
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,160
Maybe I didn't understand what he meant.

623
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,040
It's obvious that the flowers are giving him.

624
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,520
Yes.

625
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,560
She hopes

626
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,440
to get some approval.

627
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,840
Maybe Hua will bravely

628
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,640
bravely.

629
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,880
What Hua wants to know is

630
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,800
whether you care about me or not.

631
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,200
Yes.

632
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,960
Do you care about me?

633
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,840
She's already very straightforward.

634
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,600
She kept asking.

635
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,880
but I couldn't get a clear answer.

636
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,280
He should take this opportunity.

637
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,440
Isn't this a great opportunity?

638
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,960
Release it crazily.

639
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,080
I think

640
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,240
he thinks that

641
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,360
I've released a lot

642
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,560
I've overcome myself.

643
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,920
I hope a smart girl like you

644
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,880
Can you understand this?

645
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,600
But Hua can't feel it.

646
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,480
Anyway,

647
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,760
is hard to understand.

648
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,960
Yes.

649
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,800
No answer.

650
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,360
What a waste of time.

651
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,840
It's too ambiguous.

652
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,360
He doesn't dare to express his weakness

653
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,440
in front of girls.

654
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,000
Weak?

655
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,440
(Sad)

656
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,320
to express my feelings.

657
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,040
It means you didn't choose me.

658
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,280
I think he is also

659
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,920
a proud person.

660
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,280
Because he has the same problem

661
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,560
both have the same problem.

662
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,200
Esther has one too.

663
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,960
I feel like I'm protecting myself.

664
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,680
Yes, I'm protecting myself.

665
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,320
Afraid of getting hurt.

666
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,120
That's how he expressed it.

667
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,640
In the conversation,

668
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
in the conversation.

669
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,840
He thinks

670
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't need these.

671
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
I'll stop.

672
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,720
You should understand

673
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,800
what I mean.

674
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,320
Everything was a mystery.

675
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,440
To show his calmness,

676
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,560
to show his confidence.

677
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,320
Everything is under control.

678
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,360
Don't be angry.

679
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm getting dizzy.

680
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,520
Yes.

681
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,920
I can only say that Fatty

682
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,960
is really not a master.

683
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,480
Yes, he's really a "low hand".

684
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,880
He is a model brother.

685
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,880
He taught his sister to figure out love.

686
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,440
Yes.

687
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,160
But he is

688
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,440
who doesn't understand

689
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,240
in love.

690
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,560
I think he's a little timid.

691
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,440
So fast?

692
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,080
Yes, because he kept saying

693
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,440
I should respect girls.

694
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,880
I support you to go alone.

695
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,000
He's actually a little backward.

696
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,440
He has given himself a way out.

697
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,440
What are you doing?

698
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,800
Playing with your phone.

699
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,120
What do you mean?

700
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,560
What do you mean?

701
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,720
What do you mean?

702
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,560
Sit.

703
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
You want to talk to me?

704
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,560
No, I just care about you.

705
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,080
I haven't seen you for a long time. I miss you.

706
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,120
Why do you

707
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,280
care so much about me at night?

708
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,600
So your personality is because of you.

709
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,360
You love social

710
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Or is it because

711
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,400
because you can't socialize?

712
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,640
Am I bored?

713
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,840
Take your time. You're not bored actually.

714
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,240
Slowly.

715
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,280
We seldom talk about

716
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,280
with others.

717
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,440
Come in.

718
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:25,880
Another one.

719
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,960
Xinxin.

720
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm going out.

721
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,600
What are you two talking about?

722
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,520
I was just discussing

723
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,840
how to survive.

724
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
I thought he was stressed out from love.

725
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,360
Let me answer it for him.

726
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,960
You can come in.

727
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,600
Do you think

728
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,440
there are some obstacles in communication?

729
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,720
It's on again.

730
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,760
Master's number is on again.

731
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,480
Cut.

732
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,400
No.

733
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,200
I was wondering how to communicate

734
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,920
how to communicate.

735
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,720
I personally think the most important thing

736
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,680
is happiness.

737
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,400
That makes sense.

738
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,320
You've become a professor.

739
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,200
That was...

740
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,280
He switched freely.

741
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,920
Yes.

742
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,440
instead of being by his side.

743
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,480
I think every day

744
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,800
things.

745
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,560
I think this is the right relationship.

746
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,600
Yes, that makes sense.

747
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,160
I think it's important to be relaxed and happy.

748
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,520
When you stay with him,

749
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,160
when you stay with him,

750
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,440
when you're together.

751
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,120
But if you are with someone,

752
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,040
you will feel

753
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,320
I'm going on a date with her later.

754
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,560
I'm going to get started.

755
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,160
You're actually unhappy.

756
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,600
But if you think you're with her,

757
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,120
you two don't need to talk about it.

758
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,440
You also think she's not uncomfortable

759
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,280
or awkward.

760
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
I'm very happy.

761
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,560
Because some people

762
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,440
are right.

763
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,600
You can understand your relaxed point.

764
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,200
Because you can feel it

765
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,600
you can feel awkward.

766
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,160
But some people don't talk.

767
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,960
you still think

768
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,760
It doesn't matter.

769
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,160
She's comfortable by your side.

770
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,400
It means

771
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,640
you're not feeling well.

772
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,400
If you find this problem,

773
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,560
you have to

774
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,880
in time.

775
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,680
He was right.

776
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,120
Yes.

777
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,480
He did nothing wrong.

778
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,640
Don't think too much.

779
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,400
Just measure it with a standard.

780
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,320
with one standard.

781
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,040
Because it's useless to think so much now.

782
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,040
You just need to get along with someone.

783
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,960
For example, let's hurry up.

784
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
Let's get along three or five times.

785
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,800
You may slow down.

786
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
You'll get along more than ten or twenty times.

787
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,520
After you get along,

788
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,360
there will be an answer in your heart.

789
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,920
Yes.

790
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,840
Yeah, don't think about it.

791
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,360
Think won't solve anything.

792
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,200
You do it.

793
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,520
You solve your problem first.

794
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,560
You solve others' problems here.

795
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,600
to save the world. Start.

796
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,160
Yes.

797
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,440
Come in.

798
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,240
Hello.

799
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,600
Why are there so many people today?

800
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,840
Come on, Xiaoling, join us.

801
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,360
Hurry up.

802
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,960
What?

803
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,120
What?

804
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,240
This room.

805
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,640
This room needs you so much

806
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,000
We'll tutor each other by family.

807
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,960
Well, to put it bluntly,

808
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,280
do you feel happier

809
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,440
to talk to me?

810
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,880
I can't date you.

811
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,240
Maybe your joke is bad.

812
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,200
No, I'm asking you.

813
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,840
Do you feel happier

814
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,200
to get along with us?

815
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,240
Yes.

816
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,080
When you're with us,

817
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,920
when you're with us?

818
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,240
But I think it's normal.

819
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,360
You get nervous when you like it.

820
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,920
Yes.

821
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,680
I'm just afraid of making mistakes.

822
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,240
That's why I'm nervous when I like it.

823
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,000
You can do more.

824
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,560
and do more things.

825
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,800
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.

826
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,640
and make more mistakes.

827
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,920
If you can learn something about him,

828
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,680
and chat,

829
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,240
I think it'll be much better.

830
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,440
Actually what I'm showing now

831
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,600
is already taken.

832
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,920
I dare not

833
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,920
I dare not open myself completely.

834
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,720
It's okay.

835
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,400
You have two men who can help you.

836
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,800
You can talk to them more.

837
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,720
I don't think

838
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,040
are not good at dealing with such problems.

839
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,680
I think his brothers are good at it.

840
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,040
He looks smart.

841
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,560
I think sometimes,

842
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,720
girls

843
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,200
jokes or something.

844
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,160
You can ask easily.

845
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,800
You don't have to.

846
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,120
When girls joke with you,

847
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,320
you would take it seriously.

848
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,040
Actually girls are afraid of boys being serious.

849
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,520
Yes.

850
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,600
she wouldn't dare

851
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,760
I dare not joke with you.

852
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,720
I dare not talk to you more.

853
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,560
That way, your conversation will be less and less.

854
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,040
But sometimes when girls joke with you,

855
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,160
you can take it as a joke.

856
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,520
It doesn't seem like you're easy-going.

857
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,160
or anything.

858
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,640
This is how we get along.

859
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,000
Yes.

860
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,800
They are so sober in other people's feelings.

861
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,760
Yes.

862
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,080
You're right.

863
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,000
You give people

864
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,880
you don't know how to control it.

865
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,360
Yes.

866
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,840
You can't be relaxed.

867
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,440
I noticed a detail of you yesterday.

868
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,920
When reading the album,

869
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,840
everyone found out.

870
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,320
Then Tata showed her siblings.

871
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,120
Sue Su said, "Yes."

872
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,920
So cool.

873
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,880
Your expression was so serious.

874
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,160
Look. So handsome.

875
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,360
So handsome.

876
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,800
Do you want him to come?

877
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,520
Yes.

878
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,440
I'm not happy.

879
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,920
Yes.

880
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,560
But I shouldn't.

881
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,680
Of course not.

882
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,880
I can't be a fan.

883
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,120
I think boys are cool.

884
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,480
I seem to be

885
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,960
about this.

886
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,720
You are very serious.

887
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,640
He's not very serious.

888
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,120
He's quite possessive.

889
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,560
He's too strong to make himself unhappy.

890
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,840
I think I've felt it.

891
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,120
Yes, because you will

892
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,280
in this trap.

893
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,640
Love is blind.

894
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
I can't see myself.

895
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,520
and others.

896
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,080
who sees others.

897
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,440
So you shouldn't care about others.

898
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,120
You should take care of yourself.

899
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,960
Yes.

900
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,520
Maybe you play more ping-pong,

901
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,400
you always want to win.

902
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,360
But in love,

903
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
in love.

904
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,560
He's like a psychologist.

905
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,480
Yes.

906
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,960
You have to respect others.

907
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,120
You have to respect yourself.

908
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,280
If you do something

909
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,520
you are unhappy,

910
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,800
but others are happy.

911
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,880
As time goes by,

912
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,960
you're just unhappy.

913
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,200
So you disrespected yourself.

914
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
So when you do something,

915
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,760
ask yourself first.

916
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,480
You're right.

917
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,400
And all your efforts and rewards

918
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,200
are not valuable.

919
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,120
The effort in love is the effort.

920
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,200
No reward.

921
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,240
There is no reward for love.

922
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,280
There's only one way to pay off.

923
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,440
Don't expect

924
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,800
how I love you today.

925
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,960
How I treat you,

926
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,120
If you don't reply tomorrow,

927
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,680
I won't treat you well in the future.

928
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,160
That's not a good idea.

929
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,480
You should know that giving is giving.

930
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,720
Devotion.

931
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,360
and do.

932
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,760
you did it willingly.

933
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,360
If you are unwilling,

934
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,200
others may not accept it.

935
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,320
What a "fat friend".

936
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,280
Yes.

937
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,680
Fatty told me

938
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,160
maybe my possession and control desire

939
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,760
that makes this girl nervous too.

940
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,080
I think so too.

941
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,480
since I can feel

942
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,920
Susu likes me,

943
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,320
I think it's a good choice

944
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,720
a good choice.

945
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,840
Relax.

946
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,480
Don't be so formal with each other.

947
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,280
Yes.

948
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,480
Yes.

949
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,880
I'm looking forward to seeing Hwa's text.

950
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,760
I found that she was very sincere today.

951
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,520
Sincerity is a bonus.

952
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,960
Because everyone likes sincere people.

953
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,720
Tata, I don't know who she's sending it to.

954
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,240
Then we sat on the same side.

955
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,640
I didn't know what she was going to send.

956
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,800
So I was really

957
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,520
nervous and excited.

958
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,680
I'm actually curious about

959
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,520
who will be sent to today.

960
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,160
Yes.

961
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,800
In each episode,

962
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,600
we will divide into two teams

963
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,080
according to the deduction.

964
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,520
The team who guesses the most right

965
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,240
will get one

966
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,040
Guoli Wild Crest.

967
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,120
In the last episode,

968
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,160
in the last episode.

969
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,520
the most guests

970
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,040
will receive

971
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,320
a mysterious award provided by the Guoli.

972
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,040
This episode's deduction is

973
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,160
Please guess.

974
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,880
the direction of the message.

975
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,960
Now we're going to

976
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,720
of "Love Sisters".

977
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,680
Group.

978
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,400
How do we divide today?

979
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,040
Keep fighting.

980
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,440
Black and white.

981
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,400
Harry.

982
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,480
Flower.

983
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,560
Who do you think Hua will give it to?

984
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,200
Hua and Fatty are in the Mirror Room.

985
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,960
I think the chat was too ordinary.

986
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,560
Map.

987
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,800
Xiao Ling.

988
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,760
Susu must still be the soup.

989
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,120
Both of them are double arrows.

990
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,320
Tarri will definitely give flowers.

991
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,600
Chubby also gives flowers.

992
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,480
The suspense is here.

993
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,800
Xin should give the map back.

994
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,280
She's been sending pictures to Tu.

995
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,320
No one else wants to send it.

996
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,800
Yes.

997
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,400
I think she will change someone.

998
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,960
It's so hard for Esther.

999
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,680
We're done.

1000
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,280
That's it.

1001
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,000
Three, two, one.

1002
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,400
Please reveal

1003
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,720
Tae-seo.

1004
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,520
Exactly the same.

1005
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,920
We are going to

1006
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,280
a party.

1007
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,440
I feel there's something right away.

1008
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,280
It's time to reveal the truth.

1009
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,040
Let's watch it together.

1010
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,680
Every day is like an exam.

1011
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,400
My eyes are feet.

1012
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,120
Thank you for the gift.

1013
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,800
Don't cry after the injection.

1014
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,600
Injection?

1015
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,280
I received it from Harry.

1016
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,880
Lastly, I marked one.

1017
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,240
Don't cry after the injection.

1018
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,800
Because he wasn't caught by a stray cat at night.

1019
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,160
Then he was worried.

1020
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,360
He told me

1021
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,720
Later,

1022
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,920
take me to the hospital for an injection tonight.

1023
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,520
Let her get an injection.

1024
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,640
Yes, just in case.

1025
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,040
I'll definitely send it to Tata.

1026
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,400
He loves it so much.

1027
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,960
Super.

1028
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,840
When I was shopping this afternoon,

1029
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,760
I realized

1030
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,880
I don't know you at all.

1031
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,800
The moment I received her text,

1032
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,920
I was really happy.

1033
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,320
He can't hide anything.

1034
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,400
I sent the message to Harry.

1035
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,159
When I bought him a gift today,

1036
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,520
I didn't know much about him.

1037
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,199
I brought him a cup of matcha drink.

1038
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,000
He told me he didn't drink matcha.

1039
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,159
But he finished it.

1040
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,760
When I heard him say he doesn't drink matcha,

1041
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,000
I felt a little guilty.

1042
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,960
So in the text,

1043
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,560
in the text message.

1044
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,960
and added a sad expression.

1045
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,520
I get to know him gradually. Yes.

1046
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,920
To Susu.

1047
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,440
I've started learning new songs.

1048
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,719
I got a text from the soup.

1049
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,760
Because I mentioned it in my message.

1050
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,600
When can I hear

1051
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,440
more piano songs.

1052
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,480
And in private, I said it several times.

1053
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,560
When can I play my favorite song?

1054
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,400
He said it was hard.

1055
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,960
He's already learning.

1056
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,320
I only send it to Susu.

1057
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,720
In my opinion,

1058
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,880
in a period of time,

1059
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
in one time.

1060
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,360
is respect for love.

1061
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,600
Warrior of Pure Love.

1062
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,320
Awesome.

1063
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,520
I had fun playing ping pong today.

1064
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,000
Mr Tang had a good time teaching me.

1065
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,560
I received Sue's

1066
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,360
I sent the soup.

1067
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,000
I had fun playing ping-pong today.

1068
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,360
Mr Tang taught me well too.

1069
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,120
Good.

1070
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,360
I have to control you.

1071
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,320
I won't let you use your strength.

1072
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,320
You prepared well for today's date.

1073
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
And also praise him.

1074
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,480
He taught me well.

1075
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,200
Give him some confidence.

1076
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,160
She gave him emotional value.

1077
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,880
to encourage him.

1078
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,120
After talking today,

1079
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,760
I hope you can loosen the spring.

1080
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,080
I guess it's Xinxin's.

1081
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,040
Because

1082
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,640
I had a chat

1083
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,720
with Xinxin and Fatty.

1084
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,040
Xin.

1085
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,960
My feelings.

1086
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,440
I sent the soup today.

1087
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,120
I sent this encouragement message to soup.

1088
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,880
Because I think

1089
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,200
he is actually

1090
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,080
a very good person.

1091
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,960
I don't think

1092
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,000
he doesn't need to be bothered by these things.

1093
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,920
Just be yourself.

1094
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,520
Then listen to

1095
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,680
others' opinions.

1096
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,800
Because many people

1097
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,360
many people will like him.

1098
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,960
She's so nice.

1099
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,840
Xiao Ling.

1100
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,760
Take more photos.

1101
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
I'm 100% sure.

1102
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,840
This is the map.

1103
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Because the photo

1104
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,880
Today

1105
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,480
for the two of us.

1106
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,640
Beautiful. That's it.

1107
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,160
Yes.

1108
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,280
Okay.

1109
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Today's message

1110
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,320
to Xiaoling.

1111
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,400
Because I think

1112
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,480
I just want to

1113
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,600
with Xiaoling.

1114
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,240
The drawing.

1115
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,080
You're good at taking photos.

1116
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,840
Xiao Ling's.

1117
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,560
I'm going to express my feelings today.

1118
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,280
to take photos for her.

1119
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,120
I texted Tu today.

1120
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,480
We also have some

1121
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,320
our own memories.

1122
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,480
So I think it's good.

1123
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,840
It makes me feel

1124
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,440
this person might be more unique.

1125
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,960
They are in sync.

1126
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,920
They're already back and forth.

1127
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,480
I had fun today.

1128
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,240
I hope we can get to know more about each other.

1129
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,440
I think it's from Tae-seo.

1130
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,400
I'm happy today.

1131
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,600
I hope we can get to know more about each other.

1132
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
I sent Hua Hua the text message at night.

1133
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,000
After my contact with Hua today,

1134
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,120
I think our relationship

1135
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,000
between us

1136
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,360
and know each other better.

1137
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,320
I just want to express my feelings.

1138
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,800
I want to get to know you more.

1139
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,320
Can you pick me on the next date?

1140
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,640
You have bright eyes.

1141
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,560
Can you pick me on the next date?

1142
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,360
I think this one

1143
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,280
touched me.

1144
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,960
I think

1145
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,800
I'm happy to be so straightforward.

1146
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,240
I think I like it.

1147
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,040
So what flowers need

1148
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,800
is someone else's initiative.

1149
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,160
firm,

1150
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,000
Choose.

1151
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,160
I think it should be Fatty.

1152
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,120
I sent it to Hua today.

1153
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,400
Will you pick me on your next date?

1154
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,040
I've already made it very obvious.

1155
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,840
Hua.

1156
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,480
Competition.

1157
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,640
Thank you, photographer.

1158
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,960
I'm happy to receive Hwa's text.

1159
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,920
After receiving the text,

1160
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,000
I think we gave each other

1161
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,120
each other.

1162
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,520
After our date today,

1163
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,160
I've already figured out

1164
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,840
who to send today's message to.

1165
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,600
No matter

1166
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,040
anything may happen tonight,

1167
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,960
I'll text you how I feel today.

1168
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,000
(Tae-seo makes me happy all day.)

1169
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,600
It feels good to be recorded all day.

1170
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,360
Three two one

1171
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,400
Three, two, one.

1172
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,040
So I said

1173
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,840
Thank you for today's photographer.

1174
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,960
We're both doing our best.

1175
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,240
We've already tortured each other.

1176
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,880
You already know how I feel.

1177
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,880
We went to the sports day together.

1178
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,600
and you had a date too.

1179
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,040
Do you think dating is more fun

1180
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,280
or the sports day?

1181
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,560
A date?

1182
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,760
Date?

1183
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,760
I don't understand.

1184
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
I really don't understand.

1185
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,520
Fatty sent it to Hua just now.

1186
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,880
Hua is a little happy.

1187
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,840
Because Hua doesn't like the boss.

1188
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,720
His speech is a general speech.

1189
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,120
He chose you unconditionally.

1190
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,520
Actually, I think

1191
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,480
if Fatty had grabbed the chance,

1192
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,080
he would have gone up.

1193
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,560
Their timing is wrong.

1194
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,200
because Hua has decided today.

1195
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
You stayed with me all day.

1196
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,120
You recorded me all day.

1197
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,480
No matter what happens,

1198
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,240
I will vote for Tae-seo.

1199
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,840
Yes.

1200
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,320
Their timing is wrong.

1201
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,760
Yes.

1202
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,840
Now it's a three-person relationship.

1203
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,160
So I don't know

1204
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,000
I can't guess.

1205
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,520
Yes.

1206
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,280
Fatty is so active.

1207
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,160
and then he retreated.

1208
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:40,680
OK. OK.

1209
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,120
Yes.

1210
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,920
But it doesn't mean he has no chance now.

1211
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,640
Yes.

1212
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,680
Fatty, you can't shake anymore.

1213
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,360
You have to be more determined.

1214
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,480
Keep giving.

1215
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,720
There's still time.

1216
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,240
I didn't receive your message today.

1217
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,480
Because I don't think

1218
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,120
with anyone.

1219
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,240
It's like getting along with friends.

1220
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,600
I don't think

1221
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,040
They don't text me their feelings.

1222
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,400
Everyone has someone they want to know.

1223
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,240
I got two of them.

1224
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,360
I feel very happy.

1225
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,840
She was shocked.

1226
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,040
My first reaction was

1227
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,600
I was like this.

1228
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,520
Because I didn't expect

1229
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,840
In my impression,

1230
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,120
I think the interaction

1231
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,040
Their interaction

1232
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,880
is very obvious.

1233
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,240
I said in this situation,

1234
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,440
in such a situation?

1235
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,480
They're all in the unit of family.

1236
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:06,880
Really.

1237
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,120
I'm confiscating the text.

1238
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,480
Today I can feel

1239
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,920
Xinxin's pressure

1240
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,880
is obviously gone.

1241
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,280
I feel relieved.

1242
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,520
I've been saying that you're not good with zero votes.

1243
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:18,920
right?

1244
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,240
This is very limited.

1245
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,320
It's obvious that

1246
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,000
others are already in love.

1247
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,880
right?

1248
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,520
Then do your job.

1249
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,440
I feel

1250
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,000
I feel a little disappointed.

1251
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,240
He must have sent

1252
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,280
to Hua today.

1253
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,880
But Hwa went on a date with Tae-seo today.

1254
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,440
I think the flowers are for Terri.

1255
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,080
So Fatty

1256
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,760
won't send a sincere message today.

1257
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,400
Let's take a look.

1258
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,160
We should have the same answer, right?

1259
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,960
Yes.

1260
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,200
You got one wrong.

1261
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:55,720
VEREAT Esther.

1262
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,480
Congratulations to all of us

1263
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,600
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

1264
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,560
Bye.

1265
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,960
Bye.

1266
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,920
Bye.

1267
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,480
I want to get a skinny face shot.

1268
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,840
You...

1269
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,440
Here.

1270
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,880
My cheekbones are too high.

1271
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,760
Your cheekbone? Then you have to peel the bones.

1272
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,560
I just said if you want it,

1273
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,280
Here.

1274
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,120
Touch it

1275
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
Meat?

1276
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,720
You might not have it when you're old.

1277
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,040
Thank you.

1278
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,520
I won't get old even if you're old.

1279
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,160
I'm already 80 and I still look like this.

1280
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,480
He has a high cheekbone.

1281
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,960
So he won't be ugly, you know?

1282
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,160
Why do I feel so dark?

1283
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,840
What's going on?

1284
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,880
My sky has collapsed.

1285
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,840
You're so dark.

1286
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,920
You're so dark today.

1287
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,720
You look like a black man.

1288
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,880
You know my face is...

1289
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,600
Do you know how long

1290
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,760
how long it took me to hold it in so white?

1291
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,400
I used to be at least four degrees darker than this.

1292
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,800
I used to play basketball.

1293
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,960
Really.

1294
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,640
Why are you laughing?

1295
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,440
Can you stop...

1296
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,360
You're really overwhelming.

1297
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,680
You don't respect me.

1298
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,160
I'm a sensitive and fragile little boy.

1299
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,560
You're not weak.

1300
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,560
I'm not weak.

1301
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,360
Actually, I'm not weak.

1302
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,440
Is it dark?

1303
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,320
It's really dark.

1304
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,640
Can you stop talking?

1305
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,800
I won't talk.

1306
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,600
We have the same color.

1307
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,880
Right? Did you apply foundation?

1308
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,280
Are we in the same color?

1309
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,160
Why not?

1310
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,120
You're black.

1311
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,000
Can you do it?

1312
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,560
No.

1313
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,720
Turn over.

1314
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,800
Press the volume button.

1315
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,360
Isn't it ugly?

1316
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,480
You do it.

1317
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,440
I'm speechless.

1318
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,400
I can't.

1319
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,800
Why are there so many?

1320
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,560
Let me see.

1321
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,920
It feels like they're already in a relationship.

1322
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,360
Yes.

1323
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,080
I turned it off.

1324
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,520
It's off. You can't turn on my phone.

1325
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,080
I can't tell anyone the password.

1326
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,800
Because my phone password is the bank card password.

1327
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Let me see it first.

1328
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
Why is my face so big?

1329
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,480
Of course.

1330
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,200
Don't laugh. Your eyes are so small when you smile.

1331
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,200
The best time in love, right?

1332
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,040
Yes.

1333
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,280
Is it going down?

1334
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:36,680
Yes.

1335
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,160
Let's go.

1336
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,360
Hua.

1337
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,960
I want to talk to you.

1338
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,600
What's wrong? Tell me.

1339
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,160
No, I was just asking if you were happy today.

1340
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,600
How was your date?

1341
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
So you asked me today

1342
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,320
from my best friend's point of view,

1343
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,840
from my best friend's point of view.

1344
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,880
or

1345
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,240
asking how I feel today

1346
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,520
or ask for myself?

1347
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:02,920
Ask for yourself.

1348
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,240
How could I ask for myself?

1349
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,160
Why can't I ask for myself?

1350
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,440
Because I'm not interested in him.

1351
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,080
First of all,

1352
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,800
I'm asking you as a good friend.

1353
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,640
Secondly,

1354
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,200
I'm trying to help my brothers.

1355
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,400
But he doesn't know this.

1356
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,680
Actually, on the whole today,

1357
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,800
I feel very happy.

1358
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,080
But because I know

1359
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,040
his original thoughts and present.

1360
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,320
including his current observation on me.

1361
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,080
Yes.

1362
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,120
It doesn't mean

1363
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,920
he decided to choose me or him.

1364
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,480
No.

1365
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,920
And he's quite passive.

1366
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,600
I may observe him for a long time.

1367
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,240
So you're more passive.

1368
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,280
Very passive.

1369
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,320
Yes.

1370
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,280
Because I've always been a proactive type.

1371
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,920
I also need

1372
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,160
to be passive.

1373
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,920
I don't want to take the initiative alone.

1374
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,080
I don't want to take the initiative alone.

1375
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,080
to be on my own.

1376
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,640
I don't want him to take 99 steps.

1377
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,200
at least 50 steps, right?

1378
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,120
But at this stage,

1379
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,600
I want to have a good relationship.

1380
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,080
I think we can take care of each other.

1381
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,200
But I think we need the same amount.

1382
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,400
Or more than me.

1383
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,240
I know that.

1384
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,400
It means men have to pay more attention

1385
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,400
and take the initiative.

1386
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,080
Yes.

1387
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,040
I had a good time with him today,

1388
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,120
I think

1389
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,560
a date is quite different.

1390
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,800
But in this regard,

1391
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,040
I'll think about it carefully.

1392
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
think carefully.

1393
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,560
I won't be like before.

1394
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,600
just like before.

1395
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,040
If you meet someone you really like,

1396
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,520
you can do anything

1397
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,000
even that person doesn't like me very much.

1398
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,880
I just think I like him.

1399
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,720
I used to be like this.

1400
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,640
I just touched the wall, you know?

1401
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,880
It's more fair.

1402
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,560
No.

1403
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,280
equal.

1404
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:01,800
Not like that.

1405
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,440
Yes.

1406
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,440
Only you are giving.

1407
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,440
But I think

1408
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,920
if he is also passive,

1409
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,560
you two will be very tired

1410
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,400
at this time.

1411
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,640
He said

1412
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,520
will respond.

1413
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,480
But I'm not sure if he's here.

1414
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,560
Because I'm his date,

1415
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,720
because I'm his boyfriend.

1416
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,000
Because he talked to me today.

1417
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
He said he didn't.

1418
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,560
But he said he would...

1419
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,720
Ex-wife.

1420
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,880
Previously.

1421
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,400
Previously?

1422
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,320
Yes.

1423
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,320
He described it to me

1424
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,040
after he's determined,

1425
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,080
he thought we could go together.

1426
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,840
But I'm not sure

1427
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,560
Is what he said true?

1428
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:45,960
Yes.

1429
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,200
Because from what I know about him,

1430
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,920
I don't think so.

1431
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,760
Actually, I'm in the room with Tae-ri.

1432
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,520
Except for Terri,

1433
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,280
I get to know Fatty the most.

1434
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,960
So these two are also

1435
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,800
the two people

1436
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,320
I want to know the most.

1437
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,400
I think

1438
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,720
in terms of caring,

1439
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,600
in taking care of people.

1440
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,120
But I think he always changes.

1441
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,840
Even though I'm changing,

1442
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,400
but I think he's also changing.

1443
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,280
You're changing too. You should let him change too.

1444
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,720
I allow him to change.

1445
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,360
But I think

1446
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,720
I think I know him too.

1447
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,800
Yeah.

1448
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,480
And I think Fatty

1449
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,280
is quite mature.

1450
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,520
I think he thinks

1451
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,480
you can understand everyone.

1452
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,520
and think I'm the best.

1453
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,840
He's confident.

1454
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,680
I think so too.

1455
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,080
He is.

1456
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,120
I'm stubborn

1457
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,920
and persistent.

1458
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,720
I don't want to know.

1459
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,240
But I don't think you're stubborn.

1460
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,240
I think you gave up.

1461
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,560
No.

1462
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,640
I just don't like

1463
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,800
Reluctantly.

1464
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,480
Yeah.

1465
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,160
I don't like to go.

1466
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,280
But if you don't try,

1467
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,560
how would you know

1468
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,760
you're forcing him?

1469
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,240
Don't you want

1470
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,520
to master your own happiness?

1471
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,440
I took the initiative when we first met.

1472
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,720
I did.

1473
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,720
You will take the initiative.

1474
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,080
Yes, I will.

1475
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,680
But I want to see

1476
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,920
if you have any feedback.

1477
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,200
If your feedback

1478
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,680
or your feelings

1479
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,000
your feelings.

1480
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,480
I think we're not in a relationship.

1481
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,960
That's very acceptable.

1482
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,400
If we were in a relationship,

1483
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,200
I would have asked you.

1484
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,200
How could you do this?

1485
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,680
Yes.

1486
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,800
Because I think

1487
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,120
it's normal to change your mind.

1488
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:31,480
Yes.

1489
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,120
Let's say

1490
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,080
if a new guy suddenly appears,

1491
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,840
I'm more interested in him.

1492
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,560
I think it's normal.

1493
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,720
But I think we should fight for it.

1494
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,280
If you just think

1495
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,680
you don't like him,

1496
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,280
Yeah.

1497
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:46,760
Go for it.

1498
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,560
You don't have to.

1499
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,320
Yes.

1500
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,040
I think boys' attitude is very important.

1501
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,000
It's obvious.

1502
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,720
That's good.

1503
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,560
Is it possible that

1504
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,760
he was in contact with two girls?

1505
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,160
He didn't contact us at the same time.

1506
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,120
He didn't talk to me at all.

1507
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,080
And I think

1508
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,240
it's very obvious.

1509
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,280
Have you talked to each other?

1510
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:05,680
No.

1511
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,120
Have you ever wanted to talk to him?

1512
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,120
Do you want to ask him?

1513
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,560
I don't think I'll talk to him.

1514
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,160
Because he doesn't want to talk to me

1515
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,000
He doesn't want to talk to me.

1516
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,040
it means

1517
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,360
he thinks everything is natural and reasonable.

1518
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,200
Because I think

1519
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm the kind of person

1520
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,640
Yes.

1521
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,520
And I think

1522
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,760
it's the best way.

1523
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,920
Then I met a new guy.

1524
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,280
I'll tell you directly.

1525
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,760
I said I got along well today.

1526
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,960
I'll tell you directly

1527
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,160
the order of a friend.

1528
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,680
We will go back to being friends.

1529
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,720
But I think everyone's habits

1530
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,920
To be honest,

1531
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,520
he didn't do anything.

1532
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,800
He's not shaking.

1533
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,200
Got it.

1534
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,120
I know what you mean now.

1535
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,280
I think if you choose this way,

1536
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,680
to make you happier,

1537
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,000
I think you are right.

1538
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,040
Actually, you gave me a lot of inspiration today.

1539
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,200
I think I should think about it.

1540
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,040
I think Xin has a clear mind.

1541
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,280
She has made a decision.

1542
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,680
Harry has made a choice for me.

1543
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,880
She doesn't like me anymore.

1544
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,400
So she won't invest much.

1545
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,280
I have to fight for it.

1546
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,240
I want to work hard.

1547
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,080
It's a good choice of appearance.

1548
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,720
This is actually the first time

1549
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,560
in the show.

1550
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,360
Harry's change attitude.

1551
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,200
What does she think?

1552
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,680
She chose to quit decently.

1553
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,040
Yes.

1554
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,800
In my opinion,

1555
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,560
And I don't think

1556
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,960
didn't think Harry

1557
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,600
the Harry thing.

1558
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,200
Yes.

1559
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,600
She can understand and accept it.

1560
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,680
Yes.

1561
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,560
They are very healthy.

1562
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,760
I just thought of

1563
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,200
Is there another way

1564
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,440
It's a way to reduce the damage.

1565
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,160
Is it possible that Harry

1566
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,040
more normal to her

1567
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,040
instead of ignoring her.

1568
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,200
Could it be

1569
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,800
But it's hard to control this level.

1570
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,480
Do you remember

1571
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,400
he just came back from a date with Tata?

1572
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,640
When they were in the kitchen,

1573
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,800
Esther was still using the old way.

1574
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,920
At that time,

1575
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,000
was already hard to control.

1576
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,560
Because Xinxin is still in the same state.

1577
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,960
How do you want Harry to respond?

1578
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,320
We can only cut it off.

1579
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,320
And she'll keep trying.

1580
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:09,520
Yes.

1581
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,840
Is it my imagination?

1582
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,320
Or are you unhappy?

1583
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:12,640
Yes.

1584
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,840
Or did I do something wrong?

1585
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,320
She's like this.

1586
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,240
Harry chose to cut off all contact.

1587
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,400
Maybe it's also a way to reduce loss.

1588
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,240
A good solution.

1589
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,160
It's kind of

1590
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,200
I think so too.

1591
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,680
Didn't you want to go to that room?

1592
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,400
Me?

1593
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,400
I don't know what to ask you.

1594
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,840
You don't know what to ask me.

1595
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,120
I want to ask a lot of questions.

1596
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,680
I don't think

1597
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,760
to go to the Mirror House.

1598
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,920
I think so too.

1599
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,560
Actually, I was ready to go.

1600
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,240
Later I thought

1601
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,440
I can ask you these questions in person.

1602
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,720
I don't think it's necessary.

1603
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,040
Yes, ask him directly.

1604
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,320
We're in the Mirror Room.

1605
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,480
Okay.

1606
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,320
Tell us

1607
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,160
how you feel about every girl in the house.

1608
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,120
She wants to check.

1609
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,080
to test him.

1610
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,840
Let's start with Susu.

1611
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,760
You're heartless.

1612
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,040
Hua is like a sister.

1613
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,040
Xiaoling is like a good friend.

1614
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,080
Where's Xin?

1615
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,240
Xinxin.

1616
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,320
Since I texted you,

1617
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,480
since I texted you.

1618
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,080
I'm talking about Xinxin.

1619
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:11,840
Since I texted you,

1620
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,280
I haven't talked to her.

1621
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,880
Just a normal house.

1622
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
Are you nervous?

1623
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,160
I'm not nervous.

1624
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,400
I'm thinking about how to say it.

1625
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,120
It's normal.

1626
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,520
If we don't know each other,

1627
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,320
how do you feel about other guests?

1628
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:28,960
What do you think?

1629
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,280
I have feelings for her.

1630
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,800
Go on.

1631
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,160
Who else?

1632
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,360
Who else?

1633
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,000
Me too.

1634
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,280
What did you say?

1635
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,920
You don't know who I am now.

1636
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,520
You don't know who you're talking to now.

1637
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,760
Okay, I don't feel anything.

1638
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,800
Say no more.

1639
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,760
I'm sorry.

1640
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
Okay, stop it.

1641
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,320
It's okay.

1642
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,360
Of course.

1643
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,200
Go ahead.

1644
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,280
Let me calm down.

1645
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,240
It's a little hot.

1646
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,400
I should have dragged you there.

1647
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,560
You don't even answer me now.

1648
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,200
I answer.

1649
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,640
I'll answer you when I go inside

1650
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,200
I'll answer you when I go inside.

1651
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,080
No.

1652
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,600
It's okay.

1653
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,640
I'm fine.

1654
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,640
It's okay.

1655
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:14,760
Why?

1656
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,280
I'm not okay.

1657
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,040
Why?

1658
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,640
No.

1659
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,920
Why are you only telling me in the room?

1660
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,080
I'm sorry.

1661
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,200
Let's talk at home.

1662
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,000
I'm hanging up.

1663
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,080
Stop talking to me.

1664
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,120
Let's get down to business.

1665
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,000
Actually,

1666
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,440
I don't like girls with short hair.

1667
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,840
What do you mean?

1668
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,440
Okay.

1669
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:42,720
Good answer.

1670
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,800
No, listen to me.

1671
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,440
It's easy to answer.

1672
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,000
But when I see you,

1673
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,520
I think it's good.

1674
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,200
It's over.

1675
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,840
What's wrong with short hair?

1676
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,200
No.

1677
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,680
When I saw you, I felt...

1678
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,320
Wait.

1679
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,280
I said wait.

1680
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,720
Wait, I said wait.

1681
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,720
It's about my aesthetic point.

1682
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,720
Because you know why?

1683
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,080
You like long hair.

1684
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,800
I didn't say I like long hair.

1685
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,680
I've never tried short hair.

1686
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,160
Yes.

1687
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,400
Then I said,

1688
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,400
Because I like small heads.

1689
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,640
with big facial features.

1690
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,240
Really

1691
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,840
It collapsed

1692
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,560
Big face

1693
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,400
and small head.

1694
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,600
You said you're not shallow.

1695
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,320
Look at your appearance.

1696
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,240
That's true.

1697
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,000
But the standard sometimes

1698
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,920
I don't know how to describe it.

1699
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,320
To be honest,

1700
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,440
I'm sweating.

1701
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,480
Wait.

1702
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,000
It's just eye contact.

1703
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,280
At first glance,

1704
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,960
I think it's okay.

1705
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,920
I always see you smile.

1706
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,240
I like girls who smile.

1707
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,240
But you didn't

1708
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,560
that night.

1709
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,480
It proves that I'm not shallow.

1710
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,880
They fight like they're in love.

1711
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,560
Yes.

1712
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,680
There are too many information today.

1713
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,920
Why? Nothing today.

1714
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,120
I don't think anything happened today.

1715
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:58,880
Don't you think today's information

1716
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,680
more than the day before yesterday?

1717
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,440
Why?

1718
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,920
Tell me.

1719
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,200
What are you saying? I didn't say anything.

1720
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,560
Just what you think.

1721
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,880
How do you know what I'm thinking?

1722
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,080
Go on.

1723
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,600
Ask.

1724
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,760
No more questions.

1725
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,600
That's all.

1726
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,600
Why?

1727
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,360
Why did the light go out?

1728
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,520
Did they kiss?

1729
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,000
The rest are improving.

1730
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,840
Membership.

1731
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,880
Xinxin is more mature.

1732
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,240
In choosing an idol, in terms of emotions,

1733
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,800
she took herself out.

1734
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,080
She didn't say she was worried about gains and losses.

1735
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,480
She's still immersed in this relationship.

1736
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,120
Esther respects Harry's behavior.

1737
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,600
Even if it goes against her expectation,

1738
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,720
she will know what he thinks.

1739
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,720
Good.

1740
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,480
In a relationship,

1741
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,200
if you find

1742
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,440
he has no feelings for himself,

1743
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:46,920
Adults

1744
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,520
choose

1745
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,880
to leave the stage decently?

1746
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,560
Delete all contact numbers.

1747
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,720
So cruel?

1748
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,920
Yes.

1749
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,040
I don't want to delete

1750
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,080
chat records with all my ex-girlfriends.

1751
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,640
I want to know

1752
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,200
what I was confused about

1753
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,840
What did I experience with her?

1754
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,320
that you would read it.

1755
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,120
I had it before.

1756
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,280
I looked through the chat records of my ex on the plane

1757
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,680
and cry on the plane.

1758
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,840
Because after breaking up with my current boyfriend

1759
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,840
I thought of some beautiful scenes.

1760
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:17,840
Yes.

1761
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,120
Break up with your current boyfriend.

1762
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,920
I saw my ex on the plane.

1763
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,840
Look at your ex.

1764
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,400
Ex-girlfriend?

1765
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,720
I thought I gave you the wrong person.

1766
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,760
I've wronged you.

1767
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,880
How could I allow someone like you

1768
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,360
hurt me?

1769
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,880
My ex was so nice to me.

1770
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,080
and hurt me more.

1771
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,760
I'm immature in love.

1772
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,200
Do you think

1773
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,640
is a decent exit?

1774
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,160
Because I don't leave myself a way out.

1775
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,240
Because people tend to linger.

1776
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,440
On a lonely night,

1777
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,760
I might unconsciously say

1778
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,840
I wish he was still here.

1779
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,280
And look at the old messages.

1780
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:47,800
Just like you.

1781
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,000
like you.

1782
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,840
You might as well cut it off.

1783
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,480
But some people

1784
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,240
they can still be friends when they break up.

1785
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,200
This is really amazing.

1786
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,840
This is superpower.

1787
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,560
But I think

1788
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,880
after they had intimate contact,

1789
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,720
Yes.

1790
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,840
How to

1791
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,360
Friends, yeah.

1792
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,480
It's hard to control.

1793
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,080
And I think

1794
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,360
if I become friends with him,

1795
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,520
I would be

1796
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,840
a kind of

1797
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,120
Yes.

1798
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,600
I'm worried.

1799
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,440
I don't want to cause him any trouble.

1800
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,440
That's right.

1801
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:15,720
Yes.

1802
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,320
So my ex

1803
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,360
should be dead.

1804
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,640
Just an example.

1805
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,400
It's a bit heavy.

1806
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,160
But I won't contact him.

1807
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:23,680
And I think

1808
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,360
there's no proper break-up and exit.

1809
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,680
Because when we make a decision,

1810
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,880
the other side will be unhappy.

1811
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,200
It can't be the same frequency.

1812
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:33,480
Yes.

1813
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,920
I think you can only be sincere and sincere.

1814
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,880
You just need to

1815
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,400
what you want to say.

1816
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,000
Don't lie to each other.

1817
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,600
Whether they understand or not,

1818
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,640
don't ask too much.

1819
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,520
Just be sincere.

1820
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,840
There seems to be no other way.

1821
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,080
I had this experience before.

1822
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,480
Before I met my husband,

1823
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,680
I had a date

1824
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,400
a date.

1825
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,360
It's kind of going this way.

1826
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,520
But after I met my husband,

1827
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,200
I felt

1828
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,080
he's a more suitable person.

1829
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,760
I completely ignored him.

1830
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,320
I always thought

1831
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,240
cold treatment

1832
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,960
is a very disrespectful way.

1833
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,640
Disappeared.

1834
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,200
Yes, I did realize it.

1835
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,920
But we were just a little ambiguous at that time.

1836
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,840
We didn't have a clear relationship.

1837
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,760
Very funny.

1838
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,280
Why did I realize

1839
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,280
we are not suitable for each other?

1840
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:18,920
It's ridiculous.

1841
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,080
He wants to watch my performance.

1842
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,320
He asked me if I had tickets.

1843
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,840
He didn't want to buy tickets.

1844
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,800
He wants a free ticket.

1845
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:25,960
You're in a position.

1846
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,000
What's the relationship?

1847
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,880
He wants free tickets during a date.

1848
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,680
He just wants your show.

1849
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,360
He found an excuse to get your ticket.

1850
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,920
He doesn't like you at all.

1851
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,480
You can give him a ticket.

1852
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,560
but you can't ask me for tickets.

1853
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,520
It's weird anyway.

1854
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,640
I thought

1855
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,080
I worked hard to perform.

1856
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,040
Shouldn't you

1857
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,080
support me?

1858
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,720
This makes me uncomfortable.

1859
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,840
Then I deleted him.

1860
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,480
One day,

1861
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,840
when I was with my husband,

1862
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,000
one day, I suddenly remembered

1863
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,480
I said,

1864
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,480
I don't think

1865
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,640
I didn't do well.

1866
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,840
I should explain it to someone.

1867
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,880
But I didn't make it clear.

1868
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,280
Should I call someone now?

1869
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,240
Really, one day,

1870
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,480
I didn't do it well.

1871
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,080
That day, I...

1872
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:03,640
I'll make a call.

1873
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,680
I'll tell him about this.

1874
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,120
I'm...

1875
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,280
I want to tell you

1876
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,920
why I suddenly ignored you.

1877
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,200
I hope you're not sad

1878
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,440
or remember it all the time.

1879
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,560
He said it's okay.

1880
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,200
I'm married.

1881
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:14,800
I said goodbye.

1882
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,080
Goodbye.

1883
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,480
It's a decent exit.

1884
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,640
Why do I feel

1885
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,200
a bit awkward?

1886
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,120
So cute.

1887
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,640
She's trying to get over it.

1888
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,880
You're brave too.

1889
