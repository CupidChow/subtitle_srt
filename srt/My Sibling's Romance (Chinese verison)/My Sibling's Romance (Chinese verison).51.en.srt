1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Let's have a party. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,440
Wind

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,400
Feng Feng.

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,440
Wind.

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,120
Wind flying.

8
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It feels like there's a wild wine at a party.

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,840
Take part in it on Weibo #Love and Siblings

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
Post it on Weibo. (Join #Love and Sisters' Care Protecting Chart) You have a chance to get a surprise benefit.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,200
You are his second choice.

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,600
But

14
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,920
he only knows someone

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,120
to really like someone.

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,080
Maybe.

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,920
But after knowing this today,

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,360
I feel a little awkward.

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm comforting you.

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,039
They seldom do this.

21
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,240
The soup has a lot of growth and changes.

22
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,240
But...

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,200
Actually,

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,880
I can't make any decision for you.

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,560
But in my opinion,

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,320
he is

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
doesn't deserve your love.

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,479
You're being so frank.

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,400
Actually this sentence is quite heavy.

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,400
Unlike soup,

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,320
It means he's very determined.

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,600
I forced Tu

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,520
I asked him too much.

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,280
I kept saying

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,480
I said I didn't think you were sincere enough.

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,160
I said the answer you gave

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,200
is ambiguous.

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,640
So,

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,680
I want you to confirm

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,720
if you don't really like Xiaoling,

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,120
don't do anything

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,400
that will make her misunderstand.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,520
He was actually quite upset today.

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,280
Because I kept asking

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
I kept asking.

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,079
He said he really likes him.

47
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,079
But from his behavior,

48
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,040
from his behavior.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,360
I think the probability

50
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,840
he didn't think it through.

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,480
No.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not wrong that I didn't think it through.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,520
Yes.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,200
But you just need to be honest, right?

55
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
It's okay. I think I know.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,000
It's okay. Let's go.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,720
I can do it.

58
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,280
Cry.

59
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,480
If I can't hold on,

60
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,920
I'll ask you to cry.

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm here crying with you.

62
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Why don't you cry with me?

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,720
Stop crying. Why are you crying?

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,800
Cry.

65
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,520
Don't cry for nothing.

66
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,440
Don't cry.

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,080
I don't want to go down later.

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,240
It's okay. I know.

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,040
Are you really okay?

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,920
I'm fine.

71
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
I'll call you if I need anything.

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
Remember to call me.

74
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,200
Do you think

75
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,760
after ten episodes,

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,160
the distance between

77
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,840
between soup and Xiaoling.

78
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,440
has changed a lot.

79
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,200
are getting closer.

80
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,160
Love, family, friendship are growing.

81
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,480
Can I ask you a question?

82
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,360
If now

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,600
you and your brother

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,240
hold hands like soup and Xiaoling.

85
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,880
Hold it.

86
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,920
She was trembling just now.

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,560
I don't remember holding hands.

88
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,160
Let me look back.

89
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,680
Since young,

90
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,079
we never held hands.

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
And when we grew up, let alone

92
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,120
my brother and I

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,600
for the past few years.

94
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,640
I took a selfie on my wedding day.

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,440
Like Western culture.

96
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,360
They are just hugging and kissing.

97
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,960
They're doing this.

98
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,480
we won't find it strange.

99
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,960
But in our environment,

100
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,320
Yes.

101
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
When we do this,

102
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,280
when we do this.

103
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,240
Because no one is doing this.

104
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,520
For example,

105
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,400
my daughter and I hold hands at home.

106
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,760
But we won't hold hands outside.

107
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Because she would think

108
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
it's weird outside.

109
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,959
No one did that.

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,160
But my son and I are still holding hands.

111
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,839
11 years old.

112
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,080
Send him to the bus every morning.

113
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
We must...

114
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,480
Like this.

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,920
My sister and I always...

116
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,880
I always hug her.

117
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,400
Maybe I'm much younger than her.

118
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,760
I'll hug her often.

119
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,040
Where should I go with this?

120
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll always hold her hand.

121
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,800
Including my mom.

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,840
I didn't hold my mom in the past.

123
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,320
But now I'll hug her a lot.

124
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,640
Hold her.

125
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,000
Really?

126
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,520
Yes.

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
I want to

128
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,000
want to be a child in front of my mother.

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,080
I don't want to be an adult.

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
It reminds me of the last time

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,480
when I cut my toenails.

132
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,200
What happened?

133
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,400
I grabbed my feet

134
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,120
with my hands.

135
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,920
I'm sorry.

136
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,040
It's cold.

137
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,520
Siblings

138
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Did you get it?

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,680
What do you mean?

140
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,280
She's close to her siblings.

141
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,560
When her hands and feet

142
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,920
with her feet,

143
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,240
There's a strong back.

144
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,360
It's cold, but it's funny.

145
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,200
I like cold jokes.

146
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,920
Okay, let's continue.

147
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,640
Come on.

148
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,680
What did you talk about?

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,760
Nothing.

150
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,560
I'll talk to you later.

151
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Actually I asked him many questions

152
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,200
about many questions.

153
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,720
I also asked about long-distance relationship.

154
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,840
how to solve the quarrel.

155
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,400
Actually, I'm not asking him.

156
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,120
I'm trying to give him a hint.

157
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,880
What about long-distance relationship?

158
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
What did he say?

159
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,080
Then I said,

160
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,320
you went to talk to someone.

161
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,640
No problem. It's a good thing.

162
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,360
But...

163
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,640
the problem is when you take the initiative,

164
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,400
can you express

165
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,640
Can you express your feelings

166
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,360
or if you can feel their feelings.

167
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,520
Is it quantity or quality?

168
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,080
Your ten-minute quality chat

169
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,400
is much better than

170
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,040
than one hour.

171
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,640
What does he think about long-distance relationship?

172
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
It's either a long distance or...

173
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,240
Because he's busy.

174
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,920
He's busy.

175
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,840
I know.

176
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,880
He said he would

177
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
come to you

178
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,040
or hang out with you.

179
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,360
No.

180
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,960
But he doesn't like my type.

181
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,680
I asked him.

182
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,240
He said he likes cool girls.

183
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,560
and handsome.

184
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:20,960
Then he said,

185
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,680
he found that cute girls

186
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,760
is a very good choice.

187
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,040
But I still care.

188
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,600
He doesn't like my type.

189
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,080
He's changed now. He said...

190
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,560
And soup fell in love with you at first sight.

191
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,640
He said he would confess to you.

192
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,440
Confess?

193
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,600
He only told me that he wanted to do one thing.

194
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,400
But it's a bit difficult.

195
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,000
He can't do it.

196
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,440
You have to see.

197
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
What is it?

198
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm not telling you.

199
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Fine.

200
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,280
Anything else?

201
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,240
Nothing.

202
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,960
What did he say?

203
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,720
He went to training.

204
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,360
Did he tell you

205
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,200
Tell me if you did.

206
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,640
If they fight, they'll come to you.

207
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,720
Is he going to

208
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,880
training soon?

209
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,960
He said he won't

210
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,000
Maybe next time.

211
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,480
They need to train for a long time.

212
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,960
Two or three months.

213
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,680
I'm just like Tata.

214
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't have a long-distance relationship.

215
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
I don't think I have.

216
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
Me too.

217
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,560
We're doomed.

218
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,720
I need to meet.

219
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,960
To be honest, a loser with two feelings.

220
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,440
I need to meet him.

221
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
I don't feel safe either.

222
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,800
It's not that I don't feel insecure.

223
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,640
I don't feel

224
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,760
I don't feel that deep.

225
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes, what should I do?

226
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,080
Without feelings, I...

227
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,160
I'm fine.

228
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,480
I will hint myself.

229
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,880
I think they'll do the same.

230
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,160
If we haven't seen each other for a long time...

231
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,480
Yes.

232
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,400
It feels strange to meet suddenly.

233
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,160
I feel awkward.

234
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,920
Shy.

235
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,440
Yes.

236
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,640
It's awkward.

237
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,120
Borderline.

238
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

239
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,480
Don't you recognize me?

240
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
These two...

241
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,520
They are really close.

242
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,080
It's just a little awkward.

243
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,880
I feel like this after a long time.

244
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,360
I feel embarrassed.

245
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,680
It's okay.

246
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,760
I think

247
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,480
Just take it step by step.

248
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay.

249
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:46,840
Look.

250
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,280
They both care about

251
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,600
about long-distance relationship.

252
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,840
Because after a long time,

253
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,240
after a long time.

254
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,880
How long do you think a long-distance relationship

255
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,560
will affect our relationship?

256
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,320
My husband and I

257
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,680
a year and a half long-distance relationship.

258
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,800
in a special period.

259
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,480
He's not sure

260
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,440
if he can

261
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,320
live in the same place.

262
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Then we broke up for six months.

263
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,080
We haven't seen each other for a year and a half.

264
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,400
in different countries.

265
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,080
Later, he went through a lot

266
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
and came back to China.

267
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
After some time, we got together again.

268
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,000
But I really think it's okay.

269
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,800
It's because my husband and I

270
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,040
keep in touch every day.

271
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,240
Yes.

272
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,520
Because you have

273
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,800
a good communication state.

274
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,360
Yeah.

275
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,920
So I think

276
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
if you can communicate with each other every day,

277
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,040
and share what you did today

278
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,400
what you did today.

279
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,520
It's not about reporting.

280
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,120
You'll think that even if he's not by your side,

281
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,880
you can feel his warmth.

282
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,480
Yes.

283
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,280
My husband did a better thing.

284
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,240
No matter when,

285
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,200
I'll send him a message.

286
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,120
Sir.

287
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,559
he would immediately...

288
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,400
If he wasn't there,

289
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,200
he would explain to you

290
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,480
I was filming just now.

291
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,640
Sometimes, I'd make a video call.

292
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,520
Even if he was filming,

293
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,320
he'll say

294
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,080
I'm filming.

295
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,280
Wait. I'll call you back.

296
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,400
He will help you with some things in a foreign land.

297
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,680
and get you a taxi.

298
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,360
For example, if I say the lock is broken,

299
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,920
he would ask the housekeeper to fix it.

300
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,160
Will you fight?

301
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,320
I think he's such a model husband.

302
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,720
We can communicate.

303
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
But we seldom quarrel.

304
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,280
Because I have no sense of security.

305
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,800
Because of the family problem,

306
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,200
I feel insecure.

307
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,880
But Mr. Zhou

308
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,560
really gives me a great sense of security.

309
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,840
Is there any way

310
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,880
When you're in a long-distance relationship,

311
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,360
keep this freshness.

312
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,760
and surprise them.

313
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,360
Yes.

314
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,400
We can set

315
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,680
a cycle goal together.

316
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,240
For example,

317
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
three months later,

318
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,200
after three months.

319
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,800
You need to feel

320
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,440
are working hard for the next meeting.

321
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,560
Yes, there's a hope.

322
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,080
Yes, there is a hope. Yes.

323
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,760
Tu, why are you unhappy?

324
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,800
I seldom see you so weak.

325
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,160
I also think Tu Tu is very low tonight.

326
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,400
No, I'm sleepy.

327
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm a little tired

328
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,960
After the soup,

329
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,000
the metabolism will speed up.

330
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,360
If I were you,

331
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,640
I would want to hear the answer.

332
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,760
Indeed, I'm thinking about something now.

333
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,440
Yeah.

334
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,640
Don't say I'm sleepy.

335
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,000
Xiao Ling is beside you, you know?

336
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,960
When I came back,

337
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,320
I noticed that he was in a bad mood.

338
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,760
I was thinking

339
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,920
if I should talk to him.

340
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,840
I wanted to keep an eye on him,

341
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,880
But I found I couldn't sit down.

342
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,880
I really feel uneasy.

343
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
Coming.

344
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,960
Xiao Ling went to see him.

345
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,320
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

346
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Let's go.

347
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
Shall we talk upstairs?

348
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay.

349
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,880
Let's go.

350
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,840
Let me see if it's warm.

351
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,120
Not bad.

352
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,360
Have a seat.

353
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,680
I know the soup.

354
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,120
might have asked some sharp questions.

355
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,680
I know.

356
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,840
But I understand.

357
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,080
I don't know how to talk to you.

358
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,320
Me too. I'm confused.

359
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,680
You know?

360
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,360
Well,

361
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,320
I think

362
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,560
too sharp.

363
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,600
But I can understand.

364
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,400
But I...

365
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
I remember one thing.

366
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,520
I also asked Hua.

367
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,120
I said,

368
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,880
to change a man.

369
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,120
Did you come in the end?

370
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,080
But the first thing you said when you got in the car was...

371
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,200
If I knew this was the reward,

372
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,920
I wouldn't have taken it.

373
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,400
The map.

374
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,840
Do you want to win?

375
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,720
You want to win

376
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,480
just to have this privilege, right?

377
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,320
Do you know the map?

378
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,680
No.

379
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,000
If I knew it was a reward like this,

380
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,240
I don't want to win.

381
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,040
This one.

382
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,760
At that time,

383
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,680
I was quite happy.

384
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,000
But when I heard that, I...

385
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,000
Can you stop for a while?

386
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,280
Why did I say that?

387
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Because when I got in the car,

388
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,160
I said this to relieve the embarrassment.

389
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,080
Too much information difference.

390
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,200
The night before yesterday,

391
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,680
when I got the news,

392
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,640
I was still in Xin and Hua's room.

393
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Fatty was there too.

394
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,120
We were thinking

395
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,040
if I should change.

396
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Because I think it's reasonable

397
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,080
with flowers.

398
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,440
After I proposed it,

399
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,600
Xinxin was worried

400
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,400
she'll feel bad

401
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
she was very upset as a third wheel.

402
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,760
But then I thought about it.

403
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
I think I should be selfish for once.

404
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,560
I chose to change.

405
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,200
I definitely want to team up with you.

406
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
The next morning,

407
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,680
you could see me coming here.

408
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,600
At that time,

409
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,240
why I said that in the car.

410
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,360
I just want to calm down

411
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
the awkward atmosphere.

412
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,720
And...

413
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,520
So you didn't realize

414
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,960
the three of us walked together.

415
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,600
I didn't say I wanted to go with you alone.

416
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,440
So that's why.

417
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,800
Yes.

418
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,800
I don't know.

419
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,080
Yeah.

420
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,720
Then I...

421
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,160
Yes.

422
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,840
Yes.

423
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,320
You know.

424
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,760
All right.

425
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,960
Let me tell you now.

426
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,560
Do you know

427
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,440
He...

428
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,400
Because I know

429
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,720
there must be some misunderstanding

430
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,840
and you talked to him,

431
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,960
That's why he asked these questions.

432
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,840
I know there's a premise,

433
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,000
but when he asked those questions,

434
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,120
because he was so sharp.

435
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,480
Including the problem with the Mirror House.

436
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,880
Speaking of that, I'll explain.

437
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,480
Didn't you say you didn't know it until today?

438
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,600
You're...

439
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,520
Right?

440
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,880
It's like this.

441
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,040
Because at the Mirror Room,

442
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,200
Do you remember?

443
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,600
At that time,

444
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,520
on the night of snow exercise.

445
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,880
Right?

446
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,560
Because before,

447
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,560
there was nothing between us.

448
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,800
Like that, right?

449
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
So first of all,

450
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,440
since I'm in contact with Tata today,

451
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
I'll

452
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,160
fill in the pagoda first.

453
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,560
I said, "Then fill the tower."

454
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,720
And then...

455
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,160
I was curious about you

456
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,560
at the beginning.

457
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,400
At the beginning,

458
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,840
a girl

459
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,760
a boring girl.

460
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,520
I kept this.

461
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,080
Later,

462
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,280
I was testing every day.

463
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,000
I think you and I

464
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
are kind of

465
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,680
whether it's about hobbies or life,

466
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,200
we think we are quite optimistic.

467
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,800
instead of

468
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,720
rejected me,

469
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,680
and then choose you.

470
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,360
I'm

471
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,280
a little awkward.

472
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,640
I never mentioned it before.

473
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,680
Actually, I accidentally

474
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,800
Tata accidentally slipped out.

475
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,560
I found out.

476
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,880
But when I think about it,

477
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,680
In my memory,

478
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,440
you would come back.

479
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
Yes.
HAVE GREA

480
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,520
HAVE GREAT F

481
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,080
Take care of Xinxin's feelings.

482
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,800
He means

483
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,240
Yes.

484
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,720
He's afraid that Xinxin will be embarrassed.

485
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,040
Xin's feelings and Xiaoling's feelings.

486
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,160
Whose is more important to him?

487
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,040
The night before,

488
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,920
after listening to Xin,

489
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,800
he planted an anchor in his heart.

490
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
The next day I saw Xinxin,

491
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,720
When Xinyi asked,

492
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,160
his subconsciously physical reaction was

493
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,040
to take good care of the scene.

494
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,920
And she's more attached than the picture.

495
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,760
So she believes what the other person says easily.

496
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,360
The map didn't pass the test of the soup.

497
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,040
But I think

498
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,160
he's not worthy of your love.

499
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,640
But it depends

500
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,560
what he will do next.

501
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,680
I think

502
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,800
the person who made the soup

503
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,720
to deny it.

504
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
It seems that

505
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,880
Xiao Ling will be more serious.

506
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,720
But the map is still confused.

507
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,360
So it depends on

508
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,640
what will happen next.

509
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
If he changes,

510
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,880
he can still accept it.

511
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,640
Yes, I think so too.

512
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
And this stage is very important.

513
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,080
So it depends on their date.

514
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,520
Yes.

515
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,280
The map needs to work very hard

516
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,480
to get back together.

517
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,720
Come on.

518
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,360
Are you busy?

519
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,960
No.

520
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,920
I want to play with you.

521
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,520
So cute.

522
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,480
I want to play with you.

523
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,880
What kind of flower do you like?

524
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,040
Rose. Any color.

525
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,080
You can spray it.

526
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,920
It's spraying

527
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,760
There's paint on the flowers.

528
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,200
The color is different, right?

529
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,800
Yes.

530
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,920
I thought of another flower.

531
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,680
But now I can't think of

532
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,760
what the flower is called.

533
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,080
It has a good meaning.

534
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Orange flower. There are several ways to call it.

535
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,000
I like peony too.

536
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,160
Shaoyao is pretty too.

537
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,920
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

538
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
Where are you going after the recording?

539
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,640
Home.

540
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,840
What about New Year?

541
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,720
Beijing.

542
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,200
Are you going to train

543
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,760
after you leave here?

544
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,120
My mom will be in Zhejiang after New Year.

545
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,040
She took my brother to the training camp.

546
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,080
So,

547
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,840
I won't spend the Spring Festival in Beijing, right?

548
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,840
Then you won't spend the Spring Festival at home?

549
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,840
Not necessarily.

550
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,640
I have to ask my mom.

551
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,280
It's so sad not to celebrate Chinese New Year at home.

552
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Is the festival atmosphere very strong?

553
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,520
I have a lot of people to eat together.

554
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,920
I have a lot of family members.

555
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,800
More chopsticks.

556
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,640
Is anyone home? Go back.

557
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,440
Mommy is here, and my brother is here.

558
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,720
Dad should be there too.

559
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,560
Also,

560
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,720
Qiyue.

561
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,040
Hello.

562
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,960
July, May, bye. Hello.

563
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,840
Che Che, Pu Girl, Mimi.

564
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,320
Do your homework.

565
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,080
One more.

566
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,760
Let you forget it again.

567
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,680
Let me think.

568
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,240
My brain is falling.

569
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,079
Sticky.

570
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,040
Sticky.

571
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,119
I seem to forget it every time.

572
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,520
You don't remember it every time.

573
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,960
You two are sticking together.

574
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,599
You two stay together.

575
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,960
Which year?

576
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,480
Chinese New Year.

577
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,400
Sticky.

578
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,960
Chinese New Year is fine too.

579
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,040
Because I thought we could have more than one year.

580
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,040
Yeah.

581
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,360
It's quite profound. When you name it,

582
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,200
Modern poet.

583
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,840
Yes.

584
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,800
Susu.

585
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,040
What a poet.

586
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,840
Don't you think the texts I sent

587
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,560
are meaningful?

588
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,640
Yes.

589
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,320
Do you know

590
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,240
I sent you that day?

591
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,160
You didn't

592
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,640
you didn't discuss with me.

593
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,600
Do you know

594
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,880
what I mean?

595
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,240
A overflowing soup bun.

596
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,640
Do you know what it means?

597
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,120
You didn't search.

598
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,400
This one too.

599
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,200
I thought it was just that photo.

600
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,800
No.

601
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,200
I mean everything I say.

602
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,280
I'm a person with a deep meaning.

603
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,880
I'll go back and study later.

604
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,280
I think I can find it.

605
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,920
I adapted it.

606
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,720
Many are adapted.

607
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,320
He's so sticky now.

608
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,200
Where should I search?

609
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,520
Happiness is

610
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,680
Happiness is a overflowing soup bun.

611
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,360
It didn't explain.

612
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,080
It told me

613
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,800
I don't need to explain.

614
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,480
Because this is the original sentence.

615
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,960
Do you know the last one?

616
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,520
We sat on the rocks to watch the sea.

617
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,720
Do you know this?

618
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,440
Maybe we'll fall in love with each other.

619
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,840
Isn't that good?

620
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,040
I think I'm good at talking.

621
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,800
Okay.

622
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,240
Yes, I heard from Mimi that

623
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,920
your type is

624
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,440
very handsome and cool.

625
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,280
In the past,

626
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,160
I had two extremes.

627
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,560
or

628
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,280
Very handsome.

629
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,760
or very cute.

630
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,800
Okay.

631
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,000
It's like I don't like thick face.

632
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,400
Never.

633
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,240
My heart hurts.

634
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,640
I guess I'm going to fail.

635
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,640
And today,

636
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,920
I said something funny.

637
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,680
Didn't I

638
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,400
for a long time in England?

639
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,120
My friend asked me

640
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,960
if you had contact with foreigners.

641
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
I said I think they all look the same.

642
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
I don't think anyone is handsome.

643
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,400
I just like Chinese.

644
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,160
I don't like foreigners.

645
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,560
I have no feelings for foreigners.

646
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,360
Oh no, you have no feelings for me.

647
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,040
No.

648
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,080
Then Mimi said,

649
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,800
"OK, I'll let you meet

650
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,480
They have a lot of

651
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
such love games

652
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,400
to have some childish interaction.

653
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,360
You can't move your fingers.

654
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,400
You can't help either.

655
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,680
Who wants to help?

656
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,080
You can't move your finger.

657
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,160
You foul again.

658
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,960
One, two, three.

659
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll let you win.

660
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,080
Thank you.

661
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,440
You're quite generous.

662
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,680
You're welcome.

663
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,720
I heard that one day she cried for you.

664
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,760
Why don't I know anything?

665
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,640
I feel like

666
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,360
falling out with the world every day.

667
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,800
Then I asked why.

668
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,040
Then they said I should ask myself.

669
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,520
I said, I...

670
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,360
Me again.

671
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
When will you talk?

672
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,400
I don't know.

673
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,160
when she was comforting me.

674
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
When?

675
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
The day we went to the cat café.

676
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,800
When did you talk?

677
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,440
When I was sleeping.

678
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,360
I think so.

679
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,280
What did you say?

680
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,600
I made her cry.

681
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Scold me?

682
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,080
No.

683
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,600
Me?

684
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,080
I forgot.

685
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,120
Liar.

686
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,560
You swear you forgot.

687
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,120
I swear "four".

688
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,600
Swear.

689
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,560
I swear.

690
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
I forgot.

691
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,040
My soup.

692
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm so curious.

693
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,080
Did you synchronize the rest with her?

694
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,640
Yes.

695
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,760
Why did you cry because of me that day?

696
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,720
How did you know?

697
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,480
She told me.

698
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
She said it.

699
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,040
Yes. Otherwise, how would I know

700
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,560
She cares about me.

701
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,160
When I shared with her,

702
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,040
she

703
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,280
feel sad for me.

704
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,160
And

705
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,840
she might want to

706
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,120
to suppress her emotions.

707
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,800
She went out for a walk.

708
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,680
She cried when she came back from a walk.

709
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
But...

710
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,160
I was confused.

711
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,880
My mind

712
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,960
in my mind.

713
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,920
Then I was a little dull.

714
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,720
I didn't hug her in the first second.

715
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,560
Then I felt guilty.

716
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,480
I don't know why I said

717
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,480
I didn't hug her right away.

718
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,560
I felt very sad.

719
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
I think

720
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,720
I shouldn't be like this.

721
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,520
I don't want to be like that either.

722
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,720
I'll apologize to her here.

723
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,480
She didn't care at all.

724
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,520
So at that time,

725
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,680
I might realize

726
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,000
I should cherish

727
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
when I get along with you.

728
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,800
I cried.

729
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,720
And Su Zihao kept going.

730
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,120
He even flipped my quilt.

731
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,440
I'm speechless.

732
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,600
Are you sleeping?

733
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,360
Are you crying?

734
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,920
He's asleep.

735
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,360
After he saw you,

736
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,440
he came to me.

737
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
He said, "What's wrong with you?"

738
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
I said, "What's wrong with me again?"

739
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,120
What's wrong with the soup?

740
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Come and take a look.

741
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,760
Is the soup asleep or crying?

742
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,880
We cricketed you loudly at the door.

743
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,960
She also said

744
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,120
Stop it, I beg you.

745
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,160
You're so talkative.

746
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,920
What are you talking about?

747
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,280
It's so funny.

748
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,960
She will reveal

749
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,160
everything about you.

750
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,680
You can't contact each other anymore.

751
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,360
I haven't seen Su Zihao cry.

752
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,160
When can he cry?

753
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
He might cry when he confesses.

754
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,280
because he's under a lot of pressure.

755
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,720
I think so too.

756
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,320
Because he's going abroad.

757
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,280
He's far away.

758
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,920
Yes.

759
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,480
Tata is going to Japan too.

760
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,680
He was worried too.

761
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,200
They also talked about a very realistic level.

762
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,760
Yes.

763
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,880
Why did you ask me

764
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,480
about long-distance relationship?

765
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,280
You want to go to England for postgraduate studies?

766
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,320
I'm not going to England for postgraduate studies.

767
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
But I think you're busy too.

768
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,000
It's not a long-distance relationship. It's like a long-distance relationship.

769
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,760
Are you busy?

770
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,080
I'm fine.

771
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,920
When I'm not busy,

772
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,360
when I'm not busy.

773
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,880
I think you can

774
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,320
do what I do with me,

775
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,080
Or I can be with you

776
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,720
with you.

777
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,640
But you're busy.

778
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,480
Didn't you say you're busy with flying?

779
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,040
So my concern is

780
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,360
I think you'll be very busy.

781
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,360
How many times do you think

782
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,840
see me a week?

783
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,960
I never thought

784
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,720
Three or four times.

785
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,680
Almost. We'll be busy when we're busy.

786
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,960
But I can't accept

787
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,640
a foreign land.

788
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,920
I think I'll die.

789
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,560
Indeed.

790
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,000
Yes.

791
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,640
Because after I fall in love,

792
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,800
I'll be clingy.

793
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,080
But I can't see you every day.

794
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,360
Every day?

795
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,280
It's too annoying.

796
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,800
We'll find each other's shortcomings.

797
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,520
Yes.

798
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,680
But I can't accept

799
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,240
Long time no see.

800
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Let me check the class schedule.

801
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,160
Three or four times should be fine.

802
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,680
The exclusive background music is here again.

803
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,880
Mr. Jiang.

804
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,800
So sweet.

805
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,600
Both of us

806
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,040
are clear now.

807
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,200
It's just a confession.

808
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,720
I've learned how to express myself

809
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,880
I've learned to express myself.

810
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,800
and take the initiative.

811
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,560
I'll prepare for my confession.

812
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,080
Let's go.

813
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,200
Okay.

814
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:15,920
Look.

815
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,760
The person in love

816
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,000
is full of sharing.

817
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,240
some boring things.

818
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,160
Playing, fighting.

819
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Do you still know how to fight now?

820
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,240
I think sometimes.

821
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,200
Sometimes

822
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,920
like going out with friends.

823
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,160
And

824
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
hold my hand like this sometimes.

825
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,800
and play with me.

826
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,360
Sometimes in front of many people,

827
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,800
But when I look into her eyes,

828
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,040
she might

829
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,920
like this.

830
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,800
Zun can't feel tired

831
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,120
in love, right?

832
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,200
I wasn't tired before

833
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,640
I'm tired now.

834
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,240
No.

835
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,440
When I was in a relationship,

836
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,280
I went to her house every day.

837
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,760
until two or three.

838
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,240
I'll pick her up at school the next day.

839
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,400
I won't feel tired.

840
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,960
Of course not.

841
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,280
When I was in college,

842
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,320
I would go to her teaching building after class.

843
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,360
Let's go to the fourth floor first.

844
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,440
100 meters.

845
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,680
Then rush to the fourth floor.

846
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,560
After her class,

847
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,280
and then rush out to take a taxi.

848
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,160
and then get some fruit.

849
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,280
I'm not tired at all.

850
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,200
I feel very happy.

851
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,240
A reward mechanism of dopamine.

852
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,960
I firmly believe

853
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,480
it's still called youth.

854
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,440
I think when people get older,

855
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,000
I want to date

856
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,240
It's good for health.

857
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,080
Yes.

858
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,320
Yes.

859
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
It's good for both of us.

860
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,680
Everyone is calm.

861
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,720
Not like before.

862
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,840
emotional ups and downs.

863
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,000
crying and laughing.

864
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,320
Yes.

865
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,160
Didn't I say it could be until two o'clock?

866
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,840
Sometimes

867
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,080
at 12:30 a.m.

868
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,160
Lying on the massage chair

869
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
Sometimes I snore

870
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,040
I'll try my best to create

871
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,760
with my husband.

872
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,560
My husband

873
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,360
to sleep until noon.

874
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,040
He can't sleep well at night.

875
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,360
He sleeps very late.

876
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,720
But after having a child,

877
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,480
I got up at 6:30 a.m.

878
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,360
After sending off our daughter,

879
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,640
we'll also buy steamed buns

880
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,880
and go to the cafe.

881
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,800
But no matter how tired I was,

882
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,200
I'll get up early

883
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,040
I would wake up early

884
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,840
and have breakfast with him.

885
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,000
And my husband

886
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,080
We will work hard.

887
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,440
Because I've heard a lot about my friends.

888
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,320
But this kind of trouble

889
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,080
it's not trouble at Dan's place.

890
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,400
She can do

891
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,880
that she can do.

892
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,160
No, they'll think it's troubling.

893
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,200
Because they don't love enough.

894
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,760
Yes.

895
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,200
In the past,

896
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,760
when I heard their worries,

897
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,560
I think

898
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,240
that's what love is like.

899
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,040
But as long as the person is right,

900
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
there seems to be no problem.

901
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,400
Yes.

902
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,880
You'll take the initiative to do these things.

903
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,440
Yes.

904
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,160
If you meet someone

905
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,400
who suits you,

906
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,840
Then you will create

907
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,880
your rhythm.

908
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,000
So I don't want you

909
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,080
affect their relationship

910
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,720
because of other people's love stories.

911
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,240
and don't learn from others.

912
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,280
But if you really love each other,

913
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,480
you may become

914
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,720
a beautiful love state.

915
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,760
And it can be preserved.

916
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,360
Wait.

917
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,880
Do you see Tom's nose?

918
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,360
What's wrong with him?

919
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,520
Did you see his nose?

920
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,600
Your nose?

921
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,040
handsome?

922
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,880
Why is it swollen?

923
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,160
"aesthetics".

924
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,800
I knocked yesterday.

925
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,400
Nothing.

926
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,400
Where did you hurt?

927
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,200
On the floor.

928
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,800
The rope is hooked by the suitcase.

929
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,600
It hurts.

930
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,120
Help!

931
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,040
What's wrong?

932
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Are you still alive?

933
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,200
My nose is bleeding.

934
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,520
It's bleeding.

935
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,040
Don't let it spill.

936
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,480
Get ice. I'll wrap your face with a towel.

937
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,320
Apply it.

938
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,920
He went to the hospital last night.

939
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,720
He might have a fracture.

940
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,760
A fracture?

941
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,160
There's a dent on the left.

942
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,120
It should be fine.

943
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,760
It's nothing serious. The doctor said

944
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,000
he'll recover for a week.

945
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,000
When did you sleep?

946
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,400
Six.

947
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,760
You sleep for four hours.

948
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,720
Go back to sleep.

949
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,960
I have to go out today.

950
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,720
Don't go out.

951
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,160
Stop!

952
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,480
What?

953
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,200
Don't go out.

954
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,080
I feel sorry for you.

955
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,120
Why didn't you tell me?

956
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,960
When I knew about this,

957
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,600
my first thought was

958
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,080
Why didn't you tell me?

959
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,320
I hope when something happens to him,

960
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,680
or when he encounters problems,

961
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,920
when he encounters problems.

962
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,360
No matter the problem he has,

963
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,480
or not,

964
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,440
If anything happens to him,

965
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,360
I definitely want to be the first

966
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,600
stand behind him.

967
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,400
So,

968
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,360
tell me next time.

969
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,800
I'll get angry if you don't tell me.

970
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,520
She

971
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,880
worried about me.

972
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,640
He asked me

973
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,920
I've never stopped caring about you.

974
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,920
I'm used to it since childhood.

975
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,440
But I have to prepare something for Susu.

976
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,080
So I'm leaving.

977
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,800
Bye.

978
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,840
People in love don't get tired.

979
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,240
Yes.

980
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Are you leaving? Yes.

981
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,320
Yes.

982
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,680
They really cherish every minute and second.

983
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,720
A couple in love.

984
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,040
Wait for me.

985
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,280
Wait for me.

986
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,840
I'm leaving.

987
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,680
Tell her before you go out.

988
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,880
The nose of soup.

989
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,720
Last night at 3 a.m.,

990
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,960
his pants were stuck in the wheel of the suitcase.

991
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,760
And then...

992
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,480
I didn't wear glasses.

993
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,800
I took a look. I couldn't see.

994
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,520
Then I went over.

995
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:56,840
I'll take a look.

996
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,880
What's wrong with you?

997
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,760
He said he fell.

998
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,400
Are you bleeding?

999
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,880
He said you're bleeding.

1000
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,240
And I...

1001
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,000
You're bleeding.

1002
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,800
A nosebleed.

1003
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,240
Then I flew down

1004
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
like lightning.

1005
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,120
I'll get the medical kit later.

1006
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,360
and fly up with a medical kit.

1007
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,200
I heard they went to the hospital in the middle of the night.

1008
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,240
My nose is swollen.

1009
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,160
You don't know.

1010
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,480
He left.

1011
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,280
Soft tissue injury or

1012
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,720
and the fine blood vessels are ruptured.

1013
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,480
But it's not a big problem.

1014
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,200
It should be fine.

1015
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,720
Don't worry.

1016
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,840
Okay, that's good.

1017
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,280
3 or 4 a.m.

1018
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,960
I went to the emergency room.

1019
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,400
I didn't sleep much.

1020
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,640
Then my nose got hurt.

1021
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,160
I feel a little sad.

1022
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,600
Poor guy.

1023
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,800
His nose is high.

1024
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,120
After the fall, your nose will be...

1025
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,280
Poor and unlucky.

1026
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,480
Let me help you throw out the trash.

1027
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,240
How about this?

1028
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,160
Thank you.

1029
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,800
Give me a hug.

1030
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,840
This one.

1031
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,320
Okay.

1032
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,400
It's over.

1033
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,560
I'll carry it for you.

1034
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,840
I told you to hold it up.

1035
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,960
Come on.

1036
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,080
Good.

1037
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
This photo of you

1038
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,160
is really dark.

1039
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Yes.

1040
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,000
One more.

1041
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,480
Okay.

1042
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,640
Put it with mine.

1043
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,240
with mine.

1044
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,480
I look fair.

1045
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,960
Alright.

1046
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,920
Don't you know that?

1047
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,320
And it's glowing.

1048
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,800
Why do you always like filming these?

1049
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,360
I'm speechless.

1050
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Have a seat.

1051
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,560
Don't be nervous and flustered here.

1052
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,080
Press your head into the dishwasher.

1053
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,800
Let me tell you.

1054
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,600
If this continues,

1055
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,440
Has he changed too much?

1056
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,600
The language is closer.

1057
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,040
Yes.

1058
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,200
You know there's a traffic jam.

1059
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,440
Aren't you going to drive back?

1060
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,640
Well...

1061
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,040
It's okay to go south.

1062
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,160
When I go home every Chinese New Year,

1063
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,120
I don't have a traffic jam.

1064
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,200
But if we go north,

1065
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,040
from Shanghai to Jiangsu,

1066
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,960
to Shandong.

1067
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,800
It's very congested.

1068
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,880
You need to be

1069
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,960
in your place.

1070
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,680
Is it possible that

1071
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,480
in the village?

1072
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,240
Be careful of being cricketed.

1073
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
They won't cricket me.

1074
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
The only thing they can cricket me

1075
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,440
is that I'm not married

1076
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
I'm not married yet.

1077
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,320
Let's play five-piece chess.

1078
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,040
Do you want to play?

1079
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,440
Here.

1080
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Do you think I'm thinking?

1081
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,600
I know I'm going to win.

1082
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,280
Really?

1083
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,159
If you win,

1084
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,560
What if you lose?

1085
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,560
Wait.

1086
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,239
What if you lose?

1087
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,280
I will definitely win.

1088
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,040
What if you lose?

1089
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,560
Wait.

1090
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,480
What if you lose?

1091
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,040
Wait.

1092
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,000
Let me ask you a question first.

1093
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,920
If you take the next step,

1094
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,480
you'll win?

1095
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,080
No.

1096
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,040
Really.

1097
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,280
Will we win the next step?

1098
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,920
Guess.

1099
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,239
You go first. Are you sure you'll win?

1100
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:55,800
I will win.

1101
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,920
I won two requirements.

1102
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,720
OK.

1103
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,280
I lost.

1104
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,080
You lost a request.

1105
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,960
Okay.

1106
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,360
Wait.

1107
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,160
I haven't decided yet.

1108
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,840
Wait.

1109
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,600
So cute.

1110
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,440
I really didn't see it.

1111
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,120
Look at me.

1112
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,720
Look.

1113
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,800
Is it?

1114
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,920
Bobo, do you want some water?

1115
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,480
I can’t be so peaceful now.

1116
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,080
Listen.

1117
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,240
Wait and see.

1118
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,840
Go ahead.

1119
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,560
I'll remember it forever.

1120
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,400
I'll remember it first.

1121
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,600
Actually,

1122
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,040
I want to agree to your request.

1123
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,360
No.

1124
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
This is a bit...

1125
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,680
I'm pretending.

1126
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,960
I'm pretending.

1127
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,040
Can you give me two pieces?

1128
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,520
What?

1129
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,000
Why are you laughing?

1130
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,840
I didn't win.

1131
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,040
I can play six-piece chess for you.

1132
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,720
I didn't win.

1133
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,360
Wait.

1134
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
Why didn't you win?

1135
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,440
I didn't win.

1136
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,720
I'll play six-piece chess for you.

1137
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,760
Are you gambling?

1138
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,400
I'm speechless.

1139
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,480
I can't refuse.

1140
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,200
No.

1141
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,680
Yinbo,

1142
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,560
Do you think you are handsome?

1143
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,280
I think you're super handsome.

1144
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,400
I think I'm ugly.

1145
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,160
Do you admit that you're smarter than me?

1146
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,720
I don't.

1147
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,600
I think you're smarter.

1148
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,960
A date with no regrets.

1149
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,880
Coming.

1150
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,480
Coming.

1151
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,720
This is the cake. I ordered it.

1152
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,560
What would you like to drink?

1153
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,840
I have swallow wheat milk

1154
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,640
and thick coconut milk.

1155
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,440
Coke.

1156
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,880
Choose one of these.

1157
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,720
Because you can't drink coffee.

1158
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,280
Do you remember?

1159
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,800
Of course.

1160
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,120
Help me choose.

1161
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,040
Okay, she's got swallow wheat milk.

1162
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,080
And I want thick coconut milk.

1163
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,640
The swallow wheat milk should be hot.

1164
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,320
Nice opening.

1165
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,400
Eat.

1166
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,600
Let's eat first.

1167
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,680
Have you had breakfast?

1168
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,960
No.

1169
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,040
I didn't have breakfast either.

1170
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,960
Neither did you.

1171
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,080
We're almost the same.

1172
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,040
Now I want to open it at the beginning.

1173
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,960
What?

1174
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,120
Not enough

1175
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,960
Open it again.

1176
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,920
Cool.

1177
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,440
Here.

1178
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,920
I still have some questions

1179
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,800
I still have some questions.

1180
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,880
And I want to

1181
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,720
I want to solve these regrets

1182
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
I'll get rid of them.

1183
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,760
If I hadn't found out by accident,

1184
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,880
what Tata said,

1185
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,080
will you tell me?

1186
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,240
Here's the thing.

1187
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,120
That day,

1188
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,480
First of all, I think

1189
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,440
is not something

1190
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,800
that I need to hide.

1191
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,880
But after the snow exercise that day,

1192
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
I had the most contact with her.

1193
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,080
I chose her first.

1194
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,640
Yes.

1195
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,800
But it doesn't mean

1196
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,880
That's right.

1197
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,200
That's not what I meant.

1198
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,760
From her perspective, I chose her first.

1199
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,480
and got this chance through the interview.

1200
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,720
But I may say

1201
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,400
I passed the interview.

1202
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,960
I'm happy to find you.

1203
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
So I think

1204
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,320
this is not a conflict.

1205
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,720
I think both of them

1206
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,440
for each other.

1207
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,840
I want to ask you a question.

1208
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,280
Go ahead.

1209
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,480
When did you start

1210
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,920
you want to

1211
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,240
you want to get to know me more

1212
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,440
or get to know more about me.

1213
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,960
Or you just wanted to

1214
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,400
to contact me or something.

1215
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,200
Actually on the first day,

1216
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,960
I was chatting with Soup in the siblings' house.

1217
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
I said I wanted to meet you.

1218
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,680
And then again,

1219
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,240
When I'm watching you uncontrollably,

1220
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,160
When we were skiing,

1221
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,480
when we were skiing?

1222
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,520
When I talked to you later,

1223
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,800
You said I was interviewed.

1224
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,840
Are you happy?

1225
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,240
Let me tell you.

1226
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,120
I was interviewed anyway.

1227
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,920
Are you happy?

1228
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,560
I think saying this to me

1229
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,240
will

1230
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,120
attract my attention and interest.

1231
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Now I know

1232
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,240
you said that casually.

1233
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,400
He may

1234
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,280
just casually.

1235
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,680
If it was intentional,

1236
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,960
it would be

1237
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,480
too meticulous.

1238
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm taking it to heart.

1239
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,560
I was interviewed today.

1240
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,520
Are you happy?

1241
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,440
I remember this very clearly.

1242
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,320
There's a change in mind.

1243
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,960
Her eyes have changed, Xiaoling.

1244
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
When we were in the hot spring yesterday,

1245
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,400
I have a question.

1246
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
whether you want to be friends with me

1247
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,440
or love?

1248
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,560
You said you don't know

1249
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,920
I already have the answer in my heart.

1250
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,200
Because after talking to you,

1251
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,360
Including the days

1252
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,720
the days I spent with you,

1253
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
and why I went

1254
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
with you.

1255
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,760
I think that's love.

1256
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,080
Okay.

1257
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,520
I have another question.

1258
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,160
When did you

1259
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,600
interested in me?

1260
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,880
From

1261
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,040
It's mainly from getting along.

1262
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,880
And I'll talk more

1263
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,360
with you.

1264
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,160
I feel like

1265
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,560
a normal conversation.

1266
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,720
So there's no point or a sentence.

1267
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,960
or movements.

1268
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,760
Is it step by step?

1269
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,080
Okay.

1270
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,280
This...

1271
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,360
I'm a little disappointed.

1272
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,760
Actually, I'm a combination of two.

1273
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
but I prefer love.

1274
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,120
I can actually fire you even more.

1275
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,800
Go ahead.

1276
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,840
From zero to ten.

1277
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,560
If zero means no feeling,

1278
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,640
I like it.

1279
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,840
What's your number?

1280
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,720
9.5.

1281
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,640
I don't think

1282
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,800
about this score.

1283
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
You might as well not give me this score.

1284
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,520
9.5 means I like you.

1285
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,440
I like you very much.

1286
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,320
You should be like Harry at 9:5.

1287
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,480
like Harry.

1288
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,520
Yes.

1289
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
If you like someone,

1290
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,480
you care about his feelings for you.

1291
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,400
When you like someone,

1292
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,240
I don't even know

1293
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,520
what socks do you like

1294
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,000
I want to ask all of them.

1295
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,120
Yes.

1296
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,160
I can't wait to ask

1297
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,680
from the beginning to the end.

1298
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,760
We all like Xiaoling.

1299
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,240
We just feel sorry for her.

1300
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,520
I'm afraid she might get hurt.

1301
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Yes.

1302
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,720
Are you that interested in me?

1303
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,600
Why didn't I feel it?

1304
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,880
To be honest, I was surprised.

1305
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,680
Because I think

1306
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,640
this is a very high score.

1307
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,960
He has reached 9.5.

1308
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,440
Almost full marks.

1309
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:27,920
Here's the thing.

1310
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
Because I think

1311
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,560
If I get one,

1312
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,160
like six points,

1313
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,360
I must be

1314
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,680
feel sorry for my heart.

1315
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,600
I think

1316
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,160
I must have feelings for you

1317
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,480
because I like you.

1318
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,520
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

1319
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,640
interact with you

1320
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,360
or something like that.

1321
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,440
Actually, I want to know someone.

1322
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,480
I'm not saying

1323
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,200
I want to keep getting to know her.

1324
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,120
I tend to

1325
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,800
and observe slowly.

1326
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,200
Interesting.

1327
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,880
So you have nothing

1328
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,720
ask me more?

1329
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,120
From my perspective,

1330
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,960
there is no problem at all.

1331
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,280
and the questions I want to ask you.

1332
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:20,920
I don't have any.

1333
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,240
Because I think

1334
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,440
you're not curious

1335
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,040
how much I have for you?

1336
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,520
Let me ask you another question.

1337
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,960
How many points will you give me?

1338
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,280
0 to 100. You need to be so detailed.

1339
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,320
Let me think.

1340
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,400
That's a key question.

1341
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,160
Yes.

1342
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,960
90.

1343
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,680
It's also very high.

1344
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,080
To be honest,

1345
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,560
I can't give him such a high score.

1346
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,400
But I do have feelings for him now.

1347
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,440
and interested in him.

1348
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,920
I don't think it's too low.

1349
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,240
I'm not honest with myself.

1350
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,880
Then why is it 90?

1351
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,560
Because before,

1352
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,080
I found that we are similar at this point.

1353
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,200
There's no way

1354
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,120
in the world.

1355
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,520
So this is the best answer

1356
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,400
I can give.

1357
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,120
After listening to you,

1358
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,400
I think we are quite similar.

1359
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,280
I had a plan for my ideal type.

1360
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,440
I said he must be tall.

1361
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,680
And he must be...

1362
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,120
We've talked about this anyway.

1363
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,680
I said

1364
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,680
I said the person I'm in contact with now is Tu.

1365
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,720
He's not

1366
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,760
in my traditional concept.

1367
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,080
So later they asked me

1368
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,280
if I had an ideal type.

1369
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,880
I said it depends on the feeling.

1370
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,280
Well,

1371
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,480
because you showed up.

1372
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,640
I heard that two people are very similar

1373
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,360
to get along with.

1374
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,960
But I think we are the opposite.

1375
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,080
Because I think two people who are very similar

1376
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,920
He can understand

1377
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,480
his feelings

1378
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,680
can

1379
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,360
and guess

1380
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,280
I guess.

1381
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,040
So if others ask me,

1382
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,240
if people ask me

1383
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,720
or more complementary?

1384
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,360
I think we'll choose something similar.

1385
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,560
Look, he's testing again.

1386
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
It's the same.

1387
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,240
It's really like a postgraduate interview.

1388
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,480
We actually lack this part.

1389
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:05,920
Yes.

1390
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,360
We always hang out there.

1391
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,600
If we didn't talk yesterday,

1392
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
I would definitely talk to you.

1393
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,440
I don't think we're the only ones.

1394
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,040
We just sit here.

1395
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,400
Face to face. That's how we talk.

1396
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,520
I've always wanted to talk to you face to face.

1397
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,080
Right?

1398
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,520
But I didn't dare.

1399
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,800
You were brave yesterday.

1400
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,760
Why didn't you be brave?

1401
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,920
Why am I always brave?

1402
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,480
Do you know why?

1403
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,720
Because yesterday,

1404
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,560
I felt upset.

1405
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,120
It's like a twist.

1406
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,760
I feel so bad.

1407
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,280
For so many days,

1408
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,200
even more painful

1409
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,400
when I cried that day.

1410
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,240
After the soul of the soup,

1411
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,560
I will think

1412
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,200
what kind of feeling

1413
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,960
and the answer

1414
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,280
with your heart.

1415
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,760
Even if we didn't have a date today,

1416
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,200
I'd go to

1417
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,360
the House of Feelings

1418
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,320
to make it clear to you.

1419
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,960
Then you suddenly took a photo of me.

1420
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,640
Then I said it was you.

1421
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,040
Yes.

1422
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,760
At that time,

1423
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,120
when I stood up,

1424
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,280
I was like a rock.

1425
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,640
I said,

1426
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,720
we can finally talk face to face.

1427
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,520
In the end, I'm braver and decisive.

1428
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,720
What do you think

1429
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,600
what do you think

1430
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,720
need to have?

1431
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,920
What characteristics?

1432
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,560
I think for me,

1433
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,840
I can't accept cold violence.

1434
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,000
Don't worry.

1435
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,880
I am

1436
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,800
hot violence.

1437
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,480
Will you shout "hot violence"?

1438
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,000
If I really reach that point,

1439
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,520
I think

1440
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,440
We don't have to argue.

1441
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,440
I will try to communicate.

1442
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,560
I don't like cold violence.

1443
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,040
I don't like cold violence either.

1444
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,760
It's hard.

1445
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,200
I hate things

1446
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,240
that's cold and hot.

1447
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,080
I'm...

1448
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,120
One more thing.

1449
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,520
I want to be with excellent people.

1450
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,880
How do I define that?

1451
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,080
Just occasionally.

1452
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,120
But you can't lie down and break it every day.

1453
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,400
Yes.

1454
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,000
One more thing

1455
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,320
I want.

1456
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,960
But I think many people don't have this point.

1457
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,080
But I actually saw

1458
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,880
on you.

1459
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,120
Many things

1460
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,680
I don't need to make it clear.

1461
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,680
you will notice

1462
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,240
For example,

1463
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,160
I said you came to Beijing for postgraduate entrance exam.

1464
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,400
So what?

1465
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,960
Because I know

1466
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,680
with my own heart.

1467
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,160
my little selfishness.

1468
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,920
But I don't think anyone would notice it.

1469
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,000
But I didn't expect you to notice it.

1470
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,720
What I can do is

1471
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,600
is...

1472
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,320
I'll visit you on holidays.

1473
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,840
Come home often.

1474
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,960
Or come to play with me.

1475
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,680
Work hard for the postgraduate entrance exam.

1476
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,800
Getting into Beijing

1477
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,480
I put pressure on you.

1478
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,440
Come on.

1479
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,040
In my previous plan,

1480
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,920
in my previous plan.

1481
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,480
But when you...

1482
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,920
you didn't tell me

1483
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,600
about it,

1484
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,960
I would think

1485
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,240
I've already started to ask

1486
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,320
That's right.

1487
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,120
Yes.

1488
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,720
I'm already asking.

1489
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,360
Okay.

1490
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,840
Just take mine

1491
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,760
into your plan.

1492
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,280
Yes.

1493
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,600
In the future,

1494
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,080
we must understand each other.

1495
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,400
It's hard for us

1496
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,440
to meet or something.

1497
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,960
So I think we should communicate more.

1498
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,480
Both of them

1499
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,440
are even thinking about the next step.

1500
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,200
Not bad.

1501
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,360
I'm curious about one more thing.

1502
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,960
after the show,

1503
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,640
after the show?

1504
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,200
keep in touch with me?

1505
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,960
Definitely.

1506
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,800
I think both of us

1507
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,480
both professional and interest,

1508
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,640
we will definitely

1509
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,400
contact each other

1510
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,000
and get to know each other.

1511
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,440
What do you think

1512
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,240
you are worried about?

1513
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,920
Actually, I'm not that old.

1514
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,960
Although I may be a little younger than you,

1515
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,200
but I might...

1516
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,280
I shouldn't

1517
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,200
I'm not a little younger than you, am I?

1518
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,600
I'm not sure.

1519
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,440
It's hard to say.

1520
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,760
Yeah, anyway,

1521
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,040
In my opinion, it's mainly about distance.

1522
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,120
You can't stand long-distance relationship.

1523
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:07,600
Well,

1524
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,560
Although we said before

1525
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,320
we would want some space to be alone.

1526
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,440
But

1527
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,400
I'm not

1528
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,840
I'm not that clingy.

1529
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,560
but

1530
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,400
I think these two

1531
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,920
can be combined.

1532
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,880
But sometimes, for example,

1533
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,960
my family or someone

1534
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,440
sent me a message.

1535
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,120
I won't reply to him.

1536
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,920
I'll definitely say I'll go back later.

1537
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,880
That kind of personality.

1538
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,200
Okay, the prevention shot has been shot.

1539
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,200
Got it.

1540
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
That's all.

1541
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,400
I'm like...

1542
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,040
For example, I may be busy now.

1543
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,160
I can't talk to you.

1544
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,080
I'll say I'll come to you later.

1545
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,720
I really

1546
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,200
who likes to play videos.

1547
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,080
If I'm really happy and want to share,

1548
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,040
I'll play a video right away.

1549
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,080
Be it happy

1550
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,000
or sad,

1551
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,080
I think you can hear my voice

1552
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,200
and my expression.

1553
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,920
I'll wait for your video call.

1554
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,000
Yes.

1555
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,840
Look.

1556
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,480
Xiao Ling took the initiative.

1557
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,680
Today, Xiaoling and I

1558
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,560
with Xiao Ling.

1559
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,520
I know she meant it.

1560
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,160
I made the right choice.

1561
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,200
I'll make myself clear.

1562
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,240
During today's regret date,

1563
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,640
I can feel that

1564
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,520
care about what I say.

1565
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,560
My relationship with Tu has increased.

1566
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,760
I think

1567
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,760
whatever you want to say,

1568
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,440
You can understand it from a friendship's perspective.

1569
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,400
It's all set.

1570
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,760
So I've been looking forward

1571
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,600
to say a word from Tu Tu's mouth.

1572
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,440
A little.

1573
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,520
Make it clear.

1574
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,680
She's a good girl

1575
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,000
She's such an excellent girl.

1576
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,760
said she likes you.

1577
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,520
She confessed her feelings for you.

1578
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,560
What if the picture really likes you?

1579
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,080
But in his twenties,

1580
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,520
when he's over 20.

1581
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,760
Maybe he wants to change.

1582
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,440
Through two heart parties,

1583
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,280
we have some secrets that we can't tell.

1584
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,920
To be honest,

1585
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,840
the truth.

1586
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,360
It's also based on trust in each other.

1587
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,840
It's also a form of desire for a warm-up relationship.

1588
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,560
Do you think honesty

1589
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,280
is very important?

1590
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,240
I really think being honest

1591
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,480
From the moment I met you,

1592
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,760
from the moment I met you.

1593
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,040
you have to confess.

1594
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,640
But before you met him,

1595
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,240
before you met him,

1596
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,280
I hope you can

1597
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,640
a selected confession.

1598
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,120
Yes.

1599
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,120
Actually, I don't encourage

1600
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,880
to be honest about all the love history.

1601
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,960
I think in the future,

1602
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,880
you don't know

1603
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,720
a chemical reaction.

1604
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,920
But for example, finance,

1605
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,160
health

1606
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,920
because it will affect our relationship.

1607
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,320
We should be honest.

1608
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,280
But the most important thing

1609
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,440
is from this moment on.

1610
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,480
the confession

1611
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,520
after meeting you

1612
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,480
so that both parties

1613
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,760
communicate completely

1614
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,080
and let them know how you feel.

1615
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,400
I think this is very important.

1616
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,680
Love is the game of the brave.

1617
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,080
Yes.

1618
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,520
So be honest.

1619
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,880
as long as you are sincere,

1620
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,520
it can stand the test and experience of time.

1621
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,440
If love proves

1622
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,520
it proves your sincerity

1623
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,480
and a reward for being brave.

1624
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,080
Next week, our cottage

1625
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,880
is coming to an end.

1626
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,200
We're brothers.

1627
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,240
Will you give us your final vote?

1628
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,280
Will you receive

1629
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,160
(will you be able to)

1630
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,000
your true love?

1631
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,600
Let's look forward to next week's show.

1632
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,400
Let's

1633
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,400
Love Sisters

1634
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,840
Let love double

1635
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,240
The night before the confession

1636
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,080
In order to

1637
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,840
confirm each other's feelings better.

1638
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,320
Next, we will ask her

1639
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,080
I'll ask him a question instead of my brother.

1640
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,200
I'll tell you when the court is here.

1641
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,760
If someone else

1642
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,560
does everything to you,

1643
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,920
you'll still like him, right?

1644
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,360
What a sharp question.

1645
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,360
Are both parties equal in love?

1646
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,040
You scared me.

1647
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,760
After getting in touch with Tata,

1648
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,520
did you regret

1649
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,800
what you regret in the house?

1650
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,120
Do you mind being a match?

1651
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,280
Since you're not sure about your feelings,

1652
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,360
you've been

1653
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,680
giving the signal to Xiaoling.

1654
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,560
Are you looking for a way out for yourself?

1655
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,080
You look like a face.

1656
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,200
If Tae-seo had been in the house from the beginning,

1657
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,160
would you choose Tae-seo more firmly?

1658
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,440
I want to express my feelings

1659
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,640
my feelings.

1660
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,360
If he likes me,

1661
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,760
he'll confess to me.

1662
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,120
I know

1663
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,280
my feelings.

1664
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,200
I think he'll confess to me.

1665
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,040
I don't think anyone will.

1666
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,200
Tell them

1667
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,000
your true thoughts.

1668
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,560
I didn't do anything.

1669
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,800
There must be some regrets.

1670
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,400
I still need to convey my thoughts.

1671
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,320
Because I like this girl very much.

1672
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,840
I want to fight for her.

1673
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,600
for such a long time.

1674
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,040
Don't let this relationship down.
