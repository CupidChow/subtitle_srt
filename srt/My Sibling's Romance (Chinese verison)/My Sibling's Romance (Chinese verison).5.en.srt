1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
A small party.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
A party? Wild wine. I feel there will be

3
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,319
Have a party, Ye.

4
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,200
Feels like we'll have some wild wine.

5
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,400
will watch Love Sisters first.

6
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,479
Love Siblings.

7
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,720
Let love double.

8
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,759
(Welcome to "Love Sibling")

9
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,680
"Love Sisters".

10
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,400
This show is called "Little Wild Wine",

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,759
I feel there will be a fruit immediately.

12
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,680
exclusively sponsored.

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,240
We are the love family members.

14
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,000
A week passed in a blink of an eye.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
It's too long.

16
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,200
Last week, we lost our appetite.

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,000
Look at the relationship between the two teams.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,280
are officially announced.

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,240
And we will find that

20
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,680
the soup is a little sensitive.

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,560
A little sad.

22
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,320
Because of the communication between Susu and the map,

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,040
I started to think a lot.

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,360
And we also found

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,560
Harry and Xinxin

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,680
A little sparkling.

27
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,759
whispering in the kitchen.

28
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,640
This week we are going to

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
members of the cabin

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,200
to announce the life album.

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,760
I saw the preview last week.

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,040
He suddenly got emotional.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,400
Yes.

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,960
What happened to them?

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
We're going to

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,480
the update of this episode.

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,400
What a coincidence.

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
my wife and my daughter can play it.

39
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,400
It seems to be a must for love.

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,600
The soup heard you playing the piano.

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,760
She's filming quietly.

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,480
Take a picture of her.

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,800
Who?

44
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,120
Susu, listen to it with him. It's OK.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,920
Can you?

46
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
Can you?

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,200
Where are you going?

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,600
Susu, don't go down.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,160
The soup is coming.

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,200
He might think that he's not interested in him.

51
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
When Xiaoling was playing the piano,

52
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,120
when Xiao Ling was playing the piano.

53
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,560
I don't want Xiaoling to see it.

54
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,520
I don't want her to notice.

55
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,760
I think it's best for her

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
is the best.

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
I actually paid attention to you.

58
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,560
But I chose

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,160
a way to accompany her silently.

60
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,600
Yes.

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,680
Be quiet.

62
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,440
Thank you.

63
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,800
I almost cried.

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,560
You'll find that the soup

65
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,600
from Xiaoling.

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,800
It means they know each other well.

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Because soup may know Xiaoling better.

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,760
It's a kind of shy and sensitive personality.

69
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,640
He also said

70
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,720
I don't want to disturb her.

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,040
and show her

72
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,200
and generous.

73
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,920
So he didn't bother his sister.

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,000
Xiaoling.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,640
Actually, she took a girl down

76
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,360
to watch the soup and play the piano.

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,040
I agree with my brother's talent.

78
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,440
She wants the shining point of her brother

79
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
to be seen by more people.

80
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,280
And I think my younger brother is more confident.

81
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,720
Yeah.

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,480
She won't make him nervous.

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,760
Yes.

84
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,360
or something.

85
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,000
It means

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,440
know each other well.

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,080
You must have learned it for a long time.

88
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,440
Yes.

89
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,600
But I didn't take the exam.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,680
I just learned to play.

91
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,800
I've always been interested.

92
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,600
Almost.

93
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,920
I learned to play drums when I was a kid.

94
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,400
I can't do it at all now.

95
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,040
Drums

96
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
It sounds cool.

97
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,840
He was so handsome.

98
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,120
Of course it was a bit dark

99
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
Like a little coal

100
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,920
Do you have a photo

101
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,960
You'll know.

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,480
Xinxin cares about Harry.

103
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,600
I want to know his past.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,160
Looking forward to it.

105
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Yes, what's your hobby?

106
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,960
Playing the piano?

107
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,400
I actually like outdoor.

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,680
I like skiing.

109
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,400
I only know how to use double plates.

110
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,440
Me too.

111
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
I just want to learn how to play doubles.

112
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,040
Let's go on a date.

113
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,320
Let's go skiing that day.

114
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,080
We went skiing together.

115
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,880
What did you drink?

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,680
Chinese medicine.

117
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,280
There's a silver cat outside.

118
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,080
I want to show you.

119
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,840
What?

120
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,200
Stop!

121
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,120
You'll scare him away.

122
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,600
Go one by one.

123
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,720
Where?

124
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,920
So cute.

125
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
Kitty.

126
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,680
Mimi.

127
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,280
It's so family.

128
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,720
Mimi.

129
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,040
Do you want to play the piano?

130
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,760
What do you want to hear?

131
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,800
Jay Chou, order.

132
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,440
I'll play whatever I want.

133
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,200
Susu said

134
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,480
she likes Jay Chou very much.

135
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,040
Then I played it.

136
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,120
but she wasn't there.

137
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
I should have hidden the cat.

138
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,280
So that's why.

139
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
She's not here either.

140
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,520
Who's showing off his charm?

141
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,320
I don't know why he started playing the piano.

142
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,520
I still heard it.

143
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,400
Go in, Susu.

144
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,360
Go in.

145
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,640
Jay Chou is my favorite.

146
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,960
My favorite.

147
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,360
Jay Chou seems to write good songs.

148
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
Most importantly, there's a boy at the back.

149
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm going to feed him too.

150
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,520
Take the initiative.

151
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,840
and took this step.

152
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,640
Go!

153
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,360
Go!

154
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,200
Brave. That's what you should do.

155
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,520
It's coming.

156
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,720
Not every one of them takes a bite.

157
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,400
Keep going.

158
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,480
Keep walking.

159
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Walk over.

160
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,680
She returned it.

161
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,240
I saw her with Tu.

162
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,520
I don't want to disturb them.

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,960
I think if

164
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,080
the map is interested in Susu,

165
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,480
I'll give them some space to get along with.

166
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,440
I'm not a person

167
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,080
to disturb others.

168
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
He's quick-witted.

169
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,120
He's afraid of offending others.

170
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,760
He's so observant.

171
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,480
It's heartbreaking.

172
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,040
Yes.

173
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,320
He's too considerate.

174
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,920
But actually,

175
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,520
he doesn't have to give himself so many shackles.

176
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,600
There will be a chance.

177
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,880
But I can understand him.

178
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,840
Because if it were me,

179
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,720
I would also go back.

180
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,280
I think

181
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,000
those two are here.

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,480
I feel awkward going there.

183
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,720
I might as well find another chance

184
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,200
to go back.

185
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,600
Yes.

186
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,680
When we have Susu,

187
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,120
we can be alone.

188
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
It depends.

189
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,880
If you think they don't like each other,

190
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,600
it will pass.

191
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,640
If you knew the map liked her,

192
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,040
you wouldn't have gone there.

193
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,760
Yes.

194
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,520
But what's scary is

195
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,080
The soup thought the picture liked her.

196
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,720
Yes.

197
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,840
He gave her an answer first.

198
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,000
But it might not be the answer at all.

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,240
It's not that complicated.

200
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,920
Yes.

201
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,080
I'll be an eyesore. Okay.

202
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,320
and stand next to her.

203
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,720
I want to see what you are doing.

204
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,679
I can't wait to stick a picture like this.

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,120
Look together.

206
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,559
In fact, we're observing secretly

207
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,040
to see what's going on between them.

208
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,520
Yes.

209
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,880
It's better than guessing by yourself.

210
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,000
Make a clear judgment.

211
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,920
Yes.

212
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,880
Shall we eat?

213
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,200
Shall we get ready first?

214
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,640
Then

215
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Don't have so many people in the kitchen

216
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,360
It's too troublesome.

217
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,440
Yeah, I think we should just divide it.

218
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,560
Four in a group.

219
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,120
OK.

220
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
Black and white.

221
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Then call them back.

222
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,640
Why don't we leave them alone?

223
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,400
Leave them alone.

224
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier? I'll lock the door.

225
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,880
I'll lock something for you.

226
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,480
Let me tell you.

227
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,080
The heart of the soup is broken.

228
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,880
Let me ask you.

229
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,400
We're going to choose the squad.

230
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,440
We choose the squad.

231
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,160
What squad?

232
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,280
Do you want to fight?

233
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,320
We've decided

234
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,360
to cook.

235
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,880
I don't care about the other four.

236
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,520
OK.

237
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
Two boys and two girls.

238
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,440
OK.

239
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,800
The back of my hand

240
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
Chef and I

241
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,320
Can you cook

242
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,040
To be honest, I'm not good at it.

243
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,480
According to my heart,

244
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,960
I don't think you need to make it based on your cooking skills.

245
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,400
Yes.

246
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,320
Who do you choose?

247
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,680
I choose Hua.

248
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,960
Okay.

249
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,080
How hard is it?

250
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,240
Hua is good at cooking.

251
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,880
Yeah.

252
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,880
OK. You are not qualified to choose flowers.

253
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,960
I chose Hua.

254
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,160
I choose Xiao Ling and Xinxin.

255
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,520
Thank you for today.

256
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,160
Let's cook.

257
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,720
It's okay. We won't do the dishes later.

258
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,240
Come on.

259
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,520
We're having hot pot today.

260
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,000
I thought he chose Xinxin and Susu.

261
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,760
My head seems a bit messy today.

262
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,720
I can't remember his name.

263
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,240
What should I do?

264
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,280
Oh no.

265
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,680
Do you still think

266
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,000
are brothers?

267
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,520
Kind of.

268
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,320
Do you want your polar scallops today?

269
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,840
Yes, or it'll break.

270
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Eat it all.

271
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,280
Come on.

272
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,960
So many people.

273
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,360
You can do it.

274
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,040
Now I find that I can't remember anyone.

275
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
What's my name?

276
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,080
Your name is Hua.

277
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,840
Your name is Hua.

278
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,760
You're also called Hua?

279
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,640
He did it on purpose.

280
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,160
I can see it.

281
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,920
Go ahead.

282
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,560
Okay.

283
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,280
Then you two take the hot pot base out.

284
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,880
Put it in.

285
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,480
Where is the hot pot base?

286
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,320
Here.

287
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,720
But we can only eat one flavor.

288
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,160
Right?

289
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,040
So spicy.

290
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,280
I bought the tomato pot.

291
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,880
I can't see I'm a little short.

292
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,200
Let me find it for you.

293
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,800
Just take it from her back.

294
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,840
Right? Yes.

295
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,560
Why did you move?

296
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,400
Tomato flavor

297
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,960
I bought it.

298
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,440
Let's eat tomato pot, right?

299
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,640
Let's eat spicy food.

300
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
He can't eat spicy food.

301
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,640
She remembers.

302
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,400
Yes.

303
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,600
Why don't you eat?

304
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,680
Less spicy.

305
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,960
less spicy.

306
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
How about two pots?

307
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,640
Two pots or two electromagnetic ovens?

308
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,720
No.

309
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,400
No two (pot).

310
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,720
I'll take it.

311
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,040
Eat spicy food. It's okay.

312
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,280
I'll put this back.

313
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,520
What if you can't eat it?

314
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,560
Again.

315
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,880
Cook more sesame oil.

316
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
It won't be spicy, right?

317
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,960
Are you sure you can drive?

318
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
I just finished.

319
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,400
How much do you want?

320
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
1.6 liters.

321
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,280
Which one is cold water?

322
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,120
Okay, it's fine.

323
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,880
It's cold water over there.

324
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,280
Put cold water.

325
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,600
Ask him.

326
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,160
You ask first.

327
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,200
Cold water, right?

328
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,960
Hurry up if it's boiling water.

329
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,440
It's okay.

330
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,320
It's too hard for me to do it.

331
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Just put it casually.

332
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,480
Is it appropriate?

333
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,240
So what?

334
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,560
Okay.

335
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,480
I'll set it up.

336
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,920
Okay.

337
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,280
Okay, I'm splitting.

338
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,800
Why?

339
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,680
It's too ugly.

340
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,240
It's okay.

341
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,720
I just made salmon casually.

342
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,200
Okay.

343
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,800
Okay.

344
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Now

345
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,720
This is too normal.

346
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,920
It's normal.

347
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,880
Yes, they're definitely siblings.

348
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,280
Please be brothers.

349
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,400
Please.

350
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,920
Can we wash some vegetables

351
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,480
and iron it?

352
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,240
Of course.

353
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,920
Okay.

354
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,080
I'm coming

355
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,680
Should I peel the garlic?

356
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
It's okay. You wash it.

357
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,480
I don't know how.

358
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,560
You can't wash, right?

359
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,480
I can.

360
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,400
I can.

361
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm good at washing vegetables.

362
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,520
How hard it is to wash vegetables

363
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,960
What if the chef cooks vegetables tomorrow

364
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,920
Whatever

365
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,960
I don't care.

366
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,040
It's a little cold.

367
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,520
Is it hot water?

368
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,440
No.

369
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,360
What if it's cooked?

370
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,360
It's okay

371
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,160
I'll eat it after it's cooked.

372
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,960
They both speak in the south accent.

373
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,360
Maybe they are a family.

374
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,280
If they are not a family,

375
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,160
I would've

376
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,880
two arrows.

377
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,200
Let me wash them.

378
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,760
Okay, wait a moment.

379
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,440
It dropped garlic

380
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,000
It dropped garlic.

381
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's flush water.

382
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,320
Come on.

383
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,440
Be careful.

384
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,000
Let me do it.

385
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,560
Can you let me pull that?

386
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,560
You can't pull that much.

387
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,640
You can do that.

388
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,200
You can do it.

389
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,600
No way.

390
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,800
Okay.

391
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,960
Failed.

392
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,600
You're so cute.

393
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,640
You have great emotional value.

394
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,280
How stupid you are!

395
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,760
Okay, slow down.

396
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,680
I'm afraid you'll "fly".

397
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,400
I'll cut some pork belly.

398
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
But we have enough meat

399
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's cook for them tomorrow.

400
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,840
I want to eat, OK?

401
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,880
I'll be straight with you.

402
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,480
Cut.

403
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,040
Finish it.

404
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,840
You must eat it.

405
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,280
I'll be mad if anyone doesn't eat it.

406
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,400
Why are you laughing?

407
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,640
He's a observer too.

408
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,160
Is this potato slices?

409
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,520
Does it look like potatoes

410
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,360
No.

411
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,560
Don't cut your hand.

412
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,400
You can't cut it.

413
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,320
Okay.

414
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,720
You protected yourself well.

415
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,080
Yes.

416
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,840
Okay.

417
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,480
As long as we can be close.

418
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
I haven't said anything yet.

419
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,880
When I saw you say "En",

420
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,120
I know what you want to say.

421
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,040
Really?

422
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,680
The size is different.

423
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
I think it's amazing.

424
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,200
Okay.

425
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,560
The emotional value is high.

426
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,520
Eat more later.

427
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,360
Can you cut it?

428
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,200
That's right.

429
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,000
You can try.

430
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,560
I can't.

431
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,080
I can wash it for you.

432
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,120
Susu, give him a little bit.

433
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,680
even a little bit.

434
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:55,680
No.

435
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,200
Can you cut your nails?

436
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,720
I can't.

437
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,200
He said he could try.

438
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay, come on.

439
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:00,840
Come on.

440
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,600
Don't get spicy.

441
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,760
Cut it with this.

442
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,160
Should I cut it like this?

443
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,480
No.

444
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,040
Looking at him

445
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,520
when I look at him.

446
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,800
Try it.

447
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,400
I can't do it.

448
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Come on.

449
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,200
Come on.

450
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,600
A boy.

451
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,280
What?

452
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,960
Let's have hot pot.

453
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,320
OK.

454
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,000
Fatty, look at the camera.

455
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,160
Three, two, one.

456
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,000
I haven't cooked hot pot at home for a long time.

457
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,160
Fatty, you can't dip it.

458
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,320
You have to stand up and eat if you can't.

459
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,240
I have a picture.

460
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,560
I'm so concerned.

461
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,280
That sounds like a sister.

462
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,560
Oh no.

463
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,760
Wait.

464
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,160
Who made the seasoning?

465
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:18,400
Yes.

466
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,760
I...

467
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,760
my real sister.

468
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,520
I thought of something sad.

469
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,200
You can eat the meat now.

470
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,960
You can eat the bottom.

471
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,840
What's this

472
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,840
This is pork belly

473
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,560
It's my first time eating hot pot pork belly

474
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:35,920
I made it

475
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,960
I only had barbecue

476
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,680
I've been staring and watching

477
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,960
Eat soft food.

478
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,680
Susu.

479
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,800
Susu.

480
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,600
No wonder you can dance.

481
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,280
I should know what kind of dance you can dance.

482
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,520
From elementary school?

483
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,680
No.

484
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,960
Not really.

485
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,920
I learned it when I was a kid.

486
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,800
And it broke.

487
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,440
But now

488
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,760
I do it when I like it.

489
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,520
What kind of dance?

490
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
All kinds of dance, right?

491
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,080
The floor.

492
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,920
When we mop the floor,

493
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,520
when we mop the floor?

494
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,880
Sure.

495
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,240
Wipe it.

496
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,480
Just like that cleaning machine.

497
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:20,920
Xiaoling.

498
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,160
I've never seen you smile so happily.

499
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,840
No, I found Fatty

500
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,160
grow on the smile

501
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,920
of soup and Xiaoling.

502
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,760
They think it's funny.

503
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,240
We think it's okay.

504
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,600
The soup was also at noon today.

505
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,400
Really?

506
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
It's funny when you smile suddenly.

507
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,880
We think it's a little funny.

508
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,920
He thought it was funny.

509
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,440
The soup understands my joke.

510
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,800
I even blinked.

511
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,720
A little bit narrow.

512
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,720
Why? Are you sleepy?

513
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,280
You're up too early.

514
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,960
Sleep more tomorrow.

515
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,760
It's Harry and me today.

516
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,440
Okay.

517
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,040
You're wearing a little vest.

518
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,200
I'm starting to show some muscle lines.

519
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,240
Do you need my help?

520
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,440
You need to wear this.

521
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,920
Pull.

522
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,360
Pour it directly later.

523
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,600
It can't be removed, right?

524
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,960
Yes. Just throw it into a trash bag later.

525
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,000
It's more convenient.

526
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,720
I can do it myself.

527
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,440
Let me wash it for you.

528
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,160
I'll wash it after I'm done.

529
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,600
Gloves.

530
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,120
This glove is so funny.

531
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,000
What's so funny?

532
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,320
This is to prevent dripping on your sleeves.

533
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,440
This woman likes this man.

534
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,840
We're the only ones left.

535
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
They all went to rest.

536
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,600
Could it be...

537
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,480
You...

538
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,520
Can you wear it properly?

539
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,080
No.

540
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,760
Can you wear it properly from the beginning?

541
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,480
You either don't wear it

542
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,760
and go back to do the laundry.

543
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,960
So ambiguous. The little shoulder band.

544
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,120
I tidied it up for him again.

545
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,720
This little shoulder band will fall off.

546
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,360
Have you decided what to do tomorrow?

547
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,560
I'm going to make beef rice.

548
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,520
Beef rice.

549
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,720
Oh no.

550
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,640
I didn't buy tomatoes just now.

551
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,680
What should we do?

552
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,240
Beef with needle mushroom.

553
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,480
Sweet.

554
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,440
You can't eat it.

555
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,240
I've never heard of this.

556
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,560
Just put the needle mushroom in the beef.

557
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,000
Okay.

558
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,920
Of course.

559
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,840
Should we fry it or steam it?

560
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
Just use oil.

561
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,920
We need to cook eight dishes.

562
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,160
Sorry.

563
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,440
Your eyes are very...

564
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,640
I think they are

565
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
in relationship.

566
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,200
They can control each other.

567
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,960
Yes.

568
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,200
I'll learn one today.

569
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,160
You make seven.

570
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,040
Harry is blooming.

571
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,400
The curry potato drumstick.

572
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I think it's okay.

573
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,160
You want it?

574
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,600
I can do it.

575
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,480
Are you sure?

576
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,720
It's not hard, right?

577
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,520
It's just cutting potatoes.

578
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,480
It's easy to peel your hands.

579
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,360
Then you do it.

580
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,960
I think cooking is quite interesting.

581
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,560
Cooking is very interesting.

582
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,520
Really.

583
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,000
Every time I cook, the process is complicated.

584
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,040
I may use several bowls.

585
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,080
But when I was waiting for that dish,

586
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,120
I already washed the dishes.

587
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,600
Right

588
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,880
When you cook,

589
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,520
If everything is messy,

590
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,440
to the end,

591
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,760
I'll slack off the moment I finish eating.

592
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,600
I'll give up.

593
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,880
Me too.

594
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,920
I don't want to face it.

595
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,880
or there was only one pot left.

596
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,600
I said no.

597
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,200
Wash it tomorrow.

598
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,320
Yes.

599
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,400
Enough.

600
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,800
Do you really have OCD?

601
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,440
You can be dirty secretly,

602
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,360
but not in front of me.

603
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,200
in front of me.

604
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,800
You know?

605
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,680
You just need to look at him

606
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,440
he looks good.

607
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,200
I think personality is more important.

608
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,040
To be honest,

609
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,000
How much do you think looks

610
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,960
to make you like it?

611
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,000
Five points is fine.

612
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,400
Not less than five points.

613
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,840
Only six points will pass.

614
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,720
Share your view of love.

615
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,000
Again?

616
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,440
I said

617
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
That's good.

618
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,520
That means you care about your heart.

619
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,600
You think I talk less today?

620
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,880
I didn't argue with you.

621
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,400
Guoli.

622
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,960
You know oil can't fall into the sewer.

623
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,120
You said fish can't be eaten.

624
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,040
Who told you not to eat fish?

625
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,400
You said you can't eat the intestines.

626
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,840
You can't eat your organs.

627
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,200
What should I do?

628
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,080
In your words,

629
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,320
What should I do?

630
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,280
I lost it.

631
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,040
Lost?

632
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,640
We won't wash it tomorrow anyway.

633
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,600
We're so bad.

634
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,040
Don't let others speak ill of you because of this.

635
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,880
Seriously.

636
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,600
We...

637
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,160
This is ours.

638
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,680
When the word comes out,

639
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,480
in the process of cooperation,

640
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,720
there should be

641
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,520
Eight points.

642
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,600
He did most of the work.

643
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,440
Actually, I've been talking beside him.

644
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,240
and quietly...

645
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,920
Actually, time passed.

646
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,320
Two points.

647
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,840
I hope he can keep up the good work.

648
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,480
I'll buy a glass.

649
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,840
Do you want it?

650
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,000
Do you want it?

651
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,920
You mean a big glass?

652
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,360
Yes.

653
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,280
Sure.

654
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,120
Let's buy it.

655
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,320
Different colors, right?

656
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,880
Okay.

657
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,120
I heard "Ding Dong".

658
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,920
There's a doorbell.

659
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,080
Take a look.

660
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,240
Are you sure you don't want to choose a color?

661
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,280
Look.

662
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,640
So natural.

663
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,240
Yes.

664
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,160
See? He's not avoiding at all.

665
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,600
Yes.

666
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,440
Boys don't think

667
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,280
what's wrong with my hair?

668
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,160
Yes.

669
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,360
This should be sister

670
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,000
Because this is

671
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,240
very close and ambiguous.

672
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
Both are fine.

673
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,640
You or me?

674
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,400
Me.

675
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,560
What about me?

676
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,320
Don't you pick one for me?

677
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,440
Green one.

678
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,960
It looks nice.

679
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,400
Life.

680
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,440
Let's go down.

681
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,680
They are so close.

682
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,760
Sister.

683
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,840
It should be sister.

684
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,840
Let's go.

685
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,360
Is he here?

686
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,280
Yes.

687
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,880
Come down.

688
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,920
Another mission?

689
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,680
Fall in.

690
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,360
Is this the center?

691
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,160
You take the center.

692
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,680
To the members of the small house.

693
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,120
Today is the second day

694
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,760
the second day.

695
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,880
(In order to make everyone understand each other better,)

696
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,600
I'll reveal your life album later.

697
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,640
Please go to the living room and wait for the announcement.

698
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,600
(A photo album of life.)

699
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,520
Text.

700
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,080
The soup is on the bookshelf.

701
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,920
on the bookshelf

702
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,240
and share it with everyone.

703
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,520
Soup.

704
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,480
But maybe some information

705
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,280
will reveal.

706
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,960
Why did you

707
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,440
Why are you peeking?

708
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,240
Please.

709
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
He must be super cute when he was young.

710
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,800
Big eyes.

711
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
These eyes.

712
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,560
So cute.

713
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,520
These eyes.

714
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,680
So cute.

715
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
Kind of cute.

716
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Very cute.

717
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,160
You look fat.

718
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,560
"Crown Prince".

719
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
This should be me who grew up for years.

720
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,440
and became a little prince.

721
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,880
At this time, I may not know

722
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,560
I would fall in love with something

723
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,320
that you will love with your whole life.

724
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,080
I'm

725
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,000
(who participated in)

726
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,880
(in the United States.)

727
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,240
Table Tennis.

728
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,240
Table Tennis.

729
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,840
You play ping pong.

730
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,880
I won the second place in the youth group.

731
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,080
And this one.

732
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:51,920
Cool.

733
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,840
So cool.

734
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,800
This is the first time I represent the American team

735
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,680
on behalf of the American team.

736
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,240
Although I didn't win,

737
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,440
I'm still very happy.

738
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,600
This photo

739
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,080
is the National Championships I participated in.

740
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,160
My teammates and I

741
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,200
won the second place of the team.

742
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,760
In this competition,

743
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,520
in this competition,

744
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,320
I won.

745
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,600
The top American man.

746
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,680
Awesome.

747
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,280
Amazing.

748
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,640
So amazing.

749
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,720
This is the photo

750
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,440
I entered Tsinghua University.

751
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,720
Tsinghua.

752
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
He said I'm not good-for-nothing.

753
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,400
So look.

754
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,840
There's a reason why mom is strict.

755
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,720
Lucky.

756
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,920
Tsinghua University approved

757
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,600
My talent in sports

758
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,560
gave me the qualification.

759
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,320
And I'm very happy.

760
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,920
Great.

761
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,280
This photo is

762
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,760
hosted by Tsinghua University.

763
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,680
Global High School Z Generation

764
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,600
of the Global High School.

765
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,640
I'm happy to be recognized by the school.

766
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,360
This is my favorite teacher

767
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,160
my favorite teacher.

768
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,760
Mr. Liu Guozheng.

769
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,840
I think I'm very lucky

770
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,920
to receive his guidance.

771
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,720
This is Gook-jung's dad.

772
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,800
brought me

773
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,440
Beijing High School Competition for the first time.

774
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,280
I feel very happy.

775
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,480
This photo represents

776
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
on behalf of Tsinghua University.

777
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,840
I've been the champion of men's singles

778
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,200
for two years.

779
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,520
And then

780
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,320
This is the champion I won in three consecutive years.

781
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,120
Mr. Gukjung.

782
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,400
He gave me an award.

783
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,320
I think it’s a meaningful moment.

784
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,000
So you’re 1.9 meters.

785
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,280
I’m indeed 1.9 meters.

786
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,760
It’s real.

787
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,080
When the soup starts, it will be the king.

788
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
He's handsome

789
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,200
And he's well-educated.

790
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,560
and experienced.

791
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,880
Every photo is classic.

792
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,760
Every photo is highlight.

793
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,240
Everyone has been

794
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,720
really excellent.

795
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,840
I was shocked.

796
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,440
There are no photos at the back.

797
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,720
There's a letter.

798
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,760
A letter of introduction.

799
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,800
I'm looking forward to it.

800
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,560
I'm really nervous.

801
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,400
Me too.

802
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,800
To soup.

803
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,400
He's handsome and smart.

804
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,040
and good at sports.

805
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,680
These are all the comments you gave him.

806
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,760
He has been working hard

807
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,000
to show others his good and excellent skills.

808
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,040
He is strong.

809
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,360
I hope everyone recognizes him.

810
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,800
Wait.

811
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,800
It's okay.

812
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,440
A little sad.

813
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,160
He's strong.

814
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,040
I hope everyone recognizes him.

815
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,760
It's not a bad thing.

816
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Anyway, it's his personality.

817
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,120
He has excellent grades

818
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,600
in learning and sports.

819
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,520
But these labels

820
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,400
doesn't form a complete him.

821
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,600
I don't want this letter

822
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,720
become something that makes him cry.

823
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,280
Someone in the world knows you.

824
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,040
how happy it is.

825
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,080
It's rare for his family to say that.

826
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,000
Maybe.

827
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,240
But between me and him

828
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,120
between me and him,

829
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,000
Lettering is a good choice.

830
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,520
Let's be honest.

831
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,240
Indeed, he is excellent.

832
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,200
But these results made him contribute a lot.

833
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,320
When he was in primary school, he started learning piano.

834
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,080
He started practicing sports not long after.

835
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,840
After school, other kids went home.

836
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,960
But he came back at night.

837
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,160
This kind of life

838
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,000
until high school graduation.

839
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,880
for more than ten years.

840
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,640
his willpower

841
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,000
is the strongest I know.

842
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,640
He's tired from training.

843
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,360
He played countless games

844
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,280
for several hours every day.

845
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,160
Maybe the piano was his vent.

846
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,480
Every time I see him playing the piano quietly for a long time,

847
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,400
I would think that.

848
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,960
Then he got into a very good university.

849
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,880
He was also good at studying.

850
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,080
and continued physical training.

851
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,280
and made great achievements for the school.

852
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,160
If anyone

853
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,240
I don't think

854
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,880
Sports Piano Learning

855
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,360
These three are excellent.

856
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,120
He cares about what others think.

857
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,520
he might be sensitive inside.

858
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,680
It's stressful.

859
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,400
I've seen his small breakdown.

860
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,040
Why is it small?

861
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,360
Because he always digests it himself.

862
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,240
He doesn't want to be negative.

863
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,520
So many times,

864
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,400
I didn't even notice his emotions.

865
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,400
But we met every day.

866
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,440
in our life,

867
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,680
Talk to me more.

868
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
You don't have to be so strong in front of me.

869
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,240
In my heart,

870
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,160
I hope other than those handsome

871
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,640
and excellent labels,

872
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,000
can be more carefree

873
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,400
Be yourself.

874
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,600
I can't stop my eyes now.

875
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,440
I want to look at my brothers.

876
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,160
Yes.

877
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,320
The romance show hasn't started yet.

878
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,240
Because brotherhood is so touching.

879
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,600
I thought

880
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,280
he might be moved.

881
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,200
or touched.

882
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,080
Because we don't usually

883
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,120
say these things.

884
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,040
But I didn't expect

885
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,160
he would cry at the beginning.

886
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,440
I remember it was all about

887
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,920
Although you have your own shining point,

888
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,560
but please relax.

889
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,160
Don't worry too much.

890
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,640
fear others' comments.

891
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,160
Maybe mom and dad

892
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,960
give you some pressure.

893
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,680
They may think pressure is motivation.

894
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,640
I do care too much about what others say.

895
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,960
I think the letter Xiaoling gave me

896
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
in the letter Xiaoling gave me.

897
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,000
I used to think she took care of me

898
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,200
just because she wanted to be good to me.

899
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,680
But now I think

900
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,680
she wants me to be less stressed.

901
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,400
You know him well.

902
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,040
Susu.

903
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,880
This is me.

904
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,640
So cute.

905
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,320
Why are you so thin now?

906
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,320
I'm on a diet.

907
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,360
When I just learned to sit,

908
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,800
I won't leave yet.

909
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,400
You can tell it's me at a glance, right?

910
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,640
A round head.

911
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,280
So cute.

912
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,440
Cute. Okay.

913
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,400
This should be when I was three or four years old.

914
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,200
I learned some dance.

915
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,000
and my favorite fluffy toy.

916
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,680
Since childhood

917
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,120
since childhood.

918
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,120
And this is me.

919
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,600
Three or four years old.

920
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,960
My mom took me downstairs

921
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,840
to take a walk.

922
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,880
I was good at posing when I was young.

923
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,920
I knew it would make your face look smaller.

924
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,800
I was skiing.

925
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,400
So pretty.

926
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,880
That's why

927
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,199
I never skied again.

928
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:23,960
It's because

929
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,880
fractured.

930
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Because yeah

931
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,120
I fell into the net.

932
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,760
But no one saw me.

933
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,600
for half an hour.

934
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,440
So I haven't

935
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,120
in my life.

936
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,320
Smile up secretly

937
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,600
This is my wig and scarf

938
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,600
at home.

939
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,840
I've always loved my beauty since I was a kid.

940
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,920
This is the first sports meeting

941
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,159
after I went abroad.

942
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,400
About 14 years old.

943
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
14, 14, 5.

944
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,400
This is my 18-year-old birthday.

945
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,160
my dad held a adult ceremony for me.

946
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,480
When I was in school,

947
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,800
a famous landmark over there.

948
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,000
It's full of cherry blossoms.

949
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,440
So beautiful.

950
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,000
So pretty.

951
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,360
This is my graduation ceremony.

952
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,200
It was pretty that day.

953
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,120
You're still pretty now.

954
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,760
Okay. That's all.

955
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,000
Okay.

956
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,280
I'm going to read my brother's introduction letter.

957
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,640
Listen.

958
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,280
Harry, tactical retreat.

959
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
I can't imagine

960
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,320
My brothers have

961
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,760
in my heart.

962
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,040
After all, blood is thicker than water.

963
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,200
But if I have to describe my feelings for her,

964
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,120
I can only say she's a little "big-minded".

965
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,560
She always forgets things.

966
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,680
I don't have a good memory.

967
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,920
Don't cry.

968
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,720
It'll swell tomorrow

969
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,120
You look silly.

970
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,880
But in a good way,

971
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,680
her optimism and cheerful

972
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,160
and broad-minded.

973
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,560
always brings joy

974
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,400
the people around you.

975
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,320
I'm sorry.

976
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,240
I made a bad start.

977
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,480
Really

978
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,400
Really.

979
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,760
Although someone said she's magnanimous,

980
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,480
in my eyes,

981
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,480
She just

982
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,440
and her family.

983
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,560
It's okay.

984
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,000
So awkward.

985
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,880
She lives

986
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
every day.

987
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,520
and happy.

988
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,640
and happy.

989
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,680
She seems carefree.

990
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,720
This is what she's suitable for.

991
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,920
So when I shoulder

992
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,480
the burden of my family,

993
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,680
I will do my best

994
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,480
to keep her happy and happy.

995
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,560
Harry is so nice.

996
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,480
I can't help crying.

997
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,560
I want to cry again.

998
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,200
Because my brothers and I

999
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,280
never express our feelings.

1000
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,920
or say something cheesy to each other.

1001
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,440
My sister and I

1002
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,000
so frankly.

1003
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,560
This time, I'll express my emotions

1004
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,040
in a letter.

1005
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,000
and write her true feelings.

1006
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,960
Let her understand.

1007
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,120
Harry is great.

1008
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,120
Really great.

1009
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,760
I think

1010
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,880
I think from her album to the end,

1011
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,600
I think she is

1012
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,040
a very cute little princess.

1013
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,080
She is also very considerate.

1014
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,880
I think she is

1015
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,600
who is irrigued by love.

1016
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,440
should be the love given by her parents.

1017
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,240
are full of love.

1018
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,840
Because my brother wants to hug her.

1019
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
I can't tell her either.

1020
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,080
Yes.

1021
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,480
I feel so happy to have siblings.

1022
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,520
Actually I didn't see you crying

1023
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,680
I cried a little.

1024
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,560
Yes, I saw Harry.

1025
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,600
I saw her brother.

1026
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,560
Yes.

1027
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,320
I think Harry

1028
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,560
is quite different.

1029
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,040
He looks like

1030
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
So delicate.

1031
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,160
He's just joking.

1032
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,400
But in his heart,

1033
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,600
in his heart.

1034
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,120
Yes.

1035
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,600
We're brothers.

1036
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,240
Anyway,

1037
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,200
fight or fight.

1038
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,440
When you really need them,

1039
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,440
they are the one who really cares about you.

1040
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,640
They want to protect you.

1041
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,960
I'm so touched.

1042
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,800
Yes.

1043
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,960
Yes. And these words

1044
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,360
that they don't usually say.

1045
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:51,840
Yes.

1046
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,520
I think when they are on this show,

1047
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
they will become closer.

1048
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,920
So I think our show is very warm.

1049
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,120
Let love double.

1050
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,440
Yes.

1051
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,200
Really.

1052
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,920
Susu.

1053
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,080
May I ask

1054
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,320
what do you do now?

1055
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,200
I'm a business major now.

1056
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,920
I'm in charge of

1057
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,640
the copyright of the media company.

1058
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,480
Okay.

1059
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,720
Got it. Got it.

1060
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,480
Come on, Fatty.

1061
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,840
Come on.

1062
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,600
Smile.

1063
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,000
Why does he smile?

1064
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,480
Take a look.

1065
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,120
Why am I called Fatty because

1066
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,880
So cute.

1067
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,800
So cute.

1068
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,960
White and fat.

1069
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,400
So cute.

1070
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,360
Meat pout

1071
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,920
Yes

1072
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,800
Because I was fat when I was born.

1073
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,720
So Fatty is my nickname.

1074
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,960
My eyes are getting red.

1075
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,200
Maybe when I was young,

1076
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,720
I might be a bit like soup.

1077
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,640
I know cars.

1078
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,640
sports player.

1079
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,240
This is the first car

1080
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,960
when I was young.

1081
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,280
Yes, because I was naughty when I was a kid.

1082
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,360
I liked

1083
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,280
amusement park.

1084
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,880
And this was when I was in sixth grade.

1085
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,200
What are you doing?

1086
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,920
Playing with cars.

1087
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,160
You really like cars.

1088
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,080
Yes, I really like cars.

1089
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,600
When I was in college,

1090
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,720
In school,

1091
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,920
my classmate celebrated my birthday.

1092
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,040
I like sports.

1093
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,280
and play basketball.

1094
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,200
Very cool.

1095
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,320
Another photo of exercise.

1096
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,760
Ride

1097
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,440
Ride.

1098
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,360
Yeah, maybe I didn't lose weight.

1099
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,520
But I still love sports.

1100
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,800
By the way,

1101
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,480
my occupation.

1102
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,240
I'm a car manager.

1103
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,280
No wonder.

1104
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,480
So handsome.

1105
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,960
Yes.

1106
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,280
I run three garage.

1107
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,080
Awesome, Fatty.

1108
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,400
I started my own business.

1109
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,120
And my hobby became my job.

1110
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,400
I admire Fatty.

1111
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Because many of my classmates and friends

1112
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,520
want to start their own business.

1113
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,720
But 99.9 percent

1114
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,960
is a failure.

1115
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,360
If he can succeed,

1116
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,520
and run three companies,

1117
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,240
or a workshop,

1118
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,720
I think

1119
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,080
a great thing.

1120
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,480
I think Xiaoling and Fatty are good.

1121
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,080
Really?

1122
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,120
It's okay.

1123
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,360
Not much. I think I can handle it.

1124
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,960
I can't.

1125
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,960
I can't hold it anymore.

1126
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
No, really.

1127
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,280
So cute.

1128
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,000
Not a word.

1129
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,680
I should be able to hold it.

1130
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,960
When I wrote this letter,

1131
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,120
I can only think of three words.

1132
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,080
Stop eating.

1133
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,040
I remember you've been cheerful and playful since you were a kid.

1134
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,920
You're the child king of the kids around you.

1135
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,480
Guoli.

1136
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,160
No, I think Hua

1137
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,760
always teases me.

1138
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,400
I have to cry every time.

1139
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,320
It's so hard.

1140
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,560
Who is it?

1141
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,800
Hua.

1142
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,120
It's really hard for me to read.

1143
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,680
I wanted to be the only little princess in my family.

1144
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,840
But dad told me

1145
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,400
we'll grow up together.

1146
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,560
Wait for me to grow up.

1147
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,320
Why did you write something so sentimental?

1148
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,560
I'm too affectionate.

1149
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,000
Let's hold hands

1150
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and walk together.

1151
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,440
Then you became mature and reliable.

1152
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,360
We still bicker

1153
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,160
Just look at me

1154
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,560
you'll know what he's thinking.

1155
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,000
People always joke about

1156
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,640
you are the male version of me.

1157
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,880
I'm the female version of you.

1158
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,040
You have

1159
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,520
in work.

1160
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,280
You always look happy

1161
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,360
and happy in life.

1162
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,880
You can always see

1163
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,320
my lack of confidence and anxiety.

1164
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,160
gives me a sense of security.

1165
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,280
I know something.

1166
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,720
You have many weaknesses and grievances.

1167
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,600
But you've been hiding them in your heart

1168
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,640
I never say

1169
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,040
I'm afraid I'll think too much because of this.

1170
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,120
because of that.

1171
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,640
You've always been

1172
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,800
who loves me the most.

1173
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,640
So your big hand

1174
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,000
has been holding my hand.

1175
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,040
Let me tell you secretly

1176
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,920
You're the most handsome guy among the comedians.

1177
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,600
Let's do this together.

1178
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,320
and enjoy this rare journey.

1179
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,240
I didn't expect to cry so much.

1180
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,600
The reason I cried

1181
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,800
because my brothers and I

1182
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,720
don't say these things.

1183
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
I won't say it either.

1184
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,720
Fatty.

1185
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,400
I think he's a tender man.

1186
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,000
He said he wouldn't cry.

1187
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,200
But when he sat there,

1188
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,600
I felt like he was about to cry.

1189
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,600
I think so too.

1190
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,240
he doesn't usually say something sentimental.

1191
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,920
He’s actually a very fragile

1192
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,000
very fragile.

1193
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,720
When I opened the letter,

1194
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,960
when I opened the letter.

1195
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,680
I saw something in my mind.

1196
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,320
What she meant

1197
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,000
not only me,

1198
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,280
More importantly,

1199
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,360
I thought a lot.

1200
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,120
I think it's our next life.

1201
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,880
Let's hold hands.

1202
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,080
When I think of these things,

1203
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,200
I really want to cry.

1204
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,360
Have any of you written letters to your brothers?

1205
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,960
We used to write letters to my sister.

1206
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,280
My dad and I wrote letters too.

1207
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,000
or write letters?

1208
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,760
to express the feeling.

1209
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,200
But I was touched just now

1210
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,920
I felt like I saw my son and daughter.

1211
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,480
I think

1212
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,720
when they grow up,

1213
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,840
when they grow up,

1214
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,680
and dependence.

1215
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,760
So happy.

1216
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,520
Imagine the good relationship

1217
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
in the future.

1218
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,680
Because I told them

1219
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,360
I said, brother.

1220
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:26,960
remember,

1221
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,600
I'm taking care of you now.

1222
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,200
But one day,

1223
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,720
you are taller than your sister,

1224
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,880
you have to protect your sister.

1225
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,120
I told her

1226
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,640
I said you must become

1227
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,400
who understands his younger brother.

1228
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:35,800
Yes.

1229
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,560
Your brother is the best brother in the world.

1230
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,800
Just like him.

1231
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,720
Their parents said

1232
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,360
they must hold hands with big hands.

1233
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,280
So I'm so touched.

1234
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,480
I saw my children.

1235
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,560
I can show them

1236
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,320
I can show them this show.

1237
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,080
right?

1238
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,240
It will influence them too.

1239
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,720
Look, it's great to have siblings.

1240
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,320
Look how powerful the words are.

1241
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,400
Great.

1242
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,560
Xiao Ling.

1243
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:57,880
Go.

1244
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,160
Here.

1245
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,160
This is mine.

1246
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,080
So pretty.

1247
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,160
A hundred-day photo.

1248
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,240
So cute.

1249
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,280
Really.

1250
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,680
A doll

1251
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,160
Is that all you have when you were born?

1252
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,160
Yes.

1253
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,560
So beautiful.

1254
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,000
This is the first time

1255
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,760
went to the park to catch goldfish.

1256
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,840
Guoli.

1257
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,680
It really looks like a doll.

1258
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,520
And

1259
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,360
This is my graduation photo from kindergarten.

1260
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,960
So pretty.

1261
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,320
And this is...

1262
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,200
I like animals.

1263
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,320
That's why I'm riding a horse.

1264
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,520
The soup helped his sister remove her clothes.

1265
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,160
This should be in grade 3 or 4.

1266
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,080
That's when I was that tall.

1267
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,080
So sweet.

1268
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,120
I grew up tall.

1269
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,400
This is my first time fishing in the lake.

1270
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,640
I caught a bask.

1271
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,280
This is a photo of me and a lizard.

1272
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,840
So I like animals very much.

1273
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,320
When I was performing,

1274
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,040
when I was performing.

1275
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,480
Xiaoling's mom.

1276
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,920
I read it out.

1277
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,920
Because my classmates

1278
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,840
they all think

1279
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,120
I may take more care of others.

1280
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:19,440
Like this.

1281
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,560
And this is

1282
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,120
when I graduated.

1283
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,120
So beautiful.

1284
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,880
This is the video

1285
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,480
in class.

1286
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,960
a makeup photo.

1287
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,120
So pretty.

1288
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,960
The last one is my graduation photo.

1289
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,520
I'm still in Beijing Film Academy.

1290
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,640
I have my master's degree.

1291
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,520
I'm still studying for postgraduate studies.

1292
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,080
How can everyone be so excellent?

1293
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,360
Yes, they are all excellent.

1294
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,440
Here's the letter.

1295
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,120
Let me see if it's enough.

1296
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,680
A little.

1297
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,280
I won't cry.

1298
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,480
Nice to meet you.

1299
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,400
Today, let me introduce

1300
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,280
the best siblings in the world.

1301
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,360
Since I remember,

1302
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,560
Xiaoling and I often

1303
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,440
because of delicious food and remote control.

1304
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,480
No one goes easy on each other.

1305
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,480
We've been following the principle of fair competition.

1306
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,240
(We grew up with quarrels.)

1307
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,120
After entering puberty,

1308
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,760
I gradually have my own pursuit.

1309
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,920
I paid more attention

1310
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,280
on my own.

1311
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,520
She's carefree.

1312
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,640
Xiao Ling became more quiet.

1313
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,360
She always takes care of everyone's emotions.

1314
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,200
Because I'm too tired,

1315
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,480
because I'm too tired

1316
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,400
in secret.

1317
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,560
Xiao Ling never shows herself.

1318
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,520
Although she's pretty,

1319
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,280
and kind.

1320
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,400
She's good at drawing.

1321
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,760
She's tender and this one

1322
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,760
She's gentle and delicate.

1323
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,040
a society full of selfishness.

1324
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,920
You're out of line.

1325
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,240
I like a saying.

1326
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,920
We love ourselves more than love others.

1327
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,520
but we care about others' opinions

1328
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,000
than what they think.

1329
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,480
Everyone is good at showing

1330
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,840
to everyone.

1331
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,040
But Xiao Ling is an exception.

1332
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,720
She's self-conceited.

1333
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,840
I don't think it's necessary to show

1334
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,920
Accept the good or bad you are now.

1335
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,120
and improve it little by little.

1336
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,160
my own life.

1337
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,200
I envy her.

1338
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,040
She laughs again.

1339
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,760
I can't watch the last part.

1340
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,840
I won't let go

1341
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,160
I won't let her go easily.

1342
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,280
If you want to pursue her,

1343
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,520
you must pass me first.

1344
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,880
The younger brother is strong.

1345
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,960
Who wrote it?

1346
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,400
Great.

1347
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,240
You're so arrogant.

1348
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,880
I didn't expect my siblings to be so delicate.

1349
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,200
Who is it I'm curious

1350
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,880
I'm curious.

1351
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,640
You're curious too, right?

1352
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,200
I don't get it.

1353
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:06,880
Seriously.

1354
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,080
It's hard to guess.

1355
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,360
In the whole letter,

1356
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,160
many things

1357
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,000
I think it's all about my heart.

1358
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,680
But the most touching thing is

1359
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,320
he said my existence

1360
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,720
in this world

1361
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,960
in this world of self-esteem,

1362
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,120
in the world of self-esteem.

1363
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,280
That makes me feel

1364
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,880
he really saw through me.

1365
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,280
My sister doesn't like being criticized.

1366
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,680
Everyone is showing a better self.

1367
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,360
and their true self.

1368
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,360
But what I want to tell her

1369
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,160
that you may be better than me.

1370
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,120
I hope you can

1371
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,360
show yourself confidently.

1372
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,280
They know each other so well.

1373
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,360
Map.

1374
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,360
Drawing.

1375
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,080
The first one.

1376
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,720
This is my 100-year-old photo.

1377
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,560
A hundred-year-old photo.

1378
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,480
So cute.

1379
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,680
It's totally different now.

1380
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,640
My ears were pressed.

1381
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,080
In fact, my ears could tell

1382
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,640
It's big, right?

1383
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,280
It's like this.

1384
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,320
Look back later.

1385
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,000
You can see this.

1386
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,040
This is a picture of me when I was ten months old.

1387
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,480
So fat.

1388
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,320
Yeah I was chubby when I was a kid

1389
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,960
Like a fairy

1390
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,040
My ears were this big.

1391
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,360
When I was young

1392
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,720
I learned drums in elementary school.

1393
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,720
So cute.

1394
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,960
The next one is

1395
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,400
was a certificate I got

1396
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,920
in a model competition.

1397
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,760
In 2014,

1398
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,040
in 2014

1399
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,920
is to help Lin Zhi Ying dance.

1400
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,520
Who?

1401
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,520
Lin Zhi Ying.

1402
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:43,920
Yes.

1403
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,080
They are definitely not brothers.

1404
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,960
Definitely not.

1405
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,240
Because this question is instinctive.

1406
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,240
It's such a big thing

1407
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,400
It's impossible that you didn't know.

1408
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,200
I was very happy and excited.

1409
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,040
After everyone left,

1410
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,560
I left a video there.

1411
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,280
And this photo is my transformation.

1412
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,800
This is the photo

1413
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,520
in high school.

1414
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,680
Sunshine.

1415
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,080
In my opinion,

1416
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,400
is the most handsome cut.

1417
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,000
Now the hairline is getting higher

1418
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,840
So we can't keep a inch

1419
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,960
And this.

1420
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,800
I couldn't find it.

1421
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,760
a photo with the school.

1422
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,200
At home,

1423
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,560
at home.

1424
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,280
It's Zhejiang Media.

1425
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,160
Zhejiang?

1426
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,760
Really?

1427
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,280
My junior.

1428
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,320
The last one is in the school.

1429
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,080
Host?

1430
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,320
Yes at school

1431
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,240
at school.

1432
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,280
I was very happy.

1433
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,360
I picked up

1434
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,160
on the ground.

1435
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:37,840
When you sprinkle it like this,

1436
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,720
this beautiful photo.

1437
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,480
This is my current situation.

1438
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,080
I'm a student.

1439
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,960
It's so long.

1440
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,880
(Dear Drawing, Exhibition)

1441
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,200
About this letter of introduction,

1442
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,760
I thought about it for a long time.

1443
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,880
I received your letters many times.

1444
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,280
And this is the first time I wrote to you.

1445
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,840
I have a lot to say,

1446
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,800
but I couldn't say it.

1447
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,040
Somewhere

1448
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,680
Let's talk about you first.

1449
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,480
I remember

1450
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,120
When you grow up,

1451
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,800
they would chase me and make a wish.

1452
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,360
As if as long as I'm by your side,

1453
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,960
I can grant all your wishes.

1454
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:23,960
At home,

1455
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,200
you are the babies of the elders.

1456
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,760
But when you're with me,

1457
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,840
you'll become very carefree.

1458
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,800
and listen to me in everything.

1459
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,760
Give way to me.

1460
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,600
In front of you,

1461
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,360
I can be the real me.

1462
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,200
I can be lazy,

1463
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,240
You can be angry,

1464
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,280
or do something wrong.

1465
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,360
You can say whatever you want.

1466
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,720
Many people say that they give me the sense of security.

1467
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,920
But you must have given me the sense of security.

1468
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,640
What impressed me was one Spring Festival.

1469
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,480
I was scolded by my elders.

1470
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,040
I was in my third year.

1471
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,360
You pulled me behind.

1472
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,160
and yelled at her elders.

1473
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,280
Don't scold her.

1474
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,680
I know you always

1475
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,520
want me to feel loved.

1476
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,320
You don't want me to envy others.

1477
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,840
You are also

1478
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,960
to be loved.

1479
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,520
but you gave me all your love.

1480
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,800
You always show

1481
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,600
that don't fit your age.

1482
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,600
When you're here,

1483
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,160
I'm a capable and independent person.

1484
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,280
always like to be a shopkeeper.

1485
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,120
Because I know

1486
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,880
you would arrange everything well.

1487
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,640
You can always take everything down.

1488
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,480
and reassure me.

1489
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
When I ride a motorcycle,

1490
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,560
I might fall.

1491
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,320
and use your hands to hold me.

1492
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,640
is the corner

1493
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,040
in a certain way.

1494
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,800
I don't care what happens.

1495
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,280
Because you'll always be there and love me.

1496
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,320
All this time,

1497
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,480
you seem to be a born Letian.

1498
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,680
You seldom have worries.

1499
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,360
I've never seen you cry.

1500
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,720
I feel happy and proud

1501
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,440
for your personality.

1502
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,400
I hope you can be

1503
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,960
happy and happy forever.

1504
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,880
But the path of growing up

1505
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,760
is not always smooth.

1506
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,720
If you want to stop when you're sad,

1507
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,000
take a break.

1508
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,440
You don't have to be so sensible.

1509
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,560
Because when you need me,

1510
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,200
when you need me.

1511
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,040
I'm grateful to you

1512
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,080
in my life.

1513
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,640
I've always wanted to say thank you.

1514
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,200
Thank you.

1515
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,640
Thank you for always being here.

1516
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,800
This is not bad.

1517
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,160
This is the first letter she wrote to me.

1518
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,720
When I read the letter she wrote to me,

1519
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,120
I never thought about crying.

1520
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,920
I cried while reading.

1521
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,320
I don't think I ever cried in front of her.

1522
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,880
I can't cry for a while.

1523
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,600
Let me tell you.

1524
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,800
It rained just now.

1525
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,240
That's different.

1526
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,280
It's raining.

1527
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,960
Have some.

1528
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,520
No hurry.

1529
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,080
The more I drink, the more I want to cry.

1530
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,240
He's nervous.

1531
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,360
His hands are shaking.

1532
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,880
His hands are like this.

1533
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,400
Can you stop talking?

1534
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,720
Don't talk.

1535
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,880
It's cute, Harry.

1536
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,840
Sit here.

1537
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,680
Come on.

1538
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,440
If my roommate hadn't said

1539
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,120
I wouldn't sit here.

1540
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,800
I'll give you energy.

1541
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,680
Here.

1542
00:55:59,120 --> 00:55:59,720
This one.

1543
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,520
So cute.

1544
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,160
They're all funny anyway.

1545
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,040
I didn't pick the most handsome one.

1546
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,000
I don't remember when

1547
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,040
It must be in the shower

1548
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,440
Soup is also in the shower

1549
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,400
How about we roommates?

1550
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,880
What about your roommates?

1551
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,320
To be honest,

1552
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,280
This one

1553
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,320
is my brother.

1554
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,760
I just dropped it.

1555
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,280
She looked like this.

1556
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,720
I think I dislike her.

1557
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,640
You know?

1558
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,080
It's kind of pretentious.

1559
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,360
I used to pretend when I was young.

1560
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,760
What's wrong?

1561
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,560
What?

1562
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:43,760
What is this?

1563
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,360
Too ugly.

1564
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,800
He looks like my son.

1565
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,840
So cute.

1566
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,760
A bit charming.

1567
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,720
Very charming.

1568
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,640
Halloween

1569
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,880
with a small butt.

1570
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,520
I thought I was handsome.

1571
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,120
I put on makeup.

1572
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,320
They are also my brothers.

1573
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,400
I can see that

1574
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,960
his photos are all with his brothers.

1575
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,360
Yes, I can see that

1576
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,760
I don't like taking photos.

1577
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,000
but my brothers love taking photos.

1578
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,840
So most of my photos

1579
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,400
with her.

1580
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,720
Green Leaf.

1581
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,920
It's a photo! It's a photo!

1582
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,080
Harry's photo.

1583
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,400
It means he doesn't like taking photos.

1584
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,000
We took photos for him.

1585
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,600
They must be very close.

1586
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,600
Very close.

1587
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,720
It's also a drum.

1588
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,520
I learned it.

1589
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,840
It was a little dark.

1590
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,600
Why is it dark?

1591
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,680
Let me explain.

1592
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,120
I trained track and field every day.

1593
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,000
I won a prize in elementary school and junior high.

1594
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,240
It was my school.

1595
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,640
in my school.

1596
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,880
He can win the first place of nine.

1597
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,320
So it's very dark.

1598
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,120
Awesome.

1599
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,560
I hope in my next life

1600
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,080
in my next life.

1601
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,600
I don't need to be so dark.

1602
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,920
Interior sports.

1603
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,200
Then I got the trophy.

1604
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,200
A medal?

1605
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,120
This is a medal.

1606
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,560
And this shield.

1607
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,320
Amazing.

1608
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,800
Awesome.

1609
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:00,960
All champions.

1610
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,720
Yes.

1611
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,360
Wait.

1612
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:04,720
Middle school.

1613
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,000
It's ugly.

1614
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,600
I'm still trying to hide my innocence.

1615
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,680
This photo

1616
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,680
when I first learned how to pretend.

1617
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,000
Is this a headache?

1618
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,840
Yes, a headache.

1619
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,840
My head hurts.

1620
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,200
My head hurts.

1621
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,640
When we meet Harry next time,

1622
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,760
we'll do one, two, three.

1623
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,400
Then I shave my hair.

1624
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,240
This looks good.

1625
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,680
Kitten.

1626
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,720
This is my kitten in England.

1627
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,600
called Eleven.

1628
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,120
And then,

1629
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,280
my brother was next to me.

1630
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,400
to celebrate my birthday with me.

1631
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,960
And this is

1632
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,400
to shoot.

1633
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,760
Angel lamp.

1634
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,040
I went to England for eight years.

1635
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,720
It's my first time taking a picture with an angel lamp.

1636
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,760
I'm a little embarrassed.

1637
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,480
Wait.

1638
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,440
Don't rain.

1639
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,880
I'll take an umbrella.

1640
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,360
I can't cry.

1641
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,160
Wait. I want to laugh.

1642
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,720
Draw yourself.

1643
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,680
I won't cry.

1644
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,360
My brother

1645
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,720
is a big boy with a strong personality.

1646
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,280
He has a personality

1647
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,840
and has his own opinion.

1648
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,040
He looks cool.

1649
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,240
He looks like a player.

1650
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,560
But in fact,

1651
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,480
who hides

1652
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,960
in his heart.

1653
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,720
He has been smarter than me since he was a kid.

1654
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,280
Very right.

1655
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,120
I think my brother

1656
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,800
very clearly.

1657
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,960
He keeps provoking me.

1658
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,240
Trying to provoke me?

1659
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,200
No matter what I say,

1660
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:42,520
or what I do,

1661
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,640
he's going against me.

1662
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,760
In my memory,

1663
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,600
he's always good at being naughty.

1664
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,080
Every day after school,

1665
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,360
He always comes home with scars.

1666
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,080
My mom will be called to school

1667
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,040
he'll be called to school to meet his teacher.

1668
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,800
Look at his eyes.

1669
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,640
I can't hide it anymore.

1670
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,360
It's exposed.

1671
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,400
At that time, I thought

1672
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,760
what to do when he grew up.

1673
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,000
Unexpectedly,

1674
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,800
as he grew up,

1675
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,600
many advantages appeared.

1676
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,720
He loved sports when he was young.

1677
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,600
He also participated in various sports competitions.

1678
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,080
In many sports competitions in school

1679
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:12,840
in many sports competitions.

1680
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,240
Although I don't know how to praise,

1681
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,720
but I'm still very proud.

1682
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,880
And the expression of a wave.

1683
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,040
Wave.

1684
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,520
It's very detailed.

1685
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,200
After high school,

1686
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,040
I gradually got busy with my studies.

1687
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,480
We've also lived

1688
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,440
to go to cram school every day.

1689
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,480
I didn't expect that

1690
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,720
he actually loves

1691
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,960
a science that I've never learned.

1692
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:35,680
Philosophy?

1693
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,520
Maybe it's because

1694
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,520
his science was better.

1695
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,240
So when I quarreled with him,

1696
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,920
I couldn't beat him.

1697
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,320
Although we were just playing around,

1698
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,520
but most of the time,

1699
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,240
he always did something that touched me.

1700
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,320
When I was sick,

1701
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,920
when I was sick.

1702
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,280
Although I don't remember this,

1703
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,640
but I think I did.

1704
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,600
He kept talking to her.

1705
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,200
Yes.

1706
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,120
He's already shown his cards.

1707
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,200
I can't take it anymore.

1708
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,600
When no one wants to eat with me,

1709
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,160
without any complaints.

1710
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,320
At last, I hope

1711
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,320
he can shine

1712
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,040
in the field he loves.

1713
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,800
Her letter of introduction is not as emotional as others.

1714
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,680
The compliment is more than the emotional part.

1715
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,960
I'm touched.

1716
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,800
My brother and I

1717
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,240
in normal times.

1718
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,280
I've never praised him face to face.

1719
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,080
This is the first time I wrote to him.

1720
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,960
and the first time I praised him.

1721
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,040
In the letter,

1722
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,200
I wrote many good points of my brother.

1723
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,040
I want my friends in the house to know

1724
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,560
my brother is really good.

1725
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,160
Am I the first one

1726
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,360
who set a goal and didn't fall?

1727
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,160
Yes.

1728
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:39,800
I'm sorry.

1729
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,920
It rained just now.

1730
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,880
It's sunny now.

1731
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,160
It's over.

1732
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,680
I really held it back.

1733
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,600
Xinxin.

1734
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,520
Coming.

1735
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,520
I'm getting nervous.

1736
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,600
I think I'll be choking later.

1737
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,560
Prepare the soup.

1738
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,480
Yes.

1739
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,920
We'll start anytime.

1740
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,600
Tu Tu, don't cry.

1741
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,520
Tu, don't cry.

1742
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,760
Did they guess it?

1743
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,600
Yes.

1744
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,040
I think I got it.

1745
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,160
Everyone got it.

1746
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,200
This

1747
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,640
a photo of me half a year old.

1748
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,280
I learned how to ride.

1749
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:17,960
So pretty.

1750
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,800
Six years old.

1751
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,640
This is about one and a half years old.

1752
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,360
Your head is so fashionable.

1753
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,880
I've had a lot of hair since I was a kid.

1754
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,000
I'm so jealous.

1755
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,200
This is the first time I came to Beijing.

1756
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,640
You looked like a boy when you were young.

1757
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,560
I think you were two years old.

1758
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,600
About three years old.

1759
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,400
My photo

1760
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,920
in my photos.

1761
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,360
After that, my family

1762
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,960
family reasons.

1763
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,040
Then my parents separated.

1764
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,080
Then...

1765
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,440
my grandma passed away.

1766
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,920
for a long time,

1767
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,240
I went abroad alone.

1768
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,040
When I was 14,

1769
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,920
I was alone

1770
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,120
with no siblings.

1771
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,800
I went to America alone.

1772
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,040
Not many photos

1773
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,160
I didn't save them.

1774
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,400
and moved often.

1775
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,840
I didn't even

1776
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:13,640
graduation photos.

1777
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,760
I've been changing schools.

1778
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,200
I came back from America and went to Singapore.

1779
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,680
After three years,

1780
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,600
This is the first time

1781
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,400
when I was 19 or 20.

1782
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,320
So pretty.

1783
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,080
She's already 20 years old.

1784
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,360
When I was 20,

1785
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,440
I went to Japan for a trip.

1786
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,040
About a year.

1787
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,880
This is in Barcelona.

1788
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,120
I love traveling.

1789
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,280
My hobby is to travel.

1790
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,760
And last year,

1791
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,920
I went to Xinjiang.

1792
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,400
It's so beautiful.

1793
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,320
This is the Global Film.

1794
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,760
My brother took this for me.

1795
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,640
Nice shot.

1796
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,440
You're good at taking pictures.

1797
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,720
This is the investment meeting

1798
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,160
last year.

1799
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,320
I'm here as the manager of the marketing department.

1800
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,920
This is a photo of me and my dad.

1801
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,400
Okay, over.

1802
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,880
Isn't she the girl with the drawing?

1803
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,600
My siblings have been good at studying since childhood.

1804
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,080
My little head is more flexible than mine.

1805
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,360
She's the daughter of the family.

1806
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,080
Especially after being naughty

1807
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,440
I got scolded by my parents.

1808
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,440
Xinxin always comforts me.

1809
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,840
Esther has big eyes.

1810
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,360
Smile is warm and shiny.

1811
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,080
It always brings joy to our family.

1812
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,680
It's the brightest star in the house.

1813
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:49,840
Fatty.

1814
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,520
No way.

1815
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,360
But Xin is also a crybaby.

1816
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,240
When I was a kid, my mom scolded me and cried.

1817
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,240
I cried when I got bad grades.

1818
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,320
She cries even if I steal her snacks.

1819
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,600
Speak louder to her now.

1820
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,800
I cry too.

1821
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,920
It's heartbreaking.

1822
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,680
I want to tell my brothers

1823
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,240
about the future.

1824
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,160
I hope you don't worry.

1825
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,600
Don't worry.

1826
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,240
Do what you want.

1827
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,720
Fatty, why are you crying so hard?

1828
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,320
Fatty is already in the head.

1829
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,640
Give her a hug, Chubby.

1830
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,560
Although I often talk about you,

1831
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,440
no matter what you do,

1832
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,600
I will support you.

1833
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,720
Life is full of thorns and challenges.

1834
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,120
But we're not alone.

1835
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,720
No matter where we are

1836
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,600
our bond has never broken.

1837
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,440
I hope you can

1838
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,160
with a happy life.

1839
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,120
Meet the right person and love.

1840
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,520
and try it boldly.

1841
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,440
and enjoy life.

1842
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,480
I'll always be by your side to protect you.

1843
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,280
I hope you can be happy every day.

1844
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,200
Everything is the best arrangement.

1845
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,880
Why do I think she and Fatty are a good match?

1846
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,080
Fatty cares about Xinxin at least.

1847
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,800
Everything is the best arrangement.

1848
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,640
This is my personality signature too.

1849
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,720
Everything is the best arrangement.

1850
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,200
Your brother wrote it well.

1851
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,360
Yes, it's good.

1852
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,120
I was touched.

1853
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,800
I was crying when he cried.

1854
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,520
I cried my nose out.

1855
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,360
I think...

1856
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,800
But I have no choice.

1857
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,000
I couldn't stop crying.

1858
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,160
Then I cried.

1859
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,520
Because he could sense my emotions.

1860
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,120
And when I'm sensitive

1861
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,160
and fragile,

1862
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,080
he always encouraged me

1863
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,800
and told me not to be anxious.

1864
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,360
No way.

1865
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,720
Is she fat?

1866
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,240
Her siblings.

1867
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,200
Impossible.

1868
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:43,200
Show your brother.

1869
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,040
Are you too relaxed

1870
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,000
when you were relaxed?

1871
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,080
I started playing by myself.

1872
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,000
Show your brothers.

1873
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,200
Let me hug you.

1874
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,320
We used to interact

1875
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,680
as family.

1876
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,400
So Fatty should be

1877
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,160
There should be

1878
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,320
in love.

1879
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,480
We kept talking about him.

1880
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,640
He's a love insulator.

1881
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,160
Yes.

1882
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,280
I turned it down.

1883
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,160
Will the babies

1884
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,200
we won't be invited in the second season.

1885
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,640
No one is right.

1886
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,000
Our deduction ability

1887
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,160
is too bad.

1888
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:36,960
Show your brothers.

1889
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,000
I think my appearance

1890
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,160
in all aspects,

1891
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,320
in front of the screen.

1892
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,480
Not to mention a romance show.

1893
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,720
I think she's pretty.

1894
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,240
I think she can do it.

1895
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,560
But I never thought

1896
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,160
to come to this show.

1897
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,160
because of my sister.

1898
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,200
I'm He Wenxin, He Wenjie's dad.

1899
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,600
Fatty is mostly happy.

1900
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,320
and simple.

1901
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,840
and sensible.

1902
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,840
and responsible.

1903
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,760
Esther

1904
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,800
It's the same.

1905
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,520
filial

1906
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,080
and thoughtful.

1907
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,920
She studied early too.

1908
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,240
She went to school with her brother when she was five.

1909
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,160
She had good grades.

1910
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,760
So I doted on her.

1911
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,120
I've spoiled her since I was a child.

1912
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,600
When I was young,

1913
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,240
I spent 10 yuan a week.

1914
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:32,680
My sister is 100.

1915
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:35,120
The difference is ten times.

1916
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,240
It's not that exaggerated.

1917
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,000
Yes.

1918
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,279
I found out later.

1919
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,040
I was quite shocked.

1920
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,880
I thought everyone was $10.

1921
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,120
I went into my sister's room

1922
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,279
I saw it.

1923
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:47,479
full of snacks.

1924
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:49,200
That means I saved them.

1925
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:49,680
Really?

1926
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,200
Yes.

1927
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:50,920
No.

1928
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:52,680
It's really cruel.

1929
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,439
I saw her room

1930
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:54,560
full of snacks.

1931
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,800
and all kinds of snacks.

1932
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,240
Something like that.

1933
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,479
Pen. I love to buy pens and books.

1934
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:00,279
When you were young,

1935
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:01,920
you didn't spend much money.

1936
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,000
You don't like studying.

1937
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,319
KO.

1938
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,000
He's a happy man in his family.

1939
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,760
He smiles and is gentle.

1940
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,160
and brings warmth

1941
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,120
to family.

1942
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,800
In daily life,

1943
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,960
in daily life.

1944
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,600
Fatty.

1945
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,120
or Fatty, what are you doing?

1946
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,319
I seldom call him brother.

1947
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,279
Because he had a round face since he was a kid.

1948
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:28,520
He was cute when he was born.

1949
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,800
Actually, he was cuter than me when he was little.

1950
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,520
A lot cuter.

1951
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,319
Although he likes to bully me,

1952
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:34,600
he can also make everyone

1953
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,920
to everyone.

1954
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,359
They always go out

1955
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,200
It's just the two of us.

1956
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,520
There are always two people everywhere.

1957
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,200
It's good that they have a boyfriend.

1958
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,000
They have a girlfriend.

1959
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,080
Only the two of them know.

1960
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:46,720
None of us knew.

1961
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,359
When I was young,

1962
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:50,880
I liked snatching snacks from my brother.

1963
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,399
and milk.

1964
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,880
Then my brothers will get angry.

1965
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,080
I'll cry first

1966
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,120
and tell on you.

1967
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,360
Then get angry

1968
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,680
and then make up.

1969
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,080
There's a process.

1970
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,800
I could only complain when I was young.

1971
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,760
All kinds of complaints

1972
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,560
Complain to mom and dad

1973
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,840
Tell aunt and grandma

1974
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,120
the whole family.

1975
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,720
Then I was beaten.

1976
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,440
Yes.

1977
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,000
No.

1978
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,920
Keep up the good work.

1979
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,760
and find a new way to trick me.

1980
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,200
I think the way I get along with my brother

1981
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,880
is love and hate.

1982
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,920
I can tell my sister everything.

1983
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,840
and share everything.

1984
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,760
Even the two of us

1985
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,240
have no secrets.

1986
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,480
He taught me something.

1987
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,600
I taught him something.

1988
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:39,120
I'm more strict with He Wenxin.

1989
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,680
Because she's a girl.

1990
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,720
When she was in third grade,

1991
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,640
I asked my teacher for tutoring.

1992
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,800
and accompany him myself.

1993
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,240
Because I used to be a teacher.

1994
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,400
and accompanied her every day.

1995
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,240
for a year.

1996
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,440
Every day, basically in the afternoon,

1997
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,520
every day.

1998
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,520
I'll see her off at 7 a.m.

1999
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,280
I do this every day.

2000
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,840
for a year.

2001
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,960
I don't care about boys.

2002
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,040
I'll let him play basketball.

2003
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:57,600
Go out.

2004
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,520
Fatty can play outside.

2005
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,840
He's a bit wild.

2006
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,120
He likes to play with cars since childhood.

2007
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,560
When I see these cars,

2008
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,800
since I was young.

2009
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,880
So, in the end,

2010
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,560
he did what he liked.

2011
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,640
He did a good job.

2012
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,640
Basically,

2013
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,640
I don't need any support from my family.

2014
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,120
So I let him develop on his own.

2015
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,880
A sense of loss means

2016
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,720
I broke up with his dad.

2017
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,680
Although love was there,

2018
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,800
I think

2019
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,600
relatively,

2020
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,440
Parents' separation

2021
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,760
I owe a little to my child.

2022
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,840
I didn't feel it at that time.

2023
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,880
When I grew up,

2024
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,760
I feel it's a bit weird.

2025
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,640
I can feel it

2026
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,080
I can feel it.

2027
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,240
In junior high.

2028
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,200
I felt it in junior high.

2029
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,440
Because the two of them are getting farther and farther.

2030
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,560
When I was twelve or three, I could already feel it.

2031
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,600
I had my own emotions

2032
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,560
and locked myself in the room.

2033
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,520
Before I went abroad,

2034
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,240
my father had a serious talk with me.

2035
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,560
Tell He Wenxin first.

2036
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,760
We were taking a walk downstairs.

2037
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,560
I said your mom wanted a divorce.

2038
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,880
What do you think?

2039
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,800
At that time, I felt

2040
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,440
I could only accept it.

2041
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,400
I learned it from my brothers.

2042
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,880
12th grade.

2043
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,240
I was a grown-up then.

2044
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,880
I could accept it at that time.

2045
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,760
Because they separated peacefully.

2046
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,440
When parents separated,

2047
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,480
she was rebellious.

2048
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,200
has a great impact on her.

2049
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,560
Her personality changed suddenly.

2050
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,000
I used to love studying.

2051
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,120
It feels like a gentle sheep

2052
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,880
a gentle

2053
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,280
a wild horse.

2054
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,560
The impact of my parents being apart

2055
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,840
the most

2056
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,080
affect my view of love.

2057
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,360
I think

2058
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,800
girls should be

2059
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,920
in this society.

2060
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,960
Wake up.

2061
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,600
She's going abroad.

2062
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,960
She said there was an exchange student.

2063
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:00,880
She's really thoughtful.

2064
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,240
and bold.

2065
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,120
I've contacted everything.

2066
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,320
She did it herself.

2067
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,320
We couldn't contact her.

2068
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,800
I was confused at that time.

2069
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,640
When I think back, I was scared.

2070
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,440
She's only 15 years old.

2071
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,320
She was happy.

2072
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,200
not afraid at all.

2073
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,440
One person carried two boxes

2074
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,600
He went to America from Hong Kong Airport, China.

2075
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,640
When I was abroad,

2076
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,760
It's like holidays.

2077
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,440
during holidays.

2078
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,520
Maybe I've always been alone.

2079
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,800
Sometimes, I don't have friends.

2080
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,360
So, the festival is over.

2081
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,000
Ever since I lived abroad,

2082
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,800
I think

2083
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,160
enjoy being alone.

2084
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,240
After all,

2085
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,440
you have to do everything on your own.

2086
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,480
Because if no one helps you,

2087
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,080
you can't finish this.

2088
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,160
I can't finish my study.

2089
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,200
You can't complete your life.

2090
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,880
You can only muster up the courage

2091
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,280
to do everything well.

2092
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,080
So this year in America,

2093
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,160
I think after experiencing these things,

2094
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,080
it's also a growth for her.

2095
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:49,920
for her.

2096
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,000
She was very independent.

2097
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,560
I used to

2098
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,480
I used to sleep with my phone off.

2099
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,880
Ever since she went to America,

2100
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,480
I haven't

2101
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,200
I've never turned off my phone and slept at night.

2102
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:58,680
I remember

2103
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,960
their class ended at noon.

2104
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,520
I'm at 2:30 p.m.

2105
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,480
She was the first year in America.

2106
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,480
She called me every night.

2107
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,600
She called me after class.

2108
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,560
I waited for her call at 2:30.

2109
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,120
I think I've grown up

2110
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,680
when I grow up.

2111
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,280
Maybe I was naughty when I was a kid.

2112
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,400
When I grow up,

2113
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,320
when parents

2114
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,440
and communicate with each other,

2115
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,120
my parents came to me first.

2116
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:20,720
At that moment,

2117
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,000
I felt a burden on my shoulder.

2118
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,520
For example,

2119
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,680
some problems in love,

2120
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,800
and conflicts.

2121
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,080
he would tell me

2122
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:29,680
Don't be afraid.

2123
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,320
It's okay.

2124
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,480
I'll help you out.

2125
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,840
You can do whatever you want.

2126
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,440
When I feel a little wronged,

2127
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,120
or unhappy,

2128
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,480
I want to call him right away.

2129
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:44,360
I hope he can enlighten me by my side.

2130
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:45,840
I'll tell him

2131
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,560
emotional words.

2132
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,000
he will accept it all.

2133
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,240
It feels like we're more than siblings.

2134
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,080
Like family and friends

2135
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,280
Like brothers and besties.

2136
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,680
Multiple identity.

2137
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,520
She and Fatty are close.

2138
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:03,760
Yes.

2139
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,360
He Wenxin even talked about that boy.

2140
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,200
to teach that boy a lesson.

2141
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,480
When he grows up,

2142
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,280
he told He Wenxin everything.

2143
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,200
He was afraid of something.

2144
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,880
He Wenxin went with him to deal with them.

2145
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,680
Now I feel

2146
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,240
he has grown up.

2147
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,840
My family

2148
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,560
to train him.

2149
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,880
Be responsible.

2150
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:21,880
Right take care of your sister

2151
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:22,720
Now everything

2152
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,640
everything now.

2153
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,440
It's upside down.

2154
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,600
Fatty told me.

2155
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,320
He said he actually

2156
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,120
had a boyfriend.

2157
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,200
What do you think?

2158
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,720
He said I'll watch.

2159
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,400
I won't let my sister suffer.

2160
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:35,920
He's like this.

2161
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,800
So I feel relieved

2162
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,720
I feel relieved.

2163
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:38,680
They are together every day.

2164
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,920
So how can I be at ease

2165
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:40,520
How can I be at ease?

2166
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,440
Because Fatty saw it.

2167
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,120
I'm very interested in his love life.

2168
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,040
gossip.

2169
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,760
I have to know it as soon as possible.

2170
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,960
and know immediately.

2171
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:52,560
she is

2172
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,840
who likes to eat my love affairs.

2173
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,880
Yes, I do.

2174
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,480
They said I can grow up if I eat melons.

2175
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,360
I don't need to eat anything.

2176
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,800
I don't eat much every day.

2177
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,440
She eats a lot.

2178
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:05,200
If she is bullied in love,

2179
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,880
I will stand out immediately.

2180
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,120
As for their relationship,

2181
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,200
I won't interfere in other things.

2182
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:12,920
But I just

2183
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,320
I can't see my brother being bullied.

2184
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,720
He will...

2185
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,200
He gets involved in everything.

2186
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,200
He's very involved.

2187
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,000
"The three are talking."

2188
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,800
Do you think you have the invitation card?

2189
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,440
Not necessarily.

2190
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,240
Don't be modest.

2191
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,720
You're the most cheerful.

2192
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,800
But I may not have a card.

2193
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,760
Do you think you have it?

2194
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,840
I think I do.

2195
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,240
You just said no.

2196
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,520
If I say yes, you do.

2197
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,280
Aren't you disappointed if I say no?

2198
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,920
But I know who likes you.

2199
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,800
Who likes me?

2200
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,080
I said there are two houses.

2201
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:48,880
They have feelings for you.

2202
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,760
That's impossible.

2203
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,960
Don't do this.

2204
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,200
I really didn't feel it.

2205
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,360
I think there might be.

2206
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,000
Go ahead.

2207
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,600
Tell me who it is.

2208
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,600
I don't think he...

2209
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,160
he didn't say anything.

2210
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,000
All the topics

2211
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,120
Today.

2212
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,160
That's all for today.

2213
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,480
I think

2214
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,720
Harry

2215
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:06,920
His brother has feelings for me.

2216
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,520
No, he doesn't.

2217
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,680
If not, it's a map.

2218
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:11,880
I think

2219
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,200
is like this.

2220
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:13,880
No.

2221
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,360
He will answer my words.

2222
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:15,840
No.

2223
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,160
The map is my roommate.

2224
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,800
Just ask?

2225
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,320
Yes, I was talking about this with Tu.

2226
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,080
Then Tu Tu guessed me.

2227
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:27,520
Do you know

2228
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,640
Guess who my crush is.

2229
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,200
Who is it?

2230
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,240
Tu Tu thought you were my guest.

2231
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,320
Tu thinks you like me.

2232
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,280
Yes, it's funny.

2233
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,240
Because when we play games,

2234
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,440
when we play games.

2235
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,560
You love to pick up my words.

2236
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,600
I love to pick you up.

2237
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,760
No.

2238
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,000
And sometimes,

2239
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,800
you call me by my full name.

2240
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,520
You scared me.

2241
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,280
Show your brothers

2242
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,760
Go out and freeze me.

2243
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:53,880
He Wenxin.

2244
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:54,840
No.

2245
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:55,920
No.

2246
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,800
subconsciously.

2247
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,120
That's my problem.

2248
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,600
But I think you did well today.

2249
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,040
You're quite natural.

2250
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,720
I think you're more natural

2251
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:08,560
than the interview.

2252
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,080
Loosen it.

2253
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:10,880
You and

2254
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,600
Yuanyuan is in charge.

2255
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,400
Who am I controlling the scene with?

2256
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,320
Not Yuanyuan.

2257
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,800
A map.

2258
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,160
When playing games,

2259
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,400
when we play games,

2260
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,200
Can you tell?

2261
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,360
Someone likes drawing.

2262
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,160
It's too obvious.

2263
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,600
I don't like it.

2264
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,320
Not like.

2265
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,560
I just liked him at first sight.

2266
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:30,080
No.

2267
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,320
It's just a game that will hit a car.

2268
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,360
I think girls

2269
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,440
are not sure about her feelings.

2270
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,440
Oh no.

2271
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,400
But boys...

2272
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,640
I think you and Tu

2273
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,400
a little bit.

2274
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,440
Do you know who I am?

2275
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,120
I think it's obvious.

2276
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:44,680
Who is it?

2277
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,680
Xiao Ling.

2278
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:46,960
Hua.

2279
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,840
The drawing is also a guess.

2280
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,320
Aren't you Hua?

2281
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,080
I'm not good on my first day.

2282
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,800
You have to stick to your choice.

2283
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,480
We haven't started yet.

2284
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,000
I think we need to get along.

2285
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,840
Congratulations.

2286
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,600
You got a card.

2287
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,120
Really?

2288
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,240
Yes.

2289
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,360
Let me help you.

2290
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,120
No.

2291
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,240
Are you peeping?

2292
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:19,880
Let's watch it together.

2293
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,520
No.

2294
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,280
No, this.

2295
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,840
You're so curious.

2296
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,320
Good.

2297
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,640
Congratulations.

2298
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,800
I didn't expect that I would have one.

2299
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,720
To be honest,

2300
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,280
Because I think they are all handsome.

2301
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,080
You're handsome too.

2302
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:36,840
No.

2303
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,200
Look, she praises you.

2304
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,160
So I can go on a date tomorrow.

2305
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,280
Yes.

2306
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,520
You can go on a date tomorrow.

2307
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,520
I'm so happy.

2308
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,760
It's my turn.

2309
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,080
Flower and map.

2310
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,560
Who would have thought they were a family?

2311
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,800
I look forward to you.

2312
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,760
You must be cute when you were young.

2313
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,320
Look forward to me.

2314
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,480
Look at my childhood.

2315
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,800
You really love sleeping.

2316
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,160
Yes.

2317
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,120
This is what I saw when I was sleeping.

2318
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,960
So pretty.

2319
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,840
It's so white when it's pink

2320
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,720
Such big eyes

2321
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,800
It's still big now

2322
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,240
His eyes are really big.

2323
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,680
Dark eyes.

2324
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,560
Yes

2325
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,840
This was taken by my mom

2326
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,120
in Zhuhai.

2327
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,320
This is an art photo of my childhood.

2328
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:38,600
So cute.

2329
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,560
So pretty.

2330
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,160
It looks familiar.

2331
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,440
Dora.

2332
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:43,800
Dora!

2333
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,120
Dora!

2334
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,600
Dora.

2335
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,000
Okay, really.

2336
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
It seems

2337
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,400
It's trendy.

2338
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,400
Your bangs.

2339
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:55,800
Yes.

2340
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,680
I don't have bangs anymore.

2341
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,000
This is the same as you.

2342
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,400
wearing a wig.

2343
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:01,760
Me Yes

2344
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,320
Mom wig

2345
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,920
Yes, my mom came back.

2346
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:06,960
She was wearing a wig

2347
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,600
and took her wig.

2348
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,280
Dance.

2349
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,280
When I was young,

2350
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,000
I learned a little dance.

2351
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,640
This is also the graduation photo

2352
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,320
This is my graduation photo

2353
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,000
It's pretty.

2354
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,080
It's pretty.

2355
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:26,560
Skiing

2356
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,480
This is skiing.

2357
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,040
So

2358
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,880
I said we were here.

2359
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,960
we could ski here,

2360
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,320
That's good.

2361
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,800
And this is...

2362
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,320
When I was in Taiwan, China,

2363
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,600
in Taiwan, China.

2364
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,040
Try the makeup.

2365
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,560
Start your own business.

2366
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,440
It's comfortable to open a small shop.

2367
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,640
Very professional.

2368
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,160
Yes.

2369
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,560
The most beautiful person in the world

2370
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,760
Yes.

2371
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,440
Hello.

2372
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,320
I really want to tell you

2373
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,720
you are the most important person in my life.

2374
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,520
Beautiful.

2375
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,560
So generous.

2376
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,520
and considerate.

2377
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,680
All the good words in the world

2378
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,640
can describe you.

2379
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,920
We grew up together

2380
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:08,880
and grew up together.

2381
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,280
You're not like your family.

2382
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,160
like your family.

2383
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,520
You always make fun of me.

2384
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,440
and do childish things with me.

2385
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,760
From catching ants

2386
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,840
raise turtles,

2387
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,920
and play house with flowers and grass.

2388
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,200
My favorite is after school this weekend.

2389
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,280
after school.

2390
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,320
You like taro flavor.

2391
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,400
I like strawberry flavor.

2392
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,520
We can't finish it.

2393
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,080
So you always compromise

2394
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,280
and drink strawberry flavor with me.

2395
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,160
When I was young,

2396
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,440
you grew up with me.

2397
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:35,280
has been deeply engraved in my memory.

2398
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,240
If you ask me

2399
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,760
the most unforgettable thing for you,

2400
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,280
I think it was that time.

2401
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,480
I had a minor surgery

2402
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,320
for personal reasons.

2403
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,000
One day, the adults were not home.

2404
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,400
You took a leave to take care of me.

2405
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,080
Our family asked us

2406
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,440
to have dinner at the aunt next door.

2407
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,920
But she went out for something.

2408
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,480
It's not nutritious to order takeout.

2409
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,280
You can't cook.

2410
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,360
made me nutritious food.

2411
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,960
I didn't know how to cook at that time

2412
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,360
Now I know

2413
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,600
I know it now.

2414
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,080
I learned to cook online

2415
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,880
Looking at your busy back in the kitchen

2416
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,040
I'll remove the fishy smell

2417
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,040
Cut the vegetables carefully later

2418
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,400
When you put the meat in the pot,

2419
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,880
I forgot to cut the side dishes

2420
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,600
and took out the green onion, ginger and chili in a hurry.

2421
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,320
I was so scared watching you from behind

2422
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,760
but I couldn’t help.

2423
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,600
When the last dish is served,

2424
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,880
you feel relieved.

2425
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,640
You wiped the sweat on your forehead and said

2426
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,320
I've never cooked for anyone in my life.

2427
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,200
You're the first one.

2428
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,560
My parents haven't eaten it yet.

2429
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,680
I was very happy.

2430
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,160
Is this part "Chef Little Fugui"?

2431
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,120
It's so vivid.

2432
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,480
All details.

2433
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,280
I think all my worries were gone.

2434
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,320
But I regretted the first bite.

2435
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,600
Too much soy sauce

2436
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,240
The meat turned black.

2437
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,640
Potato shredded slices mixed

2438
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,400
The cabbage is stir-fried.

2439
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,680
I'll argue with you

2440
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,360
You won't get married if you do this.

2441
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,240
You said it's fine.

2442
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,880
If you can't get married, stay at home forever.

2443
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,920
I'll cook you bad meals every day.

2444
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,160
Although the dishes are unforgettable,

2445
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,840
your words comforted me.

2446
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,960
This comfort makes me

2447
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,400
in puberty.

2448
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,680
and conflicts.

2449
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,080
You always guide me patiently

2450
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,120
face problems one after another.

2451
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,520
In my memory, you didn't teach me much.

2452
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,800
but more importantly divertizing.

2453
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,040
and affect my personality.

2454
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,320
Let me smile like you

2455
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,640
sunny and considerate.

2456
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,480
and always full of energy.

2457
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,640
Behind these shining energy,

2458
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:20,000
I know there are many heartaches

2459
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,400
when you grow up.

2460
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,240
We both know

2461
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,200
our family is a bit special.

2462
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:28,600
Don't cry.

2463
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,480
They don't seem to care about

2464
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,480
your strengths.

2465
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,480
are affected by

2466
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:38,200
tenacious concepts of men over women.

2467
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,160
I can feel it every family gathering.

2468
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,920
You're facing the sex trials of adults.

2469
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,480
Wait.

2470
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,920
I didn't expect

2471
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:14,480
my brother would say

2472
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,120
in the album.

2473
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,840
Hua read her brother.

2474
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,320
When I wrote to her,

2475
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,280
she mentioned that there might be

2476
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,640
in our family.

2477
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,520
She is still so optimistic

2478
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,520
and outgoing.

2479
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,720
I think she must be

2480
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,680
must be very strong.

2481
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,000
When you respond to each other cheerfully,

2482
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,320
they feel extremely uncomfortable.

2483
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,440
Everyone wants to be loved by their family equally.

2484
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,840
But because of me,

2485
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,880
because of me.

2486
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,400
I can clearly feel

2487
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,240
your avaricious personality

2488
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,960
is formed slowly.

2489
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,920
I also saw clearly

2490
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,720
your fragile side

2491
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,600
your fragile side.

2492
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,600
You always consume more.

2493
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,280
No matter what happens,

2494
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,000
you have to find the reason.

2495
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:08,800
Not only in love,

2496
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,400
but also in life.

2497
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,480
Once you fell down,

2498
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:14,040
you went to the hospital to treat your wound

2499
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,120
and solve the dispute.

2500
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,840
If this happens again,

2501
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:18,440
I hope

2502
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,480
don't always think about solving it.

2503
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,880
Just tell me

2504
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,280
I can carry you to the hospital

2505
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,240
and help you solve everything.

2506
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,520
Lastly, I want to say it out loud.

2507
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,720
You're the best person in the world.

2508
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,760
You're like a gift.

2509
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:43,720
Be more confident.

2510
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:44,800
and less internal consumption.

2511
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,560
You don't have to feel sorry

2512
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,480
for others' kindness.

2513
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:48,840
Sorry.

2514
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:49,400
I feel burdened.

2515
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,280
You deserve to be loved.

2516
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,320
Straighten your back.

2517
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,880
and embrace everything that belongs to you.

2518
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,160
and pursue what you like bravely.

2519
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,120
You brought me along when I was young.

2520
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,440
Now, I'll protect you.

2521
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,280
I'll always be behind you

2522
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,400
as your protector.

2523
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,440
The map is good.

2524
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,360
Thank you.

2525
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,800
The last signature is

2526
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,760
to get married behind your back.

2527
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,920
Because there is

2528
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,600
There's a custom when we get married.

2529
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,000
Well,

2530
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,520
to get married secretly.

2531
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,360
The closest man.

2532
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,560
She rarely cries.

2533
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,080
She rarely cries

2534
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,000
in front of so many people.

2535
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,040
Because she is

2536
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,800
who can hold herself back.

2537
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:29,640
I think crying

2538
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,240
is a kind of emotional vent.

2539
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,280
so that I can

2540
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,600
find the right way

2541
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,880
to let

2542
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,280
the burden of my daily life.

2543
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,120
I didn't expect the map

2544
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,440
is actually sunny,

2545
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,120
but he's mature inside.

2546
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,720
So delicate.

2547
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,800
Because he may feel sad

2548
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,000
he might feel very sad, too. IYI.

2549
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:54,920
Maybe he feels bad too.

2550
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,160
In his letter, he said

2551
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,320
He said because of my arrival,

2552
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,240
you feel that men are more important than women.

2553
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,160
Yes.

2554
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,800
It means he had no choice.

2555
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,600
Although he is the one who is valued,

2556
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,960
but he'll be devoted to this.

2557
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,160
In fact, he also

2558
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,840
for his sister.

2559
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:11,720
Yes.

2560
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,120
But I think the most precious thing is

2561
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,480
he can feel this.

2562
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,120
and he's willing to tell you.

2563
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,080
You can say it out loud

2564
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:18,680
Great.

2565
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,880
Do you have anything to say

2566
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,080
to your brother?

2567
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,200
When people read these letters,

2568
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,000
nothing reminds me of my brother.

2569
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,320
Lu's brother.

2570
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,800
Go back and write a letter to Lu.

2571
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,200
My brother was naughty when I was a kid.

2572
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,240
and disobedient.

2573
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,240
But because he's a boy, IYI,

2574
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,800
My dad is the eldest son.

2575
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,360
He's the so-called eldest grandson.

2576
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,240
Although he's not from a prestigious family,

2577
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,360
but our village

2578
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,520
care about this.

2579
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,280
And

2580
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,000
my grandpa doted on him since he was young.

2581
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,520
So I think my brother

2582
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,160
that kind of love

2583
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,640
unconditional love.

2584
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,080
Before my grandpa passed away,

2585
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,280
I don't remember much.

2586
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:00,760
My grandpa hugged me.

2587
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:01,680
For example, we went to the ground

2588
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,360
and work.

2589
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:05,080
My grandma also carried me behind my brother's back.

2590
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,240
Yes, so you can feel

2591
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,560
a little different.

2592
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,080
But I think my brother

2593
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,280
is very strong.

2594
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,840
The sense of security and relaxation

2595
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,560
may come from

2596
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,160
Well,

2597
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,440
he's been able to feel

2598
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,960
that unconditional love

2599
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,880
is fearless.

2600
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:22,880
I feel that

2601
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,480
in my life

2602
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,960
may come from

2603
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,960
you think your love

2604
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,080
you need to fight for.

2605
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,480
You need to be an excellent and sensible person

2606
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,240
and obedient.

2607
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:35,840
will you be loved

2608
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,240
instead of you.

2609
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,280
is worth being loved.

2610
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,880
I think this point

2611
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,800
will still affect your personality.

2612
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,880
We just said that

2613
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,760
and insecurity.

2614
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,040
I think when you were young,

2615
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,880
you'll realize that you need to observe.

2616
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,640
You need to meet his expectations.

2617
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,830
Or you'll be abandoned.

2618
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:54,160
I might feel that way.

2619
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:01,360
Your existence is worthy of love.

2620
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,400
Thank you.

2621
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,360
Maybe your brother

2622
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,430
wanted to

2623
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:07,230
Me too.

2624
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:09,470
to my dear sister.

2625
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:10,910
Maybe

2626
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:12,350
since we grew up,

2627
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:14,110
since I grew up.

2628
01:30:14,110 --> 01:30:15,550
Of course I didn't.

2629
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:16,190
So we're even.

2630
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,160
I think Hwa is great.

2631
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:19,960
In this case,

2632
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,440
she's still a happy puppy.

2633
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,230
She brought us so much energy.

2634
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:24,830
Yes, she's very cheerful.

2635
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:26,840
Because she has a brother who loves him.

2636
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:27,480
If her brother

2637
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,760
didn't treat her like this,

2638
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,600
she might have run away from home.

2639
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,320
Yes.

2640
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,880
If the younger brother

2641
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,390
with his family,

2642
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:36,120
Yes.

2643
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,310
I'm afraid of this.

2644
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:39,000
Then she's really upset.

2645
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,030
So she and her brother

2646
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:41,630
formed a small fortress.

2647
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,120
This part is great.

2648
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:45,880
I know everyone new.

2649
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:50,240
Show your brothers.

2650
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,440
I'm really tired today.

2651
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,480
Finally (you)

2652
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,880
I'm telling you, I'm suffocating.

2653
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:10,110
You first?

2654
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:11,120
You first.

2655
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,160
Okay.

2656
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:16,080
I think she looks very beautiful

2657
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,920
and amazing.

2658
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,910
She is very kind

2659
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,480
Sometimes,

2660
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,630
a little fragile.

2661
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:29,120
But she will be strong

2662
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:29,880
through her appearance

2663
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,640
to hide

2664
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:32,640
little thoughts.

2665
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,910
is too considerate.

2666
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:35,920
and sometimes

2667
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:36,800
his own feelings.

2668
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,710
He loves his sister so much.

2669
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:40,280
You punk.

2670
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,400
You're so eloquent.

2671
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:44,560
My brother.

2672
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,480
He looks like a sheep.

2673
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,000
but a big wolf in his heart.

2674
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,880
On the outside,

2675
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,440
harmless.

2676
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,840
But in fact, Xiaojiu and his thoughts

2677
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,760
including the dark side.

2678
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,200
a lot.

2679
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,430
I've smeared more people.

2680
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:01,240
I can still control him.

2681
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,430
I can control him.

2682
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:04,670
The first impression she gave me

2683
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:06,430
she must smile a lot.

2684
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:07,920
and be optimistic

2685
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,520
is optimistic.

2686
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,590
I'm not sure

2687
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:11,390
the first side.

2688
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:12,160
In my mind,

2689
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,310
in my memory.

2690
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:14,800
So cute.

2691
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:15,710
White and fat.

2692
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,840
This is fair and fat.

2693
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,680
So cute.

2694
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,720
I want to pinch it.

2695
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,960
Because I knew at that time

2696
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,880
I wanted a boy at home.

2697
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,520
So when the result comes,

2698
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,280
I've already prepared myself.

2699
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,600
there won't be

2700
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,240
Besides,

2701
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:34,080
I really like kids.

2702
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,120
When I knew he was my younger brother,

2703
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,560
He's really cute.

2704
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,520
Show your brother.

2705
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,120
I love recording his

2706
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:45,880
in my album software.

2707
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,320
I may not have the most photos.

2708
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:50,080
He can take most of his childhood photos.

2709
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,590
Hua loves her brother so much.

2710
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,320
I think

2711
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,390
we are very close.

2712
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:02,880
We never fought.

2713
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,510
Although I'm so much older than her,

2714
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:05,360
our work

2715
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,200
or in different directions.

2716
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,670
But my communication with her

2717
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:10,680
is really zero.

2718
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:13,880
He kissed me cute when I was young.

2719
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:14,960
Bye.

2720
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,160
I'll miss you.

2721
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,400
I'm leaving. Kiss me.

2722
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,550
Stand here and kiss me.

2723
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:20,510
Sit there and kiss me.

2724
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:21,440
Since I was a kid.

2725
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,400
Now that you've grown up,

2726
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,390
Let go.

2727
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:26,080
She asked me to kiss her when she was young.

2728
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:26,840
When she was young,

2729
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,000
when she asked me to leave,

2730
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,240
You don't want to?

2731
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,520
Every time you say I'm leaving,

2732
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,280
you didn't kiss me?

2733
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,320
You wanted to kiss me.

2734
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,310
So at that time,

2735
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:34,000
it might have become a habit.

2736
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,280
You don't want it?

2737
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,480
Did I force you?

2738
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:39,680
But when you grow up,

2739
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,360
there was no such thing.

2740
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:41,950
After all,

2741
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:43,120
I remember a few years ago,

2742
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,190
I forced him to kiss me.

2743
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:44,960
He was so embarrassed.

2744
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,520
He...

2745
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:47,800
After all, he's so big.

2746
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:48,030
Right

2747
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:49,400
But now I know how to hug

2748
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,240
Just hug

2749
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:50,960
Yes.

2750
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,030
She always

2751
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:53,920
help me

2752
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,230
sensitive topics.

2753
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:57,950
My family may often say that

2754
01:33:57,950 --> 01:34:00,080
I may not be manly

2755
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:00,600
or something like that.

2756
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,440
Maybe they think

2757
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,440
too many women around me.

2758
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,560
She didn't mean to

2759
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,480
to hurt you.

2760
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,080
but to let you know

2761
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,720
They think that's what they meant.

2762
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,320
But in my opinion,

2763
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:14,840
it hurts some self-esteem in my childhood.

2764
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:15,520
or something.

2765
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,880
My sister could also

2766
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,240
at that time.

2767
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,190
I would tell them

2768
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:22,160
and tell me in private.

2769
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,040
Be yourself.

2770
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,640
Don't force yourself.

2771
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:26,360
Just grow up happily.

2772
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,160
I think a real man

2773
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,150
the pillar of our family.

2774
01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:30,880
can lift up the sky

2775
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,440
or protect

2776
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:33,760
and protect.

2777
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,710
I think this is the real manly manner.

2778
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:37,200
Yes.

2779
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,400
We're half-siblings.

2780
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,760
a family.

2781
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,040
Reorganize a family.

2782
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:57,560
Hello.

2783
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,480
I'm Hua's mother.

2784
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:00,440
Hello.

2785
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,840
I'm Yu's mother.

2786
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,280
Two moms.

2787
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,840
Today is our Cupid's date

2788
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,640
It's also the first date

2789
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:12,400
our roommates.

2790
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,920
Hello.

2791
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,160
Wrong.

2792
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,640
You don't know

2793
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,200
It's me.

2794
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,520
I hope it's from you.

2795
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,080
I was the first one to give it to you.

2796
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,160
You guessed it was me.

2797
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,600
I knew I invited you.

2798
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:29,400
A spoiled smile.

2799
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,880
That look in his eyes.

2800
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,480
I don't think it's awkward to talk to you.

2801
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,720
It's hard not Okay out.

2802
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,480
