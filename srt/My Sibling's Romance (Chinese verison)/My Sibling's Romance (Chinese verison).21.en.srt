00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,400
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
A small party.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull, refreshing as breathing.

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:45,920
Beautiful.

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,560
One piece.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:48,760
One.

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
I feel there's some wild wine at a party.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:00,520
Lambose is good.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,239
0 sugar tastes good. Young without burden.

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:05,760
love

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,520
Go down and heat up the medicine with me.

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,920
I haven't finished taking the medicine.

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,080
Take it now.

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,440
Let's go.

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,640
It's hot.

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,520
Let me help you.

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,520
You can do it yourself.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,880
With my feeling of causing trouble,

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,759
It's hot.

25
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,759
Cut a corner.

26
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,600
and pour it here.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,440
Thank you.

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,320
It's hot.

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Don't cut too much.

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,320
Do you think something will happen?

31
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,760
It will come out.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Not yet.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,720
Is it here?

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,320
Yes.

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,840
Okay.

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,240
Don't pour the wrong cup later.

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
I cut it for nothing.

38
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,880
You should face each other.

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,760
Because I need to prepare medicine.

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,680
Can he be sweeter? Yes.

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,280
He's so sweet.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,720
God help.

43
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,520
He's quite sensible.

44
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,120
Come on.

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,880
One more bite.

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,120
Be firm.

47
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,240
Come on.

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,040
Medicine is sweet.

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,440
When couples drink Chinese medicine together,

50
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,960
It feels like drinking coffee.

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,920
You’re doing volleyball.

52
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,160
I can play it.

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,280
Here.

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,120
Can you catch it?

55
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,480
Is this a embroidered ball?

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,840
Is this a straight shot?

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,720
Could it be...

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,480
Your hand doesn't hurt.

59
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,240
No.

60
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,720
No.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
Unlock a new game.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,480
Throw it down.

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,280
You scared me.

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,440
I'm coming down.

65
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,160
Come down.

66
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,960
It's almost done.

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,520
Here.

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,320
Text time.

69
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,320
Luckily,

70
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Susu and soup are finally finished.

71
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Yes, finally.

72
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,280
Yes.

73
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,520
The line today

74
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,800
will be easier.

75
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,400
Yes.

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,120
No turning.

77
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,040
One direction. Yes.

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,400
Done.

79
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,880
Not yet.

80
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,080
Who did Tu choose in the end?

81
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,960
He didn't tell me.

82
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,280
Really?

83
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,200
I thought about who to send it to.

84
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,280
Because I haven't received

85
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,880
for two days.

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,680
I have zero rules for two days.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,760
I don't want to be

88
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,800
to be left behind.

89
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,520
So I was hesitant.

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,680
Did you send it?

91
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,600
All sent.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,800
(All message has been sent.)

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,240
(They divide into two teams freely.)

94
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,360
and make a judgment.

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,760
The team who guesses the most correctly

96
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,120
will get one.

97
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,440
our Guoli Wild Crest.

98
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,320
The last episode of the show has won

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,040
The guests with the most wild badges

100
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,680
will receive

101
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,560
by Guoli.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,120
This episode's deduction is...

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,320
Please guess the direction of the message.

104
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,480
Now let's go to

105
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,840
of "Love Sisters".

106
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,440
Group.

107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,640
I'm ready to try

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,200
Black and white, right?

109
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,360
OK.

110
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,960
Come on.

111
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
Black and white.

112
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
The four of us.

113
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,720
This is an unknown.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:48,920
right?

115
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,760
Leave him alone.

116
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,840
Susu must have given us soup.

117
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,159
Xiao Ling must have wanted it.

118
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,640
Isn't Xiaoling fat?

119
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,240
Tata must be Harry, right?

120
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,800
Harry is also very determined.

121
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
Harry is Tata, right?

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,920
Will Xinxin choose Harry?

123
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,160
No.

124
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,800
One more time.

125
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,280
I'll give Harry the last time.

126
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,920
I think the flowers will be sent to Terri.

127
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,400
Hua is still chubby.

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,520
But I think she might be Tae-ri.

129
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:10,920
Yes.

130
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,320
Because just now,

131
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,560
She said I haven't received

132
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,080
for two days.

133
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,280
Yes.

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
I feel sorry for Xinxin.

135
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,600
OK.

136
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,120
Done.

137
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,960
We're ready.

138
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,000
Please announce.

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,160
Xiao Ling.
Tata.

140
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,400
Fatty.
Xiao Ling.
Tata.

141
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,080
Is it the same?

142
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,240
Do you also think Xinxin will

143
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,400
choose Harry again?

144
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,360
I think Xinxin will hang in there.

145
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,720
I don't know.

146
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,160
I know

147
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,640
what the correct answer is.

148
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,960
Yes, because she said she was competitive.

149
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,760
Now let's announce the correct answer.

150
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,800
We're going to

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,680
a party with wild wine.

152
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,600
It's time to reveal the truth.

153
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,120
Let's watch it together.

154
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,360
Why are you laughing?

155
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,120
No.

156
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,800
It's okay. I'll check Hunan.

157
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,040
Don't give me a hint.

158
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,720
He's still acting.

159
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
Still pretending.

160
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
Did you get permission from your brother?

161
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,160
You're sending me off.

162
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Did you agree?

163
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
No.

164
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,120
You didn't agree?

165
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,480
Did I agree?

166
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,160
Did I agree?

167
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,960
I'm speechless.

168
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,440
Soup.

169
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,280
Did you send me

170
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,240
Did you send it to me today?

171
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,159
I think

172
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,240
he knew I would send it to him today.

173
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,800
He still sent me

174
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,600
a message like this.

175
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,159
You know it, right?

176
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,040
Yes.

177
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,280
It's so easy. Help.

178
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,120
A boy's mind.

179
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,840
He has no sense of security.

180
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,080
What? Two small feet?

181
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,880
High five.

182
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,560
How did it come out?

183
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,520
He's thinking about how he did it.

184
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,760
What?

185
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,280
Did Susu send it to me today?

186
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,880
She replied this.

187
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,280
I think she means sorry.

188
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,520
To be honest, I don't think he understands.

189
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,360
Because after receiving his message,

190
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,800
he was confused.

191
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,280
He looks confused.

192
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,080
Why did I send that message?

193
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
is actually a face of high five.

194
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Then why did I send this expression?

195
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,640
Because

196
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
talked to the end,

197
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,880
I thought it would be a deal.

198
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,280
It's all in the past.

199
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,600
We've talked it through.

200
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,200
Then we gave him five.

201
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,360
So I sent him this expression.

202
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's move on.

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
It means "move on".

204
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,680
Tata.

205
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,720
Harry!

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's why I'm so happy.

207
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,040
I knew it was Harry.
That's why I'm so happy.

208
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,200
I knew it was Harry.

209
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,240
The message Harry sent

210
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,160
has been very valuable.

211
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,480
He wants to express that he's happy.

212
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,960
happy and nervous.

213
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,800
And I feel that

214
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560
after winning.

215
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,600
Because he added one at the end.

216
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,760
She's good at reading his information.

217
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Yes.

218
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,000
Why are you laughing so happily?

219
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,640
Nothing happened.

220
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,480
Calm down.

221
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,560
A little nervous.

222
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,760
Happy nervous.

223
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,680
I will definitely

224
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,920
I must give her

225
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
a memorable

226
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,680
Think about it.

227
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,800
Think about it tonight.

228
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,280
She always calls him Harry.

229
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,520
She can't stop smiling.

230
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,560
I sent the message

231
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,280
I sent it to Harry.

232
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,360
Actually, I've thought about it.

233
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,080
if I should send it to the map to explain.

234
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,120
But later I felt

235
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,680
there's no need to explain.

236
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,120
After all, I chose Harry for our date.

237
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
I think so too.

238
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,200
the message tonight

239
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,120
should be sent to him.

240
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,680
I haven't received these three.

241
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,040
I'll text you my feelings.

242
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,040
to those who have feelings for me that day.

243
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,360
Harry and Tata

244
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,920
They played there in the afternoon.

245
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,680
Take photos.

246
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,840
You're lucky.

247
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Wait, it's a bit ugly.

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,640
OK. Come on.

249
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,360
I think they are

250
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
on the same channel.

251
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,240
So I think

252
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,440
send it to him today.

253
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,000
I saw everything.

254
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
Cut the loss in time.

255
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,160
Xin sent it.

256
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,600
Xin sent it to him.

257
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,920
It's not love.

258
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,000
I said we should work together.

259
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,720
I'll kill you.

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
I sent my message to Map today.

261
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,120
Today,

262
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,360
I made half of the sugar strawberries with him.

263
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,200
Then I sent him the message

264
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,840
This text means

265
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,880
between siblings.

266
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,320
I've already emphasized the unity of siblings.

267
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,360
Yes, it's clear.

268
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,960
Did you text him?

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
No.

270
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,600
You're the only one who got the message.

271
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,520
You're exposed.

272
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,800
Xiao Ling.

273
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,400
Actually, I'm surprised

274
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,960
surprised me.

275
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,160
I got two too.

276
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,400
First, Xin's.

277
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,120
The second is Xiao Ling's.

278
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,920
When we were playing,

279
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,480
she said she didn't know how to fight the landlady.

280
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,000
She said directly

281
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,720
if I could teach her how to play the Landlord next time.

282
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,960
When I received

283
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,640
this news,

284
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,520
I was very happy.

285
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,840
I can't help laughing.

286
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,440
Uncovered happiness.

287
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,080
I sent my message to Map today.

288
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,880
I think

289
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,640
this is a obvious point.

290
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,400
to let him know who sent it to him.

291
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,800
So, you know Xiao Ling well about the soup.

292
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,320
He chose the map for Xiaoling.

293
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,160
Yes.

294
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,360
I guess

295
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,440
the person who sent this message should be Map.

296
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,760
Map?

297
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,240
Both sides.

298
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,760
Go over there.

299
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,160
The three of us are the same

300
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,800
We three comedians don't have love

301
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,560
I have.

302
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,000
Who knows?

303
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,880
You're amazing.

304
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,760
She doesn't envy

305
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
She doesn't envy me at all.

306
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,080
Just two days.

307
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,240
Do you know what will happen?

308
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,320
Love will bring you bad luck.

309
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,120
It doesn't matter.

310
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,600
It doesn't matter.

311
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,240
Do you know what a bounce is?

312
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,120
It's the first time I've seen people describe themselves with this.

313
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,800
When I was waiting for the news,

314
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,320
I pretended not to care,

315
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,280
but I kept looking at my phone.

316
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,760
I thought it wouldn't last three days.

317
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,160
That's really bad.

318
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,920
Here it comes.

319
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,880
It's coming. Rebound.

320
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,040
Can you teach me how to draw the shadow?

321
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,440
I thought it was Fatty.

322
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,600
I didn't expect Fatty would send it to me.

323
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,080
Because he didn't send it to me the other day.

324
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,320
I looked at him with doubt.

325
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,480
I wanted to argue with him.

326
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,800
I was wondering why you sent it to me today.

327
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,360
I sent Hwa Hwa my message today.

328
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,720
Actually, yesterday,

329
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,800
I've been thinking about this.

330
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,680
Today, obviously,

331
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,160
I want to

332
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,880
to talk to Hua.

333
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,640
to meet Hua.

334
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,800
But when I invited her today,

335
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
I sent it to Xiaoling.

336
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,960
Because...

337
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,520
I want to get to know Xiaoling as soon as possible.

338
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,680
Even if Xiao Ling and I

339
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,920
and Xiaoling,

340
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
And she didn't understand Hua.

341
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
I will still wait beside her.

342
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
I will wait.

343
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,080
Because this is a matter of respect.

344
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,160
After she gets to know it,

345
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,320
I’ll give her

346
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,120
to her.

347
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,200
Is it from Tae-seo?

348
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,400
Is it Tae-seo?

349
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,640
I think it's Tae-seo's text.

350
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,760
The content is

351
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,800
I want to know more about it.

352
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,520
I texted Hua today.

353
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,640
Because I said I regret it yesterday.

354
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,920
Today

355
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,960
to text today,

356
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,040
I sent it right away.

357
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,880
I sent the message to Hua.

358
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,800
I think I have changed.

359
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,120
As a girl,

360
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,080
as a girl.

361
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,840
the first day and the second day.

362
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,360
And after our contact,

363
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,160
no matter it's a group activity

364
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,520
she would take care of me

365
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,840
she would take care of me.

366
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,640
Her passion

367
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,600
will still touch me.

368
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,080
Who will Flower send it to?

369
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,840
Tae-seo.

370
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,320
They said the same thing.

371
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,080
I think it's also Hua.

372
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,440
But I'm not sure.

373
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
Because she sent me

374
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,520
I didn't send it to her.

375
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,680
I thought about who to send it to.

376
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,720
In the end, I sent it to Tae-seo.

377
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,840
I think I should follow my heart.

378
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,640
I've always wanted to know him.

379
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,520
I never talked to him alone.

380
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,400
So I sent him my message.

381
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,200
Fatty missed her.

382
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,960
I missed her.

383
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,280
Hua.

384
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,640
I got two.

385
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,960
I got two too.

386
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,120
I feel very happy.

387
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,120
No male choice.

388
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,160
Fatty and Xinxin failed.

389
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,440
Xinxin failed.

390
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,080
My reaction was that I guessed it.

391
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,360
Because I think he might be a little hesitant.

392
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
So the two girls he wants

393
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,960
will also be hesitant.

394
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,440
They might not choose him.

395
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,880
Both of them

396
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
in the rotation position.

397
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,320
The two of them.

398
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,000
Actually, I can feel her unhappy today.

399
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,160
She could feel Harry's determination two days ago.

400
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,079
and suddenly changed.

401
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,760
That's it.

402
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,359
It makes people feel a little unhappy.

403
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,319
But I don't think it's a big problem.

404
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,040
Because Esther adjusts her emotions quickly.

405
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,880
Actually she knows it very well.

406
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,079
I can see that she knows it very well.

407
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,400
She just said that because of her pride,

408
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,880
I think she is.

409
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,000
because of her pride.

410
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,520
Okay, let's see our correct answer.

411
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,600
It should be the same.

412
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,240
One is wrong.

413
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,840
One is wrong.

414
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,200
Xinxin.
Xin sent it to Tutu Quita.
Harry.

415
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,200
Fatty.
Xinxin.

416
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,520
Xin sent the map.
Fatty.
Xinxin.

417
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,040
Xinxin.

418
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,880
Other than that, we are all right.

419
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,560
OK.

420
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,440
Let's applaud for each of us.

421
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,880
We're tied for the first place.

422
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,840
So everyone will get

423
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,960
our Guoli Wild Crest.

424
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:52,840
X3.

425
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:53,760
XX4

426
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,960
X4

427
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,560
Hello, handsome.

428
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,720
Show your brothers.

429
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,520
Hello, I'm Yuan Bo.

430
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,920
I'm a model.

431
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,680
I have a sister seven years older than me.

432
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,800
Sister.

433
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,880
She's a fashion stylist.

434
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,240
Hello.

435
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,200
Long time no see.

436
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,440
Sister Terri: Yuan Qiong.
Show us your siblings.

437
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,840
You're finally here.

438
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,800
Long time no see.

439
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,960
Let me introduce my brothers.

440
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,920
188 handsome guy.

441
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,440
That's all.

442
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,360
What else do you want?

443
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,560
What else do you want?

444
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,920
He's a bit shy.

445
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
You deserve a beating.

446
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,440
She's very charismatic.

447
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,640
Both of them have been

448
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,120
when we were little.

449
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,440
We've been fighting since childhood.

450
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,880
Both of them are stubborn.

451
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,320
And no one was convinced.

452
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,200
My mom always said

453
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,040
they are so close.

454
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,360
Why are you two like this?

455
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,760
You two must help each other

456
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,080
in Shanghai.

457
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,400
More.

458
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,360
That's what it means.

459
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,120
But I think

460
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,400
we help each other.

461
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,480
The more she said that,

462
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,600
the more I have to go the opposite way.

463
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,680
You're really stubborn.

464
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,520
Okay.

465
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,720
He seems quite stubborn.

466
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,040
Show your brothers.
What are you talking about?

467
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,240
It's my first time to realize that.

468
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,720
When I was a kid, I always thought

469
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,800
Although my sister shouted every day,

470
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,320
but I think she's a bad person.

471
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,160
"Bad guy".

472
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,080
Because she often

473
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,920
my mom asked her to take care of me.

474
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,440
Then she wouldn't let me go out.

475
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,640
No.

476
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,480
I want to go out and play.

477
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,560
Why don't you go out with me?

478
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,520
I don't want to go out.

479
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,440
Yes, that's it.

480
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,640
Isn't that what I just said?

481
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,040
We've been on bad terms since childhood.

482
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,680
People born in the Year of the Horse don't get along with rats.

483
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,000
I've never seen Tae-seo like a younger brother.

484
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,640
Yes.

485
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,840
I haven't been with him

486
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,240
since high school.

487
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,080
After we started working after graduation,

488
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,280
we started working together

489
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,600
we started to work together

490
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,280
and lived in Shanghai.

491
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,640
I truly realized

492
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,280
my brother was by my side.

493
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,120
I grew up

494
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,280
and joined this industry.

495
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,120
When I went to Shanghai,

496
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,920
she just started working.

497
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,520
Maybe she didn't get much salary.

498
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,040
and give me pocket money.

499
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,160
I even gave you pocket money.

500
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,520
Yes.

501
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
He gave me money every day.

502
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,880
How much was it?

503
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,120
50 yuan 100 yuan

504
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,520
That's a lot.

505
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,680
Turn it back to me now.

506
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,320
She's half sister and half mother.

507
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,240
From that moment on,

508
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,080
this sister is good.

509
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,800
I have a sister.

510
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
No wonder I'm always like my mom when I'm dating.

511
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,000
It's because of you.

512
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,240
I had a lot to do when he first joined the industry.

513
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,880
Maybe I bought him

514
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,200
I don't care

515
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,040
whether I like her or not.

516
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,880
I won't listen.

517
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,240
But

518
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,440
the more you ignore him,

519
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,720
the faster boys grow.

520
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,800
But now I think

521
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,840
he can put his life

522
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,880
and work

523
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,320
is very good.

524
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,040
I think

525
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,240
are getting along well now.

526
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
We seldom contact each other.

527
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,040
But sometimes

528
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,960
to stand up for him.

529
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,400
For example, when he was away for a long time,

530
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,960
for a long time.

531
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,320
For example, when I was on a business trip for a long time,

532
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,680
when a dog needs a walk,

533
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,280
I think you're right.

534
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm not good at expressing my feelings.

535
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,120
It's basically proven by actions.

536
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
to love each other.

537
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,680
So I think

538
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,800
is more expressive than actions.

539
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,440
I think he's a reserved

540
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,080
and slow to warm up.

541
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,320
He's always cautious when he's in a relationship.

542
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,880
He knows a lot

543
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,760
to think about

544
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,160
with this person.

545
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,280
A child

546
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,320
who wants to be loved.

547
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,680
He seems to be devoted to every relationship.

548
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,920
He loves me.

549
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,360
When I was dumped,

550
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,400
I went to my sister and cried.

551
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,200
When he came back from New York,

552
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,920
when he came back from New York.

553
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,640
I just cried in my room.

554
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,680
I was so scared.

555
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,120
My family is kind of lovesick.

556
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,240
I think

557
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
it's not a bad word.

558
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,400
Love is good.

559
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,560
Isn't dating for happiness?

560
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
That's why I support him

561
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,960
in love.

562
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,440
Crying

563
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,960
She's always stubborn.

564
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,920
So I support him.

565
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,440
in love.

566
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
So I support him

567
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,440
in love

568
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,600
and cry.

569
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,560
So stubborn.

570
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,920
Show your brothers.
I won't tell you this.

571
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,120
I think my brothers

572
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,840
is to bring me into the modeling industry.

573
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
I think my brothers

574
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
changed my life.

575
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,000
I rely on myself without my family.

576
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,960
I'm more advanced.

577
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,440
I think this is my advantage.

578
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,960
I'm very satisfied

579
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,440
his achievements.

580
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,840
including when he went to Singapore.

581
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
and New York.

582
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,480
I went to Milan and Paris Fashion Week.

583
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,320
I also made some achievements.

584
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,400
I bought a car with my own efforts.

585
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:14,960
and bought a house.

586
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,520
Although

587
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,800
basic material,

588
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,040
But at his age,

589
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,600
I think he's already

590
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,440
in this industry.

591
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,080
Because my parents

592
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,240
were busy when I was little.

593
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,360
They didn't have time for me.

594
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,960
Grandma used to guide me.

595
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,120
Then grandma left

596
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,880
It feels like you've been taking care of me

597
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,840
Tae-seo.
Show your brother.

598
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,360
The person I can tell without shame

599
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,240
is the other one.

600
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,640
or

601
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,040
when our family encounters any difficulties,

602
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,760
you'll be the first one

603
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,800
to solve the problem.

604
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,160
Maybe that’s why

605
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,320
I always call him Yinbo.

606
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,880
I’m definitely interested

607
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,040
in your relationship.

608
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,560
But I think

609
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,680
he'll handle it well.

610
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,920
I never tell my parents

611
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,120
about my relationship.

612
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,440
So I'm willing to show my most fragile side

613
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,480
to my sister.

614
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,960
He didn't keep looking at the feeling.

615
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,240
I hope the other half is her.

616
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,000
is the one who feels right.

617
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,640
Happiness is the most important.

618
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
From what I know about her,

619
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,720
she won't worry that no one likes me.

620
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,280
I will definitely mock him.

621
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,640
If no one likes him,

622
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,280
I'm not worried at all

623
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,320
in the show.

624
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,880
Because he's the kind of person who is full of peach blossoms.

625
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,720
I think

626
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,920
someone would like him wherever he goes.

627
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,680
After all, I gave him all my love.

628
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,520
I'll make my brother public.

629
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,440
Guoli.
New hotel party, wild wine.

630
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,040
I like her so much.

631
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,200
and domineering.

632
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,320
but also humorous.

633
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,080
I would argue with him.

634
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,560
But I really love him.

635
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,000
He protects the weak.

636
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,200
Show your brothers.

637
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,880
Long time no see.

638
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,920
How have you been?

639
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,360
I'm doing fine.

640
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,880
I've been on a date once.

641
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,240
I checked in first.

642
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,720
Then I moved into a small house.

643
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,680
Among the three girls,

644
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,440
I can choose the date.

645
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Then I chose her.

646
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,080
What did you do on a date?

647
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,800
We had dinner together.

648
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,760
We talked a lot anyway.

649
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,840
But I came later.

650
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,120
Actually, she and another guy

651
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,920
with another guy.

652
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,920
Then...

653
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,480
Okay, your brother was rejected.

654
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,800
It's normal.

655
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,360
Yes.

656
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,200
When we were doing group activities,

657
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,960
she was in the same group with that boy.

658
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm in the same group with another girl.

659
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,320
Do you have any

660
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,040
particularly interested in you?

661
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,000
There's one.

662
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,080
The next day and the first day.

663
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,600
a girl sent it to me.

664
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,160
Yes, I guessed it later.

665
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,960
The girl

666
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,280
who was in my group.

667
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,840
So what do you think you did

668
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,280
to send you this message?

669
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,680
I don't know.

670
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,840
But later I received

671
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,480
a text message from the girl in my group.

672
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,640
She said

673
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,000
"We had fun together today."

674
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,200
I wanted to take it back.

675
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,680
The message I sent.

676
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,520
I regretted it.

677
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,000
I thought I should send it to her.

678
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,240
What should we do now?

679
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,800
There are still many days.

680
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
Show your brother.
This is your favorite.

681
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,440
Have you thought about
Show your brother.

682
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,560
about other people?

683
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,120
I've never thought about it.

684
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,960
Besides,

685
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,640
maybe we haven't had enough contact.

686
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,080
I don't know

687
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,320
how many times you have to go on dates.

688
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,160
But there should be many chances.

689
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,400
I think you can

690
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
with this girl

691
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,920
We'll meet her once or twice.

692
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,240
Then look at

693
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
of each other.

694
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,840
Do you think every girl

695
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,560
every girl?

696
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,280
Not every one.

697
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,640
Like this.

698
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,680
Two two three

699
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,400
about your siblings.
Because many things

700
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,920
You can do it in one or two days.
about your siblings.

701
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,760
Yes.

702
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,600
Did you fall in love at first sight?

703
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,840
Yes, we don't know much in a couple of days.

704
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,160
Follow your heart.

705
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,800
Let's meet later.

706
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,480
That's what I'm thinking.

707
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,640
Let's talk about it.

708
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,680
Because I basically

709
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,600
we didn't talk about

710
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,920
about

711
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,400
or personal views,

712
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,360
I didn't talk about it.

713
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,000
It's just my daily life.

714
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,240
Maybe early.

715
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,480
Good evening.

716
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,280
We didn't talk much.

717
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,760
Okay.

718
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,360
Rest early today.

719
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,120
If you have any questions later,

720
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,600
call me anytime.

721
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,800
Okay.

722
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,200
Okay.

723
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,160
Okay, bye.

724
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,280
I'm going back.

725
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:22,960
Bye.

726
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,960
As a sister,

727
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,400
she always agrees

728
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,480
She agrees.

729
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,520
Yes, as long as I'm happy.

730
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,720
She also

731
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,040
I want to know more about her.

732
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,240
and see if she's more and more like

733
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,640
more and more alike.

734
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,520
As I said before,

735
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,160
I like taking care of me.

736
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,200
I think she is

737
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,920
But there are other things

738
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,080
I want to try it again.

739
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,560
Why does my hair always collapse?

740
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,160
Just use my wig.

741
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,760
This is my Penelope.

742
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
What's wrong?

743
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,360
I can't fix my hair.

744
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,080
Your hair is so fluffy. Can you help me?

745
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,640
Don't bother.

746
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,840
Xiao Ling. I'll get you a better skull artifact.

747
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,240
Okay.

748
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,680
This is it.

749
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,400
Olia hydrochloric acid shampoo.

750
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,720
After you wash it,

751
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,240
when you wash it.

752
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,280
I'll try it now.

753
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,200
And this bottle is pretty.

754
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,080
Of course.

755
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,200
This is the second generation after the upgrade.

756
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,960
I've been stocking up since the first generation.

757
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,560
It can improve your scalp.

758
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,760
This fluffy shampoo

759
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,440
She's like our soft savior.

760
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,080
From now on,

761
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,280
is my Penelope.

762
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,600
I found that Susu is so cute.

763
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,360
She recreated the feeling of boys and girls

764
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,040
before a date.

765
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,720
Before you go on a date,

766
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,600
you're not perfect at all.

767
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,360
Yes.

768
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,320
My soft hair

769
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
I've been planted.

770
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,880
I think I can try

771
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,960
I think I can try it too.

772
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,480
Yes.

773
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,200
I think you can have a high skull easily.

774
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,880
and make your face look smaller.

775
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,520
You must have used your hair.

776
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,880
Yes, it's fluffy now.

777
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,000
When she was holding it,

778
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,160
I thought the bottle

779
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,760
is really handsome.

780
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,680
I want to try it on.

781
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,040
Date day.

782
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,560
(Protect our date.)

783
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,160
Aulia.

784
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,600
You look much more handsome today.

785
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,640
Let's go.

786
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,040
Siblings

787
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,680
Today is the day

788
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,480
for our roommates.

789
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,520
Dressing up on a date

790
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,320
to dress up on a date.

791
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,400
We've prepared

792
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,440
for a spring date today.

793
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,080
Let's share it with you, okay?

794
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Actually the three of us

795
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,600
wearing denim together.

796
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,680
And look at the color.

797
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,200
We're on a date.

798
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,000
Yes.

799
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,560
It's like you're dressed carefully, right?

800
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,360
Isn't it?

801
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,240
If the three of you stand together,

802
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,120
you three stood together.

803
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,760
Sorry.

804
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,080
I think it's easy to choose cowboys.

805
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,640
I don't think it's because of this.

806
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,080
I think it's the same element

807
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,280
the same elements.

808
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,400
Yes, because my husband and I

809
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,240
I didn't say we were going on a serious date.

810
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,000
But I found that

811
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,320
every time he went out,

812
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,560
he would look at what I wear.

813
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,040
I think sometimes he will go back.

814
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,560
But after a few times,

815
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,360
he will subconsciously

816
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,880
on your color.

817
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,600
It's getting more and more alike.

818
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,120
Yes.

819
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,080
So I don't think

820
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,000
to wear a dress for a date.

821
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,240
But you can

822
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,400
with some elements.

823
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,600
This is good.

824
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,520
It feels like a date.

825
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,400
This is good.

826
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,600
I always

827
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,840
relaxed and relaxed.

828
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,480
When you go out like this

829
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,280
Everyone is relaxed.

830
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Yes.

831
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,520
My clothes are obviously...

832
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,120
I took a look at what Guoli is wearing before going out.

833
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,640
Really.

834
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,880
You and Guoli are a good match.

835
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,680
Yes.

836
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,280
I also cooperated with

837
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,000
with the one beside me.

838
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,120
And this one.

839
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,640
Yes, both of us.

840
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,600
If the guy is dating Song Yeon-ju,

841
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,640
she'll be under a lot of pressure today.

842
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,720
Take four people to carry her skirt.

843
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,320
I think girls must

844
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,840
every day.

845
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,120
No matter what

846
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,000
today,

847
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and how bad it is.

848
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,240
But at least I'm pretty.

849
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,760
Yes.

850
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,800
Because you're not

851
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,600
for each other.

852
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,280
Do you want to make me look good first?

853
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,120
Yes, I want to be pretty.

854
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,760
No matter what, I want to be beautiful first.

855
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,280
Yes.

856
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,480
Huang Zihong Fan.

857
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,240
He's popular.

858
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,720
No.

859
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,920
Because red is actually...

860
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,920
Isn't it ENFP?

861
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,120
The Wild Wine of Guoli.

862
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
The warm and lively color is like this.

863
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,320
And if it looks like a knitting shirt,

864
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,960
I think dating is actually

865
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,880
is more formal.

866
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
But you need to feel warm.

867
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,000
So I choose this one.

868
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,920
like this.

869
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,920
"Love Sisters" joint Weibo

870
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,800
(launched a activity)

871
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,200
in spring love.

872
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,800
Come and join us in the submission.

873
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,960
and find the heartbeat of this spring.

874
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,280
They're dating.

875
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,000
Hello.

876
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Good evening.

877
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,760
Was I awkward just now?

878
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,440
A little.

879
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,480
I can feel that

880
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,440
I tried my best to keep it.

881
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,120
Why?

882
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,880
Something's wrong.

883
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,320
Something's wrong since afternoon.

884
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,320
Who?

885
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,800
Harry.

886
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,000
I suddenly spin.

887
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,960
Suddenly.

888
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,160
Is there anything wrong?

889
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,960
They went on a date last night.

890
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,000
When I came back,

891
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,840
I thought he wouldn't send it to me.

892
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,560
But last night,

893
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,120
did you receive his text?

894
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,800
It's his.

895
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,560
What did he send?

896
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,520
He said he wanted to know more about you.

897
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,320
She still thought it was from Harry.

898
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,280
It's not his.

899
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,840
It's just...

900
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,640
At first,

901
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,760
he wouldn't send it to me.

902
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,640
After sending it,

903
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,440
last night.

904
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,920
They were playing with cats.

905
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
I went out

906
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,600
They are here.

907
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,360
we didn't talk.

908
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,560
We didn't talk much

909
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,920
she didn't talk much.

910
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,080
She thought Harry sent it to her.

911
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,240
Yes.

912
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,080
She thought Harry sent it to her.

913
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,440
So you think yesterday's date

914
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,920
caused him a wave?

915
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,840
Do you think

916
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,920
he showed determination

917
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,680
at the sports day?

918
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,920
Before the sports day,

919
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,960
before the sports day.

920
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,760
Because he chose me.

921
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,160
But you didn't receive that text today.

922
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,480
I can feel your emotions are low.

923
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,360
You are depressed

924
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,600
because of your dignity?

925
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,920
Or

926
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,880
I really think

927
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,600
his change

928
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,760
made you unhappy.

929
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,440
I think both of them

930
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,920
I'm sure he'll be unhappy.

931
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,840
After all, he told you his feelings.

932
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,080
even for two or three days.

933
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,280
But you really

934
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,320
you want to

935
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,080
with him again.

936
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,280
with him.

937
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,040
It's not sudden.

938
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,520
They've been interacting today.

939
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,159
But I didn't interact with him.

940
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,639
If he wants to talk to me,

941
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,120
we have a chance.

942
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,120
Including Su Su's unhappy today.

943
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,679
is soup.

944
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,199
He will go to accompany her

945
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,199
and take medicine with her.

946
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,760
I think this is a show that he cares about.

947
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,400
But he didn't.

948
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,480
It means he doesn't care.

949
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,840
Everyone will be shocked.

950
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,040
But I have a question.

951
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
In this situation,

952
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,600
If Harry wasn't like this,

953
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,600
how should we handle this decently?

954
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,880
Because they are not

955
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,960
in a relationship.

956
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,719
Yes.

957
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,880
Harry is also embarrassed.

958
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
So he just avoided it.

959
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,159
It's hard to say.

960
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:46,920
Let me tell you.

961
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,639
I think I like him more.

962
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,280
I can't say that either.

963
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,400
At least in a short time,

964
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,000
in a short time.

965
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,040
So you think Harry is good.

966
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,600
That's what he can think of.

967
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,880
that he could think of.

968
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,760
is to stop the loss in time, right?

969
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,200
Yes.

970
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,680
He suddenly came and said

971
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,480
I'm sorry.

972
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,320
I think I like her more.

973
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,240
What strange pose?

974
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,960
No, you can't do this.

975
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,520
Yes.

976
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,080
You don't have to be sorry.

977
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,160
Sorry.

978
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,080
Beautiful hair.

979
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,240
He can apologize too.

980
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,400
It's really hard.

981
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,640
So Harry's perspective

982
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,080
In reality, I met someone

983
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,920
someone I like very much.

984
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,320
So I'm going to "complicate".

985
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,800
Yes.

986
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,080
Don't make others misunderstand me.

987
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,680
Yes.

988
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,840
I need to take good care of her.

989
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,160
That's good.

990
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,920
Yes.

991
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,760
It may be the best way

992
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,640
is also the best way for Xinxin.

993
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,560
At this stage,

994
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,080
Yes.

995
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,520
That's true.

996
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,280
I've known you for two days

997
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,000
to know you.

998
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,440
Yes.

999
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,240
That's all.

1000
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,080
Yes.

1001
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,960
I personally think

1002
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,720
you don't have to be too disappointed.

1003
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,280
Not that.

1004
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
First of all, the impact on my mood

1005
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,760
It must be.

1006
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,080
Because I was a little awkward just now.

1007
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,800
It was too tight.

1008
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,560
I didn't receive any text last second.

1009
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,440
in the last second.

1010
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
The next second is the birthday party.

1011
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,000
Happy birthday to you

1012
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,040
Sifang.

1013
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,880
Xinxin, eat more.

1014
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,000
You want cake?

1015
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,640
I can't eat it.

1016
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,360
Do you think

1017
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,840
Harry versus Tata will be more positive to you?

1018
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,760
Indeed.

1019
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,200
He has always been

1020
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
to me.

1021
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,640
chatting or entertaining.

1022
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,160
But he's very clear about Tata.

1023
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,440
He would pick her up

1024
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,000
and get along with her openly.

1025
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,480
Maybe

1026
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,280
her type.

1027
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,800
Xinxin will be fine after she gets through this.

1028
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,720
It's over.

1029
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,280
and let it go.

1030
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,000
So you think

1031
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,080
when the tower didn't appear,

1032
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,080
he wanted to know and have feelings for you.

1033
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,560
As your brother,

1034
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,760
I don't understand that.

1035
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,160
I think if he had a date yesterday

1036
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,520
and knew Tata,

1037
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,960
he should have

1038
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,520
last night.

1039
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,240
But last night,

1040
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,840
last night

1041
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,480
which made me confused.

1042
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,640
So today,

1043
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,240
because your emotions are unstable,

1044
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm a little angry too.

1045
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,600
It's a misunderstanding.

1046
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,120
An anonymous text.

1047
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,240
I'm a little angry

1048
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,920
I'm a little angry.

1049
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,480
You can

1050
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,040
to Tata directly.

1051
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,080
After you texted Xin,

1052
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,720
Then the next day,

1053
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,360
the next day.

1054
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,480
I think he doesn't respect Xinxin.

1055
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,720
I don't think you need to sigh.

1056
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,480
You really don't need to sigh.

1057
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
In other words,

1058
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,400
even if you two get along,

1059
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,000
he won't be able to pass me.

1060
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,720
Maybe.

1061
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,400
Because I may want to say

1062
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
if I'm not good enough.

1063
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,520
I don't think I'm not good enough.

1064
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,920
I think you are an excellent person.

1065
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,720
To be honest,

1066
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,840
love is not

1067
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,120
Right, love is not about value.

1068
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,400
It's not about who's bad.

1069
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,360
I feel sorry for you.

1070
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,960
Because I have a strong self-esteem since I was a kid

1071
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,080
I'm also very fragile.

1072
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,480
He can see

1073
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,360
my weakness.

1074
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,920
At this moment,

1075
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,240
I feel different

1076
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,080
It's different

1077
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,760
So it's good to have brothers.

1078
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,280
Esther is holding on.

1079
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,120
But a word of consolation

1080
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,400
I really can't hold on.

1081
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,040
Yes.

1082
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,000
Let me tell you.

1083
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,480
on the day I sent messages,

1084
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,800
I thought

1085
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,280
you would definitely receive the message.

1086
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,680
But I think love

1087
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,560
is incomparable.

1088
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,880
You don't have to say.

1089
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,640
I lost if no one chooses me today.

1090
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,600
This is not the right choice.

1091
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,200
I don't think I lost.

1092
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,960
I'll keep thinking about what I've been doing these two days.

1093
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,920
or to my friends,

1094
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,800
or to my behaviors.

1095
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,880
I just don't think I did well enough.

1096
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,720
Definitely not.

1097
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,800
Just because of a meal,

1098
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,040
because of a meal.

1099
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,240
That means

1100
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,600
he doesn't like your style.

1101
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,520
It's not nice,

1102
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,080
but it's the truth.

1103
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,440
The truth.

1104
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,280
You chose me.

1105
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,040
Yes.

1106
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,440
I'll tell you last night

1107
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,400
or last night.

1108
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,320
I won't tell you.

1109
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,720
There's no problem.

1110
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,280
In this environment,

1111
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,520
no matter what,

1112
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,680
you have your siblings.

1113
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,880
I will be there.

1114
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,840
I'll be there.

1115
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,760
Really?

1116
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,720
Yes.

1117
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,000
Great.

1118
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,840
Always behind

1119
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,400
Great.

1120
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,160
Someone will love you.

1121
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,400
Whether he chooses a tower

1122
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,840
or anyone.

1123
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,080
I think

1124
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,720
there's no need to compare this.

1125
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,040
Don't think you're not good enough.

1126
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,480
I don't think you did anything wrong.

1127
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,240
And I've experienced two rounds of

1128
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,480
two rounds of torture,

1129
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
knocked me out.

1130
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,680
Really.

1131
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,880
These two brothers asked me questions.

1132
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,920
Then both of them

1133
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,040
my invitation.

1134
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,560
including the questions Xiao Ling's brother asked me.

1135
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,640
That's called height.

1136
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,280
What height?

1137
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,320
That's why

1138
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,840
Now I forgot all my answers.

1139
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,200
It's too high.

1140
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,400
That's really too high.

1141
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,200
And they asked me

1142
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,680
what I would do if I rejected it.

1143
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,760
I said no problem.

1144
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,920
I think

1145
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,120
the denial of brothers

1146
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,720
doesn't mean their feelings.

1147
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Actually this morning,

1148
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,200
texted this morning,

1149
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,800
I only sent one message.

1150
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,920
But I sent it to Xiao Ling first.

1151
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,640
Because I met Xiaoling the day before yesterday.

1152
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,400
But after the whole day I got to know her,

1153
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,200
do you think

1154
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,000
between me and Xiao Ling?

1155
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:03,960
No.

1156
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,640
Yeah, I don't think so.

1157
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,720
We're more like friends.

1158
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,200
So,

1159
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,120
I sent this invitation to her immediately.

1160
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,920
I thought maybe I should contact her again.

1161
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,920
How can it be rejected?

1162
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,560
If both of you send it to her,

1163
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,000
Yes, send them to her.

1164
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,360
her siblings will decide

1165
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,760
who she's dating.

1166
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,400
Both of them were rejected.

1167
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,640
You can see

1168
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,160
we are very close.

1169
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,880
Trust me.

1170
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,840
They're here to invite you.

1171
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,320
I will also reject

1172
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,960
and support each other.

1173
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,880
Did you prepare these questions?

1174
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,040
Someone will invite you.

1175
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,880
and choose for you.

1176
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,280
I think I'll ask him 10,000 questions.

1177
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,360
Right?

1178
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,640
I think it's okay.

1179
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,360
Don't think

1180
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,760
he's disappointed because he's celebrating her birthday.

1181
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,000
I feel happy to celebrate her birthday.

1182
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,320
Because I think I like Tata too.

1183
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,400
She has a good personality.

1184
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,560
I think

1185
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,360
I feel a little awkward

1186
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,000
I was a little embarrassed.

1187
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,440
Actually, I'm a little embarrassed.

1188
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,320
But at this time,

1189
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,240
maybe I can

1190
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,400
I can be alone.

1191
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,440
No, I want to know too.

1192
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,840
Why are you shy about this question?

1193
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,440
He should be embarrassed.

1194
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,560
He can see clearly.

1195
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,360
He's not awkward. He's happy.

1196
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,080
If he's not embarrassed,

1197
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,280
why are you embarrassed?

1198
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,360
Don't be blinded by

1199
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,320
because of your competitive mind.

1200
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,240
I've always wanted to tell you.

1201
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,200
But I can't tell you this.

1202
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,400
Let me make it clear today.

1203
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,960
I think the relationship line

1204
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,360
follow your heart.

1205
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,320
Don't think that you'll feel bad

1206
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,960
just because

1207
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,760
you have to reply to him.

1208
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,960
This is called a heart message,

1209
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,320
instead of replying.

1210
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,200
Yes.

1211
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,240
He dances on your thunder point.

1212
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,480
You should just

1213
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,560
even when you text him,

1214
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,800
you can already tell him

1215
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,160
I didn't send it to him today.

1216
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
I know.

1217
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,920
Don't send it to someone

1218
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,720
because you don't have someone you like.

1219
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,000
I think it makes sense.

1220
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,520
You admire others if you don't like them.

1221
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,920
I think you can praise the drawing.

1222
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,480
I praised the drawing today.

1223
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,840
By the way, I want to take a step back.

1224
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,640
if he comes back to you

1225
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,960
he will come back to you.

1226
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,120
Good question.

1227
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,000
This is a good question.

1228
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,080
his good question.

1229
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
Then this is impossible.

1230
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,760
because of your pride?

1231
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
Or are you just

1232
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,200
about this person?

1233
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,480
I'm not sure

1234
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,640
is zero.

1235
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,600
But do you think

1236
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,480
a definite choice?

1237
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,360
Or

1238
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,120
he's just getting to know him.

1239
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,320
He can't be with me.

1240
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,840
Do you think what I did

1241
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,400
is the same as what he did?

1242
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,160
I think it's different.

1243
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,560
For example,

1244
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,560
I think you know

1245
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,360
and Xiao Ling,

1246
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,960
when I get to know Xiao Ling.

1247
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,520
But the message he sent me

1248
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,440
and how we get along,

1249
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,080
he was direct.

1250
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,160
I don't talk about his relationship with Tata,

1251
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,200
or how he will choose.

1252
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:49,760
I have it.

1253
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,440
I must have rejected him.

1254
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,480
We can be good friends in the future.

1255
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,720
But I won't

1256
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,440
with him again.

1257
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,840
Because the choice I made

1258
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,720
is not firm.

1259
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,480
Even if he just

1260
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,960
get to know him.

1261
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,840
Okay.

1262
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,600
I understand what you mean.

1263
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,760
He's a funny guy.

1264
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,880
If we can get along

1265
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,560
as friends,

1266
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,840
I think it's very good.

1267
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,440
Are you feeling better?

1268
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,880
I am.

1269
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,080
After all, both sides rejected you.

1270
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,480
That's comforting.

1271
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,080
But honestly, I'm not worried.

1272
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,680
I'm really not worried.

1273
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,600
Because I can feel

1274
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,840
Hua is happy to receive my message.

1275
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,200
She made me a big bowl of noodles.

1276
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,000
So you sent it to Hua today?

1277
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,640
Yes, so I firmly finish it.

1278
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,080
Fatty, is it good?

1279
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,560
Focus on hard work.

1280
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,440
Did you forget to lose weight

1281
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,600
How much weight did you lose?

1282
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,920
What did you send her?

1283
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,240
Can you teach me how to use the dressing stick?

1284
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,600
She told me in the kitchen

1285
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,320
I'll teach you.

1286
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,240
What are you thinking?

1287
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,920
Nothing. I think you're cool.

1288
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,360
I'll teach you how to fix your face.

1289
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,120
Flower takes the initiative unintentionally.

1290
00:43:59,120 --> 00:43:59,840
Yes, she's cool.

1291
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,440
Very natural.

1292
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,640
She just said it.

1293
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,560
So my date tomorrow is

1294
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Brothers' agreement.

1295
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:24,480
C. Give up.
B. Go out with your sister.

1296
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:32,320
(Protect Date) It's meaningful to protect your brothers.
Please go to the siblings' house later and tell them about your hand.

1297
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:32,920
Please go to the siblings' house later and tell your siblings.
(Protect Date) It's meaningful to protect your brothers.

1298
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,000
Actually it's not easy for them

1299
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,320
to be like this.

1300
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:35,600
Yes.

1301
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,960
We went out to have fun.

1302
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,960
It's good.

1303
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,600
I think Xinxin is actually

1304
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,880
self-testified.

1305
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,520
She noticed

1306
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,600
Harry and her

1307
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,280
between Harry and her,

1308
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,000
she thought

1309
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,800
if I didn't do well enough.

1310
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,640
It must be because I didn't handle this relationship well.

1311
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,320
So she is always

1312
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,080
self-prove.

1313
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,840
we can give

1314
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,200
who watch our show

1315
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,800
have this kind of self-reflection type.

1316
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,880
There is a word called weakness.

1317
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,480
Weakness.

1318
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,600
The first one is to show weakness to yourself.

1319
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,720
You can allow yourself

1320
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,680
not a perfect person.

1321
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,240
The second one is to find someone

1322
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,840
who can make you weak.

1323
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,200
Just like Fatty just now.

1324
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,520
In front of Xinxin,

1325
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,560
in front of Xinxin.

1326
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,160
So,

1327
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,240
Mu Chun can give you a good support.

1328
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,520
and give you a lift.

1329
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,040
Yes.

1330
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,840
So

1331
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,400
having a fat brother

1332
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,560
is really good.

1333
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,760
To someone who can prove himself,

1334
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,080
from the beginning,

1335
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,880
For example, Harry.

1336
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,800
There's something going on between them.

1337
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,120
In fact, he was being himself.

1338
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,840
He's still being himself after that.

1339
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,360
You haven't changed at all.

1340
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,840
But you will deny yourself.

1341
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,000
It's just something outside.

1342
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,760
outside.

1343
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,800
Fortunately, she is mature behind Xinxin.

1344
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,640
She said

1345
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,040
She said she knew Harry was interested in Tata.

1346
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,440
But she thinks Harry is fun.

1347
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,120
We can be friends from now on.

1348
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,400
Actually, when I said this,

1349
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,160
she actually let go.

1350
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,920
She's relieved.

1351
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,560
Yes.

1352
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,720
If you meet someone

1353
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,480
in a relationship,

1354
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,720
he may show such uncertainties.

1355
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,520
what would you do?

1356
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,360
Say goodbye.

1357
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,120
Just say goodbye.

1358
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,880
I won't say

1359
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,480
No.

1360
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,040
Did I do something wrong?

1361
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,480
Should I change something?

1362
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,680
No, I'm fine.

1363
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,880
Let's see if I'm 18

1364
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,600
or the 38-year-old me.

1365
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,040
A party with wild wine.
Guoli.

1366
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,120
I'll think it's my fault.

1367
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,520
Yes.

1368
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,640
I'll send her more WeChat messages.

1369
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,080
Try again.

1370
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,600
Right?

1371
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:26,880
Yes.

1372
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,120
But usually at this moment,

1373
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,200
she gets worse.

1374
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,320
The other party...

1375
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,520
Look, licker.

1376
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,720
I used to be like you.

1377
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,760
For example,

1378
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,440
I hit the south wall.

1379
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,120
Yes.

1380
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,480
And then he woke up.

1381
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:45,880
I found that

1382
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,640
if I'm not your first priority,

1383
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,240
you don't have to

1384
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,520
you don't need to be the first.

1385
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,720
Just say goodbye.

1386
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,800
That's fine.

1387
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,840
The next one is better.

1388
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,120
Yes.

1389
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,840
I think we need to

1390
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,680
vent your emotions.

1391
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,240
Don't hold it in.

1392
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,920
Because the more you hold back, the deeper you'll fall.

1393
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,360
I'd rather cry.

1394
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,200
and chat with friends

1395
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,280
and have a drink.

1396
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,720
It's almost done.

1397
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,800
Yes.

1398
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,640
I thought about it.

1399
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,760
I was a little sad.

1400
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,480
Well,

1401
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,440
If something like this happens to me,

1402
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,280
I can only find my own reason.

1403
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,240
And I couldn't go.

1404
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,880
and pestered him.

1405
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,400
Don't leave me.

1406
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:19,880
Don't go.

1407
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,040
It's hard to do this.

1408
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,880
It's possible that

1409
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,880
get farther away from her.

1410
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,760
Why do I want to see this scene?

1411
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,000
Don't go.

1412
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,600
Advance the difficulty.

1413
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,640
What if

1414
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,440
she looks back again,

1415
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,200
Can you do it?

1416
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,000
I'm fine.

1417
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,960
Really?

1418
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,960
Me too.

1419
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,640
Really?

1420
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,760
I can do it too.

1421
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,760
You two.

1422
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,640
We can.

1423
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,040
We're "forever backup".

1424
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,960
of "Lick Dog".

1425
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,880
Yes, a big "licker".

1426
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,000
Lick it until you get nothing.

1427
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,120
Okay.

1428
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,200
Let's continue.

1429
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,720
Let's go on a date.

1430
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,240
Okay.

1431
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,360
I hope

1432
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:56,960
tomorrow.

1433
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,280
Let's take a photo outside.

1434
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,440
I'm going to go without makeup.

1435
00:47:59,440 --> 00:47:59,800
No.

1436
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,760
I have to put on makeup when I go out with you.

1437
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,480
You have to look good when you go out with your siblings.

1438
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,720
Take photos.

1439
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,880
Ten o'clock, okay?

1440
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,960
In fact, in a relationship,

1441
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,200
he will always tell me the truth.

1442
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,680
No matter what relationship I have,

1443
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,560
in any relationship,

1444
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,040
he always tells me

1445
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,400
to cut the loss in time.

1446
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,320
It's not scary without a boyfriend.

1447
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,400
What's scary is that you've been consuming yourself.

1448
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,360
I got 80% comfort

1449
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,880
from my brother.

1450
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,960
Have you ever thought

1451
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,440
maybe Harry didn't send

1452
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,880
might not be from Harry.

1453
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,320
Here's the key question.

1454
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,720
Really?

1455
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
Really?

1456
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,880
I don't know.

1457
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,120
So this message

1458
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,480
wasn't sent by him.

1459
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:46,920
Wait.

1460
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,960
Really?

1461
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,520
Wait, my brain is burning.

1462
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,200
So I...

1463
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:53,760
To be honest,

1464
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,720
I think if this message

1465
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,600
sent by Harry,

1466
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,960
Xinxin, I think he has been behaving

1467
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,360
everything he did was very reasonable

1468
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,480
and normal.

1469
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,760
Actually, I misunderstood someone.

1470
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,800
That misunderstanding is cleared.

1471
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,160
Yes.

1472
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,280
She let it go immediately.

1473
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,920
She suddenly turned around.

1474
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,920
Bada Ridge ski resort

1475
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,520
It's cold.

1476
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,640
Who told you to hold it while falling?

1477
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,480
It's easy to feel.

1478
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,440
I have a friend.

1479
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,800
I'm going skiing today.

1480
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,880
I've asked

1481
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,760
I asked her.

1482
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,520
She likes skiing too.

1483
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,760
So I'm looking forward to it.

1484
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:36,880
Here.

1485
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,280
Why are you so surprised?

1486
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,920
Watch your step.

1487
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,480
It's you.

1488
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,760
It's me. Who do you think it is?

1489
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,240
Are you happy?

1490
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,000
Yes.

1491
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So happy.

1492
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,160
Only one.

1493
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,920
He's so happy.

1494
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,480
Let's get changed.

1495
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,400
Let's go.

1496
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,560
I'll be more careful this time.

1497
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,040
I'll skate two boards first.

1498
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,280
Youth chapter.

1499
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,520
We're really here.

1500
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,600
Karen, let's do this simple one first. Slide.

1501
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,680
Level.

1502
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,840
Get used to it first, right?

1503
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,720
Get used to it.

1504
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,200
Slowly.

1505
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,360
Let's see who falls down today's first fall.

1506
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:51,800
Okay.

1507
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,280
How do you feel now?

1508
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,600
I'm very competitive right now.

1509
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,080
Have you been an interviewer?

1510
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,320
Take a guess.

1511
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,600
You must be laughing.

1512
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,840
I was interviewed anyway.

1513
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,760
You were interviewed.

1514
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,480
Are you happy?

1515
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,680
Yesterday?

1516
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,280
I don't know.

1517
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,280
I don't know.

1518
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,080
Then the day before yesterday?

1519
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,360
What are you asking?

1520
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,680
Look over there.

1521
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,080
I'm thinking if we play that track,

1522
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,600
if we don't go left or right,

1523
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,400
just push up

1524
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,760
Then you'll go down.

1525
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,360
Yes, you'll hit the Internet.

1526
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,560
I won't.

1527
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,560
Last time I played that game too fast.

1528
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,360
I didn't dare to move.

1529
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,080
I'll keep doing this.

1530
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,120
You know?

1531
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:58,760
Then you'd better not play.

1532
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,200
You're a dangerous person.

1533
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,120
Let's go on the snow.

1534
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:08,200
Let's go to the north slope together.

1535
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,800
They look good together.

1536
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,800
You scared me.

1537
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,960
I fell for your beauty.

1538
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,720
I'm sorry.

1539
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,440
I can't hold on for a second.

1540
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,600
I was so fascinated.

1541
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,000
Someone fell over there.

1542
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,960
Don't fall.

1543
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,000
If you fall, I'll make you a request.

1544
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,560
Let me tell you.

1545
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,440
If I fall, you lift me up.

1546
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,720
I'll hold you.

1547
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,400
You're watching the Hokage?

1548
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
Who do you like the most?

1549
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,480
Neji?!

1550
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:49,800
No way!

1551
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,040
I just told Soup that

1552
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,120
I love Neji!

1553
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,560
I can't believe it!

1554
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,000
Yes.

1555
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,880
I saw your expression. I said no.

1556
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,240
Yes, everyone likes it.

1557
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,120
Only three.

1558
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:00,840
The protagonist.

1559
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,560
Good taste.

1560
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,240
Let's talk about an anime.

1561
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,840
The character we both like

1562
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,080
is actually very popular.

1563
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:12,920
After I asked her,

1564
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,760
she immediately answered that it was this role.

1565
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,720
I was really stunned for three seconds.

1566
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,240
I think

1567
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,240
someone would choose this role.

1568
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,800
And just like me.

1569
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,200
So I think that move

1570
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,400
surprised and surprised.

1571
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,160
What a coincidence, right?

1572
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,760
This is too popular.

1573
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,280
Come on.

1574
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,600
Time for level test.

1575
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,240
Three, two, one.

1576
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,320
Let's go.

1577
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,080
They're pretty good.

1578
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,640
They're so smooth.

1579
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,600
Let me teach you a trick.

1580
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,800
Great Waterfall Jutsu!

1581
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,160
Help!

1582
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,840
I'm going to surpass you.

1583
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,720
No way.

1584
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,680
They're playing together.

1585
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,200
They're kids.

1586
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,800
It exceeds

1587
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,280
They're amazing.

1588
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,000
Yes, they skated well.

1589
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,720
We won.

1590
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,680
I was lucky to let you win.

1591
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,960
Take a break.

1592
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,600
It feels so good.

1593
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,720
Hello, you skated on a single board.

1594
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,400
That's amazing.

1595
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,320
Cowboy.

1596
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,560
Can you not wrestle?

1597
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,520
Awesome.

1598
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,640
Are you from Xinjiang?

1599
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:34,480
Right?

1600
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,000
Are you from Xinjiang? I am.

1601
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,720
Do you believe she's from Xinjiang?

1602
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,320
Say something.

1603
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,920
Say something in Vego.

1604
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,040
I love you.

1605
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,240
You're really...

1606
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,440
No, she's from Beijing.

1607
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,400
I had fried eggs with tomato for lunch.

1608
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,160
It's so authentic.

1609
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,960
It's real.

1610
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,280
You're so funny.

1611
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,240
It's so authentic.

1612
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,200
Why don't you have Beijing accent?

1613
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,160
You have that accent.

1614
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,720
If you really want to hear it,

1615
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,040
I'll talk to you like this now.

1616
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,080
They learn acting differently.

1617
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,960
You can hide your accent.

1618
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,160
I can't open my mouth, you know?

1619
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,880
Awesome.

1620
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,520
Amazing.

1621
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,080
Are you skiing

1622
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,080
or this?

1623
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,120
This...

1624
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,680
Be careful.

1625
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,400
Be careful.

1626
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,120
Thank you.

1627
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,800
Don't fall like him.

1628
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,520
Bye. Go ahead.

1629
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,120
Bye.

1630
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,200
She's so cute.

1631
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:34,840
She's so confident.

1632
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,400
I can't do that.

1633
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,080
I like kids like this.

1634
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,000
I really like kids like them.

1635
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,160
"Social bandits."

1636
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,680
We're going to take a cable

1637
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,280
Take the cable.

1638
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,520
I want to ride this cable.

1639
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,680
Will it fall from the cable?

1640
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:46,880
You...

1641
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,680
Give me five yuan before I give you.

1642
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,160
Let's go over there.

1643
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,560
Let it be.

1644
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,080
Okay.

1645
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,080
Are we going to this road or that road?

1646
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,000
He said there was a road.

1647
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,320
A bend and a straight one.

1648
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,000
Which one are you going?

1649
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,920
Let's go straight.

1650
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,680
You really want to do it.

1651
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,520
Do you like it too?

1652
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,280
I like it.

1653
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,640
They can really play together.

1654
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,920
So her brother knows her well.

1655
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,920
If you come out with me again,

1656
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,480
let's play board together.

1657
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,920
It depends on Mr. Tu

1658
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,600
if Xiaoling will give me the chance next time.

1659
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,440
Of course.

1660
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,840
Really?

1661
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,080
What do you want to eat later?

1662
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,320
I chose something that suits you very well.

1663
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,520
You can eat too.

1664
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,160
It feels so good.

1665
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,920
Just tell me if you feel good on a date with me.

1666
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,400
That's great. I'll date you every day.

1667
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,400
Date you every day.

1668
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,440
I have to fight with the landlady when I go back.

1669
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,560
I'm so happy.

1670
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,960
So comfortable.

1671
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,640
Indeed.

1672
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,240
So pretty.

1673
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,720
It's so dark.

1674
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,080
Not bad.

1675
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,840
Why is it so red?

1676
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,040
Right? I told you.

1677
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,440
I'm impressed.

1678
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,640
She's so pretty.

1679
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,000
You're an ENFP.

1680
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,040
Yes.

1681
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,600
We're acting.

1682
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,960
Yes, we are.

1683
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,400
Did you fight with your brothers?

1684
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,120
Ever since you grew up, you've been like this.

1685
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,760
No.

1686
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,760
He's a bit impatient.

1687
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,800
He'll be better now.

1688
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,640
I've been pressing him as his brother

1689
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,880
You're really an art student

1690
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,280
Not like seniors who are postgraduate students

1691
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,280
In fact, at the beginning,

1692
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,760
at the beginning.

1693
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,480
Then why did you learn acting?

1694
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,880
My mom wants me to learn it.

1695
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,960
Do you have many classes?

1696
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,360
Not bad.

1697
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,480
It's all theoretical class.

1698
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,400
No practice.

1699
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,920
So for a social phobia like me,

1700
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,760
very good.

1701
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,200
I thought maybe I'll be a teacher

1702
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,920
I'll really become a teacher.

1703
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,120
So I have to think about it.

1704
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,200
Although I don't like being a teacher,

1705
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,400
but I have to think.

1706
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,000
What are you doing?

1707
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,760
Go.

1708
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,120
Let it be.

1709
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,440
Okay.

1710
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,280
This is nice.

1711
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,080
We're here to enjoy the world of ice.

1712
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,000
That's right.

1713
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,760
Cheer up.

1714
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,920
This is the first time I realized

1715
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,000
The map is really a little sun.

1716
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,440
Yes.

1717
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,280
I used to be like a kid.

1718
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,680
I need to keep balance.

1719
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,400
Take this.

1720
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,680
Don't fall like this.

1721
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,720
Awesome.

1722
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,160
I remember I fell here before.

1723
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,400
Don't you think the building over there

1724
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,080
from here?

1725
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,800
Before I came here,

1726
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,880
before I came here.

1727
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,040
They have the same style as Switzerland.

1728
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:06,840
and move here.

1729
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,600
This kind of building.

1730
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,880
Here, take a photo for you.

1731
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,800
Stand there.

1732
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,040
Don't just slide.

1733
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,800
Don't.

1734
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,960
Cheer up.

1735
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,640
Three, two, one.

1736
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,280
Now you know to take pictures for Xiaoling.

1737
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,120
Let me take a photo for you.

1738
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,120
Watch your hands.

1739
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,760
Don't block the camera.

1740
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,520
I'll kill you.

1741
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,360
Don't fall down.

1742
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,200
I really think he's going down.

1743
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,000
So happy.

1744
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,640
Three, two, one.

1745
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,280
If we don't hurry, we'll be safe.

1746
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,040
Safe?

1747
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,480
I trust you, Xiaoling.

1748
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:47,960
Slow down.

1749
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,240
Be careful.

1750
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:55,600
So high.

1751
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,480
This is steep

1752
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:58,680
Not bad.

1753
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,640
He's good at skating.

1754
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,960
Very cool.

1755
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,200
Good luck.

1756
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,160
Bye.

1757
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,600
I'll wait for you.

1758
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,960
You're so cool.

1759
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,040
I won.

1760
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,440
Do we still skate?

1761
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,200
I'll listen to you.

1762
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:46,960
You always listen to me.

1763
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,720
I don't know.

1764
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,400
I have no opinion.

1765
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,160
I'll listen to you.

1766
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,000
I have no opinion.

1767
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,880
I'll listen to you.

1768
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,720
One more time.

1769
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:51,920
Okay.

1770
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,840
Give her the initiative.

1771
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,280
Yes.

1772
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,360
I feel a little

1773
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,560
at a loss.

1774
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,040
Because in the past,

1775
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,840
I wouldn't be treated like this.

1776
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,840
He really cares about my feelings.

1777
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,200
and what I want.

1778
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,040
I feel warm and happy.

1779
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,880
That's true.

1780
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,280
Look at the camera.

1781
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,360
My stick.

1782
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,040
You scared me.

1783
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:14,600
Hold it.

1784
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,600
Don't take this down

1785
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,440
Don't drop it.

1786
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,040
Throw it away.

1787
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,680
You throw it.

1788
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,160
I laugh so loudly.

1789
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:31,880
No.

1790
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,960
They're together.

1791
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,000
Why do they look like brothers?

1792
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,880
It's like...

1793
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,040
A sense of boyfriend is more mature.

1794
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,640
That's amazing chemistry.

1795
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,040
A man's side.

1796
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,120
We're going to slide that bend.

1797
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,080
Yes.

1798
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,240
Bye.

1799
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,960
You're a fast learner.

1800
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,160
Can we start rushing?

1801
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,400
Get ready.

1802
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,200
Ready.

1803
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,200
Three, two, one, go.

1804
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,400
Why is it a little cute?

1805
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,840
The posture is like a crab.

1806
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,000
A map.

1807
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,400
Ling!

1808
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,560
Ling!

1809
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,080
skiing with him.

1810
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,080
I feel very happy.

1811
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,440
Very free.

1812
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,760
I didn't feel that way before.

1813
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,800
During skiing,

1814
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,320
what makes my heart flutter is

1815
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,880
When I went up the mountain,

1816
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,080
my face was very cold.

1817
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:08,600
At that time,

1818
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,640
she was very vivid.

1819
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,520
She's like Elsa

1820
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,680
Princess Elsa.

1821
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,520
Map.

1822
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,240
Ling.

1823
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,720
He's handsome.

1824
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,880
What's going on today?

1825
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,480
Why is it so upside down?

1826
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,920
That's right.

1827
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,040
Xiao Ling.

1828
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,560
So annoying.

1829
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,160
Give me five.

1830
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,160
I'm tired.

1831
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:44,720
I'm tired.

1832
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,760
Let's go eat.

1833
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,520
What should we eat?

1834
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,440
You'll see.

1835
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,640
A little ambiguous.

1836
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,240
Maybe she's suitable for Xiao Ling.

1837
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,400
She can be influenced.

1838
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,040
Yes.

1839
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,600
Move her emotions and enjoy the moment.

1840
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,920
Relax.

1841
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,880
Yes, the one who makes her relaxed.

1842
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,640
Yes.

1843
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,840
This date is really good.

1844
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,320
It's mainly about young and energetic.

1845
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:07,880
Yes.

1846
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,800
Young and energetic.

1847
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,600
It's perfect for Sancai tea.

1848
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,960
This green tea

1849
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,960
is very pure.

1850
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,720
This Longjing jasmine tea

1851
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,360
looks great.

1852
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:15,960
That's right.

1853
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,160
I love this one.

1854
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,120
The tea is refreshing.

1855
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,000
and jasmine fragrance.

1856
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,880
Let's take it out and have a toast.

1857
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,600
Cheers.

1858
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,400
Fatty and Xinxin's siblings.

1859
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,000
Fatty and Xinxin's sibling agreement.

1860
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,400
Can you wear it?

1861
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,000
I made it.

1862
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,760
I think it suits my outfit.

1863
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,360
You can't button it.

1864
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,040
Is it too tight?

1865
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,080
A little tight.

1866
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:46,880
A little tight. Let me loosen it for you.

1867
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,800
A little tight.

1868
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,920
You're too tight. Just like that kind of iron.

1869
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,000
A welder.

1870
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,800
This one or this one?

1871
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,120
This one.

1872
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,240
This one looks like your hair.

1873
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,560
It's a bit divided.

1874
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,840
This one

1875
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,880
looks like grocery shopping.

1876
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,440
And this one.

1877
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,360
This one looks good.

1878
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,520
Which one? This one.

1879
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,600
Okay.

1880
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:14,720
This is nice.

1881
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,240
This feels so good.

1882
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,600
This is fun.

1883
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,320
Yes.

1884
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,280
Can you carry it?

1885
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:19,920
Yes.

1886
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,520
Are you sure?

1887
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,000
Xinxin, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven.

1888
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,840
Let's get another pot of small ones.

1889
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,960
I don't think the lower ones are enough.

1890
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,920
Okay, it's too heavy. Take it.

1891
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,160
We can put it back

1892
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,480
Then we can go back to pick the wood style.

1893
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:34,920
That's it.

1894
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,800
Pick wood.

1895
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,080
That's it, right?

1896
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,120
I feel like eating buffet.

1897
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,160
Hungry. Vegetarian.

1898
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,000
It feels like a buffet.

1899
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,400
Is our wood enough?

1900
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,680
She asked us to pick some small ones.

1901
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,640
Small ones. Okay.

1902
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,200
Pick some nice wood.

1903
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,480
This is...

1904
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:01,640
duck rack.

1905
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,360
I'm hungry.

1906
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,240
This one.

1907
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,360
My name

1908
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,360
is too big.

1909
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,840
I think the desert hills

1910
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:13,520
Good.

1911
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,040
Guoli.

1912
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,600
If you need to do it now,

1913
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,520
Look at our cotton.

1914
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,400
is ready.

1915
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,360
At this time,

1916
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,640
you need to use this hot melt gun.

1917
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,640
Stick the cotton on it.

1918
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,200
Use the hot melt rubber gun.

1919
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,040
Don't burn your hands.

1920
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,160
Let me do it. I can take a photo

1921
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,480
I can take a photo for you.

1922
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,040
Yes, more.

1923
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,520
Sprinkle this. More.

1924
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,920
Ask.

1925
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:41,920
It's heavy.

1926
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,680
You sprinkle it. I'll sprinkle the light one.

1927
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,000
Too much.

1928
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,720
Too much.

1929
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,240
Sorry.

1930
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,480
Sorry

1931
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,120
The moss should be paved

1932
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,080
Just use this

1933
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:04,640
Yes

1934
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,400
Like squid

1935
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,640
Behind the two fingers

1936
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,200
Do you have two fingers?

1937
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,960
Put it on a finger and a half.

1938
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,920
and put it higher.

1939
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,680
Isn't that good?

1940
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,960
You dropped it like this.

1941
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,680
Two hands.

1942
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,680
Be formal.

1943
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,800
Press it.

1944
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,480
Like this?

1945
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,480
Yes, you make it flat first.

1946
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,800
It's almost done.

1947
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,000
No.

1948
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,200
Place the whole floor first.

1949
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,040
Got it.

1950
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,720
We just need to increase the rest later, right?

1951
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,960
Yes.

1952
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,640
I really want to eat squid

1953
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,280
I'm so hungry.

1954
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,120
Is it too much?

1955
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,280
I think we should balance it.

1956
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,560
Are we artistic?

1957
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,960
Yes.

1958
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:52,640
And here

1959
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,840
Just make it a little higher

1960
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,720
I really want to eat squid.

1961
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,560
You can see the level when you sit down.

1962
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:01,840
Right?

1963
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,760
A little ugly.

1964
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,800
I think it's pretty.

1965
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,800
It needs to be solid.

1966
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,080
Give it to me and I'll press it.

1967
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,200
Grab more.

1968
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,560
It's not generous.

1969
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,520
Let me show you.

1970
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,279
You're done with this?

1971
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:21,760
Yes.

1972
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,479
Okay.

1973
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:24,080
Then we can

1974
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,479
clean the soil

1975
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:26,560
the roots of plants.

1976
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:27,920
Go ahead.

1977
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,120
You want to take it out?

1978
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:33,880
It'll be gone if you pull it out like this.

1979
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,359
Like combing hair.

1980
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:37,800
Let's remove

1981
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,840
remove it first.

1982
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,680
Like this.

1983
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,920
Yes, take your time.

1984
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,840
It's clean

1985
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,040
Pretty a little.

1986
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,279
You look like washing vegetables.

1987
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,279
I hope you can give me some beautiful photos.

1988
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,160
The moment I pull out the grass.

1989
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,200
Let me take a photo for you.

1990
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,840
You look so funny.

1991
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,439
Tell me who you want to work with.

1992
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,760
Can't you see what's inside?

1993
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,920
Flowers.

1994
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,520
Like this.

1995
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,080
So you're here

1996
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,560
with Hua?

1997
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,479
Hua.

1998
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,560
Fatty, let's talk about

1999
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,880
whom do you want to date?

2000
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,640
I want to go on a date with Hua.

2001
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:52,600
We can

2002
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,640
keep talking.

2003
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,200
Flowers and drawings are the easiest things I get along with.

2004
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,120
More relaxed than you.

2005
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,000
Yes, you always scold me.

2006
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,600
Hua is always encouraging me.

2007
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,600
to complement each other.

2008
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,560
I think we can plant another one.

2009
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,960
Guolifang.

2010
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:17,840
A little smaller.

2011
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:20,880
How small?

2012
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,080
So cute.

2013
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,280
I think this one looks like me.

2014
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,000
You're not that thick.

2015
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,800
and dense.

2016
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,920
They are really...

2017
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,080
That split is more like you.

2018
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,240
Okay.

2019
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,440
You make the moss.

2020
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,360
I'm out of gloves.

2021
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,960
I'll do it all, right?

2022
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,960
You picked them?

2023
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,000
You didn't even move.

2024
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,720
You chose it?

2025
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,560
I might move if it's a boy.

2026
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,280
Okay.

2027
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:57,800
Okay.

2028
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,880
I chose a girl with strong ears.

2029
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,080
Isn't it similar?

2030
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:03,920
Why am I not here?

2031
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,080
No fatty.

2032
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,680
No fatty.

2033
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,080
Not many boys.

2034
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,720
It's mainly not fattened.

2035
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,520
It doesn't suit you.

2036
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,200
Okay.

2037
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,560
So pretty.

2038
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,720
I made this.

2039
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,400
It's not bad.

2040
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,200
Unbelievable. We made this.

2041
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,000
The name of the ecosystem is

2042
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,960
Beautiful and Po Niu.

2043
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,360
We have a dog now.

2044
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,720
So we decided on this theme.

2045
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,760
Actually, I've been looking for

2046
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,800
who are not fat.

2047
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,320
We can do it.

2048
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,800
I think this product has eight points.

2049
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,680
The final result is good.

2050
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,400
The remaining two points.

2051
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,200
for Hua.

2052
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,120
I hope she will go with Fatty next time.

2053
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,080
Please.

2054
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:52,560
Okay.

2055
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,640
It'll be different if you come in.

2056
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,920
It's quite ceremonial.

2057
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,240
Yes.

2058
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,040
This restaurant is good.

2059
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:00,880
It's good.

2060
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,560
Not bad.

2061
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,240
You ordered.

2062
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,080
What a delicate person.

2063
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,160
Drink some water to warm yourself up.

2064
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,760
Drink all the coldness just now.

2065
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,280
Thank you.

2066
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,120
Salad.

2067
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,560
Do you eat grass normally?

2068
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,360
I don't usually eat much.

2069
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,480
Do you eat a lot of grass?

2070
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,560
Not much.

2071
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,640
No need.

2072
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,240
When he was having dinner with Xinxin, he suffered a lot.

2073
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:35,800
Yes.

2074
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:37,800
Do you think

2075
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,240
what do you think of

2076
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,840
in the past two dates?

2077
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,880
I think

2078
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,640
I have a lot in common with Harry.

2079
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,280
And I like something similar.

2080
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:56,680
So

2081
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,400
There are many topics.

2082
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,480
And with Fatty,

2083
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,160
I think

2084
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,400
we can play together.

2085
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,800
But I don't think we have much to talk about.

2086
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,080
What about me?

2087
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:11,880
I dare to ask.

2088
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:12,440
Yes.

2089
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,200
What about you?

2090
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,760
is different

2091
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:16,760
You have to...

2092
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,080
Okay.

2093
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:19,680
Let me say mine first.

2094
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:20,640
I'll tell you later.

2095
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:21,760
How?

2096
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,680
I think Xin and I are more alike.

2097
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,280
siblings.

2098
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,520
Tata and I

2099
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,400
I think when we

2100
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,120
in the activity,

2101
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,960
we can

2102
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,040
to cooperate with each other.

2103
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,720
But I think after we go back to the house,

2104
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,160
I felt

2105
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,120
talk much.

2106
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,320
I don't think we'll communicate as much as we do.

2107
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:49,480
What about me?

2108
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,160
It's finally time.

2109
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,240
Put down your fork, map.

2110
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,560
Okay.

2111
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,880
I'm very vengeful.

2112
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,440
It's okay.

2113
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:58,920
I'm not weak either.

2114
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:00,800
Okay.

2115
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,360
So when you skied today,

2116
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,200
when you were skiing today?

2117
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,200
I thought the slope wouldn't be that steep.

2118
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,960
When I fell down,

2119
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,200
my brain crashed.

2120
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,840
I said no.

2121
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:20,480
What about you?

2122
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,320
I'm more...

2123
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,600
I was shocked.

2124
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,600
Delicious.

2125
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,440
I can think of the person

2126
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,480
you would be very happy

2127
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,480
I'm sure you'll be happy.

2128
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,320
Yes, that's him.

2129
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,200
He sat on that chair.

2130
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,200
He was like this.

2131
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,360
I'll choose this person for you.

2132
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,320
I think you'll get along very happily.

2133
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,720
No matter who I think is better,

2134
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,200
I think it's more important

2135
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,440
is more important.

2136
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,600
I said OK.

2137
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,400
Let me see who it is.

2138
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,160
Did you guess it was me?

2139
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,000
Yes.

2140
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,320
Really?

2141
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:53,800
Yes.

2142
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:54,600
So amazing.

2143
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,120
On my way here,

2144
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:57,720
I knew it.

2145
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,880
Before this,

2146
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,360
you were basically older than you.

2147
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,920
My personal relationship experience.

2148
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,480
The boys I've met

2149
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,200
are older than me.

2150
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:12,960
What about you?

2151
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,120
Same.

2152
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,920
You're all older than you.

2153
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,120
Almost.

2154
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:17,960
Same

2155
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,080
So you like your type

2156
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,240
I can't say which type I like

2157
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,080
I really

2158
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:24,800
I feel...

2159
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,920
Feeling? Yes.

2160
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,200
I don't think the type is reliable.

2161
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:28,880
Maybe.

2162
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,280
Yes.

2163
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,240
Just be happy.

2164
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,440
Which time do you think you are the happiest?

2165
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,640
Of course today.

2166
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,000
Why?

2167
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,880
I can go skiing and eat with Tu.

2168
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,240
What about you?

2169
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,080
What do you think? Of course.

2170
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,200
Why?

2171
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,480
Because I'm very happy.

2172
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,000
Didn't you see

2173
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,480
wearing dark clothes today?

2174
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,160
I think so.

2175
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,720
You used to have more blue.

2176
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,080
She noticed the color of his clothes.

2177
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:12,960
I'm different.

2178
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,320
A different me.

2179
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,960
Are you a mutant Sakura?

2180
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,880
What do you think

2181
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,840
makes you feel

2182
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,080
not sincere.

2183
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,840
Tell me a specific behavior first.

2184
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,800
When you're with her, you should...

2185
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,080
Yes, I can't.

2186
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,000
I can't stand it.

2187
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,080
When I was skiing,

2188
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,000
you asked me

2189
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
if you want to skate again.

2190
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,040
I can say whatever you want.

2191
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:41,800
Then you say you decide.

2192
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,680
I think it's good.

2193
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,120
Do we still skate?

2194
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,160
I'll listen to you.

2195
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,080
Listen to you, always listen to me.

2196
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:47,800
I don't know.

2197
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,560
I have no opinion.

2198
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,240
I'll listen to you.

2199
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,040
I have no opinion.

2200
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:50,960
I'll listen to you.

2201
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:51,880
I have my own opinion.

2202
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:52,560
I just...

2203
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,560
I can do whatever you do.

2204
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,080
I think it's good.

2205
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,360
But he still said he wanted my opinion.

2206
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,440
Then I felt

2207
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,120
he respect me.

2208
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,680
Although I said I'm not

2209
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,320
not very strong,

2210
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,680
But if he doesn't ask me

2211
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,400
what he decided to do,

2212
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,440
I will be unhappy.

2213
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,080
Although I don't have to decide,

2214
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,520
but you can't take the right.

2215
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:13,560
Luckily, I asked.

2216
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,280
She cares about that.

2217
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,080
Yes.

2218
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,840
You know what?

2219
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,560
Luckily I asked.

2220
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
My back feels cold.

2221
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,840
Like this.

2222
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:23,920
I understand.

2223
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,240
It's very subjective.

2224
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,240
For example, I went to dinner with my friends.

2225
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,840
And I play with my friends.

2226
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,640
Every time he eats,

2227
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,720
he would ask me what I want to eat.

2228
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,360
I'll say anything.

2229
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,080
Watch out.

2230
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:34,760
Then he really ordered it.

2231
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,480
I don't care.

2232
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,240
Because he knew he would ask me

2233
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,160
he would ask me.

2234
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,280
Or I'll feel uncomfortable.

2235
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,880
And I'll say anything

2236
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,480
I can say whatever they want.

2237
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:44,600
Then they come up and eat.

2238
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,080
They don't ask me what I want to eat.

2239
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,240
Yes.

2240
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,360
You can try it next time.

2241
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,240
For example, skiing just now.

2242
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,840
Do you want to do it again?

2243
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,120
You should say that.

2244
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,480
Do you think I want to do it again?

2245
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,560
Don't do this.

2246
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:56,800
Like this.

2247
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,000
Do you think I want to do it again?

2248
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:58,880
You should ask him with a smile.

2249
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,240
It sounds weird.

2250
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,640
Which dish do you think

2251
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,160
is the best?

2252
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:07,920
I said three, two, one.

2253
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,080
All of them.

2254
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,880
Does it count?

2255
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,120
Tacit test.

2256
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,480
I wanted to say it together.

2257
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,000
Because I think

2258
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,560
you will choose the same one as me.

2259
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:16,600
So I want to say,

2260
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,360
if the dessert counts.

2261
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,600
So I added a prelude.

2262
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,840
All the dishes are counted.

2263
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,680
And the rest will be ranked second and all meat.

2264
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,680
You like sweet food, right?

2265
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,160
No sweetness, no love.

2266
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,680
No sweetness, no meat.

2267
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,280
Got it.

2268
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:33,720
One more.

2269
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:37,960
You do it cool.

2270
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,200
Try it. Cool.

2271
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,480
Like this.

2272
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,640
Choose your eyebrows. Cool.

2273
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,560
Let me take a photo for you.

2274
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,760
I'll take one like this.

2275
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,280
Like this.

2276
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,680
I'm really stupid.

2277
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,880
So silly.

2278
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,880
Both of them are childish.

2279
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,480
And naturally.

2280
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,160
It's not easy.

2281
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,280
It's natural.

2282
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,280
Like this. Like this.

2283
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,280
I won't laugh.

2284
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,560
Today is the happiest day

2285
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,160
in my room.

2286
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,680
I didn't expect that he chose one.

2287
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,280
relatively,

2288
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,240
some Western elements in it.

2289
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,320
I think it's very careful.

2290
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,400
When I came out of the ski resort,

2291
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,200
I found it was cold.

2292
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,680
We didn't wear gloves.

2293
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,480
He will go back.

2294
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:34,760
And he'll be ready.

2295
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,040
to wear gloves.

2296
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,640
So I think he is a very meticulous person

2297
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,840
very meticulous.

2298
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,320
This is a rare quality.

2299
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:43,600
I think both of us

2300
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,600
Eating or topic, tacit understanding,

2301
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,920
I think we are very similar.

2302
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,280
I think in front of her,

2303
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,520
in front of her.

2304
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,200
At the same time,

2305
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,920
my happiness can touch her.

2306
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,120
I think this is the best way to get along with her.

2307
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,120
Full marks.

2308
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,360
9.9 points.

2309
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,200
And 0.1.

2310
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,360
I think it's for the future date.

2311
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,120
is more satisfying.

2312
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,360
Really.

2313
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,600
It doesn't feel like he's reciting a script.

2314
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,760
He's more natural.

2315
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,040
Yes.

2316
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,520
His growth is surprising.

2317
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,880
I think Xiaoling has made him progress.

2318
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,920
She went to bed late last night.

2319
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:20,120
Hua came to see me.

2320
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,200
to comfort you.

2321
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,960
Yes, talk to me.

2322
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,400
And...

2323
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,000
Do you think you need comfort?

2324
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,160
Yes.

2325
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,280
I believe the fifth minute

2326
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,400
Xinxin, the fifth minute we went in,

2327
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,840
we voted for that message.

2328
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:40,960
Flower.

2329
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:41,320
Flower.

2330
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:43,880
Yes.

2331
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,600
At first sight,

2332
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,400
I voted for Hua. I gave it to her in a second.

2333
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,000
Xinxin really likes flowers.

2334
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,280
She's kind of friendly.

2335
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,440
Are you friendly to the spicy pork

2336
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,800
or to her?

2337
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,080
She speaks like a Pu.

2338
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,720
and kind.

2339
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,360
To be honest,

2340
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,400
I found that

2341
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,440
I had a chance

2342
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,760
to chat with Xiaoling alone.

2343
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,200
But I don't

2344
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,520
to ask that much.

2345
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,400
She's a little...

2346
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,040
I think you two

2347
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,840
have similar growth environment.

2348
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,000
experience

2349
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
and everything.

2350
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,960
And she

2351
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,720
is more like a brother.

2352
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,920
First of all, this is her personality.

2353
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,040
Yes, she has a good personality.

2354
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:27,680
Yes.

2355
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,560
I'm talking to her like a lesson.

2356
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,480
Yes, these two.

2357
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,400
She will do this.

2358
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,000
It's like answering questions.

2359
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,520
When you talk,

2360
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,480
when you talk.

2361
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,200
So you know what?

2362
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,640
Yesterday,

2363
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,760
I realized

2364
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,360
the strength of a brother is so big.

2365
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,440
I never cared about this before.

2366
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,480
You're really good at intervention.

2367
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,760
Like a wall.

2368
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,480
Yes.

2369
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,120
Haven't you noticed that

2370
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,520
in our growth?

2371
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,360
You just think that you didn't do anything.

2372
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,680
But actually,

2373
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,360
you did a great job.

2374
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,480
In my relationship,

2375
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,560
I found

2376
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,520
So yesterday,

2377
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,520
I thought

2378
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:15,000
we should communicate about this.

2379
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,680
I was too anxious.

2380
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,600
In the past,

2381
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,760
I think

2382
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,160
it's like how we get along

2383
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,640
the other four siblings

2384
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,560
are good or

2385
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,840
we can learn these things.

2386
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,240
especially the ability to speak properly.

2387
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,520
I think

2388
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,640
We can communicate if we talk nicely.

2389
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,960
You're more impatient than me.

2390
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,440
Yes, I am.

2391
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,960
Me too.

2392
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,240
When we talk,

2393
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,680
when we talk.

2394
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,800
Yeah.

2395
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,600
It will become

2396
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,640
get excited.

2397
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,360
And a small thing

2398
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,680
It seems to be bigger.

2399
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,240
But it's just a big decibel.

2400
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,640
But it's a small matter.

2401
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,480
I think the soup and Xiaoling

2402
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,520
When they talk,

2403
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,080
I have no choice.

2404
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,160
Slow.

2405
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:56,960
If you talk to me like this,

2406
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,640
if you talk to me like this.

2407
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,800
Their communication is like...

2408
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,000
Come here. Let's talk.

2409
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,560
My communication is brazen.

2410
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,880
But I think

2411
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,400
I've done well recently.

2412
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,800
I gave myself eight points.

2413
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,240
I got eight points for myself.

2414
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,680
The closer we are,

2415
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,600
the harder it is to talk properly.

2416
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,720
So,

2417
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,440
how do you think we should change it?

2418
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,120
Do you think

2419
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,000
there are three elements to communicate.

2420
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:29,880
For example,

2421
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,160
The first one is respect.

2422
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,720
who is actually very close.

2423
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,840
He's not paying attention to what he says.

2424
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,240
Yes.

2425
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,400
It's because you subconsciously think

2426
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,480
how you can hurt him.

2427
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,240
It has

2428
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,760
between you.

2429
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,560
So what is respect?

2430
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,640
Respect is respect.

2431
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,120
He has his own behaviour

2432
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:47,800
and thinking mode.

2433
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:48,120
For example,

2434
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:49,520
you are a person who is very anxious.

2435
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,520
You have to respect him.

2436
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,320
He may be a meticulous person.

2437
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,680
Respecting him is an independent personality.

2438
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,920
Second,

2439
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:57,520
sincerity.

2440
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,520
What is sincerity?

2441
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,280
You need to be emotional.

2442
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,200
Don't express

2443
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,160
in emotions.

2444
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,640
These are subjective

2445
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,600
hurt each other.

2446
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,760
The third one is

2447
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,320
clearly expresses their needs.

2448
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,000
The more you make a detour,

2449
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,400
the more you describe it,

2450
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,560
the more unclear and unclear.

2451
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,040
Huang Zihong, what do you think?

2452
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,760
The communication in a intimate relationship.

2453
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,960
Actually, it's true

2454
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:24,920
That's true.

2455
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:25,880
For example,

2456
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,560
I usually go back during Chinese New Year.

2457
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,920
or when I have work,

2458
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:29,960
when I go back to Chengdu,

2459
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,360
when I return to Chengdu.

2460
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,760
That's great.

2461
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:33,640
That's good.

2462
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:33,920
It's you.

2463
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,000
When we meet often,

2464
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,200
Yes, you stay at home for a month.

2465
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,440
basically from half a month,

2466
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,560
there will be various

2467
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,360
in our family.

2468
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,200
Yes.

2469
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,320
Because your mom

2470
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,760
because of your mom.

2471
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,320
Yes.

2472
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,240
I saw a documentary before.

2473
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,080
It was about a foreign

2474
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,400
a speaker.

2475
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,760
and a debater.

2476
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:54,400
He said,

2477
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,120
how to win the debate.

2478
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,120
It's not about using words

2479
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,120
but to listen to your opponent.

2480
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,000
That's right.

2481
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:02,320
I think

2482
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,960
is this also suitable

2483
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,800
a close relationship or a family relationship?

2484
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,840
we can analyze

2485
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,240
why they have such emotions.

2486
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,320
Why did they say such things?

2487
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,080
your patience

2488
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,800
more patience.

2489
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,280
So I think

2490
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,640
this is the charm of "Love Sisters".

2491
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,520
I've been feeling it today.

2492
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,240
We kept saying

2493
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,720
that there's always someone who loves you.

2494
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,920
I suddenly want to become

2495
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,040
no matter when you are,

2496
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:28,560
you have to believe

2497
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,120
someone will always protect you.

2498
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:30,920
Yes.

2499
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,200
Because I think

2500
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,240
compared to love,

2501
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,280
it's more like

2502
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,800
he will feel more like

2503
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,800
protecting you

2504
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:37,760
and protecting you.

2505
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,640
It's so nice.

2506
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,160
Maybe this is the meaning of protecting a date.

2507
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,200
Protecting is the instinct of blood.

2508
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,120
Yes.

2509
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,200
In the next episode,

2510
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,920
Team 3 will protect the date.

2511
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,200
Can we have fun

2512
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,000
with your brother?

2513
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,120
where other people's love will go.

2514
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,400
Let's look forward to the next episode.

2515
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,200
Let's sing "Love Sisters".

2516
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,800
Let love double.

2517
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,080
Hua.

2518
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,520
I want to talk to you.

2519
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,120
What's wrong? Tell me.

2520
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,640
I just asked you how was your date.

2521
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,400
I think he keeps changing.

2522
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,520
I don't want to

2523
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,280
to be alone.

2524
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,720
It's normal

2525
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,200
to change your mind.

2526
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,320
Well,

2527
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,120
Are you nervous?

2528
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,680
I'm not nervous. I'm thinking about how to say it.

2529
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,080
Okay, I don't feel anything.

2530
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:23,720
Say no more.

2531
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,120
Alright, stop it.

2532
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,480
I need the Mirror House

2533
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:28,800
to have a conversation.

2534
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,560
In the small house.

2535
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,280

2536
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,080
Who are you the best to?

2537
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,560
Love at first sight or...

2538
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,200
Do you think

2539
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,320
a mature person?

2540
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,680
Don't weigh the pros and cons.

2541
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,400
Is it that long?
