It feels like we'll have some wild wine.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It's like drinking wild wine

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,239

00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,039
It's all your fault.

10
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,760
He looks disappointed.

11
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,080
He doesn't even want to talk to me.

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,200
When I was talking to Tae-seo,

13
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,160
you were more like siblings.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,120
And I heard the soup.

15
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,960
How was your talk?

16
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,240
He might not want to talk today.

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,720
His eyes are red because

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,440
makes me feel that he's broken.

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,120
I think he is a very sincere person.

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,479
Do you know

21
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,240
After I sent the message,

22
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,360
I looked through the Book of Answer.

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,200
I was surprised.

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,920
Is it because I said

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,360
Was this text correct?

26
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,160
Then it shows

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,800
it will bring you more trouble.

28
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,840
Trouble?

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Creater, please.

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,520
You're here too.

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,320
Yes cooking

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,360
What are you cooking

33
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,200
Is there anything to eat here?

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,680
Steamed rolls.

35
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,040
I'll make some glutinous rice balls.

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,480
and make some glutinous rice balls.

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,120
Are you really going to make me breakfast tomorrow?

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,160
I have no food.

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,640
I made it myself today.

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,840
Okay.

41
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,760
You spoil your sister, OK?

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,800
Okay.

43
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,480
Let's get started.

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
I want to eat.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,480
I'll give you

46
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,600
custom-made.

47
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,040
I want glutinous rice balls.

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,200
How many?

49
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
Four.

50
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,880
Just four.

51
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,800
The bird's stomach.

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,360
Luckily, I didn't say it subconsciously.

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,240
something else.

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,720
Then don't.

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,360
I won't.

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,320
how to cook glutinous rice balls.

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,560
The water is boiling and put it in.

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
How to cook glutinous rice balls?

59
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,200
After the water boils,

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,120
This is my first time answering this question.

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,800
Can I help you?

62
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,360
No need.

63
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
Really?

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,360
It's your turn to wash the dishes today.

65
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,000
Sure.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,160
So I'll try to make a lot of bowls.

67
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,480
Then cook more.

68
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
Make more dishes.

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,560
Don't wash while cooking.

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,200
Do you hear me?

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,920
Put it there if you can.

72
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,760
Come on, test expert.

73
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,680
Can you try it for me?

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,920
How?

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,120
Use fork.

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,160
It's hot.

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,040
Can't you blow on it?

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,160
Come here. Take the fork.

79
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,880
You don't have a name?

80
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,880
I'll call you tomorrow.

81
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,400
Let's play basketball.

82
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,400
I texted Xin yesterday.

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,480
After getting to know each other these days,

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,200
I think both Xinxin and Harry

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,240
are very obvious.

86
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,720
That's what I think.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
After all,

88
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,720
all the girls are good.

89
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,840
I also want to know

90
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,280
and get to know each other better.

91
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,000
If you don't get in touch with someone,

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,840
you'll miss it, right?

93
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,280
Do you want some?

94
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,040
Glutinous rice balls.

95
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,159
What are you making?

96
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,560
I'll cook whatever you want to eat.

97
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,840
I want dumplings.

98
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,520
Okay, I'll make it for you.

99
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,520
What do you want to eat?

100
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,320
Is it lunch now

101
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,560
It's fast food time

102
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,520
Time for fast food.

103
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,920
Do you want dumplings?

104
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,000
Sure.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,640
Don't eat dumplings.

106
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,040
You just had dumplings yesterday.

107
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Make more.

108
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,480
We are starving.

109
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,320
We are just hungry.

110
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,000
Glutinous rice balls.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Anything else?

112
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,520
I'll steam some rolls for you.

113
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,280
What else?

114
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
Tell me what you want to eat.

115
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,520
Tell me.

116
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,000
What do you want to eat?

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,760
What do you want to eat?

118
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Look.

119
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,520
I want to make sandwiches.

120
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,280
Or you can eat it.

121
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,159
some traditional projects like ours.

122
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,120
What filling is this?

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,840
Sesame.

124
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,080
Try it.

125
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,120
You don't like it, right?

126
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,720
Fine.

127
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,200
Try it.

128
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,880
We eat fast food every day.

129
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,040
I'll make a good meal today

130
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,720
Who will cook today?

131
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,159
Or us?

132
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,400
Because we didn't cook yesterday.

133
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,800
But we have to wash the dishes today

134
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,440
I have to cook and wash dishes today.

135
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,000
It's okay. I'll wash the dishes later.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,080
It's okay.

137
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
Then I'll eat this.

138
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,760
Who cooked it?

139
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,000
I cooked it.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
Of course. Who cooked it?

141
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,640
You want it, Xin?

142
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,880
Are you

143
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,760
Is Su awake?

144
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,000
I've sent her the food.

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,360
Take the food.

146
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
I just started to put on makeup

147
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,600
Take an egg.

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,520
How many do you want?

149
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,760
Two.

150
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,200
That's all. One.

151
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,159
There's more in the fridge.

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,320
Three are fine.

153
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,920
Two for him.

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
I really...

155
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,720
Can you

156
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
a cup of coffee?

157
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Coffee. Yes.

158
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,240
Latte.

159
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,440
Add some milk in Americano.

160
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
It's just latte.

161
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,560
But I think that granny is weird.

162
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,200
Stop drinking.

163
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,520
You're so annoying.

164
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,960
Really?

165
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,880
Okay.

166
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,840
Hello.

167
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,600
What breakfast do you want?

168
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,840
Tu Tu made glutinous rice balls. Thank you.

169
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,480
Let's eat. It's not cold.

170
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,040
You eat glutinous rice balls with chopsticks.

171
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,440
What are you using?

172
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,640
We use spoons.

173
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
It seems not the same place.

174
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,039
Let me take a spoon.

175
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,760
We all take chopsticks.

176
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,280
Thank you.

177
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,680
There happens to be black glutinous rice and black sesame.

178
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,240
So I chose black sesame for you.

179
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,640
Thank you.

180
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,280
I bought the rice.

181
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,000
I was really happy after the picture came back.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,680
Tu won't make me envy others.

183
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,440
I will have my own breakfast.

184
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,440
I think he wants to make up for it.

185
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,000
Maybe he didn't receive his message the other day.

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,920
He didn't want me to be disappointed.

187
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,320
Yes.

188
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,560
So I'm quite touched.

189
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,760
The rice is delicious.

190
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,480
Do you want some?

191
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,800
Sure.

192
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,000
Thank you.

193
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,520
Hello.

194
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,160
Have you had breakfast?

195
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,760
Not yet.

196
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,720
Xiao Ling, have you had breakfast?

197
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,440
No.

198
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,640
What do you want to eat?

199
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,040
Eat whatever you have.

200
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,080
Sandwich.

201
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,920
Sure, no problem.

202
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,680
OK?

203
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,760
Yes, thank you.

204
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,160
I'll fry more eggs.

205
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,200
My good roommate in China.

206
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,680
Xiao Ling.

207
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,560
Thank you.

208
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,840
I'm so happy.

209
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,720
Yes.

210
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm happy again.

211
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,040
Bowl.

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,400
Why aren't you wearing gloves?

213
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,920
I'm not used to wearing gloves.

214
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,800
You go this way and I'll wash.

215
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,960
Okay.

216
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,400
Tae-seo, wash the dishes.

217
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,560
No, I washed the pagoda.

218
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,280
I just washed the rest.

219
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,480
I texted him.

220
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,640
I texted you.

221
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,960
Why didn't I?

222
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,520
Boys.

223
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,000
It's going to crack.

224
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
Make a decision carefully.

225
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,160
Who are you sending it to?

226
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,840
Guess. I won't tell you.

227
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,760
I know who it is.

228
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,520
She's the girl

229
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,480
I want to know more about.

230
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,800
I didn't think too much.

231
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,760
I sent it right away.

232
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,280
Are you done?

233
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,600
So soon?

234
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
Just name.

235
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,000
Boys make choices.

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
When inviting girls to a date,

237
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,080
Because I think

238
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,040
is more difficult than a heart message.

239
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
After all, it's a big date.

240
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,960
Will you choose Susu firmly?

241
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,840
or

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,160
try to contact other girls?

243
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,960
I'm done.

244
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,680
Are you still thinking

245
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,840
I have a clear goal.

246
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,600
But I dare not send it.

247
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,480
I'm not hesitating.

248
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,640
I'm afraid today.

249
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,800
I was hesitant and scared.

250
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,400
Afraid of being rejected.

251
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,240
I really want to escape from this place.

252
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,360
I'm done.

253
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,160
It's too hard.

254
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,200
I want to get to know Xiaoling as soon as possible.

255
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,520
But I instinctively

256
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,280
to talk to Hua.

257
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,720
with Hua.

258
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,200
So when I texted her today,

259
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,760
I was struggling.

260
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,840
Forget it. Don't think too much.

261
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,360
Can you play Jay Chou's song?

262
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,320
I don't know how to make soup.

263
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,960
Soup party.

264
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,360
Yes.

265
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,320
Who plays well?

266
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,160
I don't know.

267
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,320
I don't know him.

268
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,360
Okay.

269
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes.

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,760
Okay.

271
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,400
Got it in a second.

272
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,640
Come on.

273
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,040
Let's play Yuno. I won.

274
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,920
What do you mean?

275
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,760
Is there any punishment?

276
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,800
You decide.

277
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,160
Ask each other a question.

278
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,600
Sure.

279
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,320
But what happens in the house

280
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,720
Okay.

281
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,160
Okay.

282
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,560
There's no blue one.

283
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,200
Okay.

284
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,200
Okay, go ahead.

285
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,720
Who did you send the message to on the first day?

286
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,640
You said before you came in.

287
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,120
Of course it was my first night here.

288
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,680
I sent it to you.

289
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,360
Really?

290
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,400
Thank you.

291
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,560
Now we are

292
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,160
The winner can ask the loser.

293
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,600
What happened in the house

294
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,480
is what he wants to know the most.

295
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,400
Yes, I want to know that.

296
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,720
Don't you want to ask me about Huahua?

297
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,880
Don't you want to ask me about Xinxin?

298
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,800
Yes.

299
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,320
What do you want to ask me?

300
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,200
Okay, don't let Xiaoling hear it.

301
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,280
Why?

302
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,600
Why is he hiding it?

303
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,040
Yes.

304
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,720
I need to get some information.

305
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
What are you doing? A privilege?

306
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,120
After so many days of contact,

307
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,360
no girl in your room

308
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
in your heart?

309
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,600
Got it.

310
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,760
I think there's a tie.

311
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Together.

312
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,120
You're so loud.

313
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,480
You're tied first.

314
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,240
That Linhe Tower.

315
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,040
Okay.

316
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,520
I mean it.

317
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm not lying.

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,720
Okay.

319
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,640
Share it.

320
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,600
There's nothing to share.

321
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,280
My voice was so loud and scary.

322
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,120
I think there's a tie.

323
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,760
You can't ask. No.

324
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,120
We can't discuss it in public.

325
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,400
Come on. Be my buyer.

326
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,160
Let's go.

327
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,960
It's okay. Let's fight one-on-one.

328
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,640
Okay.

329
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,720
You two pick one.

330
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,240
This one.

331
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,000
I have no choice. I don't have that card.

332
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,880
Come on, ask him.

333
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,760
Let me ask you.

334
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,560
Come on.

335
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,240
What do you want to ask?

336
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,520
Of course, you didn't win.

337
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,440
What are you playing?

338
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Talk to him.

339
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,280
Join us.

340
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,960
Come on.

341
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,680
Since you entered the house,

342
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,600
since you entered the house?

343
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,960
So far, right?

344
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
I think so.

345
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Flower.

346
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,880
After getting close,

347
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,840
OK.

348
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,200
You're back.

349
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,640
He's shy.

350
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,960
I asked a very normal question.

351
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,640
Do you want to play?

352
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,440
Come on.

353
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,360
If there are more people,

354
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,280
let's do this.

355
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,240
First, ask second.

356
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,000
Second, ask the third.

357
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,720
Third, ask the fourth.

358
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,720
Zhi Dong.

359
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,760
She came to me yesterday and said

360
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,200
Anyway,

361
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,360
I think I'm 550.

362
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,840
I think

363
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
to make a choice.

364
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,440
It's over.

365
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,000
Look at the last card left.

366
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,480
One, two, three, four, five.

367
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,520
One question.

368
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
Okay.

369
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,800
Let's go.

370
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,560
It's nothing.

371
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,800
Soup and Susu.

372
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,080
Are you going both ways now?

373
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,080
You asked me how I feel, right?

374
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,480
Yes.

375
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,280
I think so.

376
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,400
Come on.

377
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,600
Based on your feeling,

378
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,760
who do you think Tata is interested in now?

379
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,680
I think she will choose.

380
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,480
Harry.

381
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,040
Because I think

382
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,080
they might know more about each other.

383
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,280
Now you may be far from the tower.

384
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,720
Or Xin?

385
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,680
Tata.

386
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,000
We haven't...

387
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,800
We are already

388
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,400
friends.

389
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,800
Yes.

390
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,720
Very good.

391
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,240
Really?

392
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,280
I didn't notice.

393
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
You just found out?

394
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,000
I thought you still had feelings for her.

395
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,720
No.

396
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,280
Right now,

397
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,640
You don't know what's more exciting.

398
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,240
I don't know what's more exciting.

399
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,680
Yes.

400
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,880
Xin, do you want to play?

401
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,280
Yes.

402
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,760
Okay.

403
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,760
Turn red.

404
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,320
Okay.

405
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,240
Red.

406
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,680
Really.

407
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,720
One, two, three, four, five, six.

408
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,120
Choose.

409
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,720
OK.

410
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,560
Let's go, Xinxin.

411
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,640
Ask me.

412
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,600
Where to ask?

413
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,960
Just here.

414
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,120
Who did you text yesterday?

415
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,560
Harry.

416
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
Okay, that's all.

417
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,440
What a boring question.

418
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,680
She said my question was boring.

419
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,160
After your date with Susu yesterday,

420
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,960
Except Susu,

421
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,040
do you want to

422
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,480
do you want to know more?

423
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,280
Actually, I want to know.

424
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,040
Because

425
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,800
All

426
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,760
Because I've never touched

427
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,400
First,

428
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,840
except Susu.

429
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,000
I think it's Hua Hua.

430
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,840
What should I ask?

431
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,000
Go ahead.

432
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,840
You?

433
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,000
You've been staying here for so many days.

434
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,960
all the boys

435
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,600
who are you most interested in?

436
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,360
I'm sweating.

437
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,640
Why is it red again?

438
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I'm warm again.

439
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,520
The questions they asked are tricky.

440
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,120
Is it sharp?

441
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,960
It's sharp.

442
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sweating.

443
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
Do you still feel the same today?

444
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,240
Now?

445
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,160
I don't know.

446
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,000
The truth.

447
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,560
I really don't know.

448
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,160
In the investigation.

449
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,320
Okay.

450
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,000
You were happier last afternoon.

451
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,800
or last night?

452
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,120
I'm happier with you.

453
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,640
So I sent you the message.

454
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
I'm tired.

455
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,440
I might have to go to class with you.

456
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,360
Are you the only one who cares about details?

457
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,880
I think so. I can see a lot.

458
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,440
Can you understand?

459
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,880
At this stage,

460
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,040
I think I can understand it.

461
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,840
Is it that fast?

462
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,400
Not just that.

463
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,280
Sometimes I don't understand.

464
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,240
just don't read it.

465
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,960
Are you avoiding the problem?

466
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,680
Probably.

467
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,880
Yes, you're avoiding the problem.

468
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,000
But the best way

469
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,720
is to escape.

470
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,800
No, you can't say that.

471
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,320
Anyway, when something happens to me,

472
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,840
I'm going to find

473
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,160
a solution quickly.

474
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,960
Yes.

475
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,280
But I don't know if this is your personality.

476
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,680
I'll tell you too.

477
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,200
Well,

478
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,280
Dating is the most important thing.

479
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,200
If you have feelings,

480
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,840
I'll try to approach her.

481
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,680
I'll keep an eye on her

482
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,960
I'll keep an eye on her.

483
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,720
But I think

484
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,040
in a healthy relationship,

485
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,320
in a healthy relationship

486
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,440
adjust to another person

487
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,320
and solve her problems.

488
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,680
If he doesn't change,

489
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,640
we might not be together.

490
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,240
I don't know. It's a bit messy.

491
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,200
I personally think

492
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,640
I think

493
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,520
Whether it's studying or not,

494
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,840
I think you can do this.

495
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,720
But love is the only thing

496
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,520
or mature.

497
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,280
You are impulsive when you should.

498
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,080
Emotions are emotional.

499
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,440
or rational.

500
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,120
Yes.

501
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,440
Funny.

502
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,720
Red.

503
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,080
Eight.

504
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,960
Oh no.

505
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,840
How many cards?

506
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,360
Five cards.

507
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,960
Let me help you.

508
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,520
Okay.

509
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,440
Add two.

510
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,080
What?

511
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,920
Nothing.

512
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,520
I didn't say anything.

513
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,280
I was scolded.

514
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,760
No.

515
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,680
You heard it wrong.

516
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,720
My ears are red.

517
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,760
You're right.

518
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,720
Who should it be?

519
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,480
to

520
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,440
Xinxin.

521
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
My turn.

522
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,960
No more cards.

523
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,080
You draw.

524
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,400
Change.

525
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,280
What color?

526
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,680
What is this?

527
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
Green.

528
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,960
Now I can clearly feel

529
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,840
After coming from the tower,

530
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,000
his mind and mind

531
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,280
should be on the tower.

532
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,560
Let me help you.

533
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,040
It's yours?

534
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,240
Because I'm actually

535
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,840
competitive.

536
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,120
I was a little embarrassed.

537
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,160
Anyone wants to take a photo?

538
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,640
Take a photo with Xiaoling.

539
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,440
Three.

540
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,480
Don't say I took it.

541
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,240
Then who took it?

542
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,560
I said you wanted to do it.

543
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:21,960
No.

544
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Xiao Ling was the one who wanted to take it.

545
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,480
I was a little down then.

546
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,720
Today,

547
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,000
he didn't interact with me at all.

548
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,960
He has been interacting with Tata.

549
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,960
When he was playing games,

550
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,600
they sat next to her

551
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,000
and took photos for her.

552
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,640
And yesterday,

553
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,080
he had a date with Tata.

554
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,160
So I think

555
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,200
his feelings have changed.

556
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,000
Map, what are you doing?

557
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,840
I'm making that thing.

558
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,400
What are you doing?

559
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,680
What?

560
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,760
Let me help you with the map.

561
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,520
Sure.

562
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,080
If you help me, do something simple.

563
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,480
Here's the mission.

564
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,000
What mission?

565
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,400
I just want you to do something simple.

566
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,160
Make candied haws.

567
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,440
Okay.

568
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,520
Dry all these strawberries.

569
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,640
and dry them with paper.

570
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,000
Okay.

571
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,680
Let's try the water with strawberries.

572
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,480
Okay.

573
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Here we go.

574
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,520
No, it must be wet.

575
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,400
You can't wrap it like this.

576
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,200
Try it.

577
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,440
One more.

578
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,880
No.

579
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,840
Go on.

580
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,640
Again.

581
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,360
No.

582
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,280
No.

583
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,680
So bumpy.

584
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,200
Come on.

585
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,160
Ready.

586
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,440
Got it.

587
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:18,960
Good.

588
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,120
It's hard.

589
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
Try this. It must be delicious.

590
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,960
Really?

591
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,840
What?

592
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,120
News.

593
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,240
Look.

594
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,000
Okay, we did it.

595
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,160
You can eat the finished food later.

596
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm looking forward to it.

597
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,440
Make a sugar-coated haws.

598
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,520
So many people are watching.

599
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
It'll be thick, right?

600
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,240
Definitely.

601
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,880
Let me do it.

602
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,800
I'm definitely more professional than you.

603
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,560
This is his mission.

604
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,000
Hurry up. Put it on the map.

605
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,560
Here.

606
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,200
Three spoons of sugar and two spoons of water.

607
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,680
Okay.

608
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,600
Okay.

609
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,400
Okay.

610
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,200
Show us its crispy.

611
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,320
Thank you.

612
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,880
Wait a minute. It's a bit ugly.

613
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,400
OK. Come on.

614
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,200
Right?

615
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,280
Did you finish the mission?

616
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,800
Yes.

617
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,400
Come on, dance a victory dance.

618
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,960
A mission is coming.

619
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,040
Come here together.

620
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Boys' guardian date

621
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,960
have been invited.

622
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,400
The siblings invited by many boys

623
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,240
will be interviewed

624
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,320
to the Mirror House.

625
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,040
Through a secret conversation,

626
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,360
by secret conversation.

627
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,160
So exciting.

628
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,760
You can't tell girls

629
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,640
in any way.

630
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,040
Remember to keep a secret for your date.

631
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,400
Okay.

632
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Explain it.

633
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,560
We have a date with five boys today.

634
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,440
There must be two invitations.

635
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,960
Then...

636
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,560
the one who decides which date

637
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,600
is decided by her siblings.

638
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,280
who will compete with me.

639
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,800
Don't sleep tonight.

640
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,720
Mirror Room.

641
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,200
I predicted it 100 percent.

642
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,040
Because I know

643
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,960
the map must choose the tower.

644
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,120
Do you want to take a rest upstairs?

645
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Let's go.

646
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,040
I think you're going for an interview.

647
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,400
Yes.

648
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,520
I think so too.

649
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,840
Interview me.

650
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,520
It's hot.

651
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,480
Come here

652
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,040
Egg tart.

653
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,360
Thank you.

654
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,200
I was going to give it to everyone.

655
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,640
But after thinking about it,

656
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,000
I still have to be a little biased.

657
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,360
I bought 11.

658
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,840
But I don't want to give them to everyone now.

659
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,120
Don't tell others.

660
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,440
I know.

661
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,400
Is it good?

662
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,440
What do you think?

663
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,800
I don't know. To be honest,

664
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,080
I asked the map just now.

665
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,480
Ask for me.

666
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,600
Brothers are in the heart.

667
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,680
Roommate is in the heart.

668
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,560
He said he's interested in Tata.

669
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,000
I know.

670
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,720
It's obvious.

671
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,160
Interviewer.

672
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,680
We guess you'll be the interviewer later.

673
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,080
Really?

674
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,760
Well

675
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,400
Roommates are different.

676
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Anyway, I just want to say

677
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,920
what someone told me last night.

678
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,080
what someone told me last night.

679
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,480
Are you threatening me?

680
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,280
I didn't hear what you said,

681
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,120
but I know something like that.

682
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,880
It's not a threat.

683
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,040
It's just...

684
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,800
You know that, right?

685
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,400
I was accused of being a bad person.

686
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,200
I was actually a good person.

687
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,320
I don't understand.

688
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,160
But I understand.

689
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,920
No matter who it is,

690
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,960
I'm very strict.

691
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,320
I'll have a lot of questions.

692
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,200
I received a text message.

693
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,600
saying that I received invitations from many boys.

694
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,000
so I need my brother.

695
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,600
to be an interviewer.

696
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,760
But he just called me.

697
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,280
I actually feel

698
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm a little lonely.

699
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,520
I hope he's here.

700
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,560
It's so noisy over there.

701
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,120
Is it noisy?

702
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,040
I'm in the restaurant. I'm in the cafeteria.

703
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,680
Here.

704
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,800
Can you go somewhere quiet?

705
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,720
Somewhere quiet.

706
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,520
What about now?

707
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,800
Better.

708
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,400
Let me tell you the current situation.

709
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,040
I was invited to this date

710
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,200
by many boys.

711
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,320
But I don't know who it is.

712
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Like this?

713
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,240
Yes, but I can guess who it is.

714
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,080
Map and Harry.

715
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,440
We're going to interview them later.

716
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,520
who chose their date.

717
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,280
Then let's

718
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,800
a structural interview.

719
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,600
Just make the same question.

720
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,040
OK.

721
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,960
Ask everyone.

722
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,760
OK.

723
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,880
Your side.

724
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,120
As my brother,

725
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,400
What do you want to ask?

726
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:47,960
The first question.

727
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,440
How was your first impression of Tata?

728
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,480
In the past few days,

729
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,760
Did Tata

730
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,520
that makes you unhappy?

731
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,400
Let me write it down.

732
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,360
Anything else?

733
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,240
Have you talked about love?

734
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,480
For example, love at first sight or love grows over time?

735
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,040
I talked to Harry about this.

736
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
This is the map.

737
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,360
You can be passive.

738
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,000
When you have a problem,

739
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,880
you want to change yourself

740
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,159
or change others?

741
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,000
Change yourself?

742
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,840
I think it's quite difficult.

743
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,280
Yes, I think.

744
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,840
We can

745
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,280
more specific.

746
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,199
In the past relationship,

747
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,639
in the past relationship,

748
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,520
or accept more?

749
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,920
How can I feel

750
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,800
who treats me better?

751
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,960
If there's a problem, should we communicate right away?

752
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,120
It will take some time to calm down.

753
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,760
to communicate.

754
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,239
what the people around you

755
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,920
the people around you?

756
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,960
Say one to two words.

757
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,880
OK.

758
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,679
Anything else to add?

759
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,520
I think it's almost done.

760
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,080
Almost.

761
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,800
Let's wait and see.

762
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,640
Bye.

763
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,080
Okay, bye.

764
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,640
Bye.

765
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,760
Are you ready?

766
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,280
I have a few questions for you.

767
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,440
Are you ready?

768
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,160
I have a few questions for you.

769
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,880
I can hear you.

770
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,440
Come on.

771
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,320
Okay.

772
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,840
Hello.

773
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,200
I'm nervous.

774
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,400
I'm afraid they might find out that I'm not my brother.

775
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,640
I'm not my brother.

776
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,280
I think

777
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
you can see

778
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,440
their physical expressions and expressions.

779
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,720
This will be more real.

780
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,520
In the snow activity,

781
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,360
I think I get along well with Tata.

782
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,160
Trust me, Tata.

783
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,360
Come on.

784
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,040
I want to know more about

785
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,000
what kind of state

786
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,520
when she's on a date?

787
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,920
Hello, Tu.

788
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,200
Can you hear me?

789
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,880
Hello, Tu.

790
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,600
Can you hear me?

791
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,160
Hello.

792
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,880
I can hear you.

793
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,280
I have a few questions for you.

794
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,280
First, what was your first impression of Tata?

795
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,840
I think she is

796
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,720
a very quiet girl.

797
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,680
Did anything affect your mood?

798
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
I think it's more about happiness.

799
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,520
Well,

800
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,840
when we were in the same group

801
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,200
and went to the competition together,

802
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,280
During the competition,

803
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,960
we were very immersed.

804
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,560
She was the first.

805
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,080
and slipped in the front.

806
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,320
She turned around and looked this way.

807
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,840
It made me very happy.

808
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,200
If you quarreled with him,

809
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,680
will you take the initiative

810
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,840
or

811
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,680
you'll be calming down.

812
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
I don't like cold violence.

813
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,040
I think we can calm down.

814
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,920
How long do you think

815
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,120
for you to calm down?

816
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,880
I like to solve something right away.

817
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,360
For example,

818
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,200
maybe we quarreled

819
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,160
at lunch

820
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,120
or something is wrong.

821
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,720
I think we can communicate in the afternoon.

822
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,520
Will you like rational

823
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:54,960
Or

824
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,320
the kind of lovey-dovey

825
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:57,880
I don't like it.

826
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,120
We're always together.

827
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,520
Personally, I don't like

828
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,400
to report everything.

829
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,880
His answer is a little surprising.

830
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,080
Maybe in the future,

831
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,160
in the future,

832
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,240
we have some conflicts.

833
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,360
If you fail

834
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,280
the date successfully,

835
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,800
how would you feel and feel?

836
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,560
Be confident in yourself.

837
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,920
And you can't restrict her too much.

838
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,400
Okay, it's done.

839
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,040
Thank you.

840
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,360
Okay.

841
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,080
Thank you.

842
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,800
After these two days,

843
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,720
I had a good chat with Tata.

844
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,560
I might get closer to him.

845
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,680
I'm someone

846
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,640
I was chosen by you by accident,

847
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,560
Or did you just want to give me

848
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,480
I guessed.

849
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,160
Here.

850
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,120
Okay.

851
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,080
You're in my heart, aren't you?

852
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,440
No.

853
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,240
Suddenly.

854
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,520
I thought it was thundering.

855
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,760
What was that?

856
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,400
So I want to try

857
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,840
to get to know more about it.

858
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,120
and spend more time together.

859
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,520
Hello.

860
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,080
Hello.

861
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,480
Are you ready, Harry?

862
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,240
Wait.

863
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,520
I'm ready.

864
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Come on.

865
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,280
I have a few questions for you.

866
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,480
First of all,

867
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,280
your first impression of Tata.

868
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,440
I think...

869
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,520
To be honest,

870
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,000
you've grown to my point.

871
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,440
Like Terri said,

872
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,520
Su Su has reached his point.

873
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,160
I think so too.

874
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,880
In terms of personality,

875
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,560
I think she is a quiet

876
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,960
In one word,

877
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,880
I think she is

878
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,040
who can't express herself

879
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,520
in front of people.

880
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,840
will need more care.

881
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,000
Even if

882
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,360
when she wants to eat,

883
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,320
she won't say she wants more.

884
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,120
She will eat it if you make it for her.

885
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
If you didn't,

886
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,480
she wouldn't have said this.

887
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,640
or do something else

888
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,680
or do something else quietly.

889
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,080
Did anything affect your mood

890
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,600
did anything affect your mood?

891
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,200
Let's talk about our date yesterday.

892
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,360
I was very nervous.

893
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,800
At that time,

894
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,440
I was a little nervous sitting there.

895
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,520
I feel better

896
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,440
after the chat.

897
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,960
I think I can help her.

898
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
I think this is a happy thing.

899
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,560
Not really.

900
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,240
Actually, I'm quite embarrassed.

901
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
to return the card.

902
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,720
And then

903
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,960
when I texted her yesterday,

904
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,680
but she didn't reply.

905
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,960
She must be a little disappointed.

906
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,920
But

907
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,680
from an objective perspective,

908
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,560
I think I can understand.

909
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,760
Yes.

910
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,840
Will you talk to each other

911
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,600
or

912
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,480
you need to calm yourself down?

913
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,280
I'll try.

914
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,680
I'll coax my other half first.

915
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,800
and then talk to her

916
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,480
before communicating with her.

917
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,920
If she really pissed me off,

918
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,400
I said...

919
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,160
Okay.

920
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,840
Wait for me.

921
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,480
Wait for me. Let me calm down for ten minutes.

922
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,040
Then I'll talk to you about this.

923
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,480
I think my calming period

924
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,560
for more than 10 to 20 minutes.

925
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,520
Yes.

926
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,880
Then you'll like

927
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,280
Your other half is clingy.

928
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,120
Would you mind?

929
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,880
I can only say if the other half is clingy,

930
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,120
I'll be more clingy than the other half.

931
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,720
Then you are

932
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,360
You always report to each other.

933
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,480
Say something like this.

934
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,880
I don't think

935
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,280
is not appropriate.

936
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,680
I think it's good

937
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,480
is good.

938
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,160
I don't know.

939
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,880
Well,

940
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,200
After he said that,

941
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,440
I was comparing

942
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,760
compared with the map.

943
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,560
It's a big difference

944
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,400
is quite different.

945
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,840
Actually his idea and my expectation

946
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,440
is more...

947
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,600
When I hear this answer,

948
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,800
when I hear this answer.

949
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,520
Are you devoted in love

950
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,040
or acceptance type?

951
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,680
I'm only devoted in love.

952
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,400
acceptance type

953
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,680
has nothing to do with me.

954
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,160
I can only say

955
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,800
If Tata didn't choose you in the end,

956
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,680
how would you feel and feel?

957
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,600
You didn't choose me.

958
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,760
Of course.

959
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,080
He must be unhappy.

960
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,800
I guess I won't

961
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,360
with other girls

962
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,680
with each other,

963
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,440
is over.

964
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,880
Actually, it's over for me.

965
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,760
Okay, got it.

966
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,400
Okay.

967
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:17,920
Thank you.

968
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,400
Bye.

969
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,480
Have some wine.

970
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,560
That's how I feel.

971
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,720
Carry me.

972
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,760
Actually, the recipe just now

973
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,840
called "Miss You".

974
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,720
Remember I miss you all the time.

975
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,480
She must be happy.

976
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,560
The result is good.

977
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
The process is also important.

978
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,520
My heart is upside down.

979
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,720
It looks like an AK that can't be suppressed.

980
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,920
I want to find a place to calm down.

981
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
Run!

982
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,240
Run!

983
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,560
Too many people.

984
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,760
So excited.

985
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,200
So nervous.

986
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,400
I...

987
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,680
to visit my roommate.

988
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,160
What do you think?

989
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,640
I think it's quite different.

990
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,080
Yeah, me too.

991
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,040
Their answers are the opposite.

992
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,160
Yes, the map said

993
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,600
Before we set off,

994
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,040
he wanted to invite?

995
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,440
He said

996
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,840
he was also very confused.

997
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,680
If it wasn't you and him

998
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
not you and him,

999
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,920
Maybe he had fun

1000
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,680
with another girl.

1001
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,080
Then he'll continue to get along.

1002
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,400
After hearing Harry's answer,

1003
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,840
I was impressed.

1004
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,640
It's all very sincere.

1005
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,600
I can feel more confident.

1006
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,760
I think Harry Picture

1007
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,360
is more determined to choose me.

1008
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,080
In terms of the date,

1009
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,160
I would suggest

1010
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,080
than Harry.

1011
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,760
Got it.

1012
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:14,760
I think

1013
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,160
Harry wants this chance more.

1014
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,760
I feel like he's firmly choosing me.

1015
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,960
Where's my roommate?

1016
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,920
What are you doing, Mom?

1017
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,840
Today is the time for us to pick a date.

1018
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,720
I chose the same person.

1019
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,560
Now I know she chose me.

1020
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,080
I want to tell you

1021
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,880
I'm very nervous and thrilling.

1022
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,360
Do you have anything to say?

1023
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,680
I've never experienced it. I don't know.

1024
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,400
Aren't you going to be happy for me?

1025
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,240
I'm happy for you.

1026
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,160
Don't be too deliberate.

1027
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,040
Too pretentious.

1028
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,800
or the real me?

1029
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,680
Let me tell you.

1030
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,240
I've never been so sincere in my life.

1031
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,600
I've never been so sincere in my life.

1032
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,760
I think I've said everything I can.

1033
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,000
Just you two?

1034
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,040
Of course.

1035
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,320
Can I take my sister there?

1036
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,760
Can you be more composed?

1037
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,040
Why do I feel that you are very excited now?

1038
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,800
Excited.

1039
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:21,680
You have no idea

1040
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,640
I've been depressed for days.

1041
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,440
Bring the girl you like.

1042
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,920
I'll treat you to dinner tomorrow. Be calm.

1043
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,120
I feel so calm that I can't be calm anymore.

1044
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,640
I'm so excited to hear that.

1045
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,640
Because I just got the news.

1046
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,280
Choose me.

1047
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,480
I've been depressed for two days.

1048
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,400
You treat someone to dinner tomorrow.

1049
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,080
Be polite.

1050
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,080
Keep a gentleman.

1051
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,440
Okay.

1052
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,200
Show your excellent side.

1053
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,520
Okay.

1054
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,360
I plan to take her to play rugby tomorrow.

1055
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,280
A girl shouldn't play rugby.

1056
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,920
Don't tire her out.

1057
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,400
Okay, bye.

1058
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,160
Bye.

1059
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,720
Does anyone know where the soup is?

1060
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,760
Can anyone talk to me?

1061
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,240
It's hard.

1062
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,480
Because I doubt myself.

1063
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,760
After I fail,

1064
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,360
I feel a sense of defeat.

1065
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,880
I'll go upstairs.

1066
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,080
I didn't expect to be an interviewer.

1067
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,200
Because from the text

1068
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,720
a few days ago,

1069
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,480
there's no one else to choose except for one day.

1070
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,760
There was a man

1071
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,040
chose my brothers.

1072
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,840
I didn't expect my brothers

1073
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,240
two invitations.

1074
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,880
When I texted you today,

1075
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,840
I was struggling.

1076
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,480
I want to get to know Xiaoling as soon as possible.

1077
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,040
So funny.

1078
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,280
Hello.

1079
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,000
You can tell us

1080
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,640
why you want to ask Xiao Ling out.

1081
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,040
I think

1082
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,320
she's good-looking.

1083
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,040
Second, I think

1084
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,560
when she smiles,

1085
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,040
and her usual personality.

1086
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,880
I think

1087
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,080
with a good personality.

1088
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,000
So I want to know more about

1089
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,960
What will you do

1090
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,440
what will you do?

1091
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,640
Soul torture, right?

1092
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,840
Difference?

1093
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,440
Actually,

1094
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,640
in love,

1095
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,640
I should be more rational.

1096
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,880
If there are disagreements,

1097
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,200
I can obey most of the things

1098
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,520
or listen to the other half.

1099
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,480
But I will also express my thoughts.

1100
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,800
I like it more.

1101
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,640
I like discussion and discussion.

1102
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,440
After a few days of contact with Xiaoling,

1103
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,240
do you think

1104
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,600
to choose Xiaoling?

1105
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,920
When I first saw her,

1106
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,840
she was a girl

1107
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,280
very much.

1108
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,800
I've been looking for a chance to get in touch with her.

1109
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,320
But due to the time,

1110
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,960
yesterday's sports meeting was the first time

1111
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,400
I had a chat and contact with her.

1112
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,200
So I'm saying I was firm at the beginning.

1113
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,320
Now I think

1114
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,640
This is...

1115
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:10,760
This is...

1116
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,560
This is wrong.

1117
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,000
You can feel her.

1118
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,960
the happy moment in your heart.

1119
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,960
and the difference

1120
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,400
when she's happy?

1121
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,400
I don't think she can tell right now.

1122
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,120
Her brother asked a high question.

1123
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,080
There's nothing we can do.

1124
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,520
I don't know.

1125
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,800
Because I don't know her yet.

1126
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,000
I'm still

1127
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,840
at an initial stage.

1128
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,040
I don't know much about it.

1129
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,120
That's why I chose this date.

1130
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,720
I want to know more about it.

1131
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,120
If Xiao Ling didn't choose you,

1132
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,360
what would you think?

1133
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,320
If she didn't choose to go on a date with me,

1134
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,760
maybe she thinks

1135
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,160
I'd be better friends with her.

1136
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,920
I think this result is also good.

1137
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,920
I feel very happy

1138
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,720
I also feel very happy.

1139
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,880
From my impression of Fatty,

1140
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,400
he has been persistent.

1141
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,440
But his messages are everywhere.

1142
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,160
Sometimes,

1143
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,440
I think

1144
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,960
Fatty will like Xiaoling more.

1145
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,800
Okay, it's over.

1146
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,280
I think

1147
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,840
I feel more interactions and laughter

1148
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,160
in daily life.

1149
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,560
So I want to know

1150
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,520
how she was

1151
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,080
in the activity.

1152
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,840
Hello.

1153
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,640
Please tell us

1154
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,240
why you chose Xiao Ling.

1155
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,880
as your date this time?

1156
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,840
I actually

1157
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,800
the first impression

1158
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,280
I thought

1159
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,440
I voted for Xiaoling.

1160
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,240
In the past few days,

1161
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,440
in games

1162
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,120
or eating together,

1163
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,480
I think

1164
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,320
get along well.

1165
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,920
I want to know more about you.

1166
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,720
You chose her

1167
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,240
to understand Xiaoling.

1168
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,880
Or

1169
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,280
you want to

1170
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,160
with her.

1171
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,280
I should have known it

1172
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,560
It's only been a few days because of me.

1173
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,320
I can't

1174
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,880
100 percent.

1175
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,920
I want to know more about it.

1176
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,800
You can feel

1177
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,120
when Xiaoling is really happy

1178
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,720
to cater to everyone's emotions.

1179
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,640
Is there a difference?

1180
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,360
Actually, I think

1181
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,200
the moment she's really happy

1182
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,640
is eating.

1183
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,680
No matter what she eats,

1184
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,800
she's willing to share with us.

1185
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,600
I can see that she's really happy

1186
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,200
to play the game she likes.

1187
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,680
At other moments,

1188
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,560
I might not be able to express her emotions.

1189
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,760
Through these days,

1190
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,440
when you've been together these days?

1191
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,320
The most exciting thing is

1192
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,360
when she was playing,

1193
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,600
when she's having fun.

1194
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,520
when she's having fun.

1195
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,480
Like what we did together.

1196
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,880
what we did together,

1197
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,600
when we look at each other,

1198
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,640
or something like that.

1199
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,120
all kinds of moments make my heart flutter.

1200
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,640
If you have disagreements

1201
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,920
in the process of getting along,

1202
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,200
how will you solve it?

1203
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,840
If there are disagreements,

1204
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,760
we will communicate first.

1205
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,600
Actually I am

1206
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,240
who doesn't have any opinions.

1207
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,360
Because I will adjust it

1208
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,280
or preference.

1209
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,840
The answer given by two boys.

1210
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,840
Fatty said he would consider girls first.

1211
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,160
But he has his own persistence.

1212
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,480
He will also

1213
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,840
to girls.

1214
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,760
I think they may take care of each other.

1215
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,200
But the answer the map gave me

1216
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,920
he prefers to girls unconditionally.

1217
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,120
I think

1218
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,320
it may be irresponsible to say this.

1219
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,760
Because you can't always suppress yourself

1220
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,360
with your unhappy emotions.

1221
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,240
We'll break up when we're depressed.

1222
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,160
So I think

1223
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,120
are quite childish.

1224
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,560
I personally think

1225
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,240
Fatty answered better.

1226
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,800
His experience

1227
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,680
in all aspects of his experience.

1228
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,800
From what I know about her,

1229
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,360
she's easy to get.

1230
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,400
She doesn't try anything

1231
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,640
because they are afraid of bad results.

1232
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,080
But I think

1233
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,400
we should start from

1234
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,320
from the perspective of liking and happiness.

1235
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,560
Maybe from my observation these days,

1236
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,160
Xiaoling has no intention

1237
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,080
to get too close to Fatty.

1238
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:48,880
So I want Xiaoling and Tu

1239
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,760
to get to know each other more.

1240
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,760
Even if you tell me

1241
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,600
Xiaoling is the second choice of the drawing,

1242
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,560
Because I think

1243
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,440
it's most important for Xiaoling to like it herself.

1244
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,840
Two circles.

1245
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,040
You're here.

1246
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,960
Yes.

1247
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,880
What's wrong?

1248
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,760
Why are you here?

1249
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:49,920
I don't want to play anymore.

1250
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,920
I want to take a break.

1251
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,400
I didn't expect you to be like me.

1252
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,200
I'm tired too.

1253
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,240
So tired.

1254
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:55,920
I can't play anymore.

1255
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,680
Something's bothering you.

1256
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,360
I was so happy.

1257
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,480
After I was rejected,

1258
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,040
when I knew I had the chance,

1259
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,520
I was very happy.

1260
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,160
Then I immediately

1261
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,040
the tricky questions they asked

1262
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,400
on their memo.

1263
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,200
The questions I asked them

1264
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,160
is very tricky.

1265
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,280
The Avengers' plan.

1266
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,760
I'll wait for Tarri and Fatty.

1267
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,720
Let me tell you.

1268
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,680
I'll ask them.

1269
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,440
Come on.

1270
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,040
Do we have to wait so long?

1271
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,920
We don't have much patience.

1272
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,160
I saw the text about protecting our date.

1273
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,120
My first reaction was

1274
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,880
to Hua.

1275
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,520
Because yesterday, the day before yesterday,

1276
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,720
Huahua sent it to me.

1277
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,920
So today,

1278
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,280
I didn't think too much.

1279
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,280
So I sent it to her directly.

1280
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,000
Hello.

1281
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,200
Let's get started.

1282
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:35,920
Okay.

1283
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,120
What do you think attracts you?

1284
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,560
I think her personality...

1285
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,480
Tell me more.

1286
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,400
We went to the snowfield a few days ago.

1287
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,440
I was in the same team with her.

1288
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,320
When I was in the competition,

1289
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,280
every time I win,

1290
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,200
she was very happy.

1291
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,880
cheering for me.

1292
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,480
What's your first impression of her

1293
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,680
the first impression of her?

1294
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,760
First impression.

1295
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,000
The girls in our house are all great.

1296
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,240
When I was in a relationship,

1297
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,800
I might look for an older sister.

1298
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,480
Maybe

1299
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,040
take care of me

1300
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,480
and tolerate me.

1301
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,960
And she really

1302
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,680
can bring me emotional value.

1303
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,280
She doesn't feel secure.

1304
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,840
Why did you provide her

1305
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,720
a sense of security?

1306
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,680
I may be a little bit in love.

1307
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,440
I'm mostly following my boyfriend.

1308
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,160
If you compete with others,

1309
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,480
what will you do?

1310
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,000
You may give more signals

1311
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,080
and take the initiative

1312
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,000
to win her favor.

1313
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,040
If you keep getting to know her,

1314
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,680
and find it inappropriate,

1315
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,000
or how would you react?

1316
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,480
I think I'm a straightforward person.

1317
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,320
Well,

1318
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,800
If it's true, it's inappropriate.

1319
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,560
There are things that I can't get over.

1320
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,880
I'll tell her.

1321
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,760
I don't mean to hang on to her

1322
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,640
and go on a date with other female guests.

1323
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,760
I just know

1324
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,040
Why didn't she

1325
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,560
last night?

1326
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,800
This is my problem.

1327
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,160
I didn't think about it

1328
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,480
before I thought about it.

1329
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,520
At first, I thought

1330
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,000
to get in touch with every girl

1331
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,320
and get to know each other more.

1332
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,920
After going back to the room,

1333
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,360
and played

1334
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,480
with another girl.

1335
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,120
I didn't think carefully.

1336
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,360
If she didn't choose you,

1337
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,400
what would you show?

1338
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,320
or fight for it?

1339
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,360
It depends on the number of times.

1340
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,800
I'll try again and again.

1341
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,040
But with more, I'll definitely...

1342
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,400
You know that, right?

1343
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,520
Yes.

1344
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,840
Flower gives me many signals.

1345
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,720
Her siblings may hope

1346
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,840
her own siblings

1347
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,800
with someone you like.

1348
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,880
So I'm quite confident

1349
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,320
in her brother interview.

1350
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,240
Hello.

1351
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,640
Hello.

1352
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,520
Say our first question.

1353
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,080
Okay.

1354
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,040
First impression.

1355
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,720
Did anything change after getting along?

1356
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,840
Actually,

1357
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,120
my first impression of Hua

1358
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,120
to today,

1359
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,800
I don't think it has changed much.

1360
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,200
On the first day, I thought

1361
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,000
a nice girl.

1362
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,520
If others compete with you,

1363
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,880
what's your advantage?

1364
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,400
I think...

1365
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,560
How should I put it?

1366
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,800
I think after these days,

1367
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,640
I think I can understand her better.

1368
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,960
And we have

1369
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,160
a little tacit understanding.

1370
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,080
How will you make her feel safe?

1371
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,840
In fact, after a few days of observation,

1372
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,080
I found that

1373
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,160
if someone can take care of her,

1374
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,080
she would still want to be a little girl.

1375
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,840
But if no one takes care of her,

1376
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,680
she is also a very strong girl.

1377
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,480
I may observe the details

1378
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,840
and do it slowly.

1379
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,720
When she is sad,

1380
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,320
how will you comfort her?

1381
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:35,840
I personally think

1382
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,880
it's written on her face.

1383
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,160
When she was sad,

1384
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,080
I can feel a little bit

1385
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,000
I can feel a little bit.

1386
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,320
In the past few days,

1387
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,920
I'll try to comfort her.

1388
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,880
Actually, I'm not quite satisfied.

1389
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,520
I think they are all formalized and formula.

1390
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,400
Their answers are all comforting.

1391
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,320
I will accompany her.

1392
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,840
I think this is the most basic.

1393
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,160
I didn't know

1394
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,800
a creative answer.

1395
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,600
Why did you vote for Hua today?

1396
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,080
Because after today,

1397
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,960
I had more interactions with Hua.

1398
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,200
And I find that I subconsciously

1399
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,640
care about her every move.

1400
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,520
If you were not chosen today,

1401
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,440
what would you have done?

1402
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,040
I don't think I've been chosen.

1403
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,480
Because today's choice

1404
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,080
is not up to her.

1405
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,120
I think

1406
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,360
even if I'm not chosen today,

1407
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,640
I still have a lot of time and opportunities in the future.

1408
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,960
I sent this this this afternoon.

1409
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,400
this text message this afternoon,

1410
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,320
Is Hua your first choice?

1411
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,160
Hua is not my first choice.

1412
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,320
Because he asked me

1413
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,400
if my first choice was...

1414
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,200
I said no.

1415
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,840
Everyone thinks that

1416
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,280
are always the best.

1417
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,080
I don't want to talk about it. You pick it.

1418
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,480
You're the only one left.

1419
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,640
to choose my brother.

1420
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,280
Yes, this feeling is definitely not good.

1421
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,880
Through these two interviews,

1422
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,400
I can clearly feel it.

1423
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,240
I think I know how I feel.

1424
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,160
Xiao Ling's answer is...

1425
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,160
to be good friends.

1426
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,520
But Hua's answer is...

1427
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,400
I'll keep going.

1428
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,280
Let's continue to talk about the topic.

1429
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,000
Teach me.

1430
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,960
Your stuff hasn't arrived yet.

1431
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,000
Can you teach me when we arrive?

1432
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,360
Depends on mood

1433
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,200
I'll teach you

1434
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,280
Seriously

1435
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,320
will you teach me seriously?

1436
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,080
Are you kidding me?

1437
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,200
No.

1438
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:17,880
Pay the tuition fee.

1439
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,680
It won't make my face so big.

1440
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,840
If you make your students ugly,

1441
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,680
would you be happy?

1442
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,360
I don't have a disciple.

1443
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,920
It's not enough for you to sit here.

1444
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,760
I'm afraid it's too close to you.

1445
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,240
No, I want to put my back on the waist.

1446
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,280
I thought he made me a "38-line".

1447
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,320
I was afraid I might sit down.

1448
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,600
He's really...

1449
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,280
"38 Line".

1450
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,480
Did you get the parcel?

1451
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,560
I'll get it for you tomorrow.

1452
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,200
I'm going to get it tomorrow.

1453
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,560
Do you have a nickname

1454
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,800
"Prince of Depression"?

1455
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,960
Did you give it to me?

1456
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,760
Yes.

1457
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,560
Do you like it?

1458
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,360
Great.

1459
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,440
Okay.

1460
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,720
Do you have anything to say?

1461
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,800
No, let's talk tomorrow.

1462
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,760
Can you understand me?

1463
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Not now.

1464
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,640
I'm emotional these days.

1465
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,720
I will be affected by Su's actions.

1466
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,440
Whether I think too much

1467
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,240
or she did wrong,

1468
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,000
I don't think it's a positive development.

1469
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,280
I want to know

1470
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,800
how to break the deadlock.

1471
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,760
When I was reading the Book of answers,

1472
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,359
I wanted to see

1473
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:32,960
Do you want to tell me if I choose Susu firmly

1474
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,680
or you can

1475
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,160
try to contact other girls.

1476
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,200
As a result of reading,

1477
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,439
I made three decisions firmly.

1478
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,720
I was advised to try others.

1479
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,840
But

1480
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,920
I already have the answer before I turn it over.

1481
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,479
What's wrong?

1482
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:22,760
We didn't finish talking yesterday.

1483
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,399
Shall we talk?

1484
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,600
Let's go.

1485
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,920
You've been lying here.

1486
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,160
I feel bad.

1487
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:32,560
What's wrong?

1488
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,880
I'm not feeling well. I'm sick.

1489
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:39,439
I slept for two hours

1490
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:40,880
and went down for a while.

1491
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,279
Are you cold?

1492
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:43,520
I feel terrible.

1493
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,680
Let me think.

1494
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,000
There seems to be nothing to talk about.

1495
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,160
Then call me.

1496
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,440
Think about what we haven't finished yesterday.

1497
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,120
So,

1498
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,520
you will choose me.

1499
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,680
When?

1500
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:19,920
I don't know.

1501
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,360
From now on,

1502
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,960
you want me to promise

1503
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,800
No, I'm not saying...

1504
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,920
Like...

1505
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,360
So I just want to confirm

1506
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,520
how you feel right now.

1507
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,080
Aren't you supposed to be sure?

1508
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:49,880
You should...

1509
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,120
I'm sure

1510
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,880
But I still...

1511
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,480
Because I think

1512
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,000
a message to comfort

1513
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,400
another guy

1514
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,080
is...

1515
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,080
Yes, because

1516
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,680
we have different definitions

1517
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,720
are different.

1518
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,680
Yes.

1519
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,880
It's the definition of my feelings.

1520
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,680
I didn't expect

1521
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,640
You mean

1522
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,840
send it to the person you like.

1523
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,600
And I sent that text because

1524
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,320
I think

1525
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,160
I don't think it's good to say anything.

1526
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,760
If I want to text,

1527
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,160
it's more formal.

1528
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:37,880
Yes.

1529
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:38,520
Okay.

1530
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:38,960
Yes.

1531
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:44,880
Then...

1532
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,560
You...

1533
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,680
I...

1534
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,560
No.

1535
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,520
What?

1536
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,120
Nothing.

1537
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,360
That's why it's gone.

1538
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,800
I thought you wouldn't tell me today.

1539
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,320
I thought...

1540
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,640
What do you mean?

1541
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,000
And?

1542
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,560
I thought you would tell me.

1543
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,960
And then?

1544
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,480
I didn't see you.

1545
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,840
Then I thought I should stop waiting.

1546
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,760
I've been looking for you twice yesterday.

1547
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,200
You said

1548
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,280
Let's talk tomorrow.

1549
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,560
You cried yesterday?

1550
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,480
No.

1551
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,080
Really?

1552
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,240
Don't get caught by me.

1553
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,560
Don't cry in secret next time.

1554
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,760
Cry in front of me first.

1555
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,600
Okay?

1556
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,280
You're a little pervert.

1557
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,960
Men's tears.

1558
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,360
So I was in a bad mood yesterday.

1559
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:55,720
Who?

1560
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,360
You.

1561
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,360
Yes.

1562
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,600
Then why did you recover?

1563
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,040
Have you figured it out?

1564
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,600
Yes, like you said,

1565
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,320
your definition of it

1566
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,240
different from mine.

1567
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,440
I didn't consider

1568
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,960
what you said.

1569
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:12,960
Yes.

1570
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,040
Send this to other boys.

1571
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,120
I do feel

1572
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,760
it'll be hard.

1573
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,240
It's okay. I'm not sure.

1574
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,240
you'll send it to other girls later.

1575
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,920
It's okay.

1576
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,280
Just see if you can receive it or not.

1577
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,680
What if I'm zero one day?

1578
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,800
Then I'll go.

1579
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,560
I'll take my phone and question you.

1580
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,320
I wondered why I didn't receive it today.

1581
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,080
Okay.

1582
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,040
Okay?

1583
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:42,520
Sure.

1584
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,280
Really?

1585
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,720
Then you would say no.

1586
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:47,960
So what?

1587
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,440
It's up to me who I send it to.

1588
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,440
Maybe you want me to cry again.

1589
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:56,880
How should I pay you back?

1590
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,520
If I let you cry,

1591
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,240
you wouldn't have sent it to me.

1592
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,320
You always make me sad.

1593
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,480
I have to keep sending it to you.

1594
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,040
It's a bit domineering.

1595
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,000
Yes.

1596
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,280
That's how I am.

1597
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,800
Did you go out today?

1598
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,760
No.

1599
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,440
So I said

1600
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,480
I think everyone is busy today.

1601
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,360
I've been sleeping

1602
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,560
since I woke up.

1603
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,520
I'll lie on the sofa.

1604
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,720
Lie down here.

1605
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,400
No one cares about me.

1606
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,080
No one will bring me food when I go out.

1607
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,560
No one cares.

1608
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,720
Maybe I'm too sad.

1609
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,240
Okay.

1610
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,560
Come in.

1611
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,240
Bye.

1612
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,360
Bye.

1613
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,560
No, she's fine.

1614
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,440
She's better than Harry.

1615
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:10,800
Harry is coming in.

1616
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,720
Join us.

1617
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,800
OK. OK.

1618
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,120
Let's chat.

1619
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,040
Go down with me to heat up the medicine.

1620
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,440
I haven't finished taking the medicine.

1621
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,600
Take it now.

1622
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,160
It's hot.

1623
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,040
Let me help you.

1624
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,040
You can do it yourself.

1625
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,400
With my feeling of causing trouble,

1626
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,280
It's hot.

1627
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,280
Cut a corner

1628
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,120
and pour it here.

1629
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:55,960
Thank you.

1630
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,840
It's hot.

1631
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,480
Don't cut too much.

1632
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,840
Do you think something will happen?

1633
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,280
It will come out.

1634
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,640
Not yet.

1635
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,240
Is it here?

1636
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:08,840
Yes.

1637
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,360
Okay.

1638
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,760
Don't pour the wrong cup later.

1639
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,640
I cut it for nothing.

1640
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,400
You should face each other.

1641
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,280
Because I need to prepare medicine.

1642
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,200
Can he be sweeter? Yes.

1643
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,800
He's so sweet.

1644
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,640
Come on.

1645
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,400
One more bite.

1646
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,640
Be firm.

1647
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,760
Come on.

1648
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,440
You’re spinning volleyball.

1649
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,680
I can play it.

1650
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:11,800
Here.

1651
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,640
Can you answer it?

1652
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,000
Your hand doesn't hurt.

1653
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,760
No.

1654
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,240
No.

1655
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,800
Unlock a new game.

1656
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,000
Throw it down.

1657
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,800
You scared me.

1658
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:40,960
I'm coming down.

1659
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,680
Come down.

1660
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,480
It's almost done.

1661
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,040
Here.

1662
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:27,920
Done?

1663
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,400
Not yet.

1664
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,720
I thought about who to send it to.

1665
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,800
Because I haven't received

1666
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,400
for two days.

1667
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,200
I have zero rules for two days.

1668
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,280
I don't want to be

1669
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,320
to be left behind.

1670
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,040
So I was hesitant.

1671
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,200
Did you send it?

1672
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,240
Why are you laughing?

1673
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,000
No.

1674
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,680
It's okay. I'll check Hunan.

1675
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,920
Don't send me away.

1676
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,000
Did you get permission from your brother?

1677
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,040
You're sending me off.

1678
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,040
Did you agree?

1679
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,040
No.

1680
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,000
You didn't agree?

1681
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,360
Did I agree?

1682
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,040
Did I agree?

1683
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,400
I'm speechless.

1684
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,160
Did you send me

1685
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,120
Did you send it to me today?

1686
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,040
I think

1687
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,120
he knew I would send it to him today.

1688
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,680
He still sent me

1689
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,480
a message like this.

1690
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,040
You know the answer.

1691
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:15,920
Yes.

1692
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,440
How did it come out?

1693
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,640
What?

1694
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,160
I asked if Susu sent it to me today.

1695
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,760
She replied this.

1696
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,160
I think she means sorry.

1697
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,400
To be honest, I don't think he understands.

1698
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,240
Because after receiving his message,

1699
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,680
he was confused.

1700
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,160
He looks confused.

1701
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,960
Why did I send that message?

1702
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,640
is actually a face of high five.

1703
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,640
Then why did I send this expression?

1704
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:02,520
Because

1705
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,080
talked to the end,

1706
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,760
I thought it would be a deal.

1707
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,160
It's all in the past.

1708
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:08,480
We've talked it through.

1709
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,080
Then we gave him five.

1710
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,240
So I sent him this expression.

1711
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,080
I knew it was Harry.

1712
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,120
The message Harry sent

1713
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,040
has been very valuable.

1714
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,360
He wants to express that he's happy.

1715
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,840
happy and nervous.

1716
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,680
And I feel that

1717
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,440
after winning.

1718
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,480
Because he added one at the end.

1719
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:55,880
Why are you laughing so happily?

1720
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,520
Nothing happened.

1721
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,360
Calm down.

1722
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,440
A little nervous.

1723
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,640
Happy nervous.

1724
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,560
Tomorrow's date,

1725
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,800
I must give her

1726
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,000
a memorable

1727
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,560
Think about it.

1728
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:12,680
Think about it tonight.

1729
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,440
I sent the message

1730
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,160
I sent it to Harry.

1731
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,240
Actually, I've thought about it.

1732
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,960
if I should send it to the map to explain.

1733
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,000
But later I felt

1734
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,560
there's no need to explain.

1735
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,000
After all, I chose Harry for our date.

1736
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,840
I think so too.

1737
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,080
the message tonight

1738
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,000
I should send it to him.

1739
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,920
My feelings will be sent to

1740
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,920
to those who have feelings for me that day.

1741
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,240
Harry and Tata

1742
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,800
They played there in the afternoon.

1743
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,560
Take photos.

1744
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,720
You're lucky.

1745
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,240
Wait, it's a bit ugly.

1746
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:05,520
OK. Come on.

1747
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,240
I think they are

1748
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,240
on the same channel.

1749
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,120
So I think

1750
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,320
send it to him today.

1751
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,600
I'll kill you.

1752
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,200
I sent my message to Map today.

1753
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,000
Today,

1754
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,240
I made half of the sugar strawberries with him.

1755
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,080
Then I sent him the message

1756
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,720
This text means

1757
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,760
between siblings.

1758
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,200
I've already emphasized the unity of siblings.

1759
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:08,840
I sent a message.

1760
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,040
No.

1761
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,480
You're the only one who got the message.

1762
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,400
You're exposed.

1763
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,280
I was surprised

1764
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,840
surprised me.

1765
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,040
I got two too.

1766
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,280
First, Xin's.

1767
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,000
The second is Xiao Ling's.

1768
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,800
When we were playing,

1769
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,360
she said she didn't know how to fight the landlady.

1770
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,880
She said directly

1771
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,600
if I could teach her how to play the Landlord next time.

1772
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,840
When I received

1773
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,520
this news,

1774
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,400
I was very happy.

1775
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,720
I can't help laughing.

1776
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,320
Uncovered happiness.

1777
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,960
I sent my message to Map today.

1778
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,760
I think

1779
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,520
this is a obvious point.

1780
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,280
to let him know who sent it to him.

1781
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,240
I guess

1782
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,320
the person who sent this text should be the map.

1783
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:14,640
Go over there.

1784
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,040
The three of us are the same

1785
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,680
We three comedians don't have love

1786
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,440
I have.

1787
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,880
Who knows?

1788
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,760
You're amazing.

1789
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,640
She doesn't envy

1790
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,480
She doesn't envy me at all.

1791
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,960
Just two days.

1792
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,120
Do you know what will happen?

1793
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,200
Love will bring you bad luck.

1794
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,000
It doesn't matter.

1795
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,480
It doesn't matter.

1796
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,120
Do you know what it means to bounce back?

1797
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,000
It's the first time I've seen people describe themselves with this.

1798
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,680
When I was waiting for the news,

1799
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,200
I pretended not to care,

1800
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,160
but I kept looking at my phone.

1801
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,640
I thought it wouldn't last three days.

1802
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,040
That's terrible.

1803
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,920
Can you teach me how to draw shadows?

1804
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,320
I thought it was Fatty.

1805
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,480
I didn't expect Fatty would send it to me.

1806
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,960
Because he didn't send it to me the other day.

1807
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,200
I looked at him with doubt.

1808
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,360
I wanted to argue with him.

1809
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,680
I was wondering why you sent it to me today.

1810
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,240
I sent Hwa Hwa my message today.

1811
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,600
Actually, yesterday,

1812
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,680
I've been thinking about this.

1813
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,560
Today, obviously,

1814
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,040
I want to

1815
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,760
to talk to Hua.

1816
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,520
to meet Hua.

1817
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,680
But when I invited her today,

1818
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,680
I sent it to Xiaoling.

1819
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:42,840
Because...

1820
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,400
I want to get to know Xiaoling as soon as possible.

1821
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,560
Even if Xiao Ling and I

1822
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,800
and Xiaoling,

1823
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,640
And she didn't understand Hua.

1824
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,240
I will still wait beside her.

1825
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,360
I will wait.

1826
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,960
Because this is a matter of respect.

1827
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,040
After she gets to know it,

1828
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,200
I’ll give her

1829
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,000
to her.

1830
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,520
I think it's Tae-seo's text.

1831
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,640
The content is

1832
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,680
I want to know more about it.

1833
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,400
I texted Hua today.

1834
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,520
Because I said I regret it yesterday.

1835
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,800
Today

1836
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,840
to text today,

1837
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:21,920
I sent it right away.

1838
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,760
I sent the message to Hua.

1839
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,680
I think I have changed.

1840
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,000
As a girl,

1841
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,960
as a girl.

1842
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,720
the first day and the second day.

1843
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,240
And after our contact,

1844
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,040
no matter it's a group activity

1845
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,400
she would take care of me

1846
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,720
she would take care of me.

1847
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,520
Her passion

1848
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,480
will still touch me.

1849
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,960
I think it's also a flower.

1850
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,320
But I'm not sure.

1851
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,240
Because she sent me

1852
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,400
I didn't send it to her.

1853
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,560
I thought about who to send it to.

1854
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,600
In the end, I sent it to Tae-seo.

1855
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,720
I think I should follow my heart.

1856
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,520
I've always wanted to know him.

1857
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,400
I never talked to him alone.

1858
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,280
So I sent him my message.

1859
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,520
I got two.

1860
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:52,840
I got two too.

1861
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,000
I felt very happy.

1862
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,960
My reaction was that I guessed it.

1863
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:10,240
Because I think he might be a little hesitant.

1864
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,240
So the two girls he wants

1865
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,840
will also be hesitant.

1866
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,320
I might not choose him.

1867
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:25,880
Actually, I can feel that she's unhappy today.

1868
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:34,040
She could feel Harry's determination two days ago.

1869
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,960
and suddenly changed.

1870
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,630
That's it.

1871
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:40,240
It makes people feel a little unhappy.

1872
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,200
But I don't think it's a big problem.

1873
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,920
Because Esther adjusts her emotions quickly.

1874
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,760
Actually she knows it very well.

1875
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,960
I can see that she knows it very well.

1876
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,270
She just said that because of her pride,

1877
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:55,760
I think she is.

1878
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,880
She's a very strong girl.

1879
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,350
Hello, handsome.

1880
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,320
Hello, I'm Yuan Bo.

1881
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,720
I'm a model.

1882
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,470
I have a sister seven years older than me.

1883
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,680
She's a fashion stylist.

1884
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,030
Hello.

1885
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:24,990
Long time no see.

1886
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:28,600
Long time no see.

1887
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,760
Let me introduce my brothers.

1888
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,710
188 handsome guy.

1889
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,240
That's all.

1890
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,160
What else do you want?

1891
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,350
What else do you want?

1892
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:42,720
He's a bit shy.

1893
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,710
You deserve a beating.

1894
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:49,440
Both of them have been

1895
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,910
when we were little.

1896
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:53,240
We've been fighting since childhood.

1897
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,680
Both of them are stubborn.

1898
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:58,110
And no one was convinced.

1899
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:00,990
My mom always said

1900
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:03,840
they are so close.

1901
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,150
Why are you two like this?

1902
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:06,560
You two must help each other

1903
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,870
in Shanghai.

1904
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:09,200
More.

1905
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,160
That's what it means.

1906
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:11,920
But I think

1907
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,200
we help each other.

1908
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,280
The more she said that,

1909
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,400
the more I have to go the opposite way.

1910
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,480
You're really stubborn.

1911
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,320
Okay.

1912
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,510
He seems quite stubborn.

1913
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:29,040
It's the first time I've realized siblings.

1914
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,520
When I was a kid, I always thought

1915
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,600
Although my sister shouted every day,

1916
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,120
but I think she's a bad person.

1917
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,880
Because she often

1918
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,710
my mom asked her to take care of me.

1919
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:42,240
Then she wouldn't let me go out.

1920
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,440
No.

1921
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,280
I want to go out and play.

1922
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:45,360
Why don't you go out with me?

1923
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,320
I don't want to go out.

1924
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,230
Yes, that's it.

1925
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:48,440
Isn't that what I just said?

1926
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,840
We've been on bad terms since childhood.

1927
01:31:51,230 --> 01:31:53,470
People born in the Year of the Horse don't get along with rats.

1928
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,640
Since junior high school,

1929
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:04,030
since high school.

1930
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:06,880
After we started working after graduation,

1931
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,080
we started working together

1932
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,400
we started to work together

1933
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,070
and lived in Shanghai.

1934
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,440
I truly realized

1935
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,080
my brother was by my side.

1936
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,910
I grew up

1937
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:20,080
and joined this industry.

1938
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:20,920
When I went to Shanghai,

1939
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,720
she just started working.

1940
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,320
Maybe she didn't get much salary.

1941
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,840
and give me pocket money.

1942
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:27,960
I even gave you pocket money.

1943
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:28,320
Yes.

1944
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,560
He gave me money every day.

1945
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,680
How much was it?

1946
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:32,920
50 yuan 100 yuan

1947
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,320
That's a lot.

1948
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,480
Turn it back to me now.

1949
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,120
She's half sister and half mother.

1950
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,030
From that moment on,

1951
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:41,880
this sister is good.

1952
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:42,590
I have a sister.

1953
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,560
No wonder I'm like my mom when I'm dating.

1954
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,800
It's because of you.

1955
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:52,030
I had a lot to do when he first joined the industry.

1956
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:53,680
Maybe I bought him

1957
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:55,000
I don't care

1958
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,830
whether I like her or not.

1959
01:32:56,830 --> 01:32:57,680
I won't listen.

1960
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,040
But

1961
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,240
the more you ignore him,

1962
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,510
the faster boys grow.

1963
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,590
But now I think

1964
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:08,640
he can put his life

1965
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:09,680
his life

1966
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,120
is very good.

1967
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:11,840
I think

1968
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,040
are getting along well now.

1969
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,800
We seldom contact each other.

1970
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,830
But sometimes

1971
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:17,760
to stand up for him.

1972
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,190
For example, when he was away for a long time,

1973
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:21,760
for a long time.

1974
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,120
For example, when I was on a business trip for a long time,

1975
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,480
when a dog needs a walk,

1976
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,070
I think you're right.

1977
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,230
I'm not good at expressing my feelings.

1978
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:33,920
It's basically proven by actions.

1979
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:34,910
to love each other.

1980
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,470
So I think

1981
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:40,600
is more expressive than actions.

1982
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,230
I think he's a reserved

1983
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:43,870
and slow to warm up.

1984
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:46,110
He's always cautious when he's in a relationship.

1985
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:50,680
He knows a lot

1986
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,560
to think about

1987
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,950
with this person.

1988
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:55,070
A child

1989
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,110
who wants to be loved.

1990
01:33:58,110 --> 01:34:01,470
He seems to be devoted to every relationship.

1991
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:02,720
He loves me.

1992
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:05,150
When I was dumped,

1993
01:34:05,150 --> 01:34:10,200
I went to my sister and cried.

1994
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:14,000
When he came back from New York,

1995
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,710
when he came back from New York.

1996
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:18,430
She just cried in her room.

1997
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,480
I was so scared.

1998
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,920
My family is kind of lovesick.

1999
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,040
I think

2000
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,040
it's not a bad word.

2001
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,190
Love is good.

2002
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:30,360
Isn't dating for happiness?

2003
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,350
That's why I support him

2004
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:33,760
in love.

2005
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,720
So I support him.

2006
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,240
in love.

2007
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,440
So I support him

2008
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:46,240
in love

2009
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:47,390
(She's so cute.)

2010
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:48,350
So stubborn.

2011
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,920
I think my brothers have the biggest impact on me

2012
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,640
is to bring me into the modeling industry.

2013
01:34:57,310 --> 01:34:58,320
I think my brothers

2014
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,000
changed my life.

2015
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,800
I rely on myself without my family.

2016
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,760
I'm more advanced.

2017
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,240
I think this is my advantage.

2018
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,760
I'm very satisfied

2019
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,240
his achievements.

2020
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,640
He went to Singapore

2021
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:12,960
and New York.

2022
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,280
I went to Milan and Paris Fashion Week

2023
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,120
I also made some achievements.

2024
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,200
I bought a car with my own efforts.

2025
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:19,760
and bought a house.

2026
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,320
Although

2027
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,600
basic material,

2028
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,840
But at his age,

2029
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,400
I think he's already

2030
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,240
in this industry.

2031
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,880
Because my parents

2032
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,030
were busy when I was little.

2033
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:33,150
They didn't have time for me.

2034
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:34,750
Grandma used to guide me.

2035
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:35,920
Then grandma left

2036
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,680
I feel like you've been taking care of me

2037
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,640
My sister is always behind me.

2038
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,160
who can tell me without shame.

2039
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,030
is the other person.

2040
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:44,440
or

2041
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:45,840
when our family encounters any difficulties,

2042
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,550
you'll be the first one

2043
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:48,600
to solve the problem.

2044
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,950
Maybe that's why

2045
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:51,120
I always call him Yinbo.

2046
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,670
I'm definitely interested

2047
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:53,840
in your relationship.

2048
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,360
But I think

2049
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,470
he'll do well on his own.

2050
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:58,720
I never tell my parents

2051
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,920
about my relationship.

2052
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,240
So I'm willing to show my most fragile side

2053
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,280
to my sister.

2054
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,750
He didn't keep looking at the feeling.

2055
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,040
I hope the other half is her.

2056
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,800
is the one who feels right.

2057
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,430
Happiness is the most important.

2058
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:15,440
From what I know about her,

2059
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,520
she won't worry that no one likes me.

2060
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,070
I will definitely mock him.

2061
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:20,440
If no one likes him,

2062
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,070
I'm not worried at all

2063
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:24,120
in the show.

2064
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:26,680
Because he's the kind of person who is full of peach blossoms.

2065
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,510
I think

2066
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:30,720
someone would like him wherever he goes.

2067
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,480
After all, I gave him all my peach blossoms.

2068
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,510
Long time no see.

2069
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:37,560
How have you been?

2070
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,000
I'm doing fine.

2071
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,520
I've been on a date once.

2072
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:42,880
I checked in first.

2073
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,350
Then I moved into the small house.

2074
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,320
Among the three girls,

2075
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:49,080
I can choose the date.

2076
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,080
Then I chose her.

2077
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,720
What did you do on a date?

2078
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,430
We had dinner together.

2079
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:55,390
We talked a lot anyway.

2080
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:57,470
But I came later.

2081
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:59,760
Actually, she and another guy

2082
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,560
with another guy.

2083
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:04,560
Then...

2084
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,110
Okay, your brother was rejected.

2085
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:08,440
It's normal to reject him.

2086
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:08,990
Yes.

2087
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:09,840
When we were doing group activities,

2088
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,600
she was in the same group with that boy.

2089
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,880
I'm in the same group with another girl.

2090
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,960
Do you have any

2091
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,680
interested in you?

2092
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:18,640
There's one.

2093
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:19,710
The next day and the first day.

2094
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:21,240
a girl sent it to me.

2095
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:22,800
Yes, I guessed it later.

2096
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:23,600
The girl

2097
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,920
who was in my group.

2098
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,480
So what do you think you did

2099
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,920
to send you this message?

2100
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,310
I don't know.

2101
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:36,480
But later I received

2102
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:40,120
a text message from the girl in my group.

2103
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,280
She said

2104
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,640
"We're happy together today."

2105
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:44,830
I wanted to take it back.

2106
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:46,320
The message I sent.

2107
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,160
I regretted it.

2108
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,640
I thought I should send it to her.

2109
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:49,880
What should we do now?

2110
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:53,440
There are still many days left.

2111
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,920
This is your favorite now.

2112
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,080
Have you thought about

2113
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,200
about other people?

2114
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,760
I've never thought about it.

2115
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:04,600
Besides,

2116
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,280
Maybe not enough contact.

2117
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:08,720
I don't know

2118
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,960
how many times you have to go on dates.

2119
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,800
But there should be many chances.

2120
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,030
I think you can

2121
01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:17,040
with this girl

2122
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,560
We'll meet her once or twice.

2123
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:19,870
Then look at

2124
01:38:19,870 --> 01:38:20,880
of each other.

2125
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,480
Do you think every girl

2126
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,190
every girl?

2127
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:25,920
Not every one.

2128
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:27,280
Like this.

2129
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,310
Two two three

2130
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:32,030
Because many things

2131
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,400
Yes.

2132
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,240
Did you fall in love at first sight?

2133
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:40,480
Yes, we don't know much in a couple of days.

2134
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,790
Follow your heart.

2135
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:43,440
Let's meet later.

2136
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,120
That's what I'm thinking.

2137
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,280
Let's talk about it.

2138
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,310
Because I basically

2139
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,240
we didn't talk about

2140
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:53,560
about

2141
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,040
or personal views,

2142
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,000
I didn't talk about it.

2143
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,630
It's just my daily life.

2144
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:59,870
Maybe early.

2145
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:01,120
Good evening.

2146
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:03,920
We didn't talk much.

2147
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,400
Okay.

2148
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:07,000
Rest early today.

2149
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,760
If you have any questions later,

2150
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,240
call me anytime.

2151
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,440
Okay.

2152
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:12,830
Okay.

2153
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:13,790
Okay, bye.

2154
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:14,910
I'm going back.

2155
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:15,600
Bye.

2156
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:20,600
As a sister,

2157
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,040
she always agrees

2158
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,120
She agrees.

2159
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,150
Yes, as long as I'm happy.

2160
01:39:25,150 --> 01:39:26,360
She also

2161
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,680
I want to know more about her.

2162
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:30,880
and see if she is more and more

2163
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,280
more and more alike.

2164
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:33,150
As I said before,

2165
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:33,790
I like taking care of me.

2166
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:34,840
I think she is

2167
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,560
But there are other things

2168
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,710
I want to try it again.

2169
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,200
Why does my hair always collapse?

2170
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,800
Just use my wig.

2171
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,400
This is my Penelope.

2172
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,400
What's wrong?

2173
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,000
I can't fix my hair.

2174
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,720
Your hair is so fluffy. Can you help me?

2175
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,280
Don't bother.

2176
01:39:57,470 --> 01:39:57,880
Okay.

2177
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:01,310
This is it.

2178
01:40:01,310 --> 01:40:03,040
Olia hydrochloric acid shampoo.

2179
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,350
After you wash it,

2180
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,880
when you wash it.

2181
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,920
I'll try it now.

2182
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,840
And this bottle is pretty.

2183
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:10,720
Of course.

2184
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,830
This is the second generation after the upgrade.

2185
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:14,590
I've been stocking up since the first generation.

2186
01:40:14,590 --> 01:40:16,190
It can improve your scalp.

2187
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,400
This fluffy shampoo

2188
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,080
She's like our soft savior.

2189
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,720
From now on,

2190
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,910
will be my Penelope.

2191
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:52,350
Let's go.

2192
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,960
Hello.

2193
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:28,960
Good evening.

2194
01:41:32,510 --> 01:41:33,720
Was I awkward just now?

2195
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:35,390
A little.

2196
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:37,440
I can feel that

2197
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,390
I tried my best to keep it.

2198
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,080
Why?

2199
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:42,840
Something's wrong.

2200
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:44,280
Something's wrong since afternoon.

2201
01:41:45,150 --> 01:41:46,270
Who?

2202
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:47,760
Harry.

2203
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:49,950
I suddenly spin.

2204
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:50,910
Suddenly.

2205
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,120
Is there anything wrong?

2206
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,920
They went on a date last night.

2207
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:56,960
When I came back,

2208
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,800
I thought he wouldn't send it to me.

2209
01:41:58,800 --> 01:41:59,520
But last night,

2210
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,080
did you receive his text?

2211
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:01,760
It's his.

2212
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,520
What did he send?

2213
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,480
He said he wanted to know more about you.

2214
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:09,790
Well,

2215
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:10,590
At first,

2216
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:11,710
he wouldn't send it to me.

2217
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:12,600
After sending it,

2218
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,400
last night.

2219
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,880
They were playing with cats.

2220
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:17,880
Then I went out

2221
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:18,560
They are here.

2222
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,320
we didn't talk.

2223
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,510
We didn't talk much

2224
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,880
I didn't talk much.

2225
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:33,400
So you think yesterday's date

2226
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:35,870
caused him a wave?

2227
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:37,790
Do you think

2228
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:38,880
he showed determination

2229
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,640
at the sports day?

2230
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:43,870
Before the sports day,

2231
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:44,920
before the sports day.

2232
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,720
Because he chose me.

2233
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:50,110
But you didn't receive that text today.

2234
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,440
I can feel your emotions are low.

2235
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,320
You are depressed

2236
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,550
Is it because of your dignity?

2237
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:56,880
Or

2238
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,840
I really think

2239
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:58,560
his change

2240
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,720
made you unhappy.

2241
01:43:03,070 --> 01:43:05,400
I think both of them

2242
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,870
I'm sure he'll be unhappy.

2243
01:43:07,870 --> 01:43:10,800
Because he's been showing you his feelings.

2244
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,040
even for two or three days.

2245
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,240
But you really

2246
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:15,280
you want to

2247
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,040
with him again.

2248
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,240
with him.

2249
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,000
It's not sudden.

2250
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,480
They've been interacting today.

2251
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,120
But I didn't interact with him.

2252
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,590
If he wants to talk to me,

2253
01:43:26,590 --> 01:43:28,080
we have a chance.

2254
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,080
Including Su Su's unhappy today.

2255
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,640
is soup.

2256
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,150
He will go to accompany her

2257
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:34,160
and take medicine with her.

2258
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:36,720
I think this is a show that he cares about.

2259
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:37,360
But he didn't.

2260
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,430
It means he doesn't care about it.

2261
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:43,920
That's true.

2262
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,680
I've known you for two days

2263
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:47,390
to know you.

2264
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:47,840
Yes.

2265
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:48,640
That's all.

2266
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:49,470
Yes.

2267
01:43:49,470 --> 01:43:50,360
I personally think

2268
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:53,120
you don't have to be too disappointed.

2269
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,680
Not that.

2270
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:56,670
First of all, the impact on my mood

2271
01:43:56,670 --> 01:43:57,150
It must be.

2272
01:43:57,150 --> 01:43:58,480
Because I was a little awkward just now.

2273
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:00,190
It was too tight.

2274
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:01,950
I didn't receive any text last second.

2275
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:02,840
in the last second.

2276
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,830
The next second is the birthday party.

2277
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:08,400
Happy birthday to you

2278
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,430
Guolifang.

2279
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:12,280
Xinxin, eat more.

2280
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:13,400
You want cake?

2281
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,040
I can't eat it.

2282
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,760
Do you think

2283
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:23,230
Harry versus Tata will be more positive to you?

2284
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:25,150
Indeed.

2285
01:44:25,150 --> 01:44:27,600
He has always been

2286
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,600
to me.

2287
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:31,040
chatting or entertaining.

2288
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,560
But he's very clear about Tata.

2289
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:33,840
He would pick her up

2290
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,390
and get along with her.

2291
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:37,880
Maybe

2292
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,680
is his type.

2293
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,400
So you think

2294
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:47,480
when the tower didn't appear,

2295
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:51,480
he wanted to know and have feelings for you.

2296
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:53,950
As your brother,

2297
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:55,160
I don't understand that.

2298
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:57,560
I think if he had a date yesterday

2299
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,920
and knew Tata,

2300
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,360
he should have

2301
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,910
last night.

2302
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:03,640
But last night,

2303
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,240
last night

2304
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:06,880
which made me confused.

2305
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,030
So today,

2306
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:09,630
because your emotions are unstable,

2307
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:10,800
I'm a little angry too.

2308
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:17,630
Harry's behavior

2309
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:19,320
I'm a little angry.

2310
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:20,880
You can

2311
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,440
send it to Tata directly.

2312
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,480
After you texted Xin,

2313
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,120
Then the next day,

2314
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,760
the next day.

2315
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,870
I think he doesn't respect Xinxin.

2316
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,120
I don't think you need to sigh.

2317
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:35,870
You really don't need to sigh.

2318
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:37,630
In other words,

2319
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:40,800
even if you two get along,

2320
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,400
he won't be able to pass me.

2321
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,120
Maybe.

2322
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:45,790
Because I may want to say

2323
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:47,390
if I'm not good enough.

2324
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:48,920
I don't think I'm not good enough.

2325
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,320
I think you're an excellent person.

2326
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,120
To be honest,

2327
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:08,350
I have a strong self-esteem since I was a kid.

2328
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:10,480
I'm also very fragile.

2329
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:11,870
He can see

2330
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:13,760
my weakness.

2331
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:14,800
Let me tell you.

2332
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,280
on the day I sent messages,

2333
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:17,600
I thought

2334
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,070
you would definitely receive the message.

2335
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:21,470
But I think love

2336
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:22,360
is incomparable.

2337
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:23,680
You don't have to say.

2338
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:25,440
I lost if no one chooses me today.

2339
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,390
This is not the right choice.

2340
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:28,990
I don't think I lost.

2341
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:30,750
I'll keep thinking about what I've been doing these two days.

2342
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,720
or to my friends,

2343
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,590
or to my behaviors.

2344
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:36,670
I just don't think I did well enough.

2345
01:46:36,670 --> 01:46:37,520
Definitely not.

2346
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,600
Just because of a meal,

2347
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,830
because of a meal.

2348
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:42,040
That means

2349
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:44,400
he doesn't like your style.

2350
01:46:47,230 --> 01:46:49,080
So he chose me.

2351
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:49,840
Yes.

2352
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,230
I'll tell you last night

2353
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:52,190
or last night.

2354
01:46:52,190 --> 01:46:53,120
I won't tell you.

2355
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:54,520
There's no problem.

2356
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:57,080
In this environment,

2357
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,320
no matter what,

2358
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,480
you have your siblings.

2359
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,680
I will be there.

2360
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:02,640
I'll be there.

2361
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,190
Whether he chooses a tower

2362
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:09,630
or anyone.

2363
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:10,880
I think

2364
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,510
there's no need to compare this.

2365
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:13,840
Don't think you're not good enough.

2366
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,280
I don't think you did anything wrong.

2367
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:17,040
And I've experienced two rounds of

2368
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,270
the torture of my soul.

2369
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:20,920
knocked me out.

2370
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:22,480
Really.

2371
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,670
These two brothers asked me questions.

2372
01:47:24,670 --> 01:47:26,720
Then both of them

2373
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,830
my invitation.

2374
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,360
Including the questions Xiao Ling's brother asked me.

2375
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,430
That's called height.

2376
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,080
What height?

2377
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:37,120
That's why

2378
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:38,640
Now I forgot all my answers.

2379
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,000
And they asked me

2380
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,470
what I would do if I rejected it.

2381
01:47:45,470 --> 01:47:46,560
I said no problem.

2382
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,710
I think so.

2383
01:47:47,710 --> 01:47:48,920
the denial of brothers

2384
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,520
doesn't mean their feelings.

2385
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:53,120
Actually this morning,

2386
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:55,000
texted this morning,

2387
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,600
I only sent one message.

2388
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:57,720
But I sent it to Xiaoling first.

2389
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:59,440
Because I met Xiaoling the day before yesterday.

2390
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,200
But after the whole day I got to know her,

2391
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,000
do you think

2392
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,800
between Xiao Ling and me?

2393
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:04,760
No.

2394
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:06,430
Yeah, I don't think so.

2395
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:07,520
We're more like friends.

2396
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,000
So,

2397
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,910
I sent this invitation to her immediately.

2398
01:48:10,910 --> 01:48:12,720
I thought maybe I should contact her again.

2399
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,720
How can it be rejected?

2400
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,350
If both of you send it to her,

2401
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:17,790
Yes, send them to her.

2402
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:19,160
her siblings will decide

2403
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,560
who she's dating.

2404
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,200
Both of them were rejected.

2405
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,440
You can see

2406
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:26,960
we are very close.

2407
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:27,680
Trust me.

2408
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:29,630
They're here to invite you.

2409
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:31,120
I will reject the same question.

2410
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,670
Did you prepare these questions?

2411
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:38,840
Someone will invite you.

2412
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:39,680
and choose for you.

2413
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,080
I think I'll ask him 10,000 questions.

2414
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,160
Right?

2415
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,430
I think it's okay.

2416
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:47,160
Don't think

2417
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:49,560
he's upset because he's celebrating her birthday.

2418
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:49,720
No.

2419
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:50,800
I'm happy to celebrate her birthday.

2420
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,120
Because I think I like Tata too.

2421
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:53,200
She has a good personality.

2422
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:54,360
I think

2423
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,150
I feel a little awkward

2424
01:48:57,150 --> 01:48:57,790
I was a little embarrassed.

2425
01:48:57,790 --> 01:48:59,230
Actually, I'm a little embarrassed.

2426
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:01,120
But at this time,

2427
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:02,040
maybe I can

2428
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:04,190
I can be alone.

2429
01:49:04,190 --> 01:49:05,240
No, I want to know too.

2430
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,640
Why are you shy about this question?

2431
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,240
He should be embarrassed.

2432
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:14,160
He's not awkward. He's happy.

2433
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:14,880
If he's not embarrassed,

2434
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,080
why are you embarrassed?

2435
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:18,160
Don't be blinded by

2436
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:21,120
because of your competitive mind.

2437
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:23,040
I've always wanted to tell you.

2438
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,990
But I can't tell you this.

2439
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:26,200
Let me make it clear today.

2440
01:49:26,910 --> 01:49:28,760
I think the relationship line

2441
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,160
follow your heart.

2442
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,120
Don't think that you'll feel bad

2443
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:32,760
just because

2444
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:33,560
you have to reply to him.

2445
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:34,750
This is called a heart message,

2446
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:36,120
instead of replying.

2447
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:39,040
He's a clubbing dancer at your thunder point.

2448
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:41,280
You should just

2449
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,360
even when you text him,

2450
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:44,600
you can already tell him

2451
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,950
I didn't send it to him today.

2452
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:46,960
I know.

2453
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,720
Don't send it to someone

2454
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,520
because you don't have someone you like.

2455
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,800
I think it makes sense.

2456
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,320
You admire others if you don't like them.

2457
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:56,720
I think you can praise the drawing.

2458
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:58,270
I praised the drawing today.

2459
01:49:59,550 --> 01:50:01,630
By the way, I want to take a step back.

2460
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:04,440
if he comes back to you

2461
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:06,750
he will come back to you.

2462
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:10,880
I won't.

2463
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:12,760
Then this is impossible.

2464
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,560
because of your pride?

2465
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,560
Or are you just

2466
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,000
about this person?

2467
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:21,280
I'm not sure

2468
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,430
is zero.

2469
01:50:22,430 --> 01:50:24,400
But do you think

2470
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:25,280
a definite choice?

2471
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,160
Or

2472
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,920
he's just getting to know you.

2473
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,120
He can't be with me.

2474
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,640
Do you think what I did

2475
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:32,190
is the same as what he did?

2476
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:33,950
I think it's different.

2477
01:50:33,950 --> 01:50:34,360
For example,

2478
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:36,350
I think you know

2479
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:38,160
and Xiao Ling,

2480
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,760
when I get to know Xiao Ling.

2481
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,320
But the message he sent me

2482
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:43,230
and how we get along,

2483
01:50:43,230 --> 01:50:44,880
he was direct.

2484
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:47,960
I don't talk about his relationship with Tata,

2485
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:50,000
or how he will choose.

2486
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:50,560
I have it.

2487
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,240
I must have rejected him.

2488
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,270
We can be good friends in the future.

2489
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:55,520
But I won't

2490
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,240
with him again.

2491
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,640
Because the choice I made

2492
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:00,510
is not firm.

2493
01:51:00,510 --> 01:51:01,280
Even if he just

2494
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,750
get to know him.

2495
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,640
Okay.

2496
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:06,400
I understand what you mean.

2497
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,550
He's a funny guy.

2498
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:09,680
If we can get along

2499
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:10,360
as friends,

2500
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:11,640
I think it's very good.

2501
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:15,230
Are you feeling better?

2502
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:16,670
I am.

2503
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:18,880
After all, both sides rejected you.

2504
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:22,880
But honestly, I'm not worried.

2505
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,480
I'm really not worried.

2506
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:25,400
Because I can feel

2507
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,640
Hua is happy to receive my message.

2508
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:28,990
She made me a big bowl of noodles.

2509
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:31,800
So you sent it to Hua today?

2510
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,440
Yes, so I firmly finish it.

2511
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:35,870
Fatty, is it good?

2512
01:51:42,590 --> 01:51:43,710
What did you send her?

2513
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:46,040
Can you teach me how to use the dressing stick?

2514
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,400
She told me in the kitchen

2515
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,120
I'll teach you.

2516
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:51,040
What are you thinking?

2517
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,720
Nothing. I think you're cool.

2518
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,160
I'll teach you how to fix your face.

2519
01:52:02,430 --> 01:52:06,360
So my date tomorrow is

2520
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:07,360
Brothers' agreement.

2521
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,360
Let's go on a date.

2522
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:35,870
Okay.

2523
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:36,990
I hope

2524
01:52:37,950 --> 01:52:38,590
tomorrow.

2525
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:39,920
Let's take a photo outside.

2526
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,080
I'm going without makeup.

2527
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:41,440
No.

2528
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:44,400
I have to put on makeup when I go out with you.

2529
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:47,120
You have to look good when you go out with your siblings.

2530
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,350
Let's take a photo.

2531
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:49,520
Ten o'clock, okay?

2532
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:52,600
In fact, in a relationship,

2533
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,840
he will always tell me the truth.

2534
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:57,310
No matter what relationship I have,

2535
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:58,200
in any relationship,

2536
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,670
he always tells me

2537
01:53:00,670 --> 01:53:02,040
to cut the loss in time.

2538
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,960
It's not scary without a boyfriend.

2539
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,040
What's scary is that you've been consuming yourself.

2540
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,000
I got 80% comfort

2541
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,520
from my brother.

2542
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,600
Have you ever thought

2543
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,080
maybe Harry didn't send

2544
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:14,520
might not be from Harry.

2545
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:21,600
Really?

2546
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:23,520
I don't know.

2547
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,760
So this message

2548
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:26,110
wasn't sent by him.

2549
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:28,560
Wait.

2550
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,600
Really?

2551
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,150
Wait, my brain is burning.

2552
01:53:33,150 --> 01:53:34,840
So I...

2553
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:35,390
To be honest,

2554
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:37,360
I think if this message

2555
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:39,230
sent this message to me,

2556
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:41,600
I think he has been behaving

2557
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,000
everything he did was very reasonable

2558
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,120
and normal.

2559
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:46,400
Actually, I misunderstood someone.

2560
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:03,600
I'm going skiing today.

2561
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,670
I've asked

2562
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:05,560
I already asked.

2563
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:07,320
She likes skiing too.

2564
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:08,560
So I'm looking forward to it.

2565
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:13,680
Here.

2566
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,080
Why are you so surprised?

2567
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:22,720
Watch your step.

2568
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:23,280
It's you.

2569
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,560
It's me. Who do you think it is?

2570
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:29,040
Are you happy?

2571
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:29,790
Yes.

2572
01:54:29,790 --> 01:54:30,800
So happy.

2573
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:32,960
Only one.

2574
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,280
Let's get changed.

2575
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:38,200
Let's go.

2576
01:54:39,070 --> 01:54:40,350
I'll be more careful this time.

2577
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:41,840
Let's skate two times.

2578
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,320
We're really here.

2579
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,400
Let's skate on this simple (Snow Doe).

2580
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,640
Get used to it first?

2581
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:15,520
Get used to it.

2582
01:55:25,950 --> 01:55:28,160
Let's see who falls off today's first fall.

2583
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:28,600
Okay.

2584
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:34,080
How do you feel now?

2585
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:37,400
I'm very competitive right now.

2586
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:46,880
Have you been an interviewer?

2587
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:49,120
Take a guess.

2588
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,400
You must be laughing.

2589
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,640
I was interviewed anyway.

2590
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:56,560
You were interviewed.

2591
01:55:58,750 --> 01:55:59,280
Are you happy?

2592
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,480
Yesterday?

2593
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,080
I don't know.

2594
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,070
I don't know.

2595
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:07,870
Then the day before yesterday?

2596
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:10,160
What are you asking?

2597
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:15,480
Look over there.

2598
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,880
I'm thinking if we play that track,

2599
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,400
if we don't go left or right,

2600
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,200
just push up

2601
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:24,560
Then you'll go down.

2602
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,160
Yes, you'll hit the Internet.

2603
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:27,360
I won't.

2604
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:29,360
Last time I played that game too fast.

2605
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,160
I didn't dare to move.

2606
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:31,870
I'm always like this.

2607
01:56:32,350 --> 01:56:32,920
You know?

2608
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:35,550
Then you'd better not play.

2609
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:36,990
You're a dangerous person.

2610
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,920
Let's go on the snow.

2611
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:44,990
Let's go to the north slope together.

2612
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:55,600
You scared me.

2613
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:56,760
I fell for your beauty.

2614
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:57,520
Excuse me.

2615
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:06,800
Someone fell over there.

2616
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:08,760
Don't fall.

2617
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,800
If you fall, I'll give you a request.

2618
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:11,360
Let me tell you.

2619
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:13,240
If I fall, you lift me up.

2620
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,520
I'll hold you.

2621
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:20,190
You're watching the Hokage?

2622
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:21,720
Who do you like the most?

2623
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:23,280
Neji!

2624
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:26,590
No way!

2625
01:57:26,590 --> 01:57:27,840
I just told Soup that

2626
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:28,920
I love Neji!

2627
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,350
Unbelievable, you know?

2628
01:57:32,350 --> 01:57:32,800
Yes.

2629
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,680
I saw your expression. I said no.

2630
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,030
Yes, everyone likes it.

2631
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:36,920
Only three.

2632
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:37,630
The protagonist.

2633
01:57:38,110 --> 01:57:39,360
Good taste.

2634
01:57:41,950 --> 01:57:44,030
Let's talk about an anime.

2635
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:45,630
The character we both like

2636
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:48,880
is actually very popular.

2637
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:49,720
After I asked her,

2638
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:52,560
she immediately answered that it was this role.

2639
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:53,520
I was really stunned for three seconds.

2640
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:54,040
I think

2641
01:57:54,910 --> 01:57:57,040
someone would choose this role.

2642
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:58,590
And just like me.

2643
01:57:58,590 --> 01:58:00,990
So I think that move

2644
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,200
surprised and surprised.

2645
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:07,070
Come on.

2646
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,400
Time for level test.

2647
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,960
Three, two, one.

2648
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:14,110
Let's go.

2649
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:28,400
Let me teach you a trick.

2650
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:33,600
Great Waterfall Jutsu!

2651
01:58:34,270 --> 01:58:34,960
Help!

2652
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,640
I'm going to surpass you!

2653
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:40,510
Don't even think about it.

2654
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:47,600
We did it!

2655
01:58:53,150 --> 01:58:54,480
We won.

2656
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:56,480
I let you win by luck.

2657
01:58:58,110 --> 01:58:59,760
Take a break.

2658
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:01,400
It feels so good.

2659
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:04,510
Hello, you skated on a single board.

2660
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:05,200
That's amazing.

2661
01:59:06,110 --> 01:59:07,360
Can you stop wrestling?

2662
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:09,310
Awesome.

2663
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:10,430
Are you from Xinjiang?

2664
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:11,280
Yes.

2665
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,800
Are you from Xinjiang? I am.

2666
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:14,520
Do you believe she's from Xinjiang?

2667
01:59:15,070 --> 01:59:16,120
Say something.

2668
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:18,720
Say something in Vego.

2669
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:20,830
I love you.

2670
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,040
You're really...

2671
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:28,240
No, she's from Beijing.

2672
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:30,200
I had fried eggs with tomato for lunch.

2673
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:31,960
It's so authentic.

2674
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,750
It's real.

2675
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:38,080
You're so funny.

2676
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:40,030
It's so authentic.

2677
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,000
Why don't you have Beijing accent?

2678
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:42,960
You have that accent.

2679
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:43,520
If you really want to hear it,

2680
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:44,830
I'll talk to you like this now.

2681
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:47,870
They learn acting differently.

2682
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:48,760
You can hide your accent.

2683
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,960
I can't open my mouth, you know?

2684
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:54,680
Awesome.

2685
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:55,320
Amazing.

2686
01:59:56,830 --> 01:59:57,880
Are you skiing

2687
01:59:57,880 --> 01:59:58,880
or this?

2688
01:59:59,360 --> 01:59:59,920
This...

2689
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:02,480
Be careful.

2690
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:03,200
Be careful.

2691
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:03,920
Thank you.

2692
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,600
Don't fall like him.

2693
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:08,320
Bye. Go ahead.

2694
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:08,920
Bye.

2695
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:11,000
She's so cute.

2696
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:11,640
She's so confident.

2697
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,200
I can't do that.

2698
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:14,880
I like kids like this.

2699
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:15,800
I really like kids like them.

2700
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:16,960
"Social bandits."

2701
02:00:18,270 --> 02:00:19,480
We're going to take the cable.

2702
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:20,080
Take the cable.

2703
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:21,310
I want to ride this cable.

2704
02:00:21,310 --> 02:00:22,480
Will it fall from the cable?

2705
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:23,680
You...

2706
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:26,480
Give me five yuan before I give it to you.

2707
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:30,960
Let's go over there.

2708
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:34,360
Let it be.

2709
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:34,880
Okay.

2710
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,880
Should we go this way or that way?

2711
02:00:37,310 --> 02:00:38,800
He said there was a road.

2712
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:41,120
A bend and a straight one.

2713
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:41,790
Which one are you going?

2714
02:00:41,790 --> 02:00:43,710
Let's go straight.

2715
02:00:43,710 --> 02:00:45,470
You really want to do it.

2716
02:00:45,470 --> 02:00:46,320
Do you like it too?

2717
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:47,070
I do.

2718
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,720
If you come out with me again,

2719
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,270
let's play board together.

2720
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:56,720
It depends on Mr. Tu

2721
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:58,400
will give me this chance next time.

2722
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:02,240
Of course.

2723
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:03,640
Really?

2724
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:19,870
What do you want to eat later?

2725
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,120
I chose something that suits you very well.

2726
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:25,310
You can eat too.

2727
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:28,960
It feels so good.

2728
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,720
Just tell me if you feel good on a date with me.

2729
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:32,190
That's great. I'll date you every day.

2730
02:01:32,190 --> 02:01:33,200
Date you every day.

2731
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,240
I have to fight with the landlady when I go back.

2732
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,760
So comfortable.

2733
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:50,430
Yeah.

2734
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:52,030
So pretty.

2735
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:54,520
It's so dark.

2736
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:56,880
Not bad.

2737
02:02:00,190 --> 02:02:01,630
Why is it so red?

2738
02:02:01,630 --> 02:02:02,840
Right? I told you.

2739
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:03,230
I'm impressed.

2740
02:02:03,230 --> 02:02:04,440
She's so pretty.

2741
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:08,800
You're an ENFP.

2742
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:09,840
Yes.

2743
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,400
We're acting.

2744
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:13,760
Yes, we are.

2745
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:16,190
Did you fight with your brothers?

2746
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:17,920
Ever since you grew up, you've always been like this.

2747
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:18,560
No.

2748
02:02:18,910 --> 02:02:20,560
He's a bit impatient.

2749
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:22,590
He'll be better now.

2750
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:25,440
I've been pressing him as his brother

2751
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,670
You're really an art student

2752
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:30,080
Not like seniors who are postgraduate students

2753
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:36,080
In fact, at the beginning,

2754
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:37,560
at the beginning.

2755
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:39,280
Then why did you learn acting?

2756
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:40,670
My mom wants me to learn it.

2757
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:43,760
Do you have many classes?

2758
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:45,150
Not bad.

2759
02:02:45,150 --> 02:02:46,270
It's all theoretical class.

2760
02:02:46,270 --> 02:02:47,200
No practice.

2761
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:49,720
So for a social phobia like me,

2762
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:50,560
very good.

2763
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:55,000
I thought maybe I'll be a teacher

2764
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:57,720
I'll really become a teacher.

2765
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,920
So I have to think about it.

2766
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:00,990
Although I don't like being a teacher,

2767
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:03,200
but I have to think.

2768
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,800
What are you doing?

2769
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:08,560
Go.

2770
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,910
Let it be.

2771
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:12,240
Okay.

2772
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:14,880
We're here to enjoy the world of ice.

2773
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:15,800
That's right.

2774
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:17,560
Cheer up.

2775
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,480
I need to keep balance.

2776
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:24,190
Take this.

2777
02:03:25,470 --> 02:03:26,480
Don't fall like this.

2778
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:27,520
Awesome.

2779
02:03:28,990 --> 02:03:30,960
I remember I fell here before.

2780
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,190
Don't you think the building over there

2781
02:03:36,190 --> 02:03:36,880
from here?

2782
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:38,590
Before I came here,

2783
02:03:38,590 --> 02:03:39,680
before I came here.

2784
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:42,840
They have the same style as Switzerland.

2785
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:43,640
and move here.

2786
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:45,400
This kind of building.

2787
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,680
Let me take a photo for you.

2788
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:48,600
Stand there.

2789
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:49,840
Don't just slide.

2790
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:50,590
Don't.

2791
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:52,760
Cheer up.

2792
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:54,800
Three, two, one.

2793
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:57,920
Let me take a photo for you.

2794
02:03:59,360 --> 02:03:59,920
Watch your hands.

2795
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:01,560
Don't block the camera.

2796
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:02,320
I'll kill you.

2797
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:07,160
Don't fall down.

2798
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:11,920
Three, two, one.

2799
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:16,080
If we don't hurry, we'll be safe.

2800
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:16,830
Safe?

2801
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:19,280
I trust you, Xiaoling.

2802
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:24,760
Slow down.

2803
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:28,030
Be careful.

2804
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:56,990
Come on.

2805
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:01,950
Bye.

2806
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:07,390
I'll wait for you.

2807
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:17,840
I won.

2808
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:21,240
Are we still skating?

2809
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:23,000
I'll listen to you.

2810
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:23,760
You always listen to me.

2811
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:24,510
I don't know.

2812
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:25,200
I have no opinion.

2813
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:25,950
I'll listen to you.

2814
02:05:25,950 --> 02:05:26,800
I have no opinion.

2815
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:27,680
I'll listen to you.

2816
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,510
One more time.

2817
02:05:28,510 --> 02:05:28,720
Okay.

2818
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:32,160
I feel a little

2819
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:33,360
I don't know what to do.

2820
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:34,840
Because in the past,

2821
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:37,630
I wouldn't be treated like this.

2822
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:40,640
He really cares about my feelings.

2823
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:42,000
and what I want.

2824
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,840
I feel warm and happy.

2825
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:44,670
That's true.

2826
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:46,080
Look at the camera.

2827
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,150
My stick.

2828
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:50,840
You scared me.

2829
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:51,390
Hold it.

2830
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:55,390
Don't take this down

2831
02:05:56,030 --> 02:05:57,240
Don't drop it.

2832
02:05:57,240 --> 02:05:57,840
Throw it away.

2833
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,480
You throw it.

2834
02:06:04,830 --> 02:06:05,950
I laugh so loudly.

2835
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:08,670
No.

2836
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:26,910
We're going to slide that bend.

2837
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:27,870
Yes.

2838
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:30,040
Bye.

2839
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:42,750
You're a fast learner.

2840
02:06:55,710 --> 02:06:57,950
Can we start rushing?

2841
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:00,190
Get ready.

2842
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:02,000
Ready.

2843
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:04,000
Three, two, one, go.

2844
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:25,790
Map.

2845
02:07:25,790 --> 02:07:27,200
Ling.

2846
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:30,880
skiing with him.

2847
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:32,880
I feel very happy.

2848
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:34,240
Very free.

2849
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:36,560
I didn't feel that way before.

2850
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:39,600
During skiing,

2851
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:41,120
what makes my heart flutter is

2852
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:42,680
When I went up the mountain,

2853
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:44,880
my face was very cold.

2854
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:45,400
At that time,

2855
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:47,440
she was very vivid.

2856
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:49,310
She's like Elsa

2857
02:07:49,310 --> 02:07:50,480
Princess Elsa.

2858
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:54,320
Map.

2859
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:56,030
Ling!

2860
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:05,840
Xiao Ling!

2861
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:11,360
So annoying.

2862
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:18,960
Give me five.

2863
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:20,960
I'm tired.

2864
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:21,520
I'm tired.

2865
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:22,560
Let's go eat.

2866
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:23,320
What should we eat?

2867
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,240
You'll know later.

2868
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:35,840
Can you wear it?

2869
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:38,430
I made it.

2870
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:44,190
I think it suits my outfit.

2871
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:45,790
You can't button it.

2872
02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:48,480
Is it too tight?

2873
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:49,520
A little tight.

2874
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:50,320
A little tight Let me loosen it for you

2875
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:51,230
A little tight.

2876
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:54,360
It's too tight. It's like iron.

2877
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,440
A welder.

2878
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:00,240
This one or this one?

2879
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:00,560
This one.

2880
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:01,680
This one looks like your hair.

2881
02:09:02,910 --> 02:09:04,000
It's a bit divided.

2882
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:07,280
This one

2883
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:09,310
looks like grocery shopping.

2884
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:10,880
And this one.

2885
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:13,790
This one looks good.

2886
02:09:13,790 --> 02:09:14,960
Which one? This one.

2887
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:16,080
Sure.

2888
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:16,960
Right.

2889
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:18,160
Good. This looks nice.

2890
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:22,720
Can you carry it?

2891
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:23,360
Yes.

2892
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:23,960
Are you sure?

2893
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:26,430
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven.

2894
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:28,280
Let's get another pot of small ones.

2895
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:29,150
Sure.

2896
02:09:29,150 --> 02:09:30,400
I think it's not low enough.

2897
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:32,350
Okay, it's too heavy. Take it.

2898
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:35,600
We can put it back

2899
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:37,920
Then we can go back to pick the wood style.

2900
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:38,360
That's it.

2901
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:39,230
Pick wood.

2902
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:40,510
That's it, right?

2903
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:42,560
I feel like eating buffet.

2904
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:48,440
It feels like a buffet.

2905
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:50,840
Is our wood enough?

2906
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:53,120
She asked us to pick some small ones.

2907
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:54,080
Small ones. Okay.

2908
02:09:55,550 --> 02:09:56,640
Pick some nice wood.

2909
02:09:56,640 --> 02:09:57,920
This is...

2910
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:05,080
duck rack.

2911
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:08,800
I'm hungry.

2912
02:10:09,950 --> 02:10:10,680
This one.

2913
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,800
My name

2914
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:13,790
is too big.

2915
02:10:13,790 --> 02:10:16,280
I think the desert hills

2916
02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:16,960
OK.

2917
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:22,040
If you need to do it now,

2918
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:22,960
Look at our cotton.

2919
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:24,830
has been placed.

2920
02:10:24,830 --> 02:10:25,790
At this time,

2921
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:27,070
you need to use this hot melt gun.

2922
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:28,080
Stick the cotton on it.

2923
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:29,630
Use the hot melt rubber gun.

2924
02:10:29,630 --> 02:10:30,480
Don't burn your hands.

2925
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:32,600
Let me do it. I can take a photo

2926
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:34,910
I can take a photo for you.

2927
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:37,470
Yes, more.

2928
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:41,950
Sprinkle this. More.

2929
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:44,030
Do you want to spill it?

2930
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:45,360
It's heavy.

2931
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:47,120
You do it. I do it lightly.

2932
02:10:56,830 --> 02:10:57,440
Too much.

2933
02:10:58,110 --> 02:10:59,160
Too much

2934
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:00,670
Sorry.

2935
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:03,920
Sorry

2936
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:06,560
The moss should be paved

2937
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:07,520
Just use this

2938
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:08,080
Yes

2939
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:09,840
Like squid

2940
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:13,080
Behind the two fingers

2941
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:14,640
Do you have two fingers?

2942
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:16,400
Put it on a finger and a half.

2943
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:17,360
and put it higher.

2944
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:18,110
Isn't that good?

2945
02:11:19,710 --> 02:11:21,400
You dropped it like this.

2946
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:23,120
Two hands.

2947
02:11:23,680 --> 02:11:25,120
Be formal.

2948
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:26,240
Press it.

2949
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:28,920
Like this?

2950
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:29,920
Yes, you make it flat first.

2951
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,240
It's almost done.

2952
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:33,440
No.

2953
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:35,640
Place the whole floor first.

2954
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:37,470
Got it.

2955
02:11:38,110 --> 02:11:40,160
We just need to increase the rest later, right?

2956
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:41,400
Yes.

2957
02:11:42,750 --> 02:11:46,080
I really want to eat squid

2958
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:46,720
I'm so hungry.

2959
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:47,550
Is it too much?

2960
02:11:47,550 --> 02:11:48,720
I think we should balance it.

2961
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:52,990
Are we artistic?

2962
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:55,390
Yes.

2963
02:11:55,390 --> 02:11:56,080
And here

2964
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:57,280
Just make it a little higher

2965
02:11:58,750 --> 02:12:00,160
I really want to eat squid.

2966
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:04,000
You can see the level when you sit down.

2967
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:05,280
Right?

2968
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:06,200
A little ugly.

2969
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:09,240
I think it's pretty.

2970
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,230
It needs to be solid.

2971
02:12:11,230 --> 02:12:12,510
Give it to me and I'll press it.

2972
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:14,640
Grab more.

2973
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:18,000
It's not generous.

2974
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:18,960
Let me show you.

2975
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:21,720
You're done with this?

2976
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:25,200
Yes.

2977
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:26,910
OK.

2978
02:12:26,910 --> 02:12:27,520
Then we can

2979
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,920
clean the soil

2980
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,000
the roots of plants.

2981
02:12:30,590 --> 02:12:31,360
Go ahead.

2982
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:33,560
You want to take it out?

2983
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:37,310
It's gone if you pull it out like this

2984
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,800
Like combing hair.

2985
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:41,240
Let's remove

2986
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:42,270
Remove it first.

2987
02:12:42,270 --> 02:12:43,120
Like this.

2988
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:44,350
Yes, slowly.

2989
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:46,270
It's clean

2990
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,480
Pretty a little.

2991
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:50,720
You look like washing vegetables.

2992
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:53,720
I hope you can give me some beautiful photos.

2993
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:56,600
The moment I pull out the grass

2994
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:01,630
Let me take a photo for you.

2995
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,280
You look so funny.

2996
02:13:24,350 --> 02:13:26,880
Tell me who you want to work with.

2997
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:29,200
Can't you see what's inside?

2998
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:32,350
There are flowers.

2999
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:34,960
Like this.

3000
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:37,520
So you want to come with Hua?

3001
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:41,920
Hua.

3002
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:46,000
Tell me

3003
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:48,320
whom do you want to date?

3004
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:54,080
I want to go on a date with Hua.

3005
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:56,030
We can

3006
02:13:56,030 --> 02:13:57,080
keep talking.

3007
02:13:58,360 --> 02:14:00,640
Flowers and drawings are the easiest things I get along with.

3008
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:01,560
More relaxed than you.

3009
02:14:04,350 --> 02:14:05,440
Yes, you always scold me.

3010
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:09,040
Hua is always encouraging me.

3011
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:14,040
to complement each other.

3012
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,000
I think we can plant another one.

3013
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:20,320
We can plant another one here.

3014
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:21,280
A smaller one.

3015
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:24,320
How small?

3016
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:27,710
This one looks like me.

3017
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,440
You're not that dense.

3018
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:32,510
That split is more like you.

3019
02:14:35,070 --> 02:14:35,680
Okay.

3020
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,880
You make the moss.

3021
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:39,800
I'm out of gloves.

3022
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:46,400
I'll do it all, right?

3023
02:14:47,120 --> 02:14:48,400
You picked them?

3024
02:14:49,310 --> 02:14:50,430
You didn't even move.

3025
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:52,160
You chose it?

3026
02:14:53,630 --> 02:14:56,000
I might move if it's a boy.

3027
02:14:59,680 --> 02:15:00,720
Okay.

3028
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:01,240
Okay.

3029
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:03,320
I chose a girl with strong ears.

3030
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:04,510
Isn't it similar?

3031
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:07,360
Why isn't there me?

3032
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:08,510
No fatty.

3033
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:11,520
Not many boys.

3034
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:13,150
It's mainly not fattened.

3035
02:15:13,150 --> 02:15:13,950
It doesn't suit you.

3036
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:16,640
Okay.

3037
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,160
I made this.

3038
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:21,840
It's not bad.

3039
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:24,640
Unbelievable. We made this.

3040
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:28,440
The name of the ecosystem is

3041
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:29,400
Beautiful and Po Niu.

3042
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:31,800
We have a dog now.

3043
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:34,160
So we decided on this theme.

3044
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:36,190
Actually, I've been looking for

3045
02:15:36,190 --> 02:15:37,240
who are not fat.

3046
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:38,750
We can do it.

3047
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:41,240
I think this product has eight points.

3048
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:43,120
The final result is good.

3049
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:44,830
The remaining two points.

3050
02:15:44,830 --> 02:15:45,630
for Hua.

3051
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:47,550
I hope she will go with Fatty next time.

3052
02:15:54,430 --> 02:15:55,520
Please.

3053
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:56,000
OK.

3054
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,080
It'll be different if you come in.

3055
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:01,360
It's quite ceremonial.

3056
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:01,680
Yes.

3057
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,480
This restaurant is good.

3058
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:04,320
It's good.

3059
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:04,990
Not bad.

3060
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:06,680
You ordered.

3061
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:09,520
What a delicate person.

3062
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:14,590
Drink some water to warm yourself up.

3063
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:17,200
Drink it all

3064
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:24,720
Thank you.

3065
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:26,560
Salad.

3066
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:28,990
Do you eat grass normally?

3067
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:30,800
I don't usually eat much.

3068
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:32,920
Do you eat a lot of grass?

3069
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:34,000
Not much.

3070
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,070
I don't need that.

3071
02:16:40,639 --> 02:16:41,240
Do you think

3072
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:44,670
what do you think of

3073
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:46,270
in the past two dates?

3074
02:16:51,549 --> 02:16:53,309
I think

3075
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:58,080
I have a lot in common with Harry.

3076
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:59,709
And I like something similar.

3077
02:16:59,709 --> 02:17:00,120
So

3078
02:17:00,639 --> 02:17:01,840
There are many topics.

3079
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:02,910
And with Fatty,

3080
02:17:02,910 --> 02:17:04,600
I think

3081
02:17:05,719 --> 02:17:07,840
we can play together.

3082
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:11,230
But I don't think we have much to talk about.

3083
02:17:13,790 --> 02:17:14,520
What about me?

3084
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:16,639
What about you?

3085
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:19,200
is different

3086
02:17:19,709 --> 02:17:20,190
You have to...

3087
02:17:21,559 --> 02:17:22,520
Okay.

3088
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:23,120
Let me say mine first.

3089
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:24,080
I'll tell you later.

3090
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:25,200
How?

3091
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:28,120
I think Xinxin and I are more alike.

3092
02:17:29,629 --> 02:17:30,719
siblings.

3093
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:32,959
Tata and I

3094
02:17:32,959 --> 02:17:34,840
I think when we

3095
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:36,559
in the activity,

3096
02:17:36,559 --> 02:17:39,389
we can

3097
02:17:39,389 --> 02:17:40,480
to cooperate with each other.

3098
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,160
But I think after we go back to the house,

3099
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:44,600
it seems

3100
02:17:45,790 --> 02:17:46,559
talk much.

3101
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:50,750
I don't think we'll communicate as much as we do.

3102
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:52,920
What about me?

3103
02:17:56,670 --> 02:17:58,000
Okay.

3104
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,320
I'm very vengeful.

3105
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:00,879
It's okay.

3106
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:02,360
I'm not weak either.

3107
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:04,240
Okay.

3108
02:18:10,719 --> 02:18:11,799
So when you ski today,

3109
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:14,639
when you were skiing today?

3110
02:18:14,639 --> 02:18:16,639
I thought the slope wouldn't be that steep.

3111
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:18,400
When I fell down,

3112
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:19,639
my brain crashed.

3113
02:18:20,559 --> 02:18:22,270
I said, no.

3114
02:18:23,389 --> 02:18:23,920
What about you?

3115
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:25,760
I'm more...

3116
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:27,040
I was shocked.

3117
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:31,040
Delicious.

3118
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:34,879
I can think of the person

3119
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:35,920
you would be very happy

3120
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:36,920
I'm sure you'll be happy.

3121
02:18:37,879 --> 02:18:38,750
Yes, that's him.

3122
02:18:38,750 --> 02:18:39,639
He sat on that chair.

3123
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:40,639
He was like this.

3124
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:41,790
I'll choose this person for you.

3125
02:18:41,790 --> 02:18:43,760
I think you'll get along very happily.

3126
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:46,160
No matter who I think is better,

3127
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:47,639
I think it's more important

3128
02:18:47,639 --> 02:18:48,879
is more important.

3129
02:18:48,879 --> 02:18:51,040
I said OK.

3130
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:51,840
Let me see who it is.

3131
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:52,600
Did you guess it was me?

3132
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:53,440
Yes.

3133
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:55,760
Really?

3134
02:18:56,799 --> 02:18:57,240
Yes.

3135
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:58,040
So amazing.

3136
02:18:58,040 --> 02:18:59,549
On my way here,

3137
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:01,150
I knew it.

3138
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:06,320
Before this,

3139
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:08,799
you were basically older than you.

3140
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:11,360
My personal relationship experience.

3141
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:12,920
The boys I've met

3142
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:13,629
are older than me.

3143
02:19:15,959 --> 02:19:16,400
What about you?

3144
02:19:17,150 --> 02:19:17,559
Same.

3145
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:19,360
You're all older than you.

3146
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:20,559
Almost.

3147
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:21,400
Same

3148
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:23,520
So you like your type

3149
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:26,680
I can't say which type I like

3150
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:27,520
I really

3151
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:28,240
I feel...

3152
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:29,360
Feeling? Yes.

3153
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:31,639
I don't think the type is reliable.

3154
02:19:31,639 --> 02:19:32,320
Maybe.

3155
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:32,719
Yes.

3156
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:34,680
Just be happy.

3157
02:19:36,670 --> 02:19:37,879
Which time do you think you are the happiest?

3158
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:42,080
Of course today.

3159
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:45,440
Why?

3160
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:48,320
I can go skiing and eat with Tu.

3161
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:51,680
What about you?

3162
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:54,520
What do you think? Of course.

3163
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:55,640
Why?

3164
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:57,920
Because I'm very happy.

3165
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:09,440
Didn't you see

3166
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:10,920
wearing dark clothes today?

3167
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:11,600
I think so.

3168
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:13,160
You used to have more blue.

3169
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:16,400
I'm different.

3170
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:18,760
A different me.

3171
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:20,400
Are you a mutant Sakura?

3172
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,320
What do you think

3173
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:25,280
makes you feel

3174
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:27,520
not sincere.

3175
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:30,280
Tell me a specific behavior first.

3176
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:34,240
When you're with her, you should...

3177
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:36,520
Yes, I can't.

3178
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:37,440
I can't stand it.

3179
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:40,520
Do you remember when I was skiing,

3180
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:41,440
you asked me

3181
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:43,440
if you want to skate again.

3182
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:44,480
I can say whatever you want.

3183
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:45,240
Then you say you decide.

3184
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:46,120
I think it's good.

3185
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:47,560
Do we still skate?

3186
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:48,600
I'll listen to you.

3187
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:50,520
Listen to you, always listen to me.

3188
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:51,240
I don't know.

3189
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:52,000
I have no opinion.

3190
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:52,680
I'll listen to you.

3191
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:53,480
I have no opinion.

3192
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:54,400
I'll listen to you.

3193
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,320
I have my own opinion.

3194
02:20:55,320 --> 02:20:56,000
I just...

3195
02:20:56,440 --> 02:20:58,000
I can do whatever you do.

3196
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,520
I think it's good.

3197
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:01,800
But he still said he wanted my opinion.

3198
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:02,880
Then I felt

3199
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:04,560
he respect me.

3200
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:07,120
Although I said I'm not very

3201
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:07,760
not very strong,

3202
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:09,120
But if he doesn't ask me

3203
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:10,840
what he decided to do,

3204
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:11,880
I will be unhappy.

3205
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:13,520
Although I don't have to decide,

3206
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:14,960
but you can't take the right.

3207
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:17,000
Luckily, I asked.

3208
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:21,280
You know what?

3209
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:23,000
Luckily I asked.

3210
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:25,280
Like this.

3211
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:27,360
Got it.

3212
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:29,680
It's very subjective.

3213
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:31,680
For example, I went to dinner with my friends.

3214
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:34,280
And I play with my friends.

3215
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:35,080
Every time he eats,

3216
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:36,160
he would ask me what I want to eat.

3217
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:36,800
I'll say anything.

3218
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:37,520
Watch out.

3219
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:38,200
He really ordered it.

3220
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:38,920
I don't care.

3221
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:41,680
Because he knew he would ask me

3222
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:42,600
he would ask me.

3223
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:43,720
Or I'll feel uncomfortable.

3224
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:45,320
And I'll say anything

3225
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:46,920
I can say whatever they want.

3226
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:48,040
Then they come up and eat.

3227
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:49,520
They don't ask me what I want to eat.

3228
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:50,680
Yes.

3229
02:21:51,720 --> 02:21:52,800
You can try it next time.

3230
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:54,680
For example, skiing just now.

3231
02:21:54,680 --> 02:21:56,280
Do you want to do it again?

3232
02:21:56,280 --> 02:21:57,560
You should say that.

3233
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:58,920
Do you think I want to do it again?

3234
02:21:59,320 --> 02:22:00,000
Don't do this.

3235
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:01,440
Do you think I want to do it again?

3236
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:02,320
You should ask him with a smile.

3237
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:03,680
It sounds weird.

3238
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:09,080
Which dish do you think

3239
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:10,600
is the best?

3240
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:11,360
Three, two, one.

3241
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:12,520
That's all.

3242
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:13,320
Does it count?

3243
02:22:15,560 --> 02:22:16,920
I wanted to say it together with three, two, one.

3244
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:17,440
Because I think

3245
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:19,000
you will choose the same one as me.

3246
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:20,040
So I want to say,

3247
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:21,800
if the dessert counts.

3248
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:24,040
So I added a prelude.

3249
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:25,280
All the dishes are counted.

3250
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:28,120
And the rest will be ranked second and all meat.

3251
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:30,120
You like sweet food, right?

3252
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:31,600
No sweetness, no love.

3253
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:33,120
No sweetness, no meat.

3254
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:35,720
Got it.

3255
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:37,160
One more.

3256
02:22:40,400 --> 02:22:41,400
You do it cool.

3257
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:42,640
Try it. Cool.

3258
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:43,920
Like this.

3259
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:45,080
Choose your eyebrows. Cool.

3260
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:51,000
Let me take a photo for you.

3261
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,200
Let me take one like this.

3262
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:52,720
Like this.

3263
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:07,720
Like this. Like this.

3264
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:13,720
I won't laugh.

3265
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:25,000
Today is the happiest day

3266
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,600
in my room.

3267
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:28,120
I didn't expect that he chose one.

3268
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:28,720
relatively,

3269
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:30,680
some Western elements in it.

3270
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:31,760
I think it's very careful.

3271
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:33,840
When I came out of the ski resort,

3272
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:34,640
I found it was cold.

3273
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:36,120
We didn't wear gloves.

3274
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:36,920
He will go back.

3275
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:38,200
And he'll be ready.

3276
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:39,480
to wear gloves.

3277
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:41,080
So I think he is a very meticulous person

3278
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:42,280
very meticulous.

3279
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:44,760
This is a rare quality.

3280
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:47,040
I think both of us

3281
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:50,040
Eating or topic, tacit understanding,

3282
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:52,360
I think we are very similar.

3283
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:53,720
I think in front of her,

3284
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:54,960
in front of her.

3285
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:55,640
At the same time,

3286
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:57,360
my happiness can touch her.

3287
02:23:57,360 --> 02:23:59,560
I think this is the best way to get along with her.

3288
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:00,560
Full marks.

3289
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:01,800
I get 9.9 points.

3290
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:02,640
And 0.1.

3291
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:04,800
I think it's for the future date.

3292
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:06,560
is more satisfying.

3293
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:11,120
I slept late last night.

3294
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:12,320
Hua came to see me.

3295
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:14,400
to comfort you.

3296
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:17,160
Yes, talk to me.

3297
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:17,600
And...

3298
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:19,200
Do you think you need comfort?

3299
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:22,360
Yes.

3300
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:27,480
I believe the fifth minute

3301
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:31,600
the fifth minute we went in,

3302
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:33,040
we voted for that message.

3303
02:24:35,720 --> 02:24:36,080
Yes.

3304
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:36,800
At first sight,

3305
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:38,600
I voted for Hua. I gave it to...

3306
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:43,480
It's kind of friendly.

3307
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:45,640
Are you friendly to spicy meat

3308
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:47,000
or to her?

3309
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,280
She speaks like a Pu.

3310
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:51,920
and kind.

3311
02:24:51,920 --> 02:24:53,560
To be honest,

3312
02:24:54,560 --> 02:24:55,600
I found that

3313
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:58,640
I had a chance

3314
02:24:58,640 --> 02:24:59,960
to chat with Xiaoling alone.

3315
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:02,400
But I don't

3316
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:05,720
to ask that much.

3317
02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:06,600
She's a little...

3318
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:07,240
I think you two

3319
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:09,040
have similar growth environment.

3320
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:10,200
experience

3321
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:11,200
(and her experience.)

3322
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,160
And she

3323
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:14,920
is more like a brother.

3324
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:17,120
First of all, this is her personality.

3325
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:18,240
Yes, she has a good personality.

3326
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:19,880
Yes.

3327
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:21,760
I'm talking to her like a lesson.

3328
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:23,680
Yes, these two.

3329
02:25:24,320 --> 02:25:25,600
She will do this.

3330
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:28,200
It's like answering questions.

3331
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:29,720
When you talk,

3332
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:31,680
when you talk.

3333
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:33,400
So you know what?

3334
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:35,840
Yesterday,

3335
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:36,960
I realized

3336
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:41,560
the strength of a brother is so big.

3337
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:44,640
I never cared about this before.

3338
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:48,680
You're really good at intervention.

3339
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:49,960
Like a wall.

3340
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:50,680
Yes.

3341
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:52,320
Haven't you noticed that

3342
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:53,720
in our growth?

3343
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:56,560
You just think that you didn't do anything.

3344
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:57,880
But actually,

3345
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:59,560
you did a great job.

3346
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:00,680
In my relationship,

3347
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:02,760
I found

3348
02:26:02,760 --> 02:26:03,720
So yesterday,

3349
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:04,720
I thought

3350
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:07,200
we should communicate about this.

3351
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:07,880
I was too anxious.

3352
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:08,800
In the past,

3353
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:09,960
I think

3354
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:12,360
it's like how we get along

3355
02:26:12,360 --> 02:26:14,840
the other four siblings

3356
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:16,760
are good or

3357
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:19,040
we can learn these things.

3358
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:23,440
especially the ability to speak properly.

3359
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:24,720
I think

3360
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:26,840
We can communicate if we talk nicely.

3361
02:26:26,840 --> 02:26:28,160
You're more impatient than me.

3362
02:26:28,400 --> 02:26:29,640
Yes, I am.

3363
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:30,160
Me too.

3364
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:31,440
When we talk,

3365
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:32,880
more and more louder.

3366
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:34,000
Yes.

3367
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:34,800
It will become

3368
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:36,840
get excited.

3369
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:38,560
And a small thing

3370
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:39,880
It seems to be bigger.

3371
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:41,440
But it's just a big decibel.

3372
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:42,840
But it's a small matter.

3373
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:44,680
I think the soup and Xiaoling

3374
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:45,720
When they talk,

3375
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:47,280
I have no choice.

3376
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:48,360
Slow.

3377
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:49,160
If you talk to me like this,

3378
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:51,840
if you talk to me like this.

3379
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:54,000
Their communication is like...

3380
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,200
Come here. Let's talk.

3381
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:57,760
My communication is brazen.

3382
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:00,080
But I think

3383
02:27:00,080 --> 02:27:01,600
I've done well recently.

3384
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:04,000
I gave myself eight points.

3385
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:08,440
Eight points for myself?

3386
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Hua.

3387
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,440
I want to talk to you.

3388
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:16,040
What's wrong? Tell me.

3389
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:17,560
I just asked you how was your date.

3390
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:19,320
I think he keeps changing.

3391
02:27:19,320 --> 02:27:20,440
I don't want to

3392
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:22,200

3393
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:23,640

I'm not nervous. I'm thinking about how to say it.

3398
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:31,000
Okay, I don't feel anything.

3399
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:31,640
Say no more.

3400
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:34,040
Alright, stop it.

3401
02:27:34,400 --> 02:27:35,400

Who are you the best to?

3406
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,480
Love at first sight or...

3407
02:27:41,480 --> 02:27:42,120
Do you think

3408
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:43,240
a mature person?

3409
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:44,600
Don't weigh the pros and cons.

3410
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:46,320
