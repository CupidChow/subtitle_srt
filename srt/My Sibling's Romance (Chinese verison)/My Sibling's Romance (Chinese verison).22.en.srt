1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,760
I was kicked out once.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,920
I'm back.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,040
Good idol drama.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,000
I love it.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,720
Before you set off to the Ice World,

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,720
before you set off to the Ice World?

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,440
I swear to God that I didn't.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,840
Do you prefer love at first sight

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,280
or love grows over time?

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,440
I think 51 percent

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,560
love grows over time.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,200
49 percent love at first sight.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,320
The proportion and the answer

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,120
and the answer

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,680
I told you.

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,160
What's your last question?

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,880
I was an interviewer.

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,800
What do you mean?

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,720
Love Siblings.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,960
Double love!

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,640
and intervene in love and social therapy.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,600
"Love Siblings".

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,360
We are

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,240
a family member.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,080
We're going to

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,400
the update of this episode.

27
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,120
Should I wait for you?

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,920
Why are you bringing up food?

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,720
Don't you want to eat?

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,200
No, let's eat.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:47,920
Heat it up.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,440
We need to save food, you know?

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,720
Go in.

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,039
My shoes are upstairs.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,400
I'll go upstairs and change my shoes.

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,880
How are you?

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,240
How are you?

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,080
I'm fine.

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,960
I talked a lot.

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,199
I thought it would be dry.

41
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,280
No.

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,240
Yes, I won't.

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,400
I think you should

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,440
to Hua today.

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,480
Through the afternoon,

46
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,360
I regret it after I sent it.

47
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
Who did you send it to?

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,320
Hua.

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,079
Xinxin.

50
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,120
Send it to Xinxin.

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,920
Why?

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,200
Actually, I've been thinking

53
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,760
Why?

54
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,160
Did you contact her?

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,960
We're playing cards today.

56
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,440
Yes.

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,240
But

58
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,200
I'm not sure

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,040
Except you,

60
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
three girls

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,520
might be a thought.

62
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
I mean,

63
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,160
just like what I did today.

64
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,120
get to know each other more.

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,720
Kind of.

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,040
Yes, I think so too.

67
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,200
I think every one of my past

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,520
I'm just like you.

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,640
for Harry.

70
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,040
We have the same idea.

71
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,680
But my order is a bit wrong.

72
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,920
A little.

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,680
Right?

74
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,200
I've already sent it. That's it.

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,040
I just want to know more about you.

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,280
Yes.

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,400
But I got two today.

78
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,000
One is Susu.

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,960
The other one is unknown.

80
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
It should be Flower.

81
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
I think so too.

82
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
Because after receiving this text,

83
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,920
I said

84
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,280
regret.

85
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,680
Yes.

86
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,040
You forgot, right?

87
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,720
Yes, I did. Because I...

88
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,960
Now I feel

89
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,079
the order is not carefully.

90
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,040
Think carefully.

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,960
Yes.

92
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,640
I'll get you a cup.

93
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,320
This is for me.

94
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,840
Yes.

95
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,760
I thought you wanted me to give it to someone else.

96
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,000
This is my exclusive cup.

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,720
Thank you. This is...

98
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
Heat it with water.

99
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,680
Who is this for?

100
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,840
Flower.

101
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,960
I pushed her down today.

102
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,480
Did I hurt her?

103
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:05,920
Actually, I wanted to give her that cup.

104
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
You want me to give this to Hua?

105
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,360
Yes.

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,280
I'll give it to her secretly.

107
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,520
No need to give it to her secretly.

108
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,920
But you have to say

109
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,040
I accidentally pushed her down.

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,360
You did it on purpose.

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,279
I didn't mean it.

112
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,519
There's a car behind.

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,200
I'll leave it and give it to her later.

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
I wanted to buy a cup of water.

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,080
Then the flowers were there.

116
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,600
So I picked one for Hua.

117
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,960
I'll buy a glass.

118
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,200
Do you want it?

119
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,320
A huge glass? Sure.

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,040
I accidentally

121
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,080
I tripped her.

122
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,960
Actually, I wanted to bring her that cup.

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,760
I think I should apologize myself.

124
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,120
But after thinking about it,

125
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,240
this is not good.

126
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,720
Today is the first day

127
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,800
to contact Xiaoling.

128
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,040
Then she suddenly turned back

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,480
to send flowers gifts.

130
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,520
It doesn't look good.

131
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,200
Let Xinxin go.

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,680
I'm freezing.

133
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,520
Hua.

134
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,560
I have something for you.

135
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,480
Give it to Xiaoling.

136
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,640
Fatty gave it to you.

137
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,400
I know.

138
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,960
He said he was sorry

139
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
He said he's sorry.

140
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,280
Okay, you can do that.

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you.

142
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,160
When Fatty asked Esther

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,120
to me,

144
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,480
I think this action

145
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,200
is quite good.

146
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,760
Because if Fatty

147
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,120
give me the cup now,

148
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,000
I might refuse.

149
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,600
Soup went to talk to Susu.

150
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,760
You saw it.

151
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,520
Not just now.

152
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,080
Soup went to talk to Susu.

153
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,360
Really?

154
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,240
Why don't you get the soup?

155
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,880
I was wondering if I should go to him.

156
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Let's find him.

157
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,440
Come in.

158
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,160
Is anyone here?

159
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,200
No.

160
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,560
What do you think?

161
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,000
No.

162
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,760
She came to me again.

163
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,200
She said she told Terri

164
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,520
they would be friends in the future.

165
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,920
But Tae-seo told me

166
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,840
that we're just friends now.

167
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,400
I don't know. I'll keep looking.

168
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,840
It's hard.

169
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,159
That's what I'm thinking right now.

170
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,040
Will you send it to her tomorrow?

171
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,640
I'll wait for her all day.

172
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,360
Let me see her.

173
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,760
to see if what she said is true.

174
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,440
Let's see how she'll be tomorrow.

175
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I'll wait for a day.

176
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,040
Thank you.

177
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:52,960
Okay.

178
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,640
Have a rest.

179
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,720
Bye.

180
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,240
Are you hesitating?

181
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,080
No.

182
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,480
I think someone might misunderstand me.

183
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
It's true.

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,440
He misunderstood.

185
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,160
Yes.

186
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
But I asked him a question this afternoon.

187
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,600
If the person you like

188
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,800
if the person you like

189
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,200
He doesn't think he'll do anything.

190
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,280
The soup won't change.

191
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,360
But I knocked on his door once today.

192
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,520
I was kicked out once.

193
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,680
I'm back.

194
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,200
Good idol drama.

195
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,159
I love it.

196
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,120
What?

197
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
I love it.

198
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,240
He said we'll talk later.

199
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
I came back for a long time.

200
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,159
I went to knock, and he came out.

201
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,280
What did you say?

202
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,880
Seriously.

203
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,600
This is quite fun.

204
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,280
Not bad, right?

205
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,280
From the first day to today,

206
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,920
they all think I’m E.

207
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,880
But I think when we talk,

208
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
when we chatted.

209
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,440
I'm not angry.

210
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,600
Actually, I really feel cold sweat for her.

211
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Because I think

212
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,960
it wouldn't have been two days in a row.

213
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,560
for two days.

214
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,920
Write it down.

215
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,240
Are you done?

216
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,320
Yes.

217
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,840
The Avengers.

218
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,400
Go!

219
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,840
Come on, Tu.

220
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,520
His chassis are too high.

221
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,760
He's very considerate.

222
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,400
You've been blocking the wind by my side.

223
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Don't let me down.

224
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,960
I'll try.

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,800
Who is this for?

226
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Flower.

227
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,640
I pushed her down today.

228
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,320
Will you send it to her tomorrow?

229
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,040
I'll wait for her all day.

230
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,080
Let me see if what she said is true.

231
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,680
Let's see how she'll be tomorrow.

232
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,720
I'll wait for a day.

233
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,600
Thank you.

234
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,080
I don't understand.

235
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm just sad.

236
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,400
I had no choice.

237
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,480
Let's go.

238
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,440
Let's play the game.

239
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,480
Hua, draw one for me.

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,120
Why don't we go to the surrounding place?

241
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,720
Here.

242
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,440
I can't see your things.

243
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Sit over here.

244
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,720
You sit there.

245
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,800
It's okay. Take a seat.

246
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,280
Sit over there.

247
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
Sit here.

248
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,120
You sit here.

249
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,480
It's okay.

250
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,760
You can't look at this card.

251
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,320
Yes.

252
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,280
Your phone.

253
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,120
You lost.

254
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,200
You lost.

255
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,680
Let me see what you are.

256
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,160
Switch positions.

257
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,960
You...

258
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:28,960
Come on.

259
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,720
Why aren't you sitting?

260
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,640
Come on.

261
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,120
Coming.

262
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,920
Pick a card, Tae-seo.

263
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,760
Okay.

264
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,640
No, I'm thinking

265
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,720
I think we should tie it up.

266
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,320
Because if we don't tie it,

267
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,960
we can't do body movements.

268
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,080
Yes.

269
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,520
Just like this.

270
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,360
We need to do this.

271
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,120
Come on.

272
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,680
I can't tie it.

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,800
Let me tie it for you.

274
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,000
Should we ask Harry to change one?

275
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,600
Because I think this one is too hard.

276
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,560
This one is too hard.

277
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,040
Do you want to change it?

278
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,320
This one is too hard.

279
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,360
It's too hard.

280
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,680
We can't lose.

281
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,560
Then change another one.

282
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,240
Change one.

283
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,800
I'll change it. Then I'll really change it.

284
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,440
Stand up.

285
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,280
Who's taller?

286
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,240
No.

287
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,720
No, I'm just telling you.

288
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,360
No.

289
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,560
Get up and compete.

290
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680
It's really okay.

291
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,640
Tata, you...

292
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,520
I can't see it now.

293
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,760
Which one of us is taller?

294
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I can't tell.

295
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,280
I'm blind.

296
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,160
Xinxin, who do you think is taller?

297
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
I think you're taller.

298
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,280
Xin.

299
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,520
You've been here for over a minute.

300
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,360
You're messing with me.

301
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,640
Next.

302
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,160
What?

303
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,520
How will you go home during Chinese New Year?

304
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
I'll drive.

305
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,080
How are you going to go home? Are you going home?

306
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,840
I'm going home too.

307
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,040
Okay, that's all.

308
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,000
You're finally going home.

309
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,320
I didn't say I'm going back.

310
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,560
I said go back.

311
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,400
Or you'll guess it.

312
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,680
You have to change.

313
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,720
Otherwise, you won't be able to play.

314
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,560
Hua, is your makeup fast?

315
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,240
No.

316
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,360
What about me?

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,440
You... I don't know.

318
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,240
I've never put on makeup with you.

319
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,840
I think your hair is

320
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,400
Right.

321
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,640
A little bit.

322
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,360
It's too high.

323
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
I can't say it's tall or short.

324
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,640
Right?

325
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,760
Shorty.

326
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,480
You're right.

327
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,400
What is the opposite word?

328
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,160
What is the opposite word?

329
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know.

330
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,160
You don't know?

331
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,200
What is the opposite word?

332
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,040
Yes.

333
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,720
Don't be so conservative.

334
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,480
Not conservative at all.

335
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,400
This is Tata's new card.

336
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,960
Yes.

337
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,400
Which star do you like the most?

338
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,080
You didn’t tell me in the end.

339
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,520
Song Weilong.

340
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,520
Why do you like him?

341
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,680
He's handsome.

342
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
What?

343
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,840
I'm already full.

344
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,800
It's over.

345
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,760
Let's end it.

346
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,080
Map, what are you doing?

347
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,840
I'm making that thing.

348
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,080
So many people are watching.

349
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,760
This is enough.

350
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,080
It'll be thick, right?

351
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,360
Definitely.

352
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
I'll do it. I'm more professional than you.

353
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,000
This is his mission.

354
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,400
I know. I'll make one for you.

355
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
Is it sugar?

356
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,200
You need to make a comparison.

357
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,880
Just one feeling will do.

358
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,000
No need.

359
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,800
He'll be stubborn if he fails.

360
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,560
Let him do it.

361
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,760
How hard is it?

362
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,760
Hurry up and shoot the video.

363
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,200
Record me.

364
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,960
You failed.

365
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,120
What do you want me to take?

366
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,800
One shot.

367
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,040
Why is he so stubborn?

368
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,880
Seriously.

369
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,400
Take it out.

370
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,160
You scalded me.

371
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,120
Slow down. Don't rush me.

372
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,920
What? It's wrapped.

373
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,920
Who wants to taste this strawberry?

374
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,160
You're the hardest to talk.

375
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,680
Light sugar.

376
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,080
It's actually sugar water.

377
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,760
Eat it yourself.

378
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,640
There's no crispy sound.

379
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
A mission is coming.

380
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,520
Come here together.

381
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,440
Boys' guardian date

382
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,320
have all been invited.

383
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,320
The siblings invited by many boys

384
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,760
will go to the Mirror House as an interviewer.

385
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,040
(The final date)

386
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,120
to decide the girl's final date.

387
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,680
You can't tell your siblings

388
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,080
to girls in any way.

389
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,920
Remember to keep a secret for your date.

390
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,440
Here's the map.

391
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,320
Hello, Tu, can you hear me?

392
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,720
Yes.

393
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,720
I have a few questions for you.

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
Before you set off to the Ice World,

395
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,160
before you set off to the Ice World?

396
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,240
No.

397
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,960
I swear I didn't.

398
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,920
Actually, I was very glad

399
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,440
I didn't receive the invitation.

400
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,920
I missed the chance to invite others.

401
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,000
Because I think

402
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,120
I was quite confused.

403
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,600
I didn't have anyone I wanted to invite.

404
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,600
When I was being tortured,

405
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,920
I was very cautious

406
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,520
and answer her questions.

407
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,320
Because I want to

408
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,720
more about her.

409
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,000
Do you prefer love at first sight

410
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
or love grows over time?

411
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,640
I think I prefer love growing over time.

412
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,760
Because I found that I have more contact

413
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,520
and the process in time,

414
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,400
I think you can really tell

415
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,760
if you really have feelings for her.

416
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,960
not the feeling of love at first sight.

417
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,880
If you don't like

418
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,160
at first sight,

419
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,400
you can also accept the love

420
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,760
after a long time.

421
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,359
Really?

422
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,040
Yes.

423
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,160
The people around you

424
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,880
think of you the most?

425
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,200
A happy puppy.

426
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm happy and lively every day.

427
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,840
Yes.

428
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,040
Do you think you are that kind of person?

429
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,720
Actually, I have a stage

430
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,880
to recover.

431
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,320
During the day,

432
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
with everyone during the day.

433
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,920
But when I was tired,

434
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,760
I need to be alone.

435
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,120
You still need

436
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
to spend time alone

437
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
to restore my energy.

438
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,720
Yes.

439
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,680
I don't like being together

440
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,840
all the time.

441
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,120
What do you want to ask me in the end?

442
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,000
I want to ask Tata, if she goes for a backup,

443
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,600
will she prefer new people

444
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,000
or interact with the old?

445
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,520
Let Tata choose.

446
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,200
No need to answer.

447
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,520
It's a bit straightforward.

448
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,640
I think I can accept

449
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,000
I can accept it.

450
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,160
It depends on your performance.

451
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
In the end, Tata

452
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,960
to decide.

453
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,840
Okay.

454
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,800
Okay, it's done.

455
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,520
Thank you.

456
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,960
Are you ready, Harry?

457
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,120
I'm ready.

458
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,640
Come on.

459
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,880
I have a few questions for you.

460
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,960
Do you prefer love at first sight

461
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,400
or love grows over time?

462
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,760
I think 51 percent

463
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,680
love grows over time.

464
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,320
49 percent love at first sight.

465
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,080
What's the difference?

466
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,640
Love grows over time.

467
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,400
It can help me understand one person better.

468
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,560
But falling in love at first sight

469
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,400
That's not love at first sight.

470
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,960
I like her.

471
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
I said OK, then I'll take her.

472
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,080
Right?

473
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,200
We have to get along.

474
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,960
The proportion and the answer

475
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,760
and the answer

476
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,320
is different.

477
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,480
Because I just think

478
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,320
love at first sight,

479
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,280
It could be.

480
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,800
I think it's 70 percent.

481
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,960
But I think he's good.

482
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,600
It makes me feel that

483
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,520
of my age.

484
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
What do people think of you

485
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,400
the most people around you?

486
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,640
You can describe it with some words.

487
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,440
In the small house,

488
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,840
they would say

489
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm E. I pretend to be an introvert.

490
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,120
But every time I take the initiative

491
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,680
I talk to her

492
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,720
like a tower.

493
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,960
actually

494
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
in my heart.

495
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,480
To be honest,

496
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,440
It doesn't mean

497
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,040
doesn't mean the activity in your heart

498
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,320
is just a disguise.

499
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,120
And my family

500
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,760
would say I'm more reliable.

501
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,360
Lastly, I still want to ask

502
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,280
why you chose to invite Tata.

503
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,880
I want to know why he invited me.

504
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,920
because he invited me this time.

505
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,400
I can see that

506
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,640
he really wanted to ask me out.

507
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,000
or is it an objective factor?

508
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,240
You have to give it to me.

509
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,960
So he chose me.

510
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,720
to choose me.

511
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,680
Got him.

512
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,720
Nothing.

513
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,400
Because I'm just

514
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,240
I think

515
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,960
if I miss this chance,

516
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
I'll really miss it.

517
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,200
And I won't spend more time

518
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,440
in this room.

519
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,520
So I think

520
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,160
as long as I like someone,

521
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,040
I think I should choose her.

522
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,200
Because tomorrow is her birthday.

523
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
I think this is very important.

524
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,640
I also prepared something for her.

525
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,760
for her.

526
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,640
I think a birthday should be perfect.

527
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,560
Okay.

528
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,880
Okay.

529
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,360
Thank you.

530
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,640
Bye.

531
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,360
Bye.

532
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,160
It's finally my turn.

533
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,160
Hello.

534
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,240
Let's get started.

535
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,040
Okay.

536
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,160
I know it's me for the interview.

537
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,000
I was still imagining

538
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,520
The picture is sitting opposite.

539
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,640
What do you think?

540
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,880
Okay.

541
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,160
I think

542
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,480
a little insecure.

543
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,840
Why do you give her a sense of security?

544
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,080
I may have a little brain in love,

545
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,640
I just want to follow my boyfriend.

546
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,120
How do you care about her?

547
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,240
The specific way?

548
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,880
In the morning,

549
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,080
what do you want for breakfast?

550
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,360
I think this is

551
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,120
a signal for me to take the initiative.

552
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,280
I wanted to make sandwiches for her,

553
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,960
but she was already eating.

554
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,080
so I didn't say much.

555
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,080
You can take the initiative in this kind of thing.

556
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,520
Yes.

557
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,960
Just ask more, you know?

558
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,240
Okay, next.

559
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,880
What would you take her

560
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,960
what would you take her to do?

561
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,760
I usually think about where girls want to go.

562
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,360
I can go with her.

563
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,840
Will you force yourself?

564
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,600
I won't.

565
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,800
I think if she wants to do what she likes

566
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,320
to do what she likes,

567
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,560
I think I'll be happy too.

568
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,120
Do you understand?

569
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,280
Yes.

570
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,560
Hello.

571
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,040
Hello.

572
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,880
The first question.

573
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,480
Okay.

574
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,640
What do you think you have

575
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,520
to attract Hua?

576
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,920
I think my personality

577
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,360
attract Hua.

578
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,200
how others judge you.

579
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,160
Maybe it's humor

580
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,080
and responsible.

581
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,120
Sometimes we have the overall view.

582
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,320
It's heavy.

583
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,880
Actually, I have my delicate side.

584
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,440
Some people can feel it.

585
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,440
Okay.

586
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,160
Tell me about your relationship.

587
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I may not be

588
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,000
at this stage.

589
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,800
What about the past?

590
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,560
I might have experienced a lot before,

591
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,320
but I'm okay with it.

592
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,520
How do you feel?

593
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,440
Actually, I'm serious about every relationship.

594
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,280
What do you usually break up for?

595
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,760
In fact, every break-up

596
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,320
was peaceful.

597
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,120
We divided it after discussion.

598
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,240
I have my personality.

599
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,400
But I don't delay breaking up.

600
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,160
No.

601
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,640
If you can see

602
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,480
others have feelings for her,

603
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,160
What will you do?

604
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,920
or reactions.

605
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,240
I'll try my best.

606
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
I won't be the modest one.

607
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,840
Okay.

608
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,720
All the questions are over.

609
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,440
Thank you.

610
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,080
I think everyone is

611
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,680
is quite straightforward and sharp.

612
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,000
Yes.

613
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,880
You can think about

614
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,400
in your life experience

615
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,760
is the most memorable

616
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,720
or the most unforgettable.

617
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,880
the most unforgettable.

618
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
I had an interview

619
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
a very funny interview.

620
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,280
I went to interview "My Wife's Romantic Trip".

621
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,520
Why didn't you go?

622
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,440
No, I didn't.

623
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,200
It's a story about failing the interview.

624
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,240
My interview was funny.

625
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,400
Because I thought it would be funny

626
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,080
they want you to be funny.

627
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,960
But the atmosphere at the scene was really good.

628
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,480
I told my husband

629
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,880
about our relationship.

630
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,680
from the beginning to now,

631
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,160
something funny.

632
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,520
But that day,

633
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,720
I was very tired at work.

634
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,600
We talked for three to four hours.

635
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,440
Then the directors and producers

636
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,560
They all left.

637
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,400
Then I was very tired.

638
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,480
My husband and I

639
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,000
My husband is standing.

640
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,560
I lean on him like this.

641
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,400
Then he held me like this.

642
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,520
Both of them didn't talk.

643
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,920
in a very low state.

644
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,760
Then a director

645
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,800
went to the toilet.

646
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,640
He came out and saw us like this.

647
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,960
We shot off.

648
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,000
It's like we've been discovered.

649
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,760
We're just legally married.

650
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,040
Because we were there just now.

651
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,160
very funny and high.

652
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,600
Then he suddenly left.

653
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,400
You two were like this.

654
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,840
Yeah, we didn't go anyway.

655
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,920
Maybe it's because we shouldn't be so close.

656
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,040
I see.

657
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,640
You know what? I was an interviewer.

658
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,560
What do you mean?

659
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,120
I need to choose someone

660
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,600
as the girl

661
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,400
girls don't even know

662
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,240
about tomorrow's date.

663
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,120
Because it's a boy

664
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,280
to the room of Mirror.

665
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,960
They don't know.

666
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,400
Yes.

667
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,640
Really?

668
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,520
He has a lot of power.

669
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,840
How will you do the interview?

670
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,840
Give me ten minutes.

671
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,000
I'll ask them

672
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,560
the questions I care about.

673
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,680
You've been interviewed. Who can't say it?

674
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,720
You can't say that.

675
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,880
I think

676
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,440
you may have more contact

677
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,520
with someone.

678
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,920
Did you choose him?

679
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,520
No.

680
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,880
I'm just following your preference.

681
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,800
you might choose someone else.

682
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,120
At that time,

683
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,280
I chose the map.

684
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,560
I didn't choose Fatty.

685
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,840
Tu and who, Fatty.

686
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,320
So no matter who I think is better,

687
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,760
I think it's more important

688
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,920
is more important.

689
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,400
Or it's more important who you like.

690
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,280
Then I chose someone else.

691
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,080
If you

692
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,840
have no interest

693
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,200
about this person,

694
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,520
it's good to be friends.

695
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,200
I don't understand.

696
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,080
So who is it?

697
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,880
I don't know who the date is.

698
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,160
I'm happy and looking forward to it.

699
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,520
But I'm quite nervous.

700
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,960
You'll know tomorrow at 9 a.m.

701
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,480
But I think

702
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,280
if you respect your inner preference,

703
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,920
your inner preference.

704
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,160
I don't understand what you're saying.

705
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,640
It's okay. You'll understand.

706
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,440
You need to grow.

707
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
I chose it for you.

708
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,240
Yes.

709
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,960
Okay.

710
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,880
He did win his sister's heart.

711
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,320
Yes.

712
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,240
I think he did it on purpose.

713
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,880
Look forward to it.

714
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,200
I'm looking forward to it. I'm surprised.

715
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
I didn't expect two people would choose me.

716
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,440
Because I don't think

717
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,040
I don't think I'm cute.

718
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,200
No, it's cute.

719
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,880
Maybe this word is not suitable.

720
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,080
But you should know what I mean.

721
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,400
Yes, you don't like others.

722
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,360
Yes.

723
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,600
Sometimes you also

724
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,320
When playing games,

725
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,640
when playing games.

726
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,160
You know me very well.

727
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
Don't expose me.

728
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,880
Anyway, I don't think you need to think too much.

729
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,360
Just go on a date happily.

730
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:16,840
Let's go.

731
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,480
Let's go.

732
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,920
Get up.

733
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,560
Give me a hand.

734
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,880
He's in a good mood today.

735
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,080
Really.

736
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,680
Everyone wants to act cute.

737
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,480
I really want to know who it is.

738
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,720
Both of them are happy.

739
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,440
Do you want to hear

740
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,280
what happened today?

741
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,240
You sent it to Tata?

742
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,360
She sent you her message.

743
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,920
Isn't it a boy's date today?

744
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
The tower I don't choose?

745
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,480
You should choose a tower.

746
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,240
We need to compete.

747
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,280
After the competition, we go to the Mirror House

748
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,440
facing a one-sided mirror.

749
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,000
He can see me.

750
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,160
I can't see him.

751
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,880
He kept answering questions with his earphones on.

752
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,920
Then he chose me after playing the game.

753
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Do you have a text?

754
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,360
Yes.

755
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,080
It should be Tae-seo.

756
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,040
My brother chose it.

757
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,200
I thought Tata and Tarri watched it together.

758
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,080
I didn't expect Tarri was the only one.

759
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,560
He was so sincere.

760
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,600
I didn't expect that the tower was right across the street.

761
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:31,880
Yes.

762
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,720
Yes.

763
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,880
I'll go on a date with her tomorrow.

764
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,280
Tomorrow?

765
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,800
Yes.

766
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,600
Who texted you today?

767
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,440
Tata.

768
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,520
How did you know?

769
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,200
It's too obvious. She said she'll see you tomorrow.

770
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Especially to Harry.

771
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,520
No one sent me Harry except her.

772
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,920
What do you usually do?

773
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,160
Harry.

774
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,040
Good.

775
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,840
So funny.

776
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,400
This silly smile.

777
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,040
What? You don't believe me?

778
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,640
No, Xin, didn't you send it to you?

779
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,760
Xinxin didn't send it to me today.

780
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,360
Maybe she is

781
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,920
in a bad state.

782
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,800
He didn't send it to me today.

783
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,120
Maybe because I'm going on a date with someone,

784
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,360
because I'm going on a date with someone.

785
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,640
She doesn't know you're going on a date with Tata.

786
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,680
I'm already here. Don't worry about it.

787
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,560
Okay.

788
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,640
What he should say is

789
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,720
he's already very obvious.

790
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,200
Yes.

791
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,880
I have an announcement.

792
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,520
The day after tomorrow,

793
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,400
So get up early the day after tomorrow.

794
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,080
When I knew I had a date,

795
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,600
I had a guess.

796
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,120
I was invited by Soup.

797
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,200
Let's go.

798
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,280
Let's go.

799
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,640
Why didn't I see Xinxin?

800
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,800
I'm looking for her too.

801
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
I think she's in a bad mood.

802
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,360
Yes.

803
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,400
I also think she's in a bad mood.

804
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,680
I want to talk to Xinxin.

805
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Me too.

806
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,360
It's okay.

807
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
When she comes back,

808
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,680
I want to write her a note.

809
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,160
Because I'm afraid she doesn't want to talk.

810
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,840
Right?

811
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Give it to her secretly.

812
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,320
What if she still doesn't want to talk?

813
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,200
Then everyone knows her.

814
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,960
I think

815
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,240
let her know

816
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,280
that someone cares about her feelings.

817
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,880
Yes.

818
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,000
Linlin!

819
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,440
You're back.

820
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,480
I'm back.

821
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,840
You're back.

822
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,600
Are you in a bad mood?

823
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,400
Obviously.

824
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,800
What?

825
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,760
Nothing.

826
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,440
Xin, look below your pillow.

827
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,720
My pillow.

828
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,120
Don't prepare a gift for me.

829
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,640
Secretly. Secretly.

830
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,040
I think Esther's emotions are not right.

831
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,880
In my understanding,

832
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,320
I think Xin

833
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,800
she didn't receive the love message.

834
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,440
I can relate to it.

835
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,480
Because I haven't received

836
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,160
for two days.

837
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,720
I understand how she feels.

838
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,240
So I want to comfort her.

839
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,280
You're going to make me cry.

840
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,760
I'm touched after watching it.

841
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,480
I think receiving this friendship these days

842
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,760
these days.

843
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,560
I love flowers.

844
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,520
You always make me sad.

845
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,840
I have to keep sending it to you.

846
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,840
It's a bit domineering.

847
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,240
Yes.

848
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,840
That's how I am.

849
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,280
You were happier last afternoon.

850
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,160
or last night?

851
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm happier with you.

852
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,160
So I sent you the message.

853
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,000
Why do you give her a sense of security?

854
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,440
How do you

855
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,280
care about her?

856
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,800
How?

857
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,880
It's okay

858
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,320
How is it okay?

859
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,320
Luta made glutinous rice balls. Thank you.

860
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,160
Let's eat. It's not cold.

861
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,560
There happens to be black glutinous rice and black sesame.

862
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,040
So I choose black sesame for you.

863
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,800
Thank you.

864
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,600
But love is the only thing

865
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,160
or mature.

866
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,160
Feelings

867
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,320
It's emotional.

868
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,080
or rational.

869
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,080
Look forward to it.

870
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,080
I'm looking forward to it.

871
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,880
Just go on a date happily.

872
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,080
Xin, eat more.

873
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,240
You want cake?

874
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,960
I can't eat it.

875
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,720
I think you are an excellent person.

876
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,320
In the next episode,

877
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,040
the three-group protective dates.

878
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,360
Can we have fun

879
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,120
with your brother?

880
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,400
where other people's love will go.

881
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,520
Let's look forward to the next episode.

882
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,320
Let's sing "Love and Sisters".

883
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,639
Let love double.

884
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,239
Hua.

885
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,679
I want to talk to you.

886
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,280
What's wrong? Tell me.

887
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,800
I just asked you how was your date.

888
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,560
I think he keeps changing.

889
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,679
I don't want to

890
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,440
to be alone.

891
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,880
It's normal

892
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,360
to change your mind.

893
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,480
Well,

894
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,280
Are you nervous?

895
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,840
I'm not nervous. I'm thinking about how to say it.

896
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,239
Okay, I don't feel anything.

897
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:50,880
Say no more.

898
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,280
Alright, stop it.

899
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,639
I need the Mirror House

900
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,960
to have a conversation.

901
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,719
In the small house.

902
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,440
First impression.

903
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,240
Who are you the best to?

904
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,720
Love at first sight or...

905
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,360
Do you think

906
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,480
a mature person?

907
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,840
Don't weigh the pros and cons.

908
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,560
Is it that long?

909
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,160
Every Thursday at 18:00 p.m. Members enjoy the replication

910
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,080
It's on the newspaper, and the clients are looking for "Super Drama Show". and watch more interesting content.
