1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,680
Huahua
I'm sweating.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,800
Huahua
I'm sweating.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,730
I'm the one who's really sweating.
Tata

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,040
I think I said something wrong.
Tata

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,440
Huahua
Xiaoling keeps eating and drinking.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,600
Xiaoling
I'm trying to distract myself.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,520
otherwise, I'll keep thinking about it.
Xiaoling

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,200
Huahua
Okay.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,800
Huahua
Come on.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,080
Xiaoling
I'm quite honest.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,920
Zhu Dan
It shows that Xiaoling is really sincere.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,640
She cares.
Zhu Dan

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,720
Zhang Zining
She's taking it seriously.

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,200
Yang Gen
So I understand why Tangtang

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,840
asked Tutu so directly.
Yang Gen

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,360
Yang Gen
Because Tangtang knows

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,760
his sister is an alternative.
Yang Gen

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,600
Zhang Zining
Right.

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,880
Xiaoling
I remember now.

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,160
Xiaoling actually played a game with Tutu before.
Xiaoling

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,800
It seems like we were all at the piano.

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Xiaoling
It was like after the sports meet that day.

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Then we started asking Tutu
Xiaoling

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,440
about his impression of you.
Xiaoling

25
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,640
Xiaoling
But you weren't there, it seems.

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,240
I probably wasn't there.
Tata

27
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,040
Xiaoling
Then they asked,

28
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,920
if you, Tutu,
Xiaoling

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,720
Xiaoling
are the type to fall in love at first sight.

30
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,480
Then Tutu thought for a moment.
Xiaoling

31
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,140
He said yes.
Xiaoling

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,120
I don't know.
Tata

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,760
Xiaoling
Then they asked about the sports meet that day,

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,520
Tutu
Xiaoling

35
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,360
Xiaoling
if there was a moment when he felt his heart flutter for you.

36
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,960
Tutu said there was.
Xiaoling

37
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,490
Tutu said there was.

38
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Tata
When?

39
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,640
Xiaoling
He said it was when you were playing with that

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
tire-like thing sliding down.
Xiaoling

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,800
Xiaoling
He said you turned back and smiled at him.

42
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,880
Huahua
Yes, that moment when you turned back and smiled at him.

43
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,080
Why did I turn around?
Tata

44
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,440
Tutu
Nice.

45
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,480
There's a chance.
Tutu

46
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,400
Xiaoling
He said he felt a spark in that moment.

47
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,440
Then I said,
Xiaoling

48
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,520
Xiaoling
On the surface, I

49
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay.
Xiaoling

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
but deep down,
Xiaoling

51
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,320
I didn't expect I would be in control of this situation.
Xiaoling

52
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,920
I didn't expect I would be in control of this situation.

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,320
Huahua
She came right in with a sincere question.

54
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,360
A soul-searching question.
Huahua

55
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,840
Come on,
Xiaoling

56
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,880
Susu
she came in blinking her big eyes and asked.

57
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,039
Zhu Dan
It's scary when there's too much mutual information.

58
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,920
Xiaolu
Actually, it's better to know.

59
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,800
For those who really want to be in a relationship,
Xiaolu

60
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Yang Gen
You see, Xiaoling never thought

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,520
that Tutu considered her as a second choice.
Yang Gen

62
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,840
Yang Gen
So after she learned this,

63
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,840
she started to connect the dots from their past interactions.
Yang Gen

64
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,280
Yang Gen
Yang Gen: She wanted to verify Tutu's interactions with her,

65
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,640
to figure out exactly where she stood.
Yang Gen

66
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,410
to figure out exactly where she stood.

67
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,160
Yang Gen
Have you ever experienced in your relationships

68
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,759
something like this,
Yang Gen

69
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,280
Yang Gen
a secret you didn't know before?

70
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,960
Xiaolu
I only found out after marriage

71
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,620
that my husband has dyslexia.
Xiaolu

72
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,560
Xiaolu
Of course, he also

73
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,600
found out after marriage that I have
Xiaolu

74
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,480
Xiaolu
ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).

75
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,360
So we're even.
Xiaolu

76
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,040
Meina
I also have

77
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,560
Zhu Dan
ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).

78
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,360
What is that again?
Zhu Dan

79
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,520
It's that attention deficit thing.
Xiaolu

80
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,960
Zhu Dan
You

81
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
What are the symptoms?
Zhang Zining

82
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,560
Meina
It's when you find it hard to focus on one thing

83
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
for a long time.
Meina

84
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Then I just realized I have this too.
Jiang Dunhao

85
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,920
Jiang Dunhao
I often find myself watching TV,

86
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,440
and as I'm watching,
Jiang Dunhao

87
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,160
Jiang Dunhao
even though my eyes are on the screen,

88
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,880
my mind is thinking about something else.
Jiang Dunhao

89
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,490
my mind is thinking about something else.

90
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,600
Zhu Dan
So you definitely can't do things like

91
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,640
building Lego sets and such.
Zhu Dan

92
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,160
building Lego sets and such.

93
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,120
Zhang Zining
In that case, I think I have it too.

94
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,640
I can't build them either.
Zhang Zining

95
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,579
I can't build them either.

96
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
Wu Zun
It's like needing to walk for

97
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,520
ten seconds,
Wu Zun

98
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,240
Wu Zun
take a lap,

99
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,570
Actually, I have it too.
Wu Zun

100
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,520
Jiang Dunhao.
I just can't sit still, bro.

101
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,640
Xiaolu.
Everyone tends to have a bit of

102
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,800
a tendency to be distracted.
Xiaolu.

103
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,160
Xiaolu.
But it doesn't mean everyone has

104
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).
Xiaolu.

105
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,760
ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).

106
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,800
Alright.
Wu Zun.

107
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,080
Then I'm just purely impatient.
Zhang Zining.

108
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,240
Mu Chun.
Actually, it's that the right brain is more active.

109
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,280
Because the left brain is about ordered logic and causality,
Mu Chun.

110
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,840
Mu Chun.
while the right brain is more free-flowing.

111
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,720
inspiration, imagery,
Mu Chun.

112
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,840
Mu Chun.
aesthetics, visuals, and such things.

113
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,360
Mei Na.
I've never thought of it as an illness.

114
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,720
Mu Chun.
There are pros and cons to everything.

115
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,000
But if
Mu Chun.
There are pros and cons to everything.

116
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,760
it depends on how you utilize it.
Xiaolu.

117
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,200
Mu Chun.
Yes, when it comes to creativity,

118
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,640
it might actually be beneficial.
Mu Chun.

119
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,720
Mu Chun, because our creations come more from inspiration.
Mu Chun.

120
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,320
Xiaolu.
I actually think I chose the right path.

121
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,360
So it's helpful for me.
Xiaolu.

122
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,240
Xiaolu.
Because I do comedy,

123
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,680
it requires your thinking to be very divergent.
Xiaolu.

124
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,040
Jumping.
Zhu Dan.

125
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,160
Xiaolu.
You can't think along a straight line.

126
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,480
Xiaolu, because if you think linearly, the audience won't laugh.

127
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,680
Xiaolu.
But if you take a turn here and there,

128
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,160
they will laugh.
Xiaolu.

129
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,610
they will laugh.

130
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,840
Yang Gen.
Okay.

131
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,320
Let's continue to watch.
Yang Gen.

132
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Pangpang.
Let's have barbecue, I'm hungry.

133
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,600
Tangtang.
Okay.

134
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,840
Pangpang.
This caught fire quickly.

135
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,520
Very fast.
Pangpang.

136
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Xinjiang lamb skewers.
Harry.

137
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,760
Zhu Dan.
How is it so funny?

138
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
Terry.
Say hello.

139
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,880
First time barbecuing.
Terry.

140
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,920
Terry.
An activity for five guys.

141
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,800
Tangtang.
People who don't know anything.

142
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
Terry.
I'll fan it.

143
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,280
Terry.
You guys go inside.

144
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,680
Pangpang
I like barbecue.

145
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,800
Let me grill here.
Pangpang

146
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,400
Tangtang
You two stay here for a while.

147
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,800
I'll come back later.
Tangtang

148
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,160
Tangtang
I'll come back to keep you company.

149
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,519
It looks good.
Zhu Dan

150
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,440
It looks delicious.
Zhang Zining

151
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,200
Tutu
That's fine.

152
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,560
Former rivals are now grilling skewers together.
Tutu

153
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,240
It's a very heartwarming scene.
Tutu

154
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,320
Tangtang
How should I confess?

155
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,320
Tangtang
To be honest, I'm still thinking.

156
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,720
Harry
Don't think about it anymore.

157
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,400
It's just a matter of tomorrow or the day after.
Harry

158
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,120
Tangtang
Yeah.

159
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,880
Tangtang
But I can't play that piece.

160
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,010
It's too difficult.
Tangtang

161
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
Tangtang
I thought I had one more week.

162
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,720
then I thought these two days wouldn't be so busy.

163
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,800
But I've been out all the time these two days.
Tangtang

164
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
It's really busy.
Harry

165
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,080
Tangtang
Yes, and I don't have time to practice.

166
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,440
Harry
Actually, I've never known how to overcome it.

167
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,760
When you first start dating,
Harry

168
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,120
it feels like a long-distance relationship.
Harry

169
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,560
Tangtang
Your situation is indeed a hellish start.

170
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,880
Didn't you say you were going to Japan?
Tangtang

171
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,920
Tangtang
Aren't you going?

172
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
Harry
I couldn't get the visa.

173
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
There's not enough time.
Harry

174
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,600
Tangtang
But actually, I don't support you

175
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,480
making such a big sacrifice
Tangtang

176
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,000
Tangtang
for an unknown outcome.

177
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,360
Tangtang
You definitely need to focus on your studies.

178
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,680
Tangtang, you absolutely can't delay your graduation progress.
Tangtang

179
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,160
Harry

180
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,760
Yang Gen
Tangtang is quite good.

181
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,720
He's already acting like a brother-in-law now.
Yang Gen

182
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,960
Giving Harry some advice.
Yang Gen

183
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,600
Zhu Dan
Yes, very sensible advice.

184
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Tutu
What are you guys talking about?

185
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,560
Tangtang
We're discussing what's next.

186
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,520
Got it.
Tutu.

187
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,440
Tutu.
It's almost ready.

188
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,640
It's okay.
Tutu.
It's almost ready.

189
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,320
Tutu.
They'll take care of it later.

190
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,280
Tangtang.
Go get the things.

191
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,920
Tutu.
Bring a few bowls.

192
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,320
Then?
Tutu.
Bring a few bowls.

193
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,080
Tangtang.
Alright.

194
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,680
Yes, just prepare the bowls.
Tutu.

195
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,240
Terry.
Tutu, bring in the ground pepper.

196
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,159
If it's not spicy enough for you later,
Terry.

197
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:54,920
add more yourself.
Terry.

198
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,480
Okay.
Tutu.

199
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Tutu.
Let's eat a little first.

200
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,920
Terry.
Bring everything over.

201
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,880
We'll see how many there are first.
Terry.

202
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,850
We'll see how many there are first.

203
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,160
Pangpang.
Come on.

204
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Pangpang.
It's really nice.

205
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,200
Nice.
Harry.

206
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,600
Harry.
Let's eat some.

207
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,680
Then we'll start.
Harry.

208
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,080
Opening the mystery box.
Harry.

209
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Let the sharp people answer Harry's sharp questions.

210
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,320
Pangpang.
Delicious.

211
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,680
This is spicy beef.
Terry.

212
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,640
Awesome.
Tangtang.

213
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,640
Terry.
Let's grill another batch.

214
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,200
Tutu.
Grill more? I'll go.

215
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
Let's go out and do it together.
Tutu.

216
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,200
Let's go.
Tutu.

217
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,560
Pangpang.
What do you think about the girls?

218
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,820
That romantic dinner.
Pangpang.

219
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
They must be having a more exciting conversation than us.
Harry.

220
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,320
Tangtang.
Do you think they would ask questions like I do?

221
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,240
Pangpang.
They wouldn't be as formal as us.

222
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,700
I think.
Pangpang.
They wouldn't be as formal as us.

223
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,600
They wouldn't be so straightforward.
Harry.

224
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,690
They wouldn't be so straightforward.

225
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,920
Tangtang.
That's the impression Tutu gives me.

226
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,960
He's too informal.
Tangtang.

227
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,520
Tangtang.
So I have to ask in this tone.

228
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,320
Pangpang.
I think that's reasonable.

229
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,840
Tangtang.
If he keeps joking around like this.

230
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,840
Pangpang,
But today,

231
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,720
I think his answer
Pangpang,

232
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,360
Pangpang,
gave you a

233
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,420
very clear answer.
Pangpang,

234
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,440
Tangtang,
Indeed,

235
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,640
he's still maintaining this state.
Tangtang,

236
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,240
is this clear answer good or bad?
Harry,

237
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,240
Tangtang,
I think it's very much like him.

238
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,000
that's him.
Tangtang,

239
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,840
Pangpang,
But I think,

240
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,760
Tutu's answer today
Pangpang,

241
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,800
Pangpang,
to my ears,

242
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,440
I think it's sincere.
Pangpang,

243
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,760
Pangpang,
He completely expressed

244
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,920
his own thoughts.
Pangpang,

245
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,960
Pangpang,
Because you can't expect a

246
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,760
Pangpang,
child to answer so

247
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,960
Zhu Dan,
childishly.

248
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Tangtang,
so I also say,

249
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,760
Tangtang,
I don't support my siblings.

250
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,720
but it still depends on Xiaoling herself.
Tangtang,

251
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,880
Pangpang,
Your siblings will have their own judgment.

252
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,840
Tangtang,
yes.

253
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,850
let's come in first.
Tutu,

254
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,560
Tangtang,
Let's eat first.

255
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,240
eat first.
Tangtang,

256
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,120
Pangpang,
We can actually open a question.

257
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,600
I think.
Pangpang,

258
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,520
I've opened it.
Harry,

259
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:38,840
Pangpang,
Go ahead.

260
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,700
I've opened it.
Harry,

261
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,600
Harry,
Do you accept siblings

262
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,120
who are in contact with the opposite sex?
Harry,

263
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,840
Harry,
Why?

264
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,000
this sneer.
Jiang Dunhao,

265
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
Tangtang,
I don't accept it.

266
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,720
directly give.
Zhu Dan,

267
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,280
Xiaolu,
Okay.

268
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,159
Tangtang,
because I think

269
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,440
Tangtang,
boys need to take the initiative.

270
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,480
Maybe before he's sure
Tangtang,

271
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,760
Tangtang,
of his own feelings,

272
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,600
I don't want my siblings to be
Tangtang,

273
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,000
Tangtang.
the one who takes the initiative.

274
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,640
Tang Tang
At first, Tutu actively sought out Xiaoling.

275
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,360
but whenever it comes to
Tang Tang

276
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,000
Tang Tang
taking it a step further,

277
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Tutu would divert attention
Tang Tang

278
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,200
Tang Tang
or retreat.

279
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,880
She was very confused.
Tang Tang

280
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,640
Tang Tang
She didn't know what this really meant.

281
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,560
Tang Tang
Actually, I don't have much malice towards Tutu.

282
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,080
It's just that Xiaoling feels uncomfortable.
Tang Tang

283
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,760
Tang Tang
Moreover, it's not Xiaoling's problem.

284
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,560
Yang Gen
The 'Sister Protector' is online.

285
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Tutu
He firmly said no.

286
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,600
Tutu
At that time, I didn't know whether to laugh

287
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,400
or cry.
Tutu

288
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,360
Tutu
Tutu, I think this needs to be communicated with Xiaoling

289
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,559
face-to-face.
Tutu

290
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,280
Tutu
It's just that after I need to communicate,

291
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,159
I can fully tell them.
Tutu

292
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,820
There's a guaranteed answer.
Tutu

293
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,680
What about you?
Harry

294
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,200
Tutu
Previously, you might have felt it wasn't quite right.

295
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,680
Tutu
but actually, after spending so many days together,

296
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,320
I think it's quite
Tutu

297
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,960
Tutu
okay.

298
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,360
Yes,
Tutu
okay.

299
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,280
Harry
it's just that I think my idea

300
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,360
actually shouldn't appear here.
Harry

301
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,840
Harry
I respect my sister very much.

302
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,800
My sister likes it,
Harry

303
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,130
so she should pursue it.
Harry

304
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,650
I just accept it.
Harry

305
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,880
Harry
So now my sister wants to

306
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,600
then boldly pursue it.
Harry

307
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,330
Boldly love.
Harry

308
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,800
Harry
Next question.

309
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,880
The opposite sex you are currently interacting with
Harry

310
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,680
Harry
has it broken your previous ideal type?

311
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,480
In which aspect?
Harry

312
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,640
Tutu
Not really broken.

313
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,080
Because actually, on the first day, I chose for myself
Tutu

314
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,240
Tutu
the girl I was most interested in at first glance.

315
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,760
At that time, my hands and my heart's answer
Tutu

316
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,640
were the same.
Tutu

317
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
I chose Xiaoling.
Tutu

318
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,600
Pang Pang
Let me use Huahua as an example.

319
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,000
Pang Pang
is mine.

320
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
normal (ideal type).
Pang Pang

321
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,560
Pangpang,
So,

322
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,960
on the first day,
Pangpang,

323
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,600
Pangpang,
when Xinxin helped me vote for my ideal type,

324
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,800
she voted for Huahua.
Pangpang,

325
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,530
this matches the ideal type very well.
Pangpang,

326
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
Terry,
I...

327
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,200
Terry,
I guess so.

328
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,920
because I actually rely more on feelings.
Terry,

329
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,530
because I actually rely more on feelings.

330
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,800
Terry,
When you talk about ideal or not,

331
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
it's when you feel it,
Terry,

332
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,120
Terry,
that's the ideal type.

333
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,520
Pangpang, you haven't dated someone similar before,

334
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,440
this type?
Pangpang,

335
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,040
Terry,
The type I dated before

336
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,170
is quite different.
Terry,

337
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,360
Pangpang,
I see.

338
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
Tangtang,
I think I've broken

339
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,280
I might have preferred
Tangtang,

340
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,760
Tangtang,
cool and handsome girls before.

341
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,680
but maybe
Tangtang,

342
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,800
Tangtang, actually when I'm with cool and handsome girls,

343
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,560
Tangtang,
it's even more awkward.

344
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
neither of us would talk,
Tangtang,

345
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,120
Tangtang,
and we're both not proactive.

346
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,800
we'd just keep quiet when there's a problem,
Tangtang,

347
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,760
Tangtang,
until it reaches a threshold.

348
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,640
it feels completely impossible to get along.
Tangtang,

349
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,520
Then,
Tangtang,

350
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,040
Tangtang,
I feel like I've met someone quite cute,

351
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,880
and I'm really touched.
Tangtang,

352
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,440
Harry,
Let me answer that.

353
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,400
I actually had contact with Xinxin before.
Harry,

354
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,160
Harry,
At that time, I felt

355
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,360
Xinxin could chat well with me
Harry,

356
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,520
Harry,
and could understand me better.

357
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,440
At that time, I thought
Harry,

358
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,480
Harry,
she might be older than me.

359
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,040
Then I wanted to get to know her a bit.
Harry,

360
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,920
Harry,
But later I found out,

361
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,560
actually during the ice and snow (sports meet),
Harry,

362
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,760
Harry,
we were in the same car.

363
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,360
When we chatted then,
Harry,

364
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,600
Harry,
we actually couldn't connect on many topics.

365
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,640
Then later, when I dated and got to know Tata,
Harry,

366
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,880
Harry,
Tata broke through

367
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,800
my previous ideal type.
Harry,

368
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,040
Harry, I indeed don't really like girls with short hair.

369
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,000
Harry,
It's not that

370
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,960
they're not attractive,
Harry,

371
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,680
Harry.
it just doesn't quite fit my aesthetic preferences.

372
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,360
Harry,
Then as we got to know each other more,

373
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,040
things got better and better.
Harry,

374
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,960
Harry,
I found her attractive,

375
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,680
including her personality.
Harry,

376
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,800
Harry,
We got along really well,

377
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,960
and our values aligned too.
Harry,

378
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,480
Pangpang.
Indeed,

379
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,000
I think when you first start interacting with a girl,
Pangpang.

380
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I think when you first start interacting with a girl,

381
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,160
Pangpang.
you're both getting to know each other,

382
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
So I think this is reasonable.
Pangpang.

383
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,680
So I think this is reasonable.

384
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,200
Pangpang,
Regarding this matter, my opinion of you

385
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,960
went from initially having some
Pangpang,

386
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,240
Pangpang,
doubts about your approach,

387
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,040
to later feeling that your way of handling things
Pangpang,

388
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
Pangpang,
I felt that you

389
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,800
Pangpang,
I think it's actually good.

390
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,520
I believe for a man,
Pangpang,

391
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,160
Pangpang,
being decisive in these matters is good.

392
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,320
your approach to this situation,
Pangpang,

393
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,280
Pangpang,
I agree with you.

394
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,820
Come on, Pangpang,
Harry.

395
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,930
let's ask some lighter questions.
Pangpang,

396
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,680
Pangpang,
Who was your competitor in the house?

397
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
Relaxed,
Terry.

398
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,360
Pangpang.
I was just with Terry,

399
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,960
What about Tangtang?
Pangpang.

400
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,560
What about Tangtang?

401
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,320
Tangtang.
I was just fairly competing with Terry at the beginning,

402
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,000
Terry.
Fair competition,

403
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,520
Tangtang,
Didn't we both say in the restaurant

404
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,560
Tangtang,
that regardless of the final choice, it wouldn't really affect

405
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
our friendship, right?
Tangtang,

406
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,000
Tangtang,
Did you know that Pangpang initially

407
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,880
was interested in Xiaoling?
Tangtang,

408
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,600
was interested in Xiaoling?

409
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,440
Tutu,
I think he meant

410
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,120
because he had interacted with Huahua before.
Tutu,

411
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
Tutu,
I think he might have been more

412
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,440
inclined towards Huahua.
Tutu,

413
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,940
inclined towards Huahua.

414
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,040
Tutu,
Then later he might have said

415
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,960
let's interact more.
Tutu,

416
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,960
and then he started to have some of that with Xiaoling.
Tutu,

417
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,880
Tangtang.
He didn't give me an answer,

418
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,000
So actually, many things
Tangtang.

419
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,930
were smoothly glossed over by him.
Tangtang,

420
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,680
Pangpang.
Which day's heartfelt message is this?

421
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,000
What made you hesitate the most?
Pangpang.

422
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,640
Harry.
What I hesitated about the most was at that time

423
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,720
on the day of the Ice and Snow Sports Meet,
Harry.

424
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,760
Harry.
who to send it to.

425
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,120
whether to send it to Xinxin
Harry.
who to send it to.

426
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,250
or to send it to Tata.
Harry.

427
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,440
Harry.
I sent it to Tata.

428
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,520
because I had a Cupid date with her later
Harry.

429
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,440
Harry.
and felt we really hit it off.

430
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:32,880
And then
Harry.
and felt we really hit it off.

431
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,240
Harry.
after the date,

432
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
I said,
Harry.

433
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,080
Harry.
it must be her.

434
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
I was really hesitant that day.
Harry.

435
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,640
I was really hesitant that day.

436
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,040
Yes.
Harry.

437
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,920
Tangtang.
I didn't hesitate at all.

438
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,280
Terry.
I didn't really hesitate either.

439
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,320
Pangpang.
Okay.

440
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,760
I did hesitate.
Pangpang.

441
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,480
Pangpang.
Actually, I was quite hesitant on the third day.

442
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
Pangpang means the third day after the Ice and Snow Sports Meet.

443
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,760
Pangpang.
I was hesitating whether to send it to Huahua

444
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,160
or to Xiaoling.
Pangpang.
I was hesitating whether to send it to Huahua

445
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,440
Pangpang.
I hesitated between these two.

446
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,440
I think the daily heartfelt messages
Tutu.

447
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,240
Tutu, all express our current feelings about our interactions.

448
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,320
Tutu.
It's not like

449
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
they're all positive,
Tutu.

450
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
Tutu.
they're just expressing our inner thoughts,

451
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,650
the most genuine thoughts.
Tutu.

452
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,920
It's not about hesitating or not.
Tutu.

453
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,680
Yang Gen.
Here comes the official answer.

454
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,640
Zhang Zining.
Yes, it's starting again.

455
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,240
Tangtang.
He keeps giving

456
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,200
those ambiguous answers.
Tangtang.

457
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,280
Tangtang.
I'm quite angry hearing that.

458
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,920
Zhu Dan.
I can feel his anger level.

459
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,960
I feel like I'm suffocating.
Zhang Zining.

460
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Terry.
Terry, Tutu, do you want to check your green pepper skin?

461
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,260
I'll go take a look.
Terry.

462
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Green pepper.
Tutu.

463
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,560
Tangtang.

464
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:38,920
Pangpang's behavior is quite obvious, right?
Tangtang.

465
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,400
He was interested in Xiaoling at first.
Tangtang.

466
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,120
He was interested in Xiaoling at first.

467
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,600
Harry.
Then in the middle,

468
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,760
during the Winter Sports Meet,
Harry.

469
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,360
Yes, that's right.
Harry.

470
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,820
Yes, that's right.

471
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,160
Tang Tang.
He.

472
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,880
Tu Tu actually doesn't know.
Tang Tang.

473
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,000
Harry.

474
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,200
Then he just said he didn't feel it.
Tang Tang.

475
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,400
Well, but maybe he's just embarrassed.
Harry.

476
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,840
Tang Tang.
It's mainly about everyone's behavior.

477
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,160
Everyone can
Tang Tang.

478
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,960
explain clearly what they mean.
Tang Tang.

479
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,400
Tang Tang.
You say you're determined,

480
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,320
you say you're sincere,
Tang Tang.

481
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,980
but you don't take any action.
Tang Tang.

482
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,680
I have to be responsible for my sister, right?
Tang Tang.

483
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,610
I have to be responsible for my sister, right?

484
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,400
Terry.
Are you full?

485
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,280
Tang Tang.
I'm a bit full.

486
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,320
Terry.
I'm full too.

487
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,520
Terry.
Tu Tu wants to eat green peppers.

488
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:17,960
Tang Tang.
Go ahead and eat.

489
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,020
Eat the spicy ones.
Tang Tang.

490
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,440
Terry.
I grilled them especially for him.

491
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,920
You eat these two that are a bit more charred.
Terry.

492
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,760
Terry.
It'll be better.

493
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,920
Yang Gen.
Look at this heart-to-heart session for the guys.

494
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,800
Actually, the core focus is on
Yang Gen.

495
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,120
Tang Tang helping her sister by constantly asking Tu Tu.
Yang Gen.

496
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,360
Zhu Dan.
I now think it's not just Tang Tang anymore.

497
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
Everyone is helping to ask about this matter.
Zhu Dan.

498
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,160
Everyone can't take it anymore.
Wu Zun.

499
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,480
Yang Gen.
Yang Gen: So in 'Love Siblings,'

500
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,960
the protective energy of siblings has emerged.
Yang Gen.

501
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,760
Mei Na.
Yes, at times like this, you feel siblings are really great.

502
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,800
Yang Gen.
Have you ever helped your siblings

503
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
with their romantic experiences before?
Yang Gen.

504
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,080
Yang Gen.
Or have your siblings ever helped you?

505
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,920
Mei Na.
When I was young,

506
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,800
if my sister went on a date with a guy,
Mei Na.

507
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,840
Mei Na.
she might not dare to tell our parents directly.

508
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,040
She would use me as a cover.
Mei Na.

509
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,300
Saying you're dating.
Yang Gen.

510
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,480
Meina.
I was very young at that time.

511
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,200
I wasn't able to date back then.
Meina.

512
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,520
Meina.
She would say to take my sister out to play.

513
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,480
Jiang Dunhao.
A tool person.

514
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,800
Meina.
Yes.

515
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,120
And then she always thought,
Meina.

516
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,200
Meina.
I was on her side.

517
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,520
always shielding her from the storm.
Meina.

518
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,040
Meina.
But actually, I would secretly observe,

519
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
this guy's actions.
Meina.

520
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,800
Meina.
Meina, I didn't have complete judgment at that time.

521
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,000
But I could tell my parents,
Meina.

522
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,120
Meina.
everything that happened between them,

523
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,680
exactly as it was.
Meina.

524
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,640
Yang Gen.
You were a double 'spy.'

525
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,880
Yes.
Right.

526
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,840
Meina.
And then my parents,

527
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,160
Yi Meina.
based on that guy's behavior,

528
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,800
thought this guy,
Yi Meina.

529
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,120
was he really suitable for my sister.
Yi Meina.

530
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,720
was he really suitable for my sister.

531
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,280
Meina, then they found out that guy was really not suitable.

532
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,080
Meina.
And then they promptly cut their losses.

533
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,000
Wu Zun.

534
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,120
Meina.
Yes, so my sister always praised me.

535
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,400
Zhang Zining.
I really wish I had a sibling.

536
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,040
Zhu Dan.
I have protected my sister.

537
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,560
Because,
Zhu Dan.

538
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,080
Zhu Dan.
my sister once had a relationship.

539
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,320
And it was quite serious.
Zhu Dan.

540
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,160
Zhu Dan.
But it was very strange,

541
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,920
that the two of them,
Zhu Dan.

542
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960
Zhu Dan.
after reaching a certain stage,

543
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,040
never moved to the next stage.
Zhu Dan.

544
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,120
Zhu Dan.
Like physical contact or something.

545
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,360
My sister would think this guy was very reserved,
Zhu Dan.

546
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,000
Zhu Dan.
very measured and polite.

547
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,240
But after a long time,
Zhu Dan.

548
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
Zhu Dan.
I wondered if this was a problem.

549
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,920
Yang Gen.
Yes.

550
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,360
Zhu Dan.
Then I used my friends,

551
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,560
to help me at the workplace,
Zhu Dan.

552
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,720
Zhu Dan.
to quietly gather some information.

553
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,880
And then I got some information.
Zhu Dan.

554
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
Zhu Dan.
I told my friend,

555
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,920
just say I know.'
Zhu Dan.

556
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,000
Zhu Dan.
just say I know.'

557
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,440
Zhu Dan.
I said to be polite and measured.

558
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,760
Go and resolve this matter.
Zhu Dan.

559
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,400
Zhu Dan.
But you must not harm my sister.

560
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,040
Zhu Dan.
It wasn't long after that.

561
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,120
My sister told me they broke up.
Zhu Dan.

562
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,200
Zhu Dan.
But I think it's good now.

563
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,600
My sister is living happily on her own.
Zhu Dan.

564
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,480
Yang Gen,
At least we protected her,

565
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
when she needed protection the most.
Yang Gen,

566
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,320
That situation was very abnormal.
Zhu Dan.

567
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,120
Yang Gen.
Yes.

568
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,400
Wu Zun, my sister was also studying abroad before.

569
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,600
And I got along well with her boyfriend,
Wu Zun.

570
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,080
Wu Zun.
but I would often check on him,

571
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,920
to see if he did anything
Wu Zun.

572
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,000
Wu Zun.
that would betray my sister.

573
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,960
I also hope that in the future my son,
Wu Zun.

574
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,200
Wu Zun.
and my daughter,

575
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,160
can go out together when they date.
Wu Zun.

576
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,840
Zhu Dan.
Yes.

577
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,160
Wu Zun.
I think it's great.

578
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,680
Because my wife and I are the same,
Wu Zun.

579
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,560
Wu Zun.
with her sister.

580
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,480
We often go out together.
Wu Zun.

581
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,280
I think it's very helpful.
Wu Zun.

582
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,940
I think it's very helpful.

583
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,200
Zhang Zining.
It's because I don't have siblings.

584
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,240
I always go out to 'take orders'.
Zhang Zining.

585
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,960
Yang Gen.
'take orders'.

586
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,640
Zhang Zining.
To help others.

587
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,720
When I was in school,
Zhang Zining.

588
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,640
Zhang Zining.
I helped a friend,

589
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,600
by being a mailman.
Zhang Zining.

590
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,000
Zhang Zining.
She wanted to deliver a love letter but didn't dare to,

591
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,840
so I did it for her.
Zhang Zining.

592
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,040
Meina.
You're so brave.

593
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,400
Xiaolu.
I originally had something to say,

594
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,440
but indeed,
Xiaolu.

595
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,840
Xiaolu.
ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).

596
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,970
Now I don't know what I was going to say.
Xiaolu.

597
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,640
Xiaolu.
Just in a second,

598
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,960
and just now I still,
Xiaolu.

599
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,119
I really completely forgot.
Xiaolu.

600
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,520
Yang Gen.
Let's continue to see,

601
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,400
Susu.
Blind box.

602
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,440
Thank you.
Xiaoling.

603
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,520
Susu.
I'm sweating.

604
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,960
Who goes first?
Tata.

605
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,720
Anyone can.
Xiaoling.

606
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,680
Xiaoling, you ask first.
Huahua.

607
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,210
Let's just go in order then.
Tata.

608
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,000
Xiaoling.
What's happening right now

609
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,200
that would change your final decision?
Xiaoling.

610
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,880
Huahua.
That's quite sharp.

611
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,960
Huahua.
Can we sit closer?

612
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,600
Tata.
Nervous.

613
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,640
I've got goosebumps.
Tata.

614
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,200
Tata.
I don't know how to answer this question.

615
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,060
What does he do?
Tata.

616
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,520
Xiaoling.
Xiaoling, do you consider age or distance issues?

617
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,480
I think
Xiaoling.

618
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,520
Susu.
age is okay.

619
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,980
As for distance, I am indeed considering it.
Susu.

620
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,480
Xinxin.
Is there distance between you two?

621
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,640
Susu.
He's quite busy, yes.

622
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,900
He's always going out.
Susu.

623
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,360
Xinxin.
He might go from being 100% enthusiastic

624
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
to 99%,
Xinxin.

625
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,400
Xinxin.
and I would change.

626
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,720
Really?
Tata.

627
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,200
Huahua.
You can't even handle a 1% drop?

628
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,280
Tata.
Not even a 1% drop is allowed.

629
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,520
Huahua.
That's terrifying, He Wenxin.

630
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,000
My understanding of He Wenxin is
Huahua.

631
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,960
Huahua.
she can be like this,

632
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Huahua.
but not like that.

633
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,700
Huahua.
Right?

634
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,040
Susu.
Indeed, I can't either.

635
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,600
I
Susu.

636
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,360
Susu.
can only go this way.

637
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,320
You can't.
Susu.

638
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,280
Xinxin.
Right, he can go from zero to 90,

639
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,960
he can't start at 100
Xinxin.

640
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,760
and then drop to 99.
Xinxin.

641
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,440
Susu.
Can't let people feel a sense of letdown.

642
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,400
That's very difficult.
Yang Gen.

643
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,320
It's too hard.
Wu Zun.

644
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,200
Tata.
Then mine is

645
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,480
What could it be?
Tata.

646
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,240
Tata.
Maybe he's getting to know a third person.

647
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,880
Xiaoling.
What about you?

648
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,320
Huahua.
I'm touched.

649
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,840
Tata,
Suddenly, at a certain point, someone

650
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,360
really touches you.
Tata,

651
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,520
Huahua,
You become determined, right?

652
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,280
Tata,
and then you will

653
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,040
be firm in your decision.
Tata,

654
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,560
Huahua,
Yes.

655
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,040
Xiaoling,
Xiaoling, I think before we had dinner today,

656
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,200
I might have had many
Xiaoling,

657
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,280
I didn't dare to listen.
Tata,

658
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,320
Xiaoling,
Just listen.

659
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,000
Xiaoling,
before we had dinner today,

660
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I actually had doubts.
Xiaoling,

661
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,240
and I also asked you about it.
Xiaoling,

662
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,300
are you satisfied?
Huahua,

663
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,080
Xiaoling,
I think it's okay.

664
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,240
but I'm more curious about him personally,
Xiaoling,

665
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,000
what he has to say for himself.
Xiaoling,

666
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,080
Huahua,
Okay.

667
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Xiaoling,
so I think

668
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,480
what ultimately changed my decision
Xiaoling,

669
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
Xiaoling,
might be

670
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,280
Tata,
his answer.

671
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,360
Xiaoling,
it's either his answer

672
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,320
or some of my feelings.
Xiaoling,

673
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Xiaoling,
Because I will consider age,

674
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
I will consider distance.
Xiaoling,

675
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,040
Xiaoling,
And then, considering Tutu and me,

676
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,600
I'm currently in my first year of graduate school,
Xiaoling,

677
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,280
Xiaoling,
and Tutu is

678
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,600
I guess he's a freshman or sophomore.
Xiaoling,

679
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,200
Huahua,
Sophomore.

680
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,600
Xiaoling,
it's hard to say while I'm still studying.

681
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,040
maintaining a long-distance relationship for a long time
Xiaoling,

682
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,560
Xiaoling,
so this is also something I would think about.

683
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,290
to be honest,
Xiaoling,

684
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,320
Susu,
the youngest thinks the most.

685
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,080
Xiaoling,
am I the youngest?

686
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,240
Yes.

687
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,200
Indeed you are.
Xiaoling,

688
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,040
Xiaoling,
Because if I were to date someone,

689
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,760
I would be aiming for
Xiaoling,

690
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,560
Xiaoling,
although it might sound scary to say this,

691
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,000
but I would be aiming for marriage.
Xiaoling,

692
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,280
Huahua,
But that's a good thing.

693
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,360
Xiaoling,
so I think

694
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,200
I might need to consider a lot more things.
Xiaoling,

695
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,400
Yang Gen,
The preparations Xiaoling is making

696
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,680
are all preparations for officially dating him.
Yang Gen,

697
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,000
Zhu Dan,
Yes.

698
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,680
Yang Gen,
Tutu is three steps behind.

699
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,840
he hasn't even considered it yet.
Yang Gen,

700
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,760
Xiaolu,
He hasn't even determined if it's friendship or love.

701
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,120
Zhu Dan,
their energy levels,

702
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,920
emotional levels,
Zhu Dan,

703
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,520
Zhu Dan,
are not on the same level at all.

704
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,280
the difference is too big.
Zhu Dan,

705
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,980
the difference is too big.

706
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,000
then, the second question.
Xiaoling,

707
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,610
then, the second question.

708
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,720
Xiaoling, who in the cabin was once your competitor?
Xiaoling,

709
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,600
competitor?
Tata,

710
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,000
Xiaoling,
It seems you don't have one.

711
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,560
you don't have one.
Xiaoling,

712
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,600
Xiaoling,
You pass.

713
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,200
Susu,
I'm sorry.

714
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,640
Xinxin,
yes, I do.

715
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
Susu,
really?

716
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,440
Susu,
I'm not very sure.

717
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,720
come on, you don't have one.
Xiaoling,

718
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,210
come on, you don't have one.

719
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,520
I don't think so.
Xinxin,

720
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,240
Huahua,
Before,

721
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,680
Jiang Dunhao,
it was Tata, right?

722
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
no.
Xinxin,

723
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,720
Xiaoling,
Okay, then

724
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,760
Yang Gen,
it's a bit awkward.

725
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
from what I understand, it might be Xinxin.
Tata,

726
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,080
Huahua,
Right.

727
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,280
Tata,
because Xinxin had contact with Harry at first.

728
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,160
Huahua,
yes.

729
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,400
Tata,
including when he rejected my invitation card

730
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,760
Tata,
and walked out with Xinxin.

731
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,080
Tata,
I even said that day,

732
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,200
'Xinxin and Harry are dressed so well together.'
Tata,

733
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,810
'Xinxin and Harry are dressed so well together.'

734
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,720
Tata.
Do you remember?

735
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Xinxin.
I didn't hear that.

736
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,880
Huahua.
I heard it.

737
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,880
I was behind them.
Tata.

738
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,210
Huahua was all in black.

739
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,520
Huahua.
She was after you two left.

740
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,000
behind.
Huahua.

741
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
Huahua.
They make a good match.

742
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,760
Huahua.
You.

743
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,160
Xiaoling.
I.

744
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,800
Tata.
You said she was your rival.

745
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,440
Huahua.
Yes.

746
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,560
Tata.
You and who?

747
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,160
Pangpang?
Tata.

748
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,120
Huahua.
Yes, Pangpang was in contact with me at that time.

749
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,280
Then he approached her the next day or the day after.
Huahua.

750
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,980
Then he approached her the next day or the day after.

751
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,840
Huahua.
Yes.

752
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,240
Xiaoling.
Okay.

753
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,320
Who was once my rival?
Xiaoling.

754
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,560
Xiaoling.
I don't know.

755
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,000
Xiaoling, actually after dinner, I thought it might be Tata.

756
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,120
Just that one time.
Tata.

757
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Xiaoling.
After dinner, I thought it was Tata.

758
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,360
Huahua.
Tata.

759
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,200
I want to escape.
Tata.

760
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,960
Susu.
I really want some water.

761
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
It's my turn.
Susu.

762
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,520
Susu.
I'll ask first.

763
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,800
Then I'll start with you, Mizi.
Susu.

764
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,880
Xiaoling.
Okay.

765
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,520
Susu.
At this stage, siblings and love interests.

766
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,880
What's the proportion in your heart?
Susu.

767
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,740
Question mark.
Susu.

768
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,440
Xiaoling.
I think my siblings.

769
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,260
Xiaoling, my siblings definitely take up at least.

770
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,000
Xiaoling.
It doesn't sound good.

771
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,600
But at least over 80 percent.
Xiaoling.

772
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,240
Then my love interest.
Xiaoling.

773
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,960
Xiaoling.
I would also think about.

774
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,480
But to put it bluntly.
Xiaoling.

775
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,720
Xiaoling.
They can't surpass my siblings.

776
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,560
This is normal, I feel.
Susu.

777
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,720
Huahua.
Very normal.

778
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,200
Then I don't dare to speak.
Huahua.

779
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Huahua,
Yes, because I really...

780
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,120
just like the question Xiaoling just asked me,
Huahua,

781
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,960
Huahua,
I was indeed a bit choked up.

782
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,400
because recently,
Huahua,
I was indeed a bit choked up.

783
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,520
Huahua,
I haven't really been paying much attention to Tutu's

784
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,160
relationship status.
Huahua,

785
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,840
Huahua,
Including at the beginning, maybe I,

786
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,040
if I didn't have any romantic options,
Huahua,

787
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,560
Huahua,
my attention might have been mostly on him.

788
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,680
but if you ask about the recent proportion,
Huahua,

789
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,720
Huahua,
I think Tutu might only account for 30%.

790
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,520
I myself might take up 70%.
Huahua,

791
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,280
Huahua,
Because I also mentioned in my sibling diary,

792
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,760
Huahua,
I feel a bit sorry for him.

793
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,560
but it seems
Huahua,

794
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,840
Huahua,
I indeed, in the house,

795
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,200
during the later stage,
Huahua,

796
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,000
Huahua,
it's all been me

797
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,360
focusing more on my own feelings,
Huahua,

798
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,120
Huahua,
or things about myself

799
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,920
that I haven't figured out yet and need to resolve.
Huahua,

800
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,560
Huahua needs to figure herself out first.
Zhu Dan:

801
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,200
Xiaoling:
Yes.

802
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,960
Huahua,
I think even if I give Tutu

803
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,800
give him one (percent),
Huahua,

804
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,120
I don't think I would be afraid of him getting angry,

805
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,480
Huahua,
because I know he won't leave.

806
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,840
but if the person I have feelings for sees this,
Huahua,

807
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,480
Susu:
they would leave.

808
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,360
Huahua,
Right.

809
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,040
he would think,
Huahua,

810
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,800
Huahua,
if you only give me one percent,

811
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,480
I think they would...
Huahua,

812
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,680
Huahua,
But I don't think Tutu would.

813
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,720
it's like arguing with a friend
Huahua,

814
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,440
Huahua,
is completely different from arguing with family.

815
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Huahua,
a friend asked me before,

816
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,920
after you came in,
Huahua,

817
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,560
Huahua,
what if no one likes you?

818
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,620
I said it's okay, my brother likes me.
Huahua,

819
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,920
Huahua,
Even if perhaps I

820
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
don't find someone I have feelings for here,
Huahua,

821
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,800
Huahua,
my brother will always be

822
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,880
Huahua,
in some corner watching over me.

823
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,240
Tata:
it's so hard to answer.

824
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,360
My siblings aren't even here.
Tata:

825
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,800
I've completely forgotten about him these past few days.
Tata,

826
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,000
Then for you it's zero and one hundred.
Susu:

827
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Tata,
Since the Siblings' House closed,

828
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,330
I haven't thought about my brother at all.
Tata,

829
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,800
Jiang Dunhao.
Very real.

830
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
Tata,
Siblings can still account for

831
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,040
sixty percent.
Tata,

832
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,880
I think
Tata,

833
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Xinxin,
you're the same as me.

834
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,480
Huahua,
Okay, I'm the most heartless one then.

835
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,800
Xiaoling,
You can't say that.

836
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,840
Tata,
after all, the time we've spent together

837
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,280
is still not that long.
Tata,

838
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
Xinxin,
Me too, it's just that

839
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,200
I don't have a love interest right now,
Xinxin,

840
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,080
Xinxin,
but if I did,

841
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,760
Xinxin,
Pangpang would probably also account for

842
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,760
sixty percent.
Xinxin,

843
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,120
Susu,
I'm also sixty-forty.

844
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,480
it's about the same.
Susu,

845
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,210
so siblings are forty percent?
Tata,

846
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,200
Susu,
If siblings are sixty, how can they be forty?

847
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,460
ten thousand percent.
Harry,

848
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,240
Xiaoling,
No, actually at first

849
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,320
I didn't expect
Xiaoling,

850
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,760
Xiaoling,
that I would care so much about Tom.

851
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,080
to be honest, I cried that day
Xiaoling,

852
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,040
Xiaoling,
because he cried.

853
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,400
it was also, in my memory,
Xiaoling,

854
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,800
Xiaoling,
the first time I cried because of him.

855
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
so I thought,
Xiaoling,

856
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,920
Xiaoling,
it turns out he means this much to me.

857
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,800
Tata,
really, before coming here,

858
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,640
I didn't feel that siblings
Tata,

859
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,600
had such important meaning to me.
Tata,

860
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,560
Susu,
The person you're currently interacting with,

861
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,680
is it because you genuinely like them
Susu,

862
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,520
or just want to find a partner?
Susu,

863
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,980
Xiaoling, I think right now I can't say I have
Xiaoling,

864
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,360
Huahua,
Listen carefully.

865
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,040
Xiaoling,
I can't say I really like him or

866
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,400
feel like I need to be around him all the time,
Xiaoling,

867
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,720
Xiaoling,
but I am indeed very interested in him.

868
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,440
Su Su
Genuinely like.

869
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Xiaoling
is genuinely interested.

870
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,240
I wouldn't say I like him to that extent, but
Xiaoling

871
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,000
Su Su
have a good impression.

872
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,720
Xiaoling
Yes, a good impression.

873
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,040
Xiaolu
Because the word 'like' is too

874
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,880
Yang Gen
too strong in their eyes.

875
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,600
Huahua
Me too.

876
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,120
I genuinely have a good impression, just like Xiaoling.
Huahua

877
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,240
Huahua
It's not about finding a partner.

878
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,680
What about you?
Su Su

879
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,640
Well, I'm definitely sincere.
Tata

880
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,320
Su Su
Sincerely have a good impression or sincerely like?

881
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,520
Tata
So annoying.

882
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
I won't answer.
Tata

883
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,280
Huahua
Come on, tell me. Good impression or like?

884
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,600
Xiaoling
Maybe somewhere in between.

885
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,200
Yes, I actually think it's
Tata

886
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,560
Huahua
Xinxin

887
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,920
No need to say anything about Xinxin, she's not even looking for a partner.
Huahua

888
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,600
No need to say anything about Xinxin, she's not even looking for a partner.

889
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,440
Su Su
Xinxin is fine on her own.

890
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,480
Xinxin
Alright.

891
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,640
I'll skip.
Xinxin

892
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,520
Su Su
I don't need to answer either, right?

893
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,560
Xiaoling
You answer.

894
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,560
Tata
Answer.

895
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,560
Su Su
Do I still need to answer?

896
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm not looking.
Su Su
Do I still need to answer?

897
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,760
Su Su
I haven't thought about it.

898
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,880
I'm not looking for a partner.
Su Su

899
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,520
Then do you genuinely like or
Tata

900
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,720
I'm asking you back.
Tata

901
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,160
Su Su
It's the same as Tata.

902
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,420
I don't want to answer.
Su Su

903
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,520
Tata
You were just bombarding me with questions.

904
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,560
Su Su
Because I was asking on behalf of someone else.

905
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,400
Huahua
Let me ask.

906
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,120
In the last two days,
Huahua

907
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,520
Huahua
will you still help your siblings make a move?

908
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,000
Su Su
You scared me.

909
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,320
Xiaoling
I don't think it's necessary.

910
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
to help me make a move, right?
Xiaoling

911
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,730
Xiaoling, I feel like they're doing pretty well, right?

912
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Susu
I need it even less.

913
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,760
Why are you even asking me this question?
Susu

914
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,160
Susu
Is there any need to ask me?

915
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,880
I think they're doing well on their own.
Susu

916
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,240
Huahua
They're both living well.

917
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,440
Susu
It's almost too good.

918
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,400
Xinxin
He's actually been in a relationship all along.

919
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,080
Xinxin doesn't need my help or insights about girls.

920
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Xinxin
I've always been in a...

921
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
Xinxin's very gossipy role.

922
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,800
Xinxin
I'm not actually helping.

923
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
Huahua
Definitely included.

924
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,080
Let me do it.
Tata

925
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,240
Tata
Do you accept?

926
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,960
The opposite sex that your siblings are in contact with.
Tata

927
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,560
Tata
Why?

928
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,720
Xiaoling
I'm very accepting of it.

929
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,760
I think it's great. Keep going.
Xiaoling

930
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,520
Thank you.
Susu

931
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,640
Susu
Guess whether I accept it or not?

932
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,360
Getting nervous.
Tata

933
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,800
Susu
Be careful.

934
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,080
Susu
Very accepting.

935
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,360
I'm exhausted from helping every day.
Susu

936
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,280
Susu
Chattering on both sides every day.

937
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,200
Very accepting.
Susu

938
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,840
Xinxin
I'm quite accepting too.

939
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,440
I'm fine with whoever he's in contact with.
Xinxin

940
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,520
Tata
What about you?

941
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,480
Xiaoling
What about you? How did you skip yourself?

942
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,840
Tata
The opposite sex that my siblings are in contact with.

943
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,120
Where?
Tata

944
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,880
Xiaoling
Just pretend you're Terry.

945
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,480
Tata
Pretend to be Terry.

946
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Is Terry in contact with Huahua? Is that right?
Tata

947
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,080
Is Terry in contact with Huahua? Is that right?

948
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,520
Accept it. Very accepting.
Tata

949
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,280
Thank you.
Huahua

950
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,760
Xiaoling
Do you accept it?

951
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,400
Huahua
I accept.

952
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,240
Xiaoling
The people your siblings are in contact with.

953
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,320
Huahua
I said I accept all of it.

954
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,780
I even feel a bit unworthy.
Huahua

955
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,480
Xiaolu
She spoke my mind.

956
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
I've been holding it in for so long.
Xiaolu

957
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,410
I've been holding it in for so long.

958
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,700
This anger of mine.
Xiaolu

959
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,800
Tata.
Has the person you're currently seeing broken the mold?

960
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,330
In what aspects did your ideal type used to be?
Tata.

961
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,360
Xiaoling, I actually don't have a specific ideal type.

962
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,960
Xiaoling.
If you ask me what my ideal type is,

963
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,640
I would say I want,
Xiaoling.

964
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,000
maybe someone over 1.8 meters tall.
Xiaoling.

965
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,640
maybe someone over 1.8 meters tall.

966
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,160
And I also,
Xiaoling.

967
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Susu.
How tall is Tutu?

968
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,200
Xiaoling.
1.77 meters.

969
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,000
Huahua.
I'll note that down.

970
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Xiaoling.
Actually, if it were before, I might have said,

971
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,280
I hope the other person is taller than me.
Xiaoling.

972
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,160
Xiaoling.
I hope for this and that.

973
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,220
Xiaoling, but now I would say it depends on the feeling.

974
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,280
Susu.
Mine is completely different.

975
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,040
Susu.
The appearance is just different.

976
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,320
I like that kind of,
Susu.

977
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,800
Susu.
full of youthful vibe.

978
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,000
fair and clean, adorably cute.
Susu.

979
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,960
Huahua.
Tutu.

980
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,040
Xiaoling.
I have a new competitor now.

981
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,160
Susu.
That's scary.

982
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,160
Huahua.
That question should have been answered later.

983
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,360
Yes, the order is really important.
Tata.

984
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,400
Susu.
No, it's just,

985
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,080
but Tutu is a bit too cute.
Susu.

986
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,880
Susu.
I like that kind of youthful 'dad'.

987
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,800
Zhang Zining.
youthful 'dad'.

988
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,160
Yang Gen.
I think it's Jiang Dunhao.

989
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,680
Jiang Dunhao.
Zhu Dan.

990
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,440
Found the character.
Jiang Dunhao.

991
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,800
Okay.

992
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Jiang Dunhao
PR teacher, please take note.

993
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,840
Let's work towards this direction.
Jiang Dunhao

994
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,560
Susu,
He's older than me.

995
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
he's very caring.
Susu,

996
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,960
Susu,
But his appearance is like...

997
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,480
Huahua,
very manly.

998
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,160
Susu,
yes.

999
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,880
but in terms of mental and physical age,
Susu,

1000
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,000
Susu,
he's older than me in both aspects.

1001
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,280
and he takes care of me.
Susu,

1002
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,040
Susu,
He also motivates me,

1003
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,440
instead of me possibly motivating him.
Susu,

1004
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
now it's the opposite.
Xiaoling,

1005
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,760
Susu,
Now it's completely the opposite.

1006
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,200
and the funniest thing is, before,
Susu,

1007
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,960
Susu,
when I was probably in England,

1008
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,600
someone asked me
Susu,

1009
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,720
Susu,
if I had tried

1010
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,000
to interact with foreigners
Susu,

1011
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,680
Susu,
or something like that.

1012
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,440
I said it's impossible.
Susu,

1013
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,200
now,
Tata,

1014
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,560
Susu,
as a result,

1015
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,000
I really never expected this.
Susu,

1016
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,160
Susu,
It's completely different.

1017
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,080
sister is so happy to hear that.
Xiaoling,

1018
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,000
Susu,
Yes, it's all about the feeling.

1019
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,920
Tata,
the person of the opposite sex I'm interacting with is also

1020
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,680
completely different from my ideal type.
Tata,

1021
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,200
Tata,
Completely different.

1022
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,720
I also like those who are taller than me
Tata,

1023
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,680
Tata,
and older than me.

1024
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,400
I've never
Tata,

1025
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,600
Tata: At first, I was very resistant to dating younger guys.

1026
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,440
Susu,
Agree. I've never dated one.

1027
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Xiaoling,
me neither.

1028
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,640
Tata,
because I think for people of the same age,

1029
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,280
guys are definitely all
Tata,

1030
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,760
Susu,
immature.

1031
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,560
they're all quite immature.
Tata,

1032
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,080
Huahua,
Right.

1033
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,440
Tata, but at first, we didn't know the age,

1034
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,320
Tata: After interacting with Harry,

1035
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,280
Tata,
I feel that his mental age

1036
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,210
is quite mature.
Tata,

1037
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,040
Tata,
I really like Harry's personality.

1038
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
I really like
Tata,

1039
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,920
people who are very thoughtful.
Tata,

1040
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,520
Huahua
I actually still prefer

1041
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,840
those who are a bit older than me.
Huahua

1042
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,600
Huahua.
We probably learned about ages yesterday,

1043
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,520
I found that everyone seems
Huahua.

1044
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,840
not to be much older than me.
Huahua

1045
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,720
Susu,
Terry,

1046
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,400
Terry is the same age as her.
Tata,

1047
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,320
Huahua,
The same age.

1048
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,480
Right, not much older.
Huahua,

1049
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,720
Huahua
But regarding height, I think

1050
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,840
whether it's early or later interactions,
Huahua

1051
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,920
Huahua,
I think they're all okay.

1052
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,360
they're all over 180 cm tall.
Huahua,

1053
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,040
Huahua
I just think

1054
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,640
Susu,
one sentence made two women silent.

1055
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,280
Huahua,
Yes, that's excellent.

1056
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,860
Huahua, I think it's pretty good.

1057
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,200
Xinxin,
Entering the cabin.

1058
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,280
You and your siblings, in terms of emotions and life,
Xinxin,

1059
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,080
Xinxin,
which aspect has changed the most and why?

1060
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,040
Xiaoling,
I think for me,

1061
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,520
the changes in emotions and life
Xiaoling,

1062
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,760
Xiaoling,
are probably half and half.

1063
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,280
Xiaoling,
Because in terms of emotions, indeed,

1064
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,800
I never thought before
Xiaoling,

1065
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,880
Xiaoling,
that I would have this definition of an ideal type.

1066
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,920
And I also didn't expect
Xiaoling,

1067
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,680
Xiaoling,
that I would be more interested in Tutu now.

1068
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,520
because he's not my ideal type.
Xiaoling,

1069
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,000
Xiaoling,
Then in terms of life,

1070
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,640
it's like what I just mentioned,
Xiaoling,

1071
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,280
Xiaoling,
I might have interacted with my brother before

1072
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,720
just as strangers, passersby.
Xiaoling,

1073
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,080
Xiaoling,
But now I truly realize it's different.

1074
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,640
Xiaoling,
And I think it's the same for my brother.

1075
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,120
I never thought before
Xiaoling,

1076
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,720
Xiaoling,
that he would stand on stage to give a speech.

1077
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,440
And then express his feelings.
Xiaoling,

1078
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,800
Xiaoling,
This is something he's never done before.

1079
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,760
Moreover,
Xiaoling,

1080
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,560
Xiaoling,
not to mention what he did on stage,

1081
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,040
he rarely even goes on stage.
Xiaoling,

1082
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,600
Xiaoling,
Xiaoling, and then we each cried once for each other.

1083
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,360
I think
Xiaoling,

1084
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,200
to be honest, this has never happened before.
Xiaoling,

1085
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,890
to be honest, this has never happened before.

1086
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,520
Susu, I feel he has changed a lot in his daily life.

1087
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,320
Susu,
Because he might be a...

1088
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,560
person who's very camera-shy. Guo Lifang,
Susu,

1089
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,960
Susu,
Yes, before he came,

1090
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,760
he was probably very anxious and resistant.
Susu,

1091
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,000
Susu,
It felt like he didn't really want to come.

1092
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,600
it seemed like he was overthinking a lot.
Susu,

1093
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,520
Susu,
'What if I can't finish my thesis?'

1094
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,840
'What if no one likes me?'
Susu,

1095
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,640
Susu,
All sorts of this and that.

1096
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,000
But then after he arrived, he found out...
Susu,

1097
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,730
he's doing much better than me.
Susu,

1098
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,720
Susu,
Right.

1099
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,920
Then his emotions...
Susu,

1100
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,720
Susu,
But his emotions...

1101
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,200
he's always been sincere and passionate,
Susu,

1102
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,760
Susu,
and he treats girls very well.

1103
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,920
So I don't think he'll have that kind of...
Susu,

1104
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,880
Susu,
make girls feel a sense of disappointment.

1105
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,680
Susu,
As for my daily life,

1106
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,600
I actually don't feel much has changed.
Susu,

1107
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,200
Susu,
But when it comes to emotions,

1108
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,640
I feel I've changed a lot.
Susu,

1109
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,160
Susu,
I used to be an extremely reserved person.

1110
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,880
I was incredibly bottled up.
Susu,

1111
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,360
Susu,
I mean, in my entire life,

1112
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,520
I might have never taken the initiative, not once.
Susu,

1113
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,160
I might have never taken the initiative, not once.

1114
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,320
Susu,
Let alone actively...

1115
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,680
clearing up misunderstandings with others,
Susu,

1116
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,960
Susu,
or initiating conversations with people.

1117
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,320
Susu,
Yes.

1118
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,180
I used to be a very passive person.
Susu,

1119
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,320
Susu,
Right.

1120
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,480
Xinxin,
As for me...

1121
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,400
Xinxin,
I think I might have changed more in terms of lifestyle.

1122
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,160
The changes are quite significant.
Xinxin,

1123
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,800
The changes are quite significant.

1124
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,240
Xinxin,
Because I've been living alone for a long time,

1125
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,760
and then in the small house with many people,
Xinxin,

1126
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,800
Xinxin,
I started to ask things like,

1127
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,280
'What do you want? What do I want?'
Xinxin,

1128
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,560
Xinxin,
I started to care about others,

1129
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,520
taking care of others' emotions more often.
Xinxin,

1130
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,280
Xinxin,
As for Pangpang,

1131
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,000
he's also...
Xinxin,

1132
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,760
Xinxin,
I mean...

1133
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,800
Xinxin and I are actually quite independent in our daily lives.

1134
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,280
Xinxin,
So, the changes in our daily lives,

1135
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,440
have also become a bit more regular.
Xinxin,

1136
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,480
Xinxin,
But when it comes to emotions,

1137
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,040
I think he has changed.
Xinxin,

1138
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,160
Xinxin,
He's usually a rather decisive person,

1139
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,480
very straightforward.
Xinxin,

1140
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,720
Xinxin,
And when dealing with relationships,

1141
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,400
he's probably not one to drag things out.
Xinxin,

1142
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,980
he's probably not one to drag things out.

1143
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,280
Xinxin,
But after coming here, he might

1144
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,520
not want to miss out,
Xinxin,

1145
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,080
and he thinks a lot.
Xinxin,

1146
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,200
Xinxin, then he struggles with his thoughts every day,

1147
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,440
Xinxin,
thinking about many things.

1148
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,240
Xinxin,
seeing his indecisive side,

1149
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,400
I'm very happy.
Xinxin,

1150
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,120
Xinxin,
Yes, he doesn't need to criticize me anymore.

1151
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,920
because every day he feels
Xinxin,

1152
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,280
Xinxin,
that he's doing very well,

1153
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,560
and then he would nag me,
Xinxin,

1154
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,040
Xinxin,
thinking I'm not doing well enough in various aspects.

1155
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,240
and now I say,
Xinxin,

1156
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,000
Xinxin,
'Are you doing so well?'

1157
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,600
'So what right do you have to criticize me?'
Xinxin,

1158
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,680
Xinxin,
He says, 'I won't criticize you anymore.'

1159
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,040
'You're free to soar from now on.'
Xinxin,

1160
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,680
I,
Tata,

1161
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,080
Tata,
I'll just talk about myself, feeling a bit lost.

1162
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,000
as for me,
Tata,

1163
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,560
Tata,
my life hasn't changed much actually.

1164
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,320
it's about the same.
Tata,

1165
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,680
Tata,
But in terms of emotions,

1166
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,280
there have indeed been many changes.
Tata,

1167
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,740
there have indeed been many changes.

1168
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Tata,
In gatherings like this where everyone comes together,

1169
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,760
I'm the type who
Tata,

1170
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,480
Tata,
wouldn't actively try to blend in with everyone.

1171
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,280
I would stay by myself on the side,
Tata,

1172
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,160
Tata,
not talking.

1173
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,000
But since coming here, I feel that I've
Tata,

1174
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,920
Tata,
become more proactive in various aspects.

1175
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,080
I'll also actively join in playing with everyone,
Tata,

1176
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,320
Tata,
talking together.

1177
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,320
Tata,
In terms of emotions,

1178
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,120
it's similar to Susu.
Tata,

1179
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,440
Tata,
I'm actually quite a passive person too.

1180
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,880
but I feel that since coming here,
Tata,

1181
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,680
Tata,
I've gained a

1182
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,000
clear understanding of myself.
Tata,

1183
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,560
Tata,
I feel that in some aspects,

1184
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,640
I'm quite proactive, yes.
Tata,

1185
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,440
Tata, I didn't expect myself to be like this, actually.

1186
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,120
Susu.
Plus one, agree.

1187
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,880
So,
Tata.

1188
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,400
Huahua.
I think he might have

1189
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,480
a bigger change emotionally.
Huahua.

1190
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,060
a bigger change emotionally.

1191
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,480
Huahua's
Because I've never been involved in

1192
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,760
process of getting to know someone, pursuing them,
Huahua's

1193
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,719
Huahua.
and then being together.

1194
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,880
Huahua
So I actually saw him

1195
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,810
constantly sticking by your side,

1196
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,400
Huahua.
revolving around the girl he likes.

1197
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,800
Because I used to feel that
Huahua.

1198
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
always had others revolving around him.
Huahua

1199
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,120
Xiaoling,
So this is already considered proactive now.

1200
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,800
isn't it?
Xiaoling,

1201
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,400
Huahua,
Yes, so this time

1202
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,080
I saw him being a bit more proactive.
Huahua,

1203
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,040
Huahua,
You might not feel it,

1204
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,600
but actually for me,
Huahua,

1205
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,400
Huahua.
I didn't feel he was very proactive either.

1206
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,040
This is my honest opinion.
Huahua.

1207
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,520
Huahua
Then in terms of daily life, it's still the same.

1208
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,639
just eats and sleeps without worry, sleeps and eats.
Huahua

1209
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,360
Huahua.
Right.

1210
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,679
The only difference is
Huahua.

1211
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,000
Huahua
when he saw I was in a bad mood,

1212
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,719
he made me four tangyuan.
Huahua

1213
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,980
Overcooked tangyuan.
Xiaoling:

1214
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
Huahua,
As for myself,

1215
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,400
I think my emotions and life
Huahua,

1216
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,280
have both changed quite a bit.
Huahua,

1217
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,480
Wu Zun:
There's been a lot of growth in both areas.

1218
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,440
Everyone,
Wu Zun:

1219
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,200
Huahua,
actually, when I came to this cabin,

1220
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,840
I feel the first good friend I made
Huahua,

1221
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,920
Huahua:
was Xinxin.

1222
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,840
But I feel a bit awkward now.
Huahua:

1223
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,920
Huahua:
I don't dare to get close to her anymore.

1224
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,680
Xinxin:
Why?

1225
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,840
Tata:
Is it because of the relationship with Pangpang?

1226
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,240
Huahua,
I don't know if it's sensitivity or what,

1227
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,440
but I also feel that the two of us
Huahua,

1228
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,640
Huahua.
are not like we were at the beginning.

1229
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,720
Huahua,
It means we can talk about anything.

1230
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,480
it's not that good anymore.
Huahua,

1231
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,000
Huahua,
So I feel these days

1232
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,080
I've been deliberately avoiding you too.
Huahua,

1233
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,400
Huahua,
I've been deliberately avoiding you too.
Huahua,

1234
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,920
I don't know if you've noticed,
Huahua,

1235
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,360
but I'm afraid to say too much to you.
Huahua,

1236
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,640
Huahua,
Because I feel like

1237
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,760
not saying anything is not good, but saying too much isn't good either.
Huahua,

1238
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,440
Huahua,
I have the same feeling as you.

1239
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,400
Xinxin,
Yes, actually I'm a bit scared.

1240
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,680
you give me too much information.
Xinxin,

1241
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,160
Xinxin,
Because I tend to overthink things.

1242
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,840
then when I relay it to Pangpang,
Xinxin,

1243
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,960
Xinxin,
it becomes another version.

1244
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,280
Huahua,
Yes.

1245
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,560
Xinxin,
because my emotions are also

1246
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,440
quite volatile.
Xinxin,

1247
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,320
Xinxin,
What Huahua conveys to me,

1248
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,280
I'll embellish it when I pass it on to him.
Xinxin,

1249
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,920
Xinxin,
Then he gets fired up again.

1250
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,920
He thinks I'm ready again,
Xinxin,

1251
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,320
Susu,
that I'm going to make a move.

1252
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,800
Xinxin,
he says he wants to confess.

1253
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,520
I'm really afraid of him doing that.
Xinxin,

1254
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
Xinxin,
I'm very calm.

1255
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,640
These days when he asks me,
Xinxin,

1256
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,560
Xinxin,
I just say

1257
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,420
I'm thinking about my own things.
Xinxin,

1258
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,800
Zhu Dan,
It's not easy either.

1259
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,160
Xinxin,
from my perspective, I feel that

1260
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,680
whichever guy you choose from the house,
Xinxin,

1261
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,160
Xinxin,
I would be very happy for you.

1262
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,520
And I don't think it would affect
Xinxin,

1263
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,920
Xinxin,
our friendship.

1264
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,240
Because of him,
Xinxin,
our friendship.

1265
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,080
Xinxin,
our connection might become closer.

1266
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,200
But it wouldn't affect
Xinxin,

1267
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,680
Xinxin,
how much I like you,

1268
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,240
or how close we are.
Xinxin,

1269
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,760
Xinxin,
No matter who you end up with,

1270
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,600
I would be very happy,
Xinxin,

1271
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,360
Xinxin,
I would be happy for you.

1272
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,160
Yes.
Xinxin,

1273
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,840
Xiaoling
You two have a drink.

1274
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,960
Xinxin
Let's have a drink together.

1275
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,440
Zhu Dan
So honest.

1276
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,600
Say whatever comes to mind.
Zhu Dan

1277
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,120
Huahua
From an outsider's perspective yesterday,

1278
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,680
Huahua, we were quite dramatic, weren't we?

1279
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,400
Huahua
I was in a group with Terry and Pangpang.

1280
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,000
but let me tell you,
Huahua

1281
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,520
Huahua
Pangpang was really great yesterday.

1282
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,640
How so?
Tata

1283
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,680
Huahua
He didn't make me feel embarrassed at all.

1284
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,080
I felt he was afraid
Huahua

1285
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,480
Huahua
that I might be pushed into the spotlight.

1286
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,800
he would actively
Huahua

1287
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,680
Huahua
help me avoid some trouble.

1288
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,240
Xinxin
Stop giving out nice guy cards.

1289
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,920
Huahua
I'm not giving out nice guy cards. He really was good.

1290
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,120
Xinxin
Stop praising him.

1291
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,840
Huahua
This is just girl talk.

1292
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,440
You don't need to say I'm praising him.
Huahua

1293
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,760
Huahua
It'll just create another information gap later.

1294
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,280
Xinxin
Right.

1295
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,760
Because I've conveyed again
Xinxin

1296
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,800
Xinxin
that my ears have become very big now.

1297
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,400
Susu
Pangpang said he wants to confess.

1298
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Tata
It's heating up again.

1299
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,600
Xinxin
It's starting to heat up again.

1300
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,360
Huahua
His speech on the second floor

1301
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,960
He said, the point that made him angry
Huahua

1302
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,720
Huahua
might be that

1303
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,760
I was in contact with Terry at the same time
Huahua

1304
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
Huahua
and didn't tell him about it.

1305
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,640
I didn't explain it clearly to him either.
Huahua

1306
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,160
I didn't explain it clearly to him either.

1307
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,560
Huahua
But he told me,

1308
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
He said, 'You can go and interact with Terry,'
Huahua

1309
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,160
Huahua
'I don't mind.'

1310
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,640
He said, 'We're all adults,'
Huahua

1311
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,360
Huahua
'but when you interact with him,'

1312
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,400
'Huahua, can you pause things on my side?'

1313
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,440
Huahua
'Don't interact with Terry at the same time'

1314
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,960
'while also interacting with me.'
Huahua

1315
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,800
Huahua
'It would become like I'm chasing after Terry,'

1316
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,840
'while he's chasing after me,'
Huahua

1317
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,120
Huahua
'putting him in a very awkward position.'

1318
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,760
Huahua,
That speech of his was very manly.

1319
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,360
Huahua,
it was really responsible.

1320
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,040
when I heard it, I just
Huahua,

1321
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,360
Susu,
wanted to cry.

1322
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,240
Huahua,
I would think,

1323
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,440
am I moved or attracted?

1324
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,200
Xinxin,
Xinxin, in relationships, being moved alone is not enough.

1325
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,800
feelings still need attraction
Xinxin,

1326
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,060
more than being moved.
Xinxin,

1327
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,280
Tata,
Actually, if I hadn't come in,

1328
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,800
following this direction,
Tata,

1329
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,520
Tata,
you and Harry would have continued to get to know each other.

1330
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,680
Xinxin,
assuming Tata hadn't come in,

1331
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,680
my understanding with Harry,
Xinxin,

1332
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,440
Xinxin,
I think we would still be friends.

1333
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,120
Xiaoling,
and Harry is actually quite straightforward.

1334
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,720
because I remember
Xiaoling,

1335
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,400
Xiaoling,
my first Cupid date,

1336
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,880
he sent me a text message that day.
Xiaoling,

1337
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,600
Xiaoling,
The content was,

1338
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:06,960
'Thank you,
Xiaoling,
The content was,

1339
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Xiaoling,
friend who made me feel comfortable.'

1340
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,040
then I said, 'This guy is really straightforward.'
Xiaoling,

1341
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,820
then I said, 'This guy is really straightforward.'

1342
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,840
Xiaoling,
Including my interactions with him later,

1343
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,880
sometimes I would feel
Xiaoling,

1344
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,960
Xiaoling,
like he's always dancing in my minefield.

1345
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,840
Xinxin,
Yes, he is.

1346
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,160
always dancing in my minefield too.
Xinxin,

1347
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,000
Xinxin,
Then at first, Pangpang

1348
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Pangpang kept saying,
Xinxin,

1349
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,200
Xinxin,
'Why did you send it to him?'

1350
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,680
then I said,
Xinxin,

1351
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,960
Xinxin,
'Because we talked a lot.'

1352
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,160
others all had
Xinxin,

1353
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,680
Xinxin,
someone to interact with.

1354
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,320
Xinxin,
I knew at that time

1355
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,920
after he had a date with you that day,
Xinxin,

1356
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,600
Xinxin,
he sent it to you afterwards.

1357
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,080
then I didn't
Xinxin,

1358
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,600
Tata,
But I didn't send him anything that day.

1359
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,000
because I sent it to Tutu.
Tata,

1360
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,680
Xinxin,
But actually there was a misunderstanding.

1361
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,840
I did receive
Xinxin,

1362
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,720
Xinxin,
a heartfelt message that day,

1363
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,400
but it wasn't from him.
Xinxin,

1364
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,440
Huahua,
It was from Terry.

1365
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,920
Susu,
you thought it was from Harry?

1366
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,560
Xinxin,
I thought it was from Harry.

1367
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,720
Pangpang was a bit angry that day
Xinxin,

1368
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,560
Xinxin,
because he felt

1369
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,320
he didn't know what it meant.
Xinxin,

1370
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:57,880
Xinxin,
Later I told him

1371
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,600
that it wasn't actually sent to me by that person.
Xinxin,

1372
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,960
Xinxin,
He said that makes sense.

1373
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,480
it's reasonable.
Xinxin,

1374
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,160
Xinxin,
If he sent it to me

1375
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,640
after going on a date with you,
Xinxin,

1376
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,440
Xinxin,
I would find it a bit strange.

1377
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,680
it would feel quite odd.
Xinxin,

1378
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,840
Xinxin,
But after his date with you,

1379
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,240
he was indeed very clear.
Xinxin,

1380
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,760
Xinxin,
And the two of us

1381
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,890
didn't have any unnecessary contact.
Xinxin,

1382
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Xinxin,
He's very clear about

1383
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,360
what type he likes
Xinxin,

1384
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,360
and what kind of girl he wants.

1385
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,120
Xinxin,
If we had entered at the same time,

1386
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,440
he would probably
Xinxin,

1387
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,600
give you the first second.
Xinxin,

1388
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,720
Yang Gen,
Xinxin gracefully

1389
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,920
let go of this relationship.
Yang Gen,

1390
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,160
Yang Gen,
Yang Gen, and it didn't affect Tata and Harry at all.

1391
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,720
right.
Wu Zun,

1392
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,160
Huahua,
Does Tangtang like your type?

1393
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,240
Xiaoling,
from what I know about him,

1394
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,640
he used to like spirited girls.
Xiaoling,

1395
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,080
That's you.

1396
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,000
Susu,
You're spirited.

1397
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,800
Xiaoling,
but now it's completely different.

1398
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,440
thank you.
Susu,

1399
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,120
Xinxin,
There's a message.

1400
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,920
Terry,
there's a text.

1401
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,560
Xiaoling,
confession is coming.

1402
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,680
do you need a date to make up for regrets?
Xiaoling,

1403
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,210
vote to decide who gets the regret-free date.
Harry,

1404
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,200
do you need it?
Tata,

1405
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,600
Xiaolu, everyone probably hopes for Xiaoling and Tutu, right?
Xiaolu,

1406
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,730
Xiaolu, everyone probably hopes for Xiaoling and Tutu, right?

1407
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,920
Xiaoling,
Whether or not there's a chance for a date,

1408
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,160
I'll go talk to him anyway.
Xiaoling,

1409
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,960
still wants to have more contact with Terry.
Huahua

1410
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,000
Tutu,
Actually, I think

1411
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,880
I really need this opportunity.
Tutu,

1412
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,800
Hali
I can actually

1413
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,720
spend time with Tata up close.
Hali

1414
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Hali,
It's really just these two days.

1415
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,200
Pangpang
bro,

1416
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,960
voted for you.
Pangpang

1417
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,820
gives it to you.
Tata

1418
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,240
Yang Gen,
For each episode,

1419
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,760
we will base on the content of the current episode
Yang Gen,

1420
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,000
Yang Gen,
to decide the deduction content.

1421
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,680
the deduction content for this episode is
Yang Gen,

1422
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,720
Yang Gen,
which two people will get

1423
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,120
the chance for a perfect date.
Yang Gen,

1424
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,680
Yang Gen,
This time it's an individual competition.

1425
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,840
please write your answers
Yang Gen,

1426
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,920
Yang Gen,
on the answer board.

1427
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,840
Yang Gen,
those who answer correctly

1428
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,640
will receive a
Yang Gen,

1429
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,320
Yang Gen,
Fruit Cube Wild Badge.

1430
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,360
in the final episode,
Yang Gen,

1431
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,520
Yang Gen,
the guest who receives the most Fruit Cube Wild Badges

1432
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,720
the guest who receives the most Fruit Cube Wild Badges
Yang Gen,

1433
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,400
Yang Gen,
will win

1434
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,760
a mysterious grand prize provided by Fruit Cube.

1435
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,360
Yang Gen,
Alright,

1436
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Yang Gen,
now let's enter

1437
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,520
Yang Gen, the Fruit Cube Exciting Moment of 'Love Siblings'.

1438
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,840
Yang Gen,
Now that we've all finished writing,

1439
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,300
let's reveal the answers.
Yang Gen,

1440
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,400
Yang Gen,
Tutu and Xiaoling.

1441
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,680
only
Yang Gen,

1442
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,160
Yang Gen,
Teacher Muchun wrote Huahua and Hali.

1443
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,920
Muchun
why is that?

1444
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,320
Mu Chun
Aren't they separated?

1445
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,720
So they might not be a match.
Mu Chun

1446
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,080
The couple who's supposed to go on a date.
Mu Chun

1447
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,760
That makes sense.
Xiao Lu

1448
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Mu Chun
So I wanted to say,

1449
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,440
Doesn't Harry have separation anxiety?
Mu Chun

1450
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
At this stage, he's about to
Mu Chun

1451
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:06,920
At this stage, he's about to

1452
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,760
Give them a chance.
Wu Zun

1453
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,440
Yang Gen
What will the answer be like?

1454
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,360
Next, we're going to enter
Yang Gen

1455
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,440
Yang Gen
Party Xiao Ye Jiu

1456
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,760
It feels like there's immediately
Yang Gen

1457
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,890
Fruit Cube's exciting reveal moment.
Yang Gen

1458
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,560
Xin Xin
There's a message.

1459
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,200
Xiao Ling
When I received that text saying

1460
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,800
Xiao Ling, when there's a make-up date,

1461
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,240
Xiao Ling
I was thinking,

1462
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Xiao Ling, if I really got this chance,

1463
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,440
Xiao Ling
when I'm on a date with Tutu,

1464
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,360
what should I say?
Xiao Ling

1465
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,400
Xiao Ling
Then I got really conflicted,

1466
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,120
It won't turn ugly, will it?
Xiao Ling

1467
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,360
Xiao Ling
We won't end up not even being able to be friends, right?

1468
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,820
I don't want that outcome.
Xiao Ling

1469
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,920
Hua Hua
I want to have more interaction with Terry.

1470
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,440
We haven't had enough interaction yet.
Hua Hua

1471
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,240
Hua Hua
So I want to get to know him better.

1472
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
Xin Xin
Being able to meet everyone is already satisfying enough.

1473
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,880
I think this date
Xin Xin

1474
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,000
Xin Xin
can be given to someone who needs it more.

1475
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,480
Su Su
I think we should give others more opportunities.

1476
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,800
Let them have more interactions.
Su Su

1477
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,320
Let them have more interactions.

1478
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
Ta Ta
Actually, I don't feel any regret.

1479
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,800
I just think
Ta Ta

1480
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,200
Ta Ta
if we can date, then let's date.

1481
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,600
Is it necessary?
Ta Ta

1482
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,280
Hua Hua
Does anyone want to go?

1483
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,000
Ta Ta
Compared to us two,

1484
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,330
it feels like those two might need it more.
Ta Ta

1485
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
Huahua
Do you want to go to Xiaoling?

1486
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,680
Xiaoling
to be honest, I want to.

1487
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,560
even if there wasn't this dating opportunity,
Xiaoling

1488
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,040
Xiaoling
I would still

1489
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,600
Susu
talk things out.

1490
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,760
Xiaoling
I originally during dinner today

1491
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,320
I said I didn't have the courage,
Xiaoling

1492
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,880
Xiaoling
but now I feel

1493
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,960
regardless of whether there's this dating opportunity or not,
Xiaoling

1494
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,840
Xiaoling
I will go talk to him.

1495
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,360
Huahua
giving you support.

1496
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,120
Tata
actually, I've already edited it.

1497
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,240
Xinxin
I've also made my choice.

1498
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,920
Susu
I've also edited it long ago.

1499
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,360
Huahua
yes, me too, Xiaoling.

1500
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,000
Susu
then I'll send it.

1501
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,600
Good luck.
Susu

1502
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,360
Tata
Good luck, Xiaoling.

1503
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,480
Huahua
for the regret-free date, I think

1504
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,960
Xiaoling and Tutu need it more.
Huahua

1505
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,240
Huahua
I might not be able to

1506
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,840
because this date
Huahua

1507
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,680
Huahua
is to further my relationship with Terry.

1508
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,080
but I think Xiaoling and Tutu
Huahua

1509
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,280
need to clear up the misunderstanding.
Huahua

1510
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,280
Xiaoling
I want to have a frank talk with Tutu.

1511
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,520
otherwise, I'll feel very uncomfortable.
Xiaoling

1512
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,680
otherwise, I'll feel very uncomfortable.

1513
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,960
Xiaolu
Girls all understand.

1514
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,800
Zhu Dan
Xiaoling

1515
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,160
Terry
There's a text message.

1516
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,680
Harry
To the boys in the small house,

1517
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,600
one of you will
Harry

1518
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,520
Harry
get a chance for a regret-free date.

1519
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,200
Please vote among Harry, Tangtang, Terry, and Tutu
Harry

1520
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,320
Harry
to decide

1521
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,680
the owner of the regret-free date.
Harry

1522
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,200
Harry
You can't vote for yourself.

1523
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:14,720
Bolang
Harry

1524
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,720
Pangpang
Campaigning for myself.

1525
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,240
Harry
Then my reason is very clear.

1526
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,120
It's because
Harry

1527
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,920
Harry
I can actually be close to Tata

1528
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,960
it's actually just these two days.
Harry

1529
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,850
it's actually just these two days.

1530
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,760
Harry
Because after this,

1531
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,080
she's going to Japan for her work,
Harry

1532
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,840
Harry
and I'm going to England for my studies.

1533
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,640
It's really hard to meet up.
Harry

1534
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,720
Harry,
This issue has been bothering me

1535
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,920
for over a week now.
Harry,

1536
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,400
Harry.
Every night, I have to go out,

1537
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:39,920
wearing a short-sleeved shirt,
Harry.

1538
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,560
Harry,
wearing thinner clothes.

1539
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,020
I need to go out to cool off.
Harry,

1540
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,440
Harry.
It's annoying every day,

1541
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,040
You see me with a long face every day,
Harry.

1542
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
Harry.
it's because of this reason,

1543
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,360
Not because of anything else.
Harry.

1544
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,620
yes.
Harry,

1545
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,120
Pangpang,
Brother,

1546
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,720
I vote for you.
Pangpang,

1547
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,600
Pangpang,
You won. Go ahead.

1548
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,640
Pangpang,
your reason is really...

1549
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,720
Tangtang,
I just want to go on this date.

1550
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,560
but I don't think
Tangtang,

1551
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,480
Tangtang,
I'm the one among us

1552
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,840
who needs this date the most.
Tangtang,

1553
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,120
Tangtang,
So,

1554
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,800
Pangpang, please vote for the person who needs it the most.
Tangtang,

1555
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,720
Yang Geng,
Campaigning.

1556
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,250
help your sister campaign.
Yang Geng,

1557
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,840
well, I actually
Terry,

1558
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,640
Terry,
think similarly to Tangtang.

1559
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,360
because I,
Terry,

1560
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,920
Terry,
I just,

1561
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,640
anyway, I'm not like you.
Terry,

1562
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,200
Terry,
Whether it's studies

1563
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:14,960
Terry,
or Tata's work,

1564
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,840
maybe both sides are not quite...
Terry,

1565
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,440
Terry,
I think I'll have many opportunities later

1566
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,100
I can get in touch with Huahua.
Terry,

1567
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,080
Tutu,
Actually, I think

1568
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,920
I really need this opportunity.
Tutu,

1569
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,920
Tutu,
Through what Tangtang just said,

1570
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,480
including some things she told me,
Tutu,

1571
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,280
Tutu,
there are some details.

1572
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,720
For example, she said
Tutu,

1573
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,640
Tutu,
when Xiaoling was talking to me

1574
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,240
about emotional issues,
Tutu,

1575
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,500
I changed the subject to something else.
Tutu,

1576
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,760
Tutu,
Actually, I don't remember that happening.

1577
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,360
Tutu,
I might not have formally

1578
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,480
had such a conversation with her.
Tutu,

1579
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,880
Tutu,
Regardless of the final outcome,

1580
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,360
I think we need to talk it out, to communicate clearly.
Tutu,

1581
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:45,880
I think we need to talk it out, to communicate clearly.

1582
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,160
that's right.
Wu Zun,

1583
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,600
Tangtang's eyes have softened a bit.
Zhu Dan,

1584
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,220
Tangtang's eyes have softened a bit.

1585
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,320
Tang Tang.
Okay then.

1586
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,200
Let's vote individually.
Tang Tang.

1587
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,760
Alright.
Tu Tu.

1588
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,280
Terry.
Let's not discuss it. We'll vote on our own.

1589
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,440
Tang Tang.
I do want to go on this date.

1590
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,160
to go out and have fun with Su Su again.
Tang Tang.

1591
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,080
Tang Tang.
To spend more time together.

1592
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,200
Tang Tang.
But I think Tu Tu

1593
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,400
needs this date more.
Tang Tang.

1594
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,680
Tang Tang.
Even if you don't give an answer tomorrow,

1595
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,360
at least you two will spend a day together.
Tang Tang.

1596
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,440
Tang Tang.
Xiaoling won't dwell on this matter.

1597
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,920
So she can avoid a whole day of inner turmoil.
Tang Tang.

1598
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,520
Tu Tu.
Even if the date tomorrow isn't successful,

1599
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,040
I'll also go to open
Tu Tu.

1600
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,120
Tu Tu.
the House of Intentions tonight.

1601
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,360
To truly
Tu Tu.

1602
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,000
Tu Tu.
sit down and talk about this matter with her.

1603
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,080
To have a good talk with Xiaoling.
Tu Tu.

1604
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,080
Otherwise, I feel
Tu Tu.

1605
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,640
Tu Tu.
if we don't clear things up,

1606
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,080
it will be a regret in my heart.
Tu Tu.

1607
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,720
Let's go. Let's start our journey back.
Tu Tu.

1608
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,250
Let's go. Back to the cabin.
Terry.

1609
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,800
Yang Gen.
Okay.

1610
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,600
A round of applause for each of us
Yang Gen.

1611
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:53,960
Yang Gen.
for the correct answer.

1612
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,920
Here's the Fruit Cube Wild Badge.
Yang Gen.

1613
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,000
Look at my color scheme.
Xiaolu.

1614
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,640
Zhu Dan.
Yes, the one on my chest is the same.

1615
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,400
Meina.
Let's go wild with like-minded people.

1616
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,960
Terry.
Let's go home.

1617
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:09,970
It's so cold.
Harry.

1618
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,080
Terry.
Do you think they're back?

1619
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,280
Pangpang.
They probably haven't returned yet.

1620
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,240
Terry.
They're not back yet.

1621
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,560
Pangpang.
This bath is getting intense.

1622
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,720
You guys,
Pangpang.

1623
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,480
Pangpang.
usually so quiet,

1624
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,680
are all holding back.
Pangpang.

1625
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,600
Yang Gen.
Interrogation Bureau.

1626
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,920
After the Heart-to-Heart session,
Tu Tu.

1627
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,780
I'm really emotional.
Tu Tu.

1628
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,960
Tu Tu.
It's just,

1629
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,680
it's making me
Tu Tu.

1630
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,180
deeply reflect on my inner thoughts.
Tu Tu.

1631
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,120
Tutu
I even started to doubt myself.

1632
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,640
Am I really that bad?
Tutu

1633
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,040
Yang Gen
That's not what you should be doubting.

1634
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,280
It's not about being bad.
Xiaolu

1635
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,560
Tutu
I don't know how to express

1636
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,800
my inner feelings anymore.
Tutu

1637
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,520
Zhu Dan
He means he's already taken the initiative.

1638
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,280
But why haven't any of you noticed?
Zhu Dan

1639
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,210
Xiaolu, he sees this as everyone's rejection of him.

1640
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,520
Tangtang
Was I scary today?

1641
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,560
Terry
Actually, it wasn't scary.

1642
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,320
Maybe you care more about Xiaoling.
Terry

1643
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,440
Tangtang
I'm different from usual.

1644
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,600
Terry
Yes, it's a bit different.

1645
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,040
Terry
So what Xiaoling talked to you about is

1646
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,080
She quite likes Tutu, right?
Terry

1647
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,200
Tangtang
She said Tutu might have been proactive at first,

1648
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,880
and then she was happy,
Tangtang

1649
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,200
Tangtang
so she started to take initiative,

1650
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,680
but then she found Tutu pulling back,
Tangtang

1651
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,920
Tangtang
not responding anymore.

1652
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,080
Terry

1653
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,600
Terry
I think, as siblings,

1654
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,000
we still need to say this.
Terry

1655
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:29,760
Terry
We still need to say it.

1656
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,420
I think you did nothing wrong.
Terry

1657
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,400
Huahua
Are they back yet?

1658
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:34,760
Susu
Doesn't seem like it.

1659
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,880
Huahua
Is anyone there?

1660
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,680
Susu
No one.

1661
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,400
Susu
Nobody.

1662
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,640
Terry
The girls are back.

1663
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,680
Tangtang
I really want to go welcome them,

1664
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,520
but I need to rest for a bit.
Tangtang

1665
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,380
Out of battery.
Zhang Zining

1666
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,040
Tata
No,

1667
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,600
when did you guys get back?
Tata

1668
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,040
Pangpang
Five minutes before you.

1669
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,280
Tom
Xiaoling

1670
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:52,880
Tangtang
What's up?

1671
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,240
Xiaoling
I want to talk to you.

1672
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,600
Terry

1673
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,480
Xiaoling
Come out.

1674
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,280
Terry
Fruit Cube Wild Bar

1675
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,560
I really want to hear it.
Harry

1676
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,560
Terry
I want to hear it too.

1677
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,520
Xiaoling
How did your conversation go?

1678
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,400
Tangtang
Pretty good.

1679
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,200
Tell me something I want to know.
Xiaoling

1680
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,680
Tangtang
He still doesn't know his own feelings.

1681
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,200
Xiaoling
Is this from your public chat,

1682
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,160
or did you ask him privately?
Xiaoling

1683
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,920
Tangtang
It's all public.

1684
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,280
I actually asked him quite a lot,
Tangtang

1685
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,400
Tangtang
about many of the points you were confused about.

1686
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,320
Tangtang
and then,

1687
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,680
although I
Tangtang

1688
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,280
Tangtang
might not really like this kind of behavior,

1689
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,140
but he did tell the truth, I guess.
Tangtang

1690
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,360
Tangtang
He also said

1691
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,760
that he
Tangtang

1692
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,880
Tangtang
hasn't made up his mind yet.

1693
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,540
Whether he'll confess or not.
Tangtang

1694
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,360
Xiaoling
I learned something today.

1695
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,800
It seems like Tata
Xiaoling

1696
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,920
Xiaoling
mentioned it unintentionally.

1697
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,760
Then she said
Xiaoling

1698
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,720
Xiaoling
when she was an interviewer,

1699
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,040
she felt Harry would be more interested in dating her.
Xiaoling

1700
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,560
Xiaoling
She thought Tutu

1701
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,720
wasn't as interested in dating her.
Xiaoling

1702
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,880
Xiaoling
When I heard that, I said,

1703
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,040
'What do you mean?
Xiaoling

1704
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,760
Xiaoling
Did Tutu go for an interview with you?'

1705
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Xiaoling
So now I'm wondering,

1706
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,040
was it the first time
Xiaoling

1707
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,920
Xiaoling
he probably approached Tata,

1708
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,680
but was rejected,
Xiaoling

1709
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,880
and then he came to me?
Xiaoling

1710
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,720
Tangtang
Actually, you might be his second choice.

1711
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,040
Susu
I heard from Mimi today

1712
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,720
that your type is someone
Susu

1713
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,080
Susu
who's very handsome and cool.

1714
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,280
Tangtang
I'm actually quite extreme in my preferences.

1715
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,680
It's either
Tangtang

1716
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,400
Tangtang
super handsome

1717
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,640
or super cute.
Tangtang

1718
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,320
Susu
It's like how I don't like heavy makeup.

1719
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,200
Looks like the confession is going to fail.
Tangtang

1720
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:22,920
Looks like the confession is going to fail.

1721
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,840
Xiaoling
Yesterday when we were in the hot spring,

1722
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,200
there was a question asking
Xiaoling

1723
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,280
Xiaoling
if your feelings for me are developing into friendship

1724
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,240
or into love.
Xiaoling

1725
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,360
Xiaoling
You said you didn't know either.

1726
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,720
Tutu
I already have the answer in my heart.

1727
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,280
I think that must be love.
Tutu
