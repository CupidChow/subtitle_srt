1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,600
There's a mission.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,880
I'll take a look.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,000
(To members of the house.)

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,760
(A date with faith is coming.)

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,760
express your feelings in an anonymous letter.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,000
and secretly put it in the mailbox.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,760
(A man who received an anonymous letter)

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
Don't refuse the date invitation.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,280
Please finish the invitation before eight.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,680
In the anonymous letter,

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,600
(Do not reveal)

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,040
about the letter.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,120
I can't refuse.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,960
Okay.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,680
The one who got it can't refuse.

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,080
Here's your chance to be fat.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,400
Okay.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,200
Bravo!

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,800
To members of the house

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
From sunrise to sunset

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,480
You are all romantic memories together.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,440
Tomorrow the romantic house will open

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,880
In the remaining time,

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
in the remaining time

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,560
to witness your feelings.

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,000
Please cherish every opening

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,720
Treasure every romance

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,760
One limited edition for each person.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,400
Two hours per time.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
Five at most.

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
Please fill in the business board.

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,400
Be a considerate landlord.

33
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,280
A new area.

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,320
It's warm.

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,560
I can also make coffee.

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,280
It smells good

37
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,160
Really

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,039
Smells good

39
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,039
This is the smell of romance

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,960
Our new area

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,640
Romantic House is about to open.

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,479
This area

43
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,960
is a great space

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,720
a good space to chat and date.

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
We need to emphasize

46
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,280
the number of romantic houses

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,880
doesn't include the owner.

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,880
Who will start it?

49
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,320
It's not an invitation system.

50
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,800
but who is willing to come for you.

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,400
For example, I'm the owner of today's house.

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
I hope the romantic house

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,880
Today's members are

54
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,000
Two men and three women.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,440
Then we'll register ourselves.

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,840
Yes.

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,760
Whoever enters your romantic house first

58
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,040
will join your party.

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,840
But everyone

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,560
can only open a romantic house once.

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,320
So cherish this opportunity.

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,880
What do you want to say to me?

63
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,280
Yes.

64
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,480
Go up.

65
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,240
What do you want to share with me?

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,520
I don't know how to say romantic house.

67
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,040
How do you want to be romantic?

68
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,240
Isn't it a rule to write about the gender and gender?

69
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,120
Hello?

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,360
Flower.

71
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,880
Here.

72
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,360
Who?

73
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:50,960
Tae-seo.

74
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,680
Hello.

75
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,160
Do you want some?

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,760
Yes.

77
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,680
We're talking in secret.

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,400
Take more.

79
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,160
Let's talk.

80
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
Who are you inviting today?

81
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,200
What do you think?

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,440
Fatty and Xinxin.

83
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
I think if we invite Fatty, Xinxin will come in.

84
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
How do you think I should start?

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,720
I'm afraid I'll get excited later.

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,760
No.

87
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,920
I don't think you'll get excited.

88
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,640
Because it's not yesterday.

89
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,160
If it was yesterday, you would be excited.

90
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,040
You're fine today.

91
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,280
calm today?

92
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,560
Are you sure?

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
After I open a romantic house,

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
after I open a romantic house?

95
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,920
Will he come?

96
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,880
Can you take the lead first?

97
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,160
Just sit down.

98
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,320
Yes, I'll organize it.

99
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,560
Are you sure you don't want the fifth person?

100
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,440
Of course not.

101
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,320
I don't know.

102
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,560
Think about who the fifth person is.

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,440
I think Xiao Ling

104
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,640
Xiaoling will be embarrassed.

105
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,840
I think Hua is so brave.

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,040
Yes.

107
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,680
Look at the phone

108
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,560
Look at your phone.

109
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,160
Hua.

110
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,720
Two men and two women.

111
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,880
Go, Fatty.

112
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
Hurry.

113
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,480
So this number

114
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,640
Hua told us?

115
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,760
That girl.

116
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,640
She can only restrict the gender.

117
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,280
But as for

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,600
the man and the woman

119
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,520
It's us.

120
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
What if there are too many people?

121
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
Grab it.

122
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,760
I hope

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,240
I hope we can get to know each other more.

124
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
Tae-seo is going.

125
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,880
He volunteered.

126
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,880
There may be some misunderstanding these days.

127
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,720
We're going to talk.

128
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,640
Good.

129
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,000
I have to talk to Hua.

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,400
I think it should be a great reconciliation in the century.

131
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,360
Romantic House.

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,440
Today's owner is us.

133
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,320
Hua.

134
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,159
So did you get this position?

135
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,040
Follow me.

136
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll come even if you don't allow me to.

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,400
No.

138
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,520
There's a fire here. Light the candles.

139
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

140
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,720
It feels so good.

141
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:10,800
Smells good.

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,640
I already smell it.

143
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,800
Have one.

144
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,760
I'll take one.

145
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,440
It's fun.

146
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,920
Right?

147
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,960
You're too old to play with fire.

148
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,200
Done.

149
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,120
So romantic.

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,520
It's really romantic.

151
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,560
Then why is it called "Romantic House"?

152
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,480
Come up and talk.

153
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's talk.

154
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Because I will definitely say

155
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,320
talk to you.

156
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,520
I have to say this.

157
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,280
Because you'll be there too.

158
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,920
And I'll tell her

159
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,760
I'll say it too.

160
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,920
Then say it.

161
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,960
You can say whatever you want.

162
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
I think it's the happiest to say it out.

163
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
You'll know

164
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,720
how you're going to get along with her.

165
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,640
Friends can be more natural friends.

166
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,800
I just stand

167
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,720
very neutral.

168
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,120
no matter what happens between you two,

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,480
I will be Hua's best friend.

170
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,440
I won't stand with you.

171
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,600
to show my stance.

172
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,240
Right?

173
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,680
It's okay.

174
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
Because we... Yes.

175
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,840
You've made up your mind.

176
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,280
what you want to say, right?

177
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,080
I'm sure I've thought it through.

178
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,560
They are already here.

179
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,120
So nervous.

180
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm nervous.

181
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,480
Coming.

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,520
Come in. Isn't it romantic?

183
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,240
How is it?

184
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,760
Do you feel it?

185
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,440
So romantic.

186
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,480
Did you do this?

187
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:36,880
Yes.

188
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes, I lit the candles.

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,800
Have a seat.

190
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,880
Let's make some coffee

191
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,840
Like having tea at night.

192
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
It's beautiful here

193
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,640
Yes.

194
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:46,720
Guoli. Yes.

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,280
You should bring your camera here.

196
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,680
Good pair.

197
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,320
Let's take a photo.

198
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,800
Nice.

199
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
Yes.

200
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,880
Very natural

201
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,080
We're the first to come to Romantic House

202
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,440
So romantic

203
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,840
You are the most romantic siblings.

204
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,800
I'm so happy here.

205
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Right?

206
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,800
It's like a paradise.

207
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,040
And this place

208
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,440
a sense of security.

209
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,920
Yes.

210
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,080
Okay.

211
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,280
Okay.

212
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,040
Here.

213
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,760
Pour it in the cup.

214
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,320
Okay, thank you.

215
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,400
Hua, sit next to me.

216
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,600
Okay.

217
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:24,880
Wait.

218
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,280
It's a bit watery.

219
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,240
Sorry.

220
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,200
So you saw

221
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,320
the text I sent.

222
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,360
I'll come if you send it.

223
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,520
You'll come no matter what.

224
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,960
You'll come no matter what.

225
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,080
Excited.

226
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,000
Can't there be background music?

227
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,400
No.

228
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,320
But yesterday

229
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,440
was really good.

230
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,000
But we're not the best partners.

231
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,880
Yes, we're not the best.

232
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,840
I thought it would be you.

233
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,560
Did you vote for me?

234
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,160
Yes.

235
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,920
Did you vote for me?

236
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,680
Tata.

237
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
It's where they make models.

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
and singing and dancing.

239
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,800
I think they put more effort

240
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,360
in this aspect.

241
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,720
I think Tata and others

242
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,480
are eye-catching.

243
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,360
Because in the end,

244
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,080
Memory point.

245
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,880
Yes.

246
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
It doesn't matter.

247
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,520
As long as I'm happy.

248
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,920
It's not important. He said a lot.

249
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,360
Oh no, I'm so nervous.

250
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,560
Me too.

251
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,640
OK, we're here.

252
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,840
Let's get straight to the point.

253
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,360
Who will speak first?

254
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,200
Let me say something first.

255
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,720
Why am I

256
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,480
my emotions

257
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,840
to the back.

258
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,560
and then there were so many ups and downs.

259
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,400
After our first date,

260
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,480
we talked about

261
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,280
We both expressed our feelings.

262
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,680
They want to meet the other side again.

263
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,920
and take a look.

264
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,680
So when Tata

265
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,160
when Tarri and I came in,

266
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,200
we sent the text

267
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,320
to newcomers respectively.

268
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,920
But at that time,

269
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,760
I also said

270
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,920
I was in contact with Xiaoling.

271
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,760
Because the next day,

272
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,400
the next day.

273
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,960
But because

274
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,160
your emotions were unstable,

275
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,520
So I changed my direction quickly.

276
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,800
When I saw you unhappy,

277
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,680
At that time,

278
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,880
I couldn't make you so sad.

279
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,440
So the next day,

280
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,520
the next day.

281
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,160
I sent you that message.

282
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,880
First of all, you think she was unhappy.

283
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,720
Were you unhappy then?

284
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,880
I haven't received your message for two days.

285
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,200
Yes.

286
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,560
I knew it when I saw you.

287
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,040
Two days.

288
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,520
But I didn't show anyone

289
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,280
I have negative emotions,

290
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
including my unhappiness.

291
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,480
Maybe I didn't express it.

292
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,320
But you feel that I don't know.

293
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,440
But in my heart,

294
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,520
I never wanted to express

295
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,680
about this.

296
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,080
It's just that at the moment,

297
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,040
including me.

298
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,240
My siblings (text number) are zero.

299
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,120
My brothers and I

300
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,040
received zero in two days.

301
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,280
But we were in the siblings' house.

302
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,440
We had fun.

303
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,800
There's no love between a funny man and a woman.

304
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,040
Although it's possible

305
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
when we say this,

306
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,440
But maybe

307
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,400
a little disappointed.

308
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,160
But I can guarantee that

309
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,000
we never

310
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,480
emotions to anyone.

311
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,200
I don't want you

312
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,320
pity us or something.

313
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,840
No.

314
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,600
You don't need to stress.

315
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,320
I'll say,

316
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm not stressed.

317
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,440
Let me tell you.

318
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
I'll tell you what I think.

319
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,640
And I was in the Mirror Room.

320
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,280
Do you know I asked you a question?

321
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,520
Of course I know.

322
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,040
Yes.

323
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,640
I asked you.

324
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,520
Do you prefer dating

325
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,880
or sports day?

326
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,200
You said dating is more fun.

327
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,760
Okay, this is my first question.

328
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,520
I'll ask you the third question.

329
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
You said after the sports day,

330
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,800
after the sports day.

331
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,160
Right?

332
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
But two days after the sports day,

333
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,680
you sent them to Xiao Ling.

334
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,800
I didn't send Xiaoling the next day.

335
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,600
I didn't know who it was.

336
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,640
You didn't send it to her.

337
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,280
Yes.

338
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
I'll welcome Tata.

339
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,720
Because on that day,

340
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,920
We talked that day.

341
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,560
That's it.

342
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,640
Why didn't you send it to her the next day?

343
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:48,960
Because...

344
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,680
Do you want to hear me out?

345
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,520
They're not in the right state.

346
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,960
Yes.

347
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
The first day Tae-seo came in,

348
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,960
I was the one who was left behind.

349
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,360
I am...

350
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,960
We have no choice.

351
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,120
After Tae-seo was rejected,

352
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,920
after Tae-seo was rejected.

353
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,640
And on the sports day,

354
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,120
Tae-ri didn't send it to me either.

355
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,120
I know that.

356
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,880
It means I haven't received it for two days.

357
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
So I can understand

358
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,600
how sad you were when you didn't receive the message.

359
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
Because I know

360
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,160
more emotionally than me.

361
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,080
But I won't.

362
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,880
I just think

363
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,080
I just want to be sad.

364
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,800
or don't think about it secretly.

365
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,880
Excuse me.

366
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,760
Well...

367
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,080
About this message.

368
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,320
Why didn't I send it to you

369
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,800
I didn't send it to you

370
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,440
because when we were on a date,

371
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,480
we clearly said

372
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,360
they both want to try it again.

373
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,720
Yes.

374
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,440
So we get along as usual.

375
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,840
right?

376
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,080
We got along well with each other.

377
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,440
Until the Secret Mirror Room,

378
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,360
you couldn't do it.

379
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,400
You said you can check it after the sports day.

380
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,320
But what you said is different from what you did.

381
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,720
You said all your actions

382
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,520
and all your

383
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,720
follow your heart?

384
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,160
Are you affected?

385
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,920
Yes, you said yes.

386
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,040
I said I firmly said

387
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,920
I said yes.

388
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,160
It's because I didn't feel it.

389
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,280
That's why I'm asking you this.

390
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,400
Maybe everyone has their own way

391
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,480
in their own way.

392
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,160
In fact, in life,

393
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,320
in life,

394
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,400
that I can feel my love,

395
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,640
I actually gave you a lot.

396
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,200
It's just that you can't see it.

397
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
I can feel it.

398
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm very sure.

399
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,400
Yes.

400
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,920
I also told Tu

401
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,360
I can feel that Fatty

402
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,480
his feelings for me.

403
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,240
But...

404
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,560
So...

405
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,120
Otherwise, I wouldn't have chosen you

406
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,880
to ask you these questions.

407
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,240
Yes, so I personally think

408
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,960
you can feel my feelings.

409
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,320
And I'm pretty clear.

410
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,760
Why can't I go so fast?

411
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,520
I'm answering the question.

412
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,560
First, it's about speed.

413
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,960
The emotions in it

414
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,560
will be magnified.

415
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,280
No.

416
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,480
Then you go out and play with Xinxin.

417
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,240
In front of me,

418
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,600
in front of me.

419
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,360
He has been making

420
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,160
a gift for Xiaoling today.

421
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,240
and put the ecosystem in front of me.

422
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,600
I said it.

423
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,280
He...

424
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,120
I didn't say that.

425
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,360
you gave it to Xiao Ling.

426
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,040
I didn't give it to Xiaoling.

427
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,720
I put it at the entrance.

428
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,360
I said I'd show it to Xiaoling.

429
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,160
You did.

430
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,280
When you came in, you said Xiaoling

431
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,840
Fatty wants to give you a gift.

432
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,480
I didn't say it.

433
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,400
He did it all day.

434
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,840
I said we made a gift

435
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,360
for everyone.

436
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,560
I didn't say it's for Xiaoling.

437
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,120
I said I'd wait for you.

438
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,720
Because Xiaoling asked me,

439
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,200
So I said,

440
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,480
You'll know when you see it.

441
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,360
I clearly remember this sentence.

442
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,560
Xiaoling, Fatty made you

443
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,720
a gift for you today.

444
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,560
And Xiaoling said, "What is it?"

445
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,240
Did you miss me?

446
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,720
What?

447
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,440
Do you miss me?

448
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,160
Yes.

449
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,960
Linlin!

450
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,120
I've been waiting for you.

451
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,760
What's wrong?

452
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,480
We're waiting for you.

453
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,240
because you were waiting for us?

454
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,720
Do you know what we were doing today?

455
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,440
What did we do?

456
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Let me show you later.

457
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
What did I do today?

458
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,800
Show.

459
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,000
Wait.

460
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,680
Here's a gift for you. Wait.

461
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,840
It's not me.

462
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,320
I'm just taking off my clothes.

463
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,480
Not me.

464
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm going to put something down.

465
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,440
Fatty.

466
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,360
Good evening.

467
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,480
What is this?

468
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
I made it

469
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,480
You didn't even look at it.

470
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,040
Let me see what it is.

471
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,560
The ecological tank.

472
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,800
The ecosystem.

473
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,400
What happened?

474
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,360
I remember.

475
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,320
Hua was sitting at the table.

476
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,480
Susu was also at the table.

477
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,320
Xiao Ling is here too.

478
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,240
I don't remember

479
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,440
Fatty made this ecosystem for Xiaoling.

480
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
This whole sentence.

481
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,520
So I think

482
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
there was a misunderstanding.

483
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
A big mistake.

484
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,960
Explain it now

485
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,120
You can explain it now.

486
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,200
Just say that you misunderstood.

487
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,680
Because I didn't say that.

488
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,280
If I give you something,

489
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,040
I will definitely...

490
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,160
No, I think the four of us

491
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,240
are too different.

492
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,720
You can tell me.

493
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,760
You can tell me.

494
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,160
what you did today.

495
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,640
can you say

496
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Fatty wants to give it to Xiaoling?

497
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,400
Or if you want to give it to Xiaoling,

498
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,000
you can ask directly.

499
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,840
If I could ask,

500
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,960
we wouldn't be sitting here now.

501
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,080
And the point is this ecosystem

502
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,400
I didn't do it alone.

503
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,480
And the two of us

504
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,000
didn't mention Xiaoling

505
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
I never mentioned Xiaoling.

506
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
How could it be?

507
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,440
I don't think you need to care about this misunderstanding.

508
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,040
After this misunderstanding,

509
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,720
I clearly

510
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,840
my feelings.

511
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,200
It's not a misunderstanding.

512
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,720
I think it's just

513
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,320
you told me

514
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,080
after the sports day.

515
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,640
But in my understanding,

516
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,840
you didn't send me

517
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,800
after the sports day.

518
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,720
Okay.

519
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,960
Let's talk now.

520
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,120
Follow that topic.

521
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,960
Mirror House.

522
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,720
You didn't feel it for two days.

523
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,840
In the next three days,

524
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,920
Do you feel it?

525
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,560
Yes.

526
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,360
In this small house,

527
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,000
I can feel it every day.

528
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,720
you have feelings for me.

529
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,360
That's right.

530
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,440
Except for the first day.

531
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,920
Yes.

532
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,200
That's good.

533
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,040
I can feel it.

534
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,240
Yes.

535
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,240
It's so blunt.

536
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,760
Tarri is here

537
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,280
The romantic house is open today

538
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,000
Because the initiator is Flower.

539
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So I sneaked over and took a look.

540
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,720
to see who it was.

541
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,840
Then I saw Fatty.

542
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,280
I took a look and left.

543
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,240
I couldn't get in because there were enough people.

544
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Let's talk about Mirror House.

545
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,000
Okay.

546
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,240
I asked a few questions

547
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,880
I asked a few questions.

548
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,520
I remember.

549
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,160
The first question is

550
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,600
Are you happy dating Tae-seo

551
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,400
or happy with you?

552
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,200
Yes, I also asked

553
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,560
if you would treat me differently.

554
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,760
Then you say yes, I will.

555
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,640
Then why did I

556
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,840
at dinner that day?

557
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,280
I suddenly lost control.

558
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,760
It's like this.

559
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,240
When we had dinner that night,

560
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,800
you asked me before I texted you.

561
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,800
if you would send it to me tonight.

562
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,920
Yes.

563
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,240
Will you send it to me today?

564
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,320
What are you doing?

565
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,880
Excuse me.

566
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,320
After sending this message that day,

567
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,000
I got angry right away.

568
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,800
But in the next second,

569
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,040
the map came to explain to me.

570
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,200
This is obviously your order.

571
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,359
I wanted to talk about it last night.

572
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,319
But the chat last night

573
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,359
is definitely not as good as it is now.

574
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,920
Because I saw you wearing a mask last night.

575
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,560
my emotions

576
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,960
is still very emotional.

577
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,440
I'm afraid I'll get too excited.

578
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,800
To avoid more conflicts with you,

579
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,119
I had to

580
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,839
to not communicate with you.

581
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,960
I think

582
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,920
our feelings for each other

583
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,400
are mutual.

584
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,520
I think as fat,

585
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,319
he would mind

586
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,480
he thinks you like him.

587
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,359
and sent it to Terri.

588
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,080
The second question is

589
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,720
there's a problem with lack of information.

590
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,840
I got

591
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,680
from my sister.

592
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,720
So you're not interested in Tae-seo.

593
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,880
After your first date with Tae-seo,

594
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
I understand if you send it to him.

595
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,160
But why?

596
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,880
after I expressed my feelings,

597
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,360
you have to comfort someone

598
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,480
who didn't come.

599
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,200
and Tata.

600
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,160
And I don't think this matter

601
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,120
should be comforted by text.

602
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,280
I didn't say I didn't mean anything to him.

603
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,880
I'm in contact with him.

604
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,160
Okay, Guoli.

605
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,000
Liberation.
OK.

606
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,960
But the message I sent that day

607
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,720
is comfort.

608
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,800
Because I think everyone is here.

609
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,400
He's not here.

610
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
I feel sorry for him.

611
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,880
As fat,

612
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,680
he might mind

613
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,800
the meaning of your message.

614
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,080
At that time,

615
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,160
at that time.

616
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,680
She can feel Fatty's love for her.

617
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,400
She was also in contact with Tae-ri.

618
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,120
and the atmosphere.

619
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,720
and send it to Tae-seo.

620
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,160
That's what we've been together for the past three or four days.

621
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Now you know

622
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,200
how you feel, right?

623
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,400
The first day Tae-seo came in,

624
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,600
and the next day,

625
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I clearly

626
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,560
with you.

627
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,120
Tae-seo is not my type.

628
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,240
Because Tae-seo is passive.

629
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,880
But we've been getting along these days.

630
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,960
I don't think he's completely passive.

631
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
On the contrary, Fatty doesn't treat me well.

632
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
I didn't talk to you these days.

633
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,920
Actually, in the past few days,

634
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,120
I've spent the most time with Tae-seo.

635
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
I'm sure

636
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,440
with the map and you.

637
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,560
I didn't say

638
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,360
every day.

639
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,560
I don't follow my heart every day.

640
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,600
Flower is very sincere.

641
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,560
First of all, Fatty did something

642
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,200
what Fatty did.

643
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,960
That's why your feelings are weakening.

644
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,000
Then you didn't.

645
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,160
Now I've met a new guy.

646
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,480
And you think

647
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,600
on a new guy.

648
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,800
it's normal.

649
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,000
In his opinion,

650
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,480
he expressed his feelings for you for three days.

651
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,680
You knew he liked you

652
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,320
you met another guy.

653
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,360
and didn't tell him

654
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,080
He thought

655
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,560
why I exploded that day.

656
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,600
Because you said

657
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
you said you would send it to me today.

658
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,800
Then I thought

659
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
I asked if you would send it to me today.

660
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,400
Then you said,

661
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,960
Don't you know what I'm doing?

662
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,080
Yes.

663
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,520
I think what you did

664
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,720
will make Fatty...

665
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,200
Okay.

666
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,560
I'm sorry.

667
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,480
I apologize for this.

668
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,080
I think the most wrong thing I did

669
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,960
is asking you about this that day.

670
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,080
will affect your judgment.

671
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,800
Definitely.

672
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,760
Because I sent you two days in a row.

673
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
I can't accept this explanation.

674
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:04,800
right?

675
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,440
Why did you choose me

676
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,440
how I feel for you?

677
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,920
you need to do something nice.

678
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,560
You know how I feel.

679
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,600
But the text you sent to Tae-seo.

680
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,680
I was treated differently.

681
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,120
Is this the answer today?

682
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,400
I made myself clear.

683
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,760
From the day we started dating,

684
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,000
I know how you feel.

685
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,320
Including your kindness to me.

686
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,720
Yes.

687
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,480
I know.

688
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,720
But before I know how I feel,

689
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,080
what you did to me

690
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,560
I think

691
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,720
I'm being inconsistent.

692
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,800
Maybe I think too bad of people.

693
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,600
I might not know

694
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,040
because I sat there

695
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,160
because I was sitting there?

696
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,120
I did hear it. I saw it too.

697
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,680
No.

698
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,960
I didn't say that.

699
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,840
We won't say it.

700
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,680
I think we'll know when we look back.

701
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
I just said this.

702
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,560
Now I know.

703
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,600
I can hear you sitting here.

704
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,880
I understand what you mean.

705
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,800
Because you also text me how you feel.

706
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,440
Sometimes you'll

707
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,640
with comfort.

708
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,400
In my eyes,

709
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,160
you're actually...

710
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,120
your feelings for Tae-ri

711
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,520
on friends.

712
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,880
That's what I received.

713
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,720
So I will push Fatty

714
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,600
to send it to you more proactively.

715
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,120
or

716
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,480
push forward your relationship.

717
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,120
It's like this.

718
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,400
I don't want your future development

719
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
will be affected

720
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,200
or my relationship with you.

721
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,080
I made myself clear that

722
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,880
I like Esther very much.

723
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,400
I often say

724
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,280
I don't want

725
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
I don't want anything to affect us.

726
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,200
Me too.

727
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,280
I know you're very nice to me.

728
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,200
I don't want anything

729
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,080
make you unhappy.

730
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,320
Your unhappy day today

731
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
makes me very emotional.

732
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,120
Including yesterday, it's not like you.

733
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,360
Because you have to allow me

734
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,840
to have my own ideas.

735
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,520
I don't want it to be because of me.

736
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,440
Sit together.

737
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,800
Because I'm there, you don't come over.

738
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,800
I don't know if you have that.

739
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,160
But I don't want that to happen.

740
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,320
I don't want you to be unhappy.

741
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,560
I won't. Don't think too much.

742
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,080
This thing...

743
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,800
I said I respect it.

744
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,400
I think we've talked it through.

745
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,200
Actually, you...

746
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,680
I think we just need to talk it out.

747
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,600
Yes, first of all,

748
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,480
You can feel his feelings.

749
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:15,800
Yes.

750
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,960
You got it.

751
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,320
Yes.

752
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,240
What about after you accept it?

753
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,880
You're still getting along with Tae-seo.

754
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,720
Yes.

755
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,680
I won't complain.

756
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
I like someone.

757
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,920
and someone is not interested in me.

758
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,600
I'll avoid you on purpose.

759
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,400
I won't.

760
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,680
Okay, you'd better.

761
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,320
Do you think I'll avoid you and Tae-seo?

762
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,840
No way.

763
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,200
Why are you avoiding me and Tae-seo?

764
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,320
You're avoiding me.

765
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,600
I think you...

766
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,480
We used to be noisy.

767
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:41,880
These days,

768
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,200
You used to be noisy because...

769
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,120
That's just a form of expressing my love.

770
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,720
Okay, I understand.

771
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,320
Actually, on that day yesterday,

772
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,800
I had feelings for you.

773
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,440
That day,

774
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,120
you texted me

775
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,920
Map came to me and told me.

776
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,840
This behavior makes me feel

777
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,880
you care about me.

778
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,040
It's not that you don't care about me.

779
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,280
I think you're in a bad mood.

780
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,960
I said, go over there.

781
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,440
Yes, why did you do this?

782
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,080
Because I think you're in a bad mood.

783
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
So I wanted him to come over.

784
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,800
You're interacting with him again.

785
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,120
and you have to consider my feelings.

786
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,360
You said you would treat me differently.

787
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,320
I think it's better to discriminate.

788
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,880
Because I'm a person who treats me differently.

789
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,840
You asked me if I was biased.

790
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
I'm absolutely biased.

791
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
For example, if the soup is unhappy,

792
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,040
Go and comfort the soup.

793
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,360
or go to the soup directly.

794
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,680
No one will think you're giving him a signal.

795
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,080
Because you two don't like each other.

796
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,440
But Fatty has feelings for you.

797
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
when Fatty likes you,

798
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,760
ask Tu to do this immediately.

799
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,960
This is a misunderstanding.

800
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,680
He's just overthinking.

801
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,480
In the future, if you want to say no, just say no.

802
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,080
Yes, you can refuse me.

803
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,040
Yes, make it clear.

804
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,240
why I have to change myself

805
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,080
because of this?

806
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,840
When I think back now,

807
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,080
I will still let him comfort you.

808
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,400
Why do you think

809
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:45,960
Because

810
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,400
a kind person.

811
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,880
I feel

812
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,000
you're on my side again.

813
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,800
You didn't...

814
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,520
You just said the same thing.

815
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,240
I said in their opinion,

816
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,000
you can refuse them if you want.

817
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,320
But I think you are a nice person.

818
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,520
You need to comfort him.

819
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,440
I gave the wrong signal.

820
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,480
I'm sorry. I can apologize.

821
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,040
But you told me not to do this.

822
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,960
I'm not asking you to apologize.

823
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
No.

824
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,920
I can apologize.

825
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,320
But you have to stop me from doing this.

826
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,960
I can't.

827
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,200
It was when you comforted Tae-seo.

828
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
Why are you explaining to me?

829
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,800
It's okay.

830
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,960
Just ignore me.

831
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,160
I didn't explain to you.

832
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,280
You look unhappy.

833
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,800
I'll ask him to comfort you.

834
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,000
Don't be upset.

835
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,920
Oh no. The contradiction is upgraded again.

836
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,000
Time's up.

837
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,680
To help them

838
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
He becomes the last straw

839
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,840
last straw.

840
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,680
Yes.

841
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,600
I don't think it's a kind of

842
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,360
to comfort him.

843
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,040
Like he said,

844
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,000
a way to release my feelings for him.

845
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,280
Maybe in some small things,

846
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,400
for example, making noodles for him,

847
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,440
or argue with him.

848
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,920
I think in the eyes of boys,

849
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,080
they might think

850
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,480
having feelings for him is mutual.

851
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,680
But it's not

852
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,920
is not

853
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,560
I'm trying to show my interest.

854
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,320
When I came out of the house,

855
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,800
a little unhappy.

856
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,920
She's unhappy because

857
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,440
she wants to get close to Tae-seo.

858
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,200
I thought it could be a relief.

859
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,720
We can be good friends.

860
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
I didn't expect

861
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,560
to end up like this.

862
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
It even affected

863
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,520
her relationship with Xinxin.

864
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,520
I've never seen a relationship like this.

865
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,640
My head is buzzing.

866
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,240
Who is wrong?

867
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,960
What do you think

868
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,680
between Hua and Fatty?

869
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,600
You always talk about things first.

870
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,040
after they talked.

871
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,640
Then I started to talk about my feelings.

872
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,000
They didn't talk.

873
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,280
Yes, I have to defend myself.

874
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,080
Yes, just debate.

875
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,680
Like the ecosystem

876
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,520
We've talked about it.

877
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,480
Then just tell her

878
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,960
I put a flower in it.

879
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,920
It's for you.

880
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,480
Isn't that good?

881
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,920
They didn't say that.

882
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,320
Yes, just.

883
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,360
That's it.

884
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,480
They didn't even say anything.

885
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,840
Maybe they have strong

886
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,520
in their hearts.

887
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,880
Yes, then it's over.

888
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,480
Let's stop talking.

889
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,720
This also says that it's over.

890
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,280
Is it over?

891
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,080
It's still there.

892
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,280
It's not solved at all.

893
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,120
in the way of negotiation.

894
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,560
Yes.

895
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,000
Everyone is circling around.

896
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
All outside. Yes.

897
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,920
And feel

898
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,080
I feel all the conversation

899
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,840
who is wrong.

900
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,280
It seems that both of them said

901
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,240
Hua, you're wrong.

902
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,000
The drawing also said

903
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,400
I think so too.

904
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,600
Yes.

905
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,360
Tu Tu spoke for Xinxin.

906
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,040
she was so emotional.

907
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,240
She must have said

908
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,680
you're my brother.

909
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,200
You won't help me.

910
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,280
Even if I was wrong,

911
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,640
you should take care of my feelings emotionally.

912
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,600
You know how I feel.

913
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,400
you should think about it

914
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,480
from my perspective.

915
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,200
Yes.

916
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,400
Actually, I think Tu

917
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,040
didn't say anything,

918
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,360
but that was right.

919
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,120
If you want to break it, break it clean.

920
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,600
But she didn't.

921
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,160
It's the problem.

922
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,240
She got five points on both sides.

923
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,280
I think

924
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,880
Fatty is more.

925
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,400
That's why she deliberately

926
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,680
to send a message

927
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,240
to let him know this message.

928
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,000
I didn't get to talk.

929
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,920
When both of them got to the point,

930
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,120
his emotions changed him again.

931
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,240
Yes, it's all in your own emotions.

932
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,600
There's also flower.

933
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,240
Okay, I apologize.

934
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,400
She actually got over it.

935
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,960
She's fine. I'm sorry.

936
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
This is also her defense.

937
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,160
She didn't think she was wrong.

938
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,560
Yes.

939
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,840
The problem is, two people say it by head.

940
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,640
You're wrong.

941
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,640
Her brother stepped on it too.

942
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,040
The map must be shocked.

943
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,400
He doesn't know how to get involved in this whirlpool.

944
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,640
Tu said I've never seen such a big scene.

945
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,000
Map wants to go out now

946
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,200
800 pacesetters go to the north slope.

947
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,840
It's easier to go to school.

948
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,000
Boys and girls

949
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
are actually different in nature.

950
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,040
Men tend to fall into

951
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,920
debate effect.

952
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,240
I've been trying to persuade you.

953
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,800
Women tend to fall into the snake-chasing effect.

954
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,920
Pursue snakes?

955
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,120
When you were bitten by a snake,

956
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,400
you didn't treat the wound in time,

957
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,560
but you went after that snake.

958
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,720
For example, if a boy is a little louder,

959
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,560
the girl will... Why are you so loud?

960
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,320
Yes, why are you yelling at me?

961
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,240
Can't you talk to me nicely?

962
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
Do you have to talk to me

963
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,120
to talk to me?

964
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,880
Then it doesn't matter anymore.

965
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,160
It exists when you yell at me.

966
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,480
Yes.

967
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,960
You're back.

968
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,680
You're back.

969
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,160
Let's go upstairs and talk.

970
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,880
Let's go to the wilderness of Guoli.

971
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,800
I don't want to tell you.

972
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Are you angry?

973
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,720
Yes.

974
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,960
My name is Tu.

975
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,200
to help me speak.

976
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,960
But I want to see God

977
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,520
including the back.

978
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,960
He's standing in the same line with them.

979
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,200
I would be angry.

980
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,080
Even if it's all my fault,

981
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,480
I want someone to be on my side.

982
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,240
and speak for me.

983
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,200
But he didn't.

984
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,080
So I was very angry.

985
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,920
You do it.

986
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,640
I don't want to talk.

987
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,800
I need to change my pants now.

988
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,400
Hua is obviously unhappy.

989
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,720
Because she thought that Tu Tu didn't protect her.

990
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,280
Not that.

991
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,440
Not really.

992
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,920
She said I was confused about the ecosystem.

993
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,360
I don't remember either.

994
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,160
I brought the ecosystem in

995
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,320
and put it at the door.

996
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,120
I said I would give it to you right away.

997
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,320
I was joking.

998
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,080
She said...

999
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,040
Tell Xiaoling

1000
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,280
Fatty said it's a gift for you.

1001
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,560
Did I really say that?

1002
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,200
Are you really not going to tell me?

1003
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,840
What?

1004
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,400
Let's talk inside

1005
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,520
What are you doing

1006
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,560
What are you talking about now?

1007
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,160
Do you think I'm not defending you?

1008
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
What do you think?

1009
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,320
I know, but

1010
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,720
from an objective point of view,

1011
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,480
if I were to help you,

1012
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,920
we would have had a big fight.

1013
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,800
So what?

1014
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,960
Actually, you guys...

1015
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,440
Fatty felt that I comforted him that day

1016
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,320
that I went to comfort him that day.

1017
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,600
and a misunderstanding.

1018
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,120
That's why his information is bad.

1019
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,560
his own information shortage?

1020
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,960
Even just now...

1021
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,600
I asked you to comfort them.

1022
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,480
You all think I'm problematic, right?

1023
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,240
You think so too.

1024
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,960
They think

1025
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,080
should be decisive.

1026
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,840
When I talked to you,

1027
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,200
when I talked to you.

1028
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,400
That's why

1029
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,680
to tell you in private.

1030
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,440
Why can't you tell me in person?

1031
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,040
in private?

1032
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,520
No.

1033
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,240
I want to tell you

1034
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,720
in a relationship,

1035
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,920
it's true that

1036
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,720
Don't be too nice to them.

1037
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,120
You are kind in nature.

1038
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,360
You can be kind to anything.

1039
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,960
But for a relationship,

1040
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,000
you are kind and hesitant

1041
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,560
at the same time.

1042
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,720
will hurt both of them.

1043
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,440
I can also think that you're the problem.

1044
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,560
I want you to comfort him.

1045
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,840
You can comfort him as a friend.

1046
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,400
Why did you say I asked you to go?

1047
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,600
I didn't care about that.

1048
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,560
Yes, I don't care about you.

1049
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,280
That's why you think it doesn't matter.

1050
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:33,920
Really?

1051
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,800
Should I

1052
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,600
with him just now?

1053
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,240
Because from the beginning,

1054
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,200
you didn't care about these things.

1055
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,960
You don't think

1056
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,160
I care about this.

1057
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,680
You don't think

1058
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,040
this has affected me.

1059
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,240
Because you can't see my emotions.

1060
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,760
It's nothing.

1061
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,680
He's mad at him.

1062
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,160
You think it's nothing?

1063
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,920
Don't you think I'm sad?

1064
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,320
You think it's nothing?

1065
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,840
From today onwards,

1066
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,760
when I wanted to talk to him,

1067
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,800
you thought it was nothing.

1068
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,040
You didn't try to help me.

1069
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,080
What should I ask?

1070
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,040
Just tell me.

1071
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,360
I did.

1072
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,720
What's your point of view?

1073
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,240
I think you two

1074
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,760
talk to each other.

1075
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,640
We must talk face to face.

1076
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,320
Yes, so you've made it clear?

1077
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,240
Do you think

1078
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,440
I thought you would help me

1079
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
you would help me

1080
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,360
and let everyone untie this.

1081
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,120
I didn't want to go to a romantic house.

1082
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,760
I thought I should talk to Fatty alone.

1083
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,080
I thought I would be more confident with you.

1084
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
I don't want to talk anymore.

1085
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
In fact, from the map's point of view,

1086
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,160
he did nothing wrong.

1087
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,480
He didn't do anything wrong.

1088
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,920
He's an exhauster now.

1089
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Why do you have to

1090
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,320
I told you my feelings for you,

1091
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,400
you have to do something nice.

1092
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,400
In the future, you have to say no to me.

1093
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,560
When I think back now,

1094
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,920
I still let him comfort you.

1095
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,280
Why do you think

1096
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,480
Because she is

1097
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,080
a kind person.

1098
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,720
You're on my side again.

1099
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,560
You didn't.

1100
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,200
You just said it like that.

1101
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,960
I don't know what to say.

1102
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,080
many images flashed in my mind.

1103
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,760
I thought maybe

1104
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,800
some emergencies

1105
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,840
or some

1106
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,320
in the house.

1107
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,200
No matter what happens,

1108
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,240
she can't let us suffer.

1109
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,040
She was protecting us.

1110
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,880
When I think about it,

1111
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,440
I started to blame myself.

1112
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,480
I don't mean to blame you.

1113
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,080
I was wrong.

1114
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,560
I was wrong.

1115
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
I don't mean to blame you.

1116
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,240
I'm not blaming you.

1117
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:57,840
I'm sorry.

1118
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,360
I don't blame you.

1119
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,639
I'm sorry.

1120
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,440
When I saw him crying,

1121
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,400
I thought he was too harsh.

1122
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,080
I feel guilty.

1123
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,239
Because I think Hua should

1124
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,280
express her feelings.

1125
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,639
She was really hurt.

1126
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,600
Yes.

1127
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,360
I don't blame you.

1128
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
I didn't help you just now.

1129
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,159
I don't mean to blame you.

1130
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,280
Stop crying.

1131
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,400
I don't blame you.

1132
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,120
I was thinking

1133
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,080
you usually...

1134
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,560
I don't mean to blame you.

1135
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,400
Don't cry.

1136
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,120
Hurry up.

1137
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,360
Okay.

1138
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
I'm sorry.

1139
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,600
No.

1140
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,040
His cry really breaks my heart.

1141
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,960
I don't blame you.

1142
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,000
I was thinking that

1143
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,280
Every time you're heading towards us,

1144
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,360
no matter what happens,

1145
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,680
I'm angry.

1146
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,040
But I don't blame you.

1147
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,320
I know.

1148
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,960
I'm afraid I'm not capable.

1149
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,720
I didn't speak for you just now.

1150
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,200
What do you mean?

1151
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,400
Are you blaming him

1152
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,680
or blame him?

1153
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,520
All right.

1154
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,960
Okay.

1155
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,160
Stop.

1156
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,760
I'm happy to see you cry.

1157
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,160
I just want you to cry.

1158
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,560
It's okay.

1159
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,240
What do you think we are doing?

1160
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,200
It's okay.

1161
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,880
I didn't mean it.

1162
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,240
I envy them. They get along so well.

1163
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,200
They get along better this way.

1164
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,120
Yes.

1165
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,200
Okay.

1166
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,440
If someone sees us,

1167
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,840
I can't explain.

1168
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,680
All right.

1169
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,120
All right.

1170
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,200
I'm not angry anymore.

1171
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,120
I know you're not angry.

1172
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,040
I blame myself

1173
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
for not helping you.

1174
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,720
No.

1175
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,240
I'm actually fine.

1176
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,360
Look at me. I just wanted you to cry.

1177
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,520
You asked me

1178
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,200
I haven't seen you cry for a long time.

1179
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,840
I didn't see you cry

1180
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,360
I didn't see you crying either.

1181
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,880
All right.

1182
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,000
Why are you more like a brother?

1183
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,040
Don't cry.

1184
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,520
I think

1185
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,120
if I can't do anything,

1186
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,000
I can't help you.

1187
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,760
What else can I do for you?

1188
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,360
What else can I say?

1189
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,600
to get involved in your love experience.

1190
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,760
I can't do anything.

1191
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,560
What else can I do?

1192
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,400
Okay, stop crying.

1193
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,680
Okay.

1194
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm sorry.

1195
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,960
It's okay.

1196
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,640
The map has been trying to set them up.

1197
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:20,960
Yes.

1198
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,240
That's why he feels guilty.

1199
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,680
Yes.

1200
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,560
I found that he was a nuisance.

1201
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,720
Just to love his sister.

1202
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,800
Yes.

1203
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,120
You're crying like a flush.

1204
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,880
I don't know

1205
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,000
why I'm crying like this.

1206
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,680
I just...

1207
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,200
You cried so hard.

1208
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
At first, I really thought

1209
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
it's not a big deal.

1210
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,880
Everyone is interacting with each other.

1211
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,960
I've been silent for so long.

1212
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,000
I was thinking

1213
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,080
no matter what I do,

1214
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,280
you will protect me

1215
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,720
and help us do these things.

1216
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,560
I think

1217
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,480
when I can do something for you,

1218
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,720
even if I can say something for you,

1219
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,440
I can't say it.

1220
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,760
I think I'm useless.

1221
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,160
I knew why I was like this.

1222
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,040
Why was I standing there?

1223
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,400
No, I didn't mean

1224
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,760
I really need to stand

1225
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,080
from that angle?

1226
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,320
It's okay.

1227
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,800
Okay.

1228
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,000
I know.

1229
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,240
I'm happy to see you cry, actually.

1230
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,840
You made me cry on purpose.

1231
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,640
That's right.

1232
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,960
I'm not good if you don't cry today.

1233
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,000
I'll be angry all day.

1234
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400
I'll forgive you before I go to bed.

1235
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,720
Okay.

1236
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,520
Satisfied?

1237
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,280
Yes, I am.

1238
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,640
Go clean up and eat.

1239
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,400
Are you hungry?

1240
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,600
No one cooks anything.

1241
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,840
I'll cook.

1242
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,000
I'll do it every day.

1243
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,760
All right, your hands are cold.

1244
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,520
Are you cold?

1245
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,840
Add some clothes. Let's go.

1246
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,680
I'll cook for you.

1247
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,360
Younger brother is the most important person in your heart.

1248
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,120
It's easy to get a brother

1249
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,720
Enjoy.

1250
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,880
I saw Lu

1251
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,600
when she was crying,

1252
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,320
you were touched.

1253
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,160
Did you resonate with your brother too?

1254
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,280
No.

1255
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,200
There's nothing to apologize for.

1256
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
I feel so sorry for him.

1257
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,760
Have you been intimate

1258
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,880
or your family?

1259
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,400
Have you ever apologized like this?

1260
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,760
I usually bow my head first.

1261
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,040
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

1262
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,840
It's my fault.

1263
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,160
Yes, I did something wrong.

1264
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,400
I think something is wrong here.

1265
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,680
Am I right?

1266
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,600
Sometimes she would think

1267
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,400
I think so.

1268
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,640
Then you two do it like this

1269
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,760
Yes, I'm also like this.

1270
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,520
I'm good at apologizing.

1271
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,320
I think no matter in a close relationship

1272
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,800
or siblings,

1273
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,040
in a relationship?

1274
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,120
Just like praising others.

1275
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,800
and apologise.

1276
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,560
It's not a big deal.

1277
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,280
Yes.

1278
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,960
I know it in my heart. I understand it.

1279
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,640
but I can't say it.

1280
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,480
Sorry, I was wrong.

1281
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,160
I don't know how to say this.

1282
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,680
There's an apology.

1283
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,040
You just learned it?

1284
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,760
Something like this.

1285
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,600
Let others know

1286
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,440
that you mean it.

1287
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,840
I'll think of another way.

1288
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,080
Yeah, I think you didn't say it.

1289
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,760
you can express it with your actions.

1290
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,960
I think my love to my parents

1291
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,400
my parents.

1292
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,840
Every income I received

1293
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,280
I received.

1294
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,360
A very direct way.

1295
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,200
You're actual.

1296
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,120
I'm just a sweet talker.

1297
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,040
Let's comprehend it.

1298
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,080
Comprehensive.
Let's comprehend it.

1299
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,040
Comprehensive.

1300
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,240
This is

1301
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,320
a heartbroken love.

1302
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,920
If I can feel it, it's worth it.

1303
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,040
I'm good at apologizing too.

1304
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,960
Sliding down. Very fast.

1305
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,440
Because I think kneeling is

1306
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,880
a sincere apology.

1307
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,840
Just pretend that you're wrong.

1308
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,000
It's not that serious

1309
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,760
It's not that serious.

1310
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,960
But I learned to apologize

1311
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,840
I learned it from my husband.

1312
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,600
Because he has no face at all.

1313
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,280
If he did something wrong,

1314
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,600
Are you two competing who skates faster?

1315
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,840
You two slipped.

1316
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,720
and bumped into each other.

1317
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
Bow to each other, right?

1318
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,640
You put out the fire first.

1319
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,080
Yes.

1320
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,880
Use this.

1321
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,160
What if both sides are right?

1322
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,320
It's stiff over there.

1323
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,600
How can they be right?

1324
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,680
There must be a lot of things

1325
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,840
have different opinions.

1326
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,520
That's what I think.

1327
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,920
That's what you think.

1328
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,080
I don't think you should

1329
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,720
I don't think you should tell the kids.

1330
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,440
What should we do?

1331
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
We each give in, right?

1332
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,400
Really.

1333
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,440
You can't say I'm sorry because I'm wrong.

1334
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,080
I think...

1335
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,080
He's coming in.

1336
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,440
Come in.

1337
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,600
Okay.

1338
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
What's wrong with the map?

1339
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,680
Why is he crying?

1340
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,360
Who?

1341
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,120
Map.

1342
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,040
Because Xin and I

1343
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,160
and Hua

1344
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,480
had a

1345
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,240
with the four of us.

1346
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,880
The map

1347
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,960
is neutral.

1348
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,560
So just now

1349
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,640
just talked about these.

1350
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,480
I feel so sorry for the drawing.

1351
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,640
I want to see the map.

1352
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,520
Can I come in?

1353
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,440
Yes.

1354
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,160
I'm really fine.

1355
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,320
Did you cry a lot just now?

1356
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,320
Do you know why I wear glasses?

1357
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,040
Do you know

1358
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,320
swollen

1359
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,520
Is it swollen?

1360
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,160
I just...

1361
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,360
I wanted to go in just now.

1362
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,640
but I don't think it's good.

1363
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,440
Close the door.

1364
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,160
Have a seat.

1365
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,920
Is it appropriate?

1366
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,080
Yes, just sit down.

1367
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,520
I'm really fine.

1368
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,920
It's okay. Tell me if you want to.

1369
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,520
It doesn't matter if you don't want to.

1370
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,600
How should I put it?

1371
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
I cried because

1372
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,840
I think

1373
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,880
what happened

1374
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
what happened,

1375
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,400
you didn't take my side immediately.

1376
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,600
Just like that.

1377
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:31,960
Yes.

1378
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,760
So,

1379
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,480
I felt very sad.

1380
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,800
I blamed myself.

1381
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,320
I heard you say you won't scold me, right?

1382
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,800
That's why this happened.

1383
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,680
It's swollen.

1384
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,480
I'm really...

1385
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,600
Xiao Ling is so nice.

1386
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,200
They're really compatible.

1387
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,160
I almost ran out of oxygen.

1388
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,360
I cried so much that I was out of oxygen.

1389
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,680
I need to

1390
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,800
calm down.

1391
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,120
It's okay.

1392
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,840
Then my sister said

1393
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,280
I won't be angry if you cry.

1394
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,720
Was that too embarrassing?

1395
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
I cried a lot.

1396
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,440
Objectively speaking, I'm fine now.

1397
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,600
It's big.

1398
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,120
Really Can you hear it on the first floor

1399
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,000
I don't know. I'm not on the first floor.

1400
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,280
But I think I can hear it on the first floor.

1401
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,760
Did they hear it?

1402
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,240
They are not in the room.

1403
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,040
I was sitting alone in their room

1404
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,120
But there are people downstairs.

1405
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,240
I hope this day will come for you.

1406
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,160
Tom can cry for me.

1407
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,800
I don't want to cry for him.

1408
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,440
Okay, do you want some water?

1409
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,760
No.

1410
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,360
I'll pour you a drink.

1411
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,400
You rejected my kindness.

1412
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,480
Okay.

1413
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,560
You have to come up later.

1414
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,560
Do you want ice?

1415
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,920
No, I'll write slowly.

1416
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,720
Write it. Forget it.

1417
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,520
If you want to write,

1418
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,720
I won't pour you water.

1419
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,840
So just go back.

1420
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,560
It's okay. I'm just writing.

1421
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,920
I was stunned by crying.

1422
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,160
I don't know what to write now.

1423
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,840
Write whatever you want.

1424
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,880
Please.

1425
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,240
I won't get you water.

1426
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,440
Bye.

1427
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,280
After going through the romantic house,

1428
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,080
I'm quite torn.

1429
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,280
After going through a romantic house

1430
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,200
I'm hesitant.

1431
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,120
She's thinking

1432
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,720
whether she should give up Fatty completely.

1433
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,440
Yes.

1434
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,600
In the romantic house,

1435
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,640
Hua has clearly rejected it.

1436
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,120
So I'm thinking who I should write to.

1437
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,000
But Fatty has finished.

1438
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,280
But she didn't say no clearly.

1439
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,760
Yes.

1440
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,640
I can't see it.

1441
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,600
The map.

1442
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,760
The Luo family and Su family

1443
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,520
The map was given to Xiaoling.

1444
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,040
The Su family?

1445
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,600
Where should I put this?

1446
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,120
Tae-seo will give you flowers.

1447
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,640
Yes, I don't think he'll leave for a while.

1448
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,960
Personally,

1449
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,800
I'm not good at talking.

1450
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,680
So I think I can write

1451
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,480
I can write it.

1452
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,440
to tell Hua

1453
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,160
you are a great girl.

1454
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,000
and positive.

1455
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,880
There are many things I need to learn.

1456
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,840
I drew that flower when I was writing the draft.

1457
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,400
But it was too ugly.

1458
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,360
Then I thought

1459
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,920
I could just fold a handmade flower.

1460
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,880
I watched a lot of teaching lessons.

1461
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,160
and kept folding.

1462
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,320
I really learned it.

1463
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:53,960
I didn't learn how to use my hand.

1464
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,440
Think about it later. Forget it.

1465
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,400
Failed.

1466
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,600
A little clumsy and cute.

1467
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,960
Fatty, who are you giving it to?

1468
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,960
He must have changed.

1469
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,360
He is...

1470
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,920
Our program

1471
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,120
will follow the content of the show

1472
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,080
according to the content of the program.

1473
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,800
What we're going to speculate in this episode is

1474
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,400
the love letter of Hua and Fatty.

1475
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,880
Who did they give to?

1476
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,200
This time, for individual battle,

1477
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,360
The person who gets the right answer will get

1478
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,400
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

1479
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,560
In the last episode,

1480
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,880
the most guests

1481
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,800
the most guests

1482
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,960
will receive

1483
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,400
by Yuwo Liqiang.

1484
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,680
Next, let's

1485
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,520
of "Love and Sisters"

1486
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,280
of Love Sisters.

1487
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,800
So hard.

1488
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,360
Fatty is so hard.

1489
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,240
Will he give it to Tata?

1490
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,640
Yes, he has made it clear.

1491
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,120
He won't give flowers.

1492
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,000
Let’s see what we can do.

1493
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,920
Lynchon completely dismantled them.

1494
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,920
Do you think it's over?

1495
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,600
Actually, I wanted to write about Xiaoling just now.

1496
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,400
Yes, because his first date was Xiaoling.

1497
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,440
Fatty said he wouldn't give flowers.

1498
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,680
So I thought if he didn't,

1499
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,040
who would he give it to?

1500
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,320
He might give it to Xiao Ling.

1501
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:27,880
But...

1502
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,520
if Fatty doesn't give flowers this time,

1503
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,840
they will really break up.

1504
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,600
I think

1505
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,240
I also think they will fight for it.

1506
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,960
It's just love voting.

1507
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,000
We're going to have some wild wine.

1508
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,080
I feel there will be

1509
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,160
It's time to unveil the truth.

1510
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,280
No.

1511
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,560
It's really Xiaoling.

1512
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,600
There's no love line.

1513
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,120
I wrote it to

1514
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,800
a close male friend.

1515
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,840
Because I think writing to her

1516
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,640
to write to her.

1517
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,680
Who is it?

1518
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,880
Fatty.

1519
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,960
Really?

1520
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,880
Fatty.

1521
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,600
Fatty.

1522
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,520
Hua, you are so brave.

1523
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,640
Fatty, you deserve it.

1524
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,880
You deserve it.

1525
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,760
You're such a disappointment.

1526
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,480
This is really disappointing.

1527
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,560
So cool.

1528
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,160
He's so strong and calm.

1529
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,320
He's not stable.

1530
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,240
When it's time for him to rush, he should step back.

1531
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,320
When it's time, he dashes.

1532
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,360
This is the time.

1533
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,320
It's time.

1534
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,160
Really

1535
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,200
We're not meant to be.

1536
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:34,920
Forget it.

1537
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,560
I think Hua is really brave.

1538
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,880
Yes.

1539
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,480
She can choose him again.

1540
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,600
Yes.

1541
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,800
So brave.

1542
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,680
Let's see if there's anything right.

1543
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,000
Raise your hand if you get one right.

1544
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,240
Zi Ning.

1545
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,600
Lord.

1546
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,400
Dan.

1547
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,240
Mr. Lynne.

1548
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,480
You didn’t get one right.

1549
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,640
Congratulations.

1550
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,680
for winning a Wild Crest of Guoli.

1551
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,480
Because we didn't

1552
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,400
discuss

1553
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,560
whether we still have feelings

1554
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,200
Can we continue?

1555
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,240
Because they are explaining

1556
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,720
why I did it.

1557
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,240
I want to use this date

1558
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,360
whether we can continue

1559
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,360
talk about us

1560
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,800
or choose to be friends,

1561
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,800
I hope

1562
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,400
to have a one-on-one chat with him.

1563
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,200
That's why I wrote this letter to him.

1564
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,360
I'm curious.

1565
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,320
what the first reaction of being fat is.

1566
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:32,960
Yes.

1567
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,040
It seems that we still don't give up.

1568
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,880
We really won't give up.

1569
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,680
Looks like we still won't give up.

1570
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,320
Are you nervous?

1571
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,560
A little.

1572
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,720
How many letters do you think you've received?

1573
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,040
One.

1574
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,840
How many letters do you think I received?

1575
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,880
Ten letters?

1576
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,600
That's too much.

1577
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,320
Three.

1578
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,440
Let's see if it's yours.

1579
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,240
or whose.

1580
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,760
Maybe all three are for you.

1581
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,320
Yours.

1582
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,320
Here you go.

1583
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,760
You're quite polite.

1584
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,920
Let me see who this is for.

1585
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,480
It's for me.

1586
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,600
So popular.

1587
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,560
Here.

1588
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,280
I opened the envelope

1589
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,520
and saw it folded like a fan.

1590
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,600
I said Fatty.

1591
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,360
I'm actually quite surprised.

1592
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,000
Because I didn't expect Fatty would write to me.

1593
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,280
He really praised me.

1594
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,600
I don't know what to say.

1595
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,160
He said my beauty is my biggest strength.

1596
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,000
When I read this, I...

1597
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,720
You look silly.

1598
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,360
I didn't expect you to be so delicate.

1599
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,080
I'm so touched that I'm going to cry.

1600
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,760
You're going to cry.

1601
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,480
Okay.

1602
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,040
The soup is so happy.

1603
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,280
I'm very happy

1604
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,280
I'm very happy.

1605
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,560
telling me in the letter

1606
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,120
All the present

1607
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,720
The ordinary day after day

1608
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,160
One day

1609
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,320
I'll make you understand the meaning of persistence.

1610
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,160
hoping that

1611
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,000
to stick to what I love.

1612
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,320
In the end, she said

1613
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,080
she invited me to experience

1614
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,080
The cold winter in Beijing is full of love.

1615
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,840
I feel very happy and happy.

1616
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,000
When I read this,

1617
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,600
In fact,

1618
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,840
who wrote that letter.

1619
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,200
Because he mentioned him crying.

1620
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,240
My first feeling was

1621
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,880
I think he trusts me.

1622
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,640
Because in the letter,

1623
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,920
he said I comforted him when he cried.

1624
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,400
Other than his sister,

1625
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,120
who noticed his emotions.

1626
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,440
He also thinks I comforted him.

1627
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,760
Because I said before

1628
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,360
I want to be a soup

1629
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,760
a strong tree hole.

1630
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,680
So I think

1631
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,920
this time I became a tree hole in the picture.

1632
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,080
And I think

1633
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,960
closer to him.

1634
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,760
Let me see yours.

1635
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,320
No.

1636
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,720
Let's analyze who wrote it.

1637
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,040
Okay.

1638
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,120
I'll check yours first.

1639
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:40,760
before you look at mine.

1640
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,720
Look at this first.

1641
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,400
So...

1642
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,440
Just read it.

1643
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,720
Let me make it clear.

1644
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,440
I seldom cry.

1645
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,440
In the letter,

1646
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,040
he didn't want anyone to see him cry.

1647
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,760
But when you comfort him,

1648
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,800
he was happy.

1649
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,280
I didn't see him cry.

1650
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,680
I went after he cried.

1651
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,800
How did you comfort him?

1652
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,440
I asked him

1653
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,520
if you have something to tell me,

1654
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,120
You can tell me.

1655
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,440
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

1656
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,800
When will you comfort me?

1657
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,200
You never cry here.

1658
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,120
Cry and let me see.

1659
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,880
I'll comfort you.

1660
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,800
I'll punch you.

1661
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,520
The soup has been relaxed

1662
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,600
I became relaxed.

1663
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,280
You've changed a lot.

1664
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,000
Yes.

1665
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,440
There's a saying in the Book of Green Leather.

1666
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,320
There are many people in the world.

1667
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,160
We happened to be friends.

1668
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,320
So beauty is your weakness.

1669
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,600
Okay.

1670
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,200
Stop it.

1671
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,680
I'll be embarrassed.

1672
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,880
You received two letters

1673
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,280
It's also a kind of recognition for your excellence.

1674
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,960
The picture is full of

1675
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,600
more about his feelings.

1676
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,360
Actually, he didn't write it on you.

1677
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,600
Fatty is full of sisters.

1678
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,560
I still think she is happy.

1679
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,720
The most important thing is she chose what she likes.

1680
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,480
Beauty is only your weak point.

1681
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,440
Okay, I want to see yours.

1682
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,680
Okay, that's it.

1683
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,200
No.

1684
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,400
Hurry up.

1685
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,880
Have a look.

1686
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:20,960
Come on.

1687
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,080
Don't even think about the letter.

1688
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,680
It's from Susu.

1689
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,840
She also mentioned in the letter that

1690
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,800
at the beginning,

1691
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,400
I found the topic dry.

1692
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,880
But when we didn't talk,

1693
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,960
when I didn't talk.

1694
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,440
So I think

1695
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,520
this is a good sign.

1696
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,240
Please keep it up.

1697
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,240
I think both of them are more cheerful.

1698
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,720
Yes, much brighter.

1699
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,720
Great.

1700
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,360
Let's take a photo.

1701
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,560
Okay.

1702
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,040
I didn't expect

1703
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,240
I could receive two letters.

1704
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,000
Charism.

1705
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,880
You're popular.

1706
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,800
She's quite charming.

1707
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,200
Climb along the stick.

1708
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,200
Place it from above.

1709
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,120
You first.

1710
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,000
Don't be so nervous.

1711
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,000
One.

1712
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,440
Two. Come on.

1713
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,200
I saw it clearly.

1714
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,480
I'll put it in slowly.

1715
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:24,800
Thank you.

1716
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,920
Although love is full of twists and turns,

1717
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,360
the relationship between brothers is getting deeper.

1718
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,000
Yes.

1719
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,400
What are you doing?

1720
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,400
Get up.

1721
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,080
I'll pull you up.

1722
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,720
Pull me up.

1723
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,000
Pull harder.

1724
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,880
I'm impressed.

1725
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:43,680
Let's go.

1726
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,280
We can't demolish it like this.

1727
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,880
Isn't there a squat here?

1728
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,440
Excuse me.

1729
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,760
Take that.

1730
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,800
Are you a normal person?

1731
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,680
I'm in a hurry.

1732
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,280
This is too hasty.

1733
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,360
Look, it's all broken.

1734
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,520
It's not broken.

1735
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,320
It's the same.

1736
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,280
Look at them. They are fine.

1737
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,480
It's broken.

1738
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,160
He flipped the roof.

1739
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,040
What a coincidence

1740
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,040
It's soup

1741
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,200
How did you know?

1742
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,720
I saw it writing "Dear Harry".

1743
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,240
Let's take a photo first.

1744
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,840
Why don't you take a photo after you're done?

1745
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,400
Okay.

1746
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,320
Okay. Let's go. Okay. Okay.

1747
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,480
I'm touched.

1748
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,200
It's an interpretation from beginning to end.

1749
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,000
From the first day

1750
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,080
to our last day.

1751
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,560
The day before yesterday.

1752
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,480
And she took the initiative

1753
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,720
what she did yesterday.

1754
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,320
I think it's a change of acknowledgment.

1755
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,920
she still cares about me and cares about me.

1756
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,360
So I'm really touched.

1757
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,760
My eyes are wet

1758
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,200
You've put your heart into it.

1759
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,200
In this letter,

1760
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,760
I can see his growth.

1761
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,880
And in the letter,

1762
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,760
in the letter.

1763
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,480
I talked to him about his behavior.

1764
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,240
he would think about what he did wrong.

1765
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,280
He might be improving.

1766
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,160
Nightingale doesn't need to understand complicated people's hearts.

1767
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,880
She will praise every spring with flowers.

1768
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,280
So romantic.

1769
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,320
Really handwritten letters are so romantic

1770
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,640
I'm done. I'll take a picture too.

1771
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,360
Why are you crying

1772
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,400
This is sister.

1773
00:58:59,080 --> 00:58:59,600
Who knows?

1774
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,680
I've never received a handwritten letter in my life.

1775
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,760
Neither have I.

1776
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:04,960
So sincere.

1777
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,680
Can I take this?

1778
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,200
I don't know.

1779
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,880
I'll see if they've taken it.

1780
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,600
I knew it.

1781
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,920
if I would take it with me.

1782
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,280
Open from the back. There's a small door behind.

1783
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,440
Oh no.

1784
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,720
Why are there three letters?

1785
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,840
She found that they received three letters of soup.

1786
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,840
Oh no.

1787
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,400
Did you know about the soup?

1788
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,640
I got two texts yesterday.

1789
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:25,800
I don't know.

1790
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,480
He asked me which one was written by you.

1791
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,120
Then I said, "There must be one of them."

1792
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,640
You're always the one who wrote the script.

1793
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,880
He can't tell which one I wrote.

1794
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,680
That's too much.

1795
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,000
Who sent the other one?

1796
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,760
Did Xin send it?

1797
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,680
I feel...

1798
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,640
I think so too.

1799
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,000
Can I see yours?

1800
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,120
No.

1801
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,120
I like to see them together.

1802
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,040
when they are together.

1803
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,040
Can I see yours?

1804
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,040
Let me see it.

1805
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,720
I can show you.

1806
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,720
Mine is okay.

1807
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,640
Forget it. I don't want to show it to you.

1808
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,920
I don't want to see your present.

1809
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,240
Are you going to put it back?

1810
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,200
What else?

1811
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,120
Let's go.

1812
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,400
He wrote a Chinese and an English article.

1813
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,320
He thinks both of us are a little stubborn

1814
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,520
and sensitive.

1815
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,480
Maybe he thinks I'm too passive

1816
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,240
he'll be passive too.

1817
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,200
It's not good for both of us to solve the problem together.

1818
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,240
So he probably

1819
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,840
to see me being passive.

1820
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:57,480
he still talked to me.

1821
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,040
People from our generation write letters.

1822
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:01,560
Yes.

1823
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,280
Yes, but they don't have it now.

1824
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,120
Yes.

1825
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,320
Is there no letter?

1826
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,320
It'll be awkward if there's no letter.

1827
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,880
There are two letters every day, but you haven't.

1828
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,640
Not today.

1829
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,640
The Wang family.

1830
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,960
I dare not look at it.

1831
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,640
This is ours.

1832
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,880
Three letters.

1833
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,560
You have two.

1834
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,920
No way. Sit here.

1835
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,240
Three letters.

1836
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,000
It's full.

1837
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,720
I know who wrote it.

1838
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,160
Terri gave it to me.

1839
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,560
In fact, he didn't

1840
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,800
he didn't express his feelings.

1841
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,240
But one sentence impressed me a lot.

1842
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:27,880
He said

1843
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,280
he was nervous and nervous

1844
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,760
I was nervous and rushing.

1845
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,760
I didn't expect this.

1846
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,720
I thought

1847
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,520
he would be happy and happy.

1848
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,840
Let's read this letter carefully and read it slowly.

1849
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,000
Xiaoling's letter touched me a lot.

1850
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,560
She wrote that when she was watching

1851
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,840
in the video,

1852
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,040
others may feel sorry for us.

1853
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,480
and feel sorry for us.

1854
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,640
But she wrote

1855
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,280
In her heart,

1856
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,920
she thinks we are

1857
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,640
are so lively and cheerful.

1858
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,680
She admires and respects us.

1859
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,240
It seems that since young,

1860
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,880
since I was a kid.

1861
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,640
said this to us.

1862
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,320
It's well written.

1863
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,360
I can tell who wrote this.

1864
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,640
It's so well written.

1865
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,080
They can tell who wrote it.

1866
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,000
They have good chemistry.

1867
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,280
Me too.

1868
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,400
Look at the next letter.

1869
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,400
Xinxin wrote to me mainly to comfort me.

1870
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,840
After the romantic house,

1871
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,760
she thought she might have

1872
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,120
a bit harsh today.

1873
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,600
And she wrote in the letter

1874
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,320
She said she saw

1875
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,040
how to get along

1876
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,720
with her siblings.

1877
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,840
She thinks I'm a role model for her.

1878
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,800
and communicate with me more.

1879
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,920
So does Xinxin.

1880
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,600
Do you know how I feel now?

1881
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,240
I feel

1882
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,800
full of warmth.

1883
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,640
I think Tae-seo wrote mine.

1884
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,560
He took pictures of me all day.

1885
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,160
I thought we would get along well.

1886
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,440
but it was a bit hasty.

1887
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,800
Is he a little awkward?

1888
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,920
I'll take a photo.

1889
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,080
I'll review it for him later.

1890
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,480
But when I cried just now,

1891
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,280
when I cried?

1892
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:22,880
I want to laugh.

1893
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,520
I cried like that.

1894
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,480
So what?

1895
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,760
I've never seen you cry.

1896
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,240
Indeed.

1897
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,480
So you know how much you mean to me?

1898
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,600
how important you are to me?

1899
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,840
The same weight as yours.

1900
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,680
I'm speechless.

1901
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,560
Then I won't lose weight.

1902
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,680
Then don't eat tonight.

1903
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,600
Fine.

1904
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,520
Let's go.

1905
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:50,840
Let's go.

1906
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,600
Yuan family?

1907
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,400
I don't think so.

1908
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,200
Okay, no.

1909
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,880
After I moved in,

1910
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,320
Hua has been choosing me.

1911
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,920
I think

1912
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,000
only Hua Hua would write to me.

1913
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,640
But I didn't receive it.

1914
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,000
I'm a little disappointed.

1915
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,040
Tae-seo must be heartbroken.

1916
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,280
He cries when he goes out.

1917
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,720
This is ours.

1918
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,760
Coming.

1919
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,200
Fatty.

1920
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,440
Look.

1921
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,560
Who will write for us?

1922
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,160
Can one person write a lot?

1923
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:51,480
Sit down.

1924
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,280
What do you want to drink, Yinbo?

1925
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,160
Let me help you.

1926
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,560
Let me help you, Yinbo.

1927
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,960
What are you doing?

1928
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,080
Yinbo.

1929
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:06,560
This...

1930
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,720
What else do you want to eat?

1931
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,600
Good night, Yinbo.

1932
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,560
Whether I go or not is in my hands.

1933
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,320
I want to go on a date.

1934
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,200
Okay, you try.

1935
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,240
I'll try too.

1936
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,320
to see who will get it.

1937
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,200
Next, let me share

1938
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,560
the story of siblings on Weibo.

1939
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,880
The netizens

1940
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,880

1941
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,680
are very normal.

1942
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,360
We have a suggestion for you.

1943
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,400
Her love experience

1944
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,840
belongs to her.

1945
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,880
So in the process,

they are in a very good mood.

1949
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,960
