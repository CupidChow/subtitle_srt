1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,560
Thinking affair and physical affair

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,760
Which one do you think is more unacceptable?

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,000
Physical affair.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,800
I have mysophobia.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,920
Isn't that supposed to be thinking?

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,400
What do you think is the most charming?

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,120
I think it's company and support for me.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,800
Apply hand cream. No.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,400
Thank you.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,800
It's enough.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,360
Enough

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,120
Thank you.

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,360
I didn't eat the sandwich you gave me.

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,600
Someone ate it.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,960
Who ate it?

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:32,920
I don't know.

17
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,960
I don't know. I don't know either.

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,200
Can you do it for me again?

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,320
What are you doing?

20
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,240
Are you frying eggs?

21
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,680
Yes.

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,960
Fried an egg for three people.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,200
Love Siblings.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
Let love double.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,320
(Welcome to "Love Siblings")

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,200
"Love Sisters".

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,640
We're lovers.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,880
We are going to

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,640
the update of this episode.

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,440
Let's play.

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,240
Come on.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,360
Here, this card.

33
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,280
Come on. Three, two, one, start.

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,320
The first one is bigger.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,160
Okay.

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,360
Okay. Here.

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,240
Wait.

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,039
I won't give you time to think.

39
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,840
Three, two, ten.

40
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,479
I just want to win this round, right?

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,280
One for you.

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Ten thirty. Three, two, one.

43
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,440
10:30.

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,920
Is it awesome?

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,640
You'll know soon.

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,200
The last one.

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,880
Let's do it together.

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,520
Three seven.

49
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
We won.

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,080
Choose one from Truth or Dare.

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,440
Truth.

52
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:12,920
What about you?

53
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,120
I can also choose Truth.

54
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,520
Okay.

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,200
Why do you think we broke up?

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,200
There's a new guy.

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
You're the new one. He's the new one.

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,560
Not me.

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
What do you think is the most charming?

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
I think it's company and support for me.

61
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,079
I want to complain.

62
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,240
But I couldn't say it out loud.

63
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,079
Tell me.

64
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,480
to find a mom and dad?

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,680
I won't talk to him.

66
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,280
I won't talk to him.

67
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,040
I'm not playing with you.

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,560
Dating normally

69
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
We need company and support anyway.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,880
How should we talk?

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,480
But this is the most important.

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,320
She's quite special, because...

73
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
How special, bro?

74
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,800
It's over.

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,160
I guess we should...

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Yes, we're right.

77
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
In the end,

78
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,040
when you went to the three garden yesterday,

79
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,680
I knew it.

80
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,280
Right?

81
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,840
I don't understand.

82
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,320
Come on.

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
Do you think you fall in love at first sight

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
or love that grows over time?

85
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,360
I think I have them all.

86
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,920
Both.

87
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,320
Which one do you prefer?

88
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,920
It's more like love that grows over time.

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,880
Love grows over time.

90
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,520
Why?

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
I value personality more.

92
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,440
But I think love at first sight

93
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,760
It belongs to someone

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,480
Someone who grows on his own point.

95
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,200
must have a feeling of heartbeat.

96
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,120
But in the future,

97
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,160
you think you'll only have a moment of heartbeat,

98
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,120
But if you don't think it's suitable,

99
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,440
I don't think I'll continue.

100
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,600
Will you choose to like you more

101
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,520
or the one you like more?

102
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,280
If a girl

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,079
really likes me,

104
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,920
or like me,

105
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,240
and make me feel sincere,

106
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,920
I'll be with her.

107
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,360
Yes.

108
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,120
So if a girl

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
really pursues me,

110
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,200
she can change my mind.

111
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,120
I will be with her.

112
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,160
Got it.

113
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,680
That's a deep question.

114
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,320
Is it possible to answer in depth?

115
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,960
Not deep.

116
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,760
How tall are you?

117
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,280
176 cm.

118
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,880
How tall are you?

119
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm 177 cm.

120
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,520
How tall are you?

121
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,440
178 cm.

122
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,840
I always think so.

123
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,800
But if you say you're 176 cm,

124
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,640
I don't think

125
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,840
we're almost the same.

126
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Yes.

127
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,720
Come on.

128
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,240
The three of us stand in line.

129
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,600
The three of us

130
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,040
Yeah.

131
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,640
Understand? It's the mountain.

132
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,440
Fair.

133
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,360
So awkward.

134
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,000
So you like animals.

135
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,560
Me too. I love animals.

136
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,400
Why do you keep snakes?

137
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,159
Lizard guard the palace

138
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,200
Because I think

139
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,120
I have many cats and dogs.

140
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,600
I also bought pigs.

141
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,120
Then I bought a hamster and a golden bear.

142
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,560
I wanted something special.

143
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,640
I thought about that day.

144
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,520
Snake.

145
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,480
Yes.

146
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,159
I talked a lot with Harry today.

147
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,320
about animals.

148
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,120
Because I found someone like me

149
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,040
like snakes and lizards.

150
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,440
That's it

151
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,280
that are unusual.

152
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
So I think

153
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
I can relate to him

154
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,640
in many things.

155
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,840
So I want to have more contact with him.

156
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,920
We really need an intervention.

157
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,480
I brought some.

158
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,960
Awesome.

159
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,840
I can't get in.

160
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,280
Is it broken?

161
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,520
The battery is dead, right?

162
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,000
I think we can insert it in.

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,240
Let me ask the map.

164
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,880
Map?

165
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,920
The one we put in the microwave yesterday

166
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,960
Can't you insert it in?

167
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,760
It's stuck

168
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,320
No.

169
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,720
Why can't I get in?

170
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
It's the same

171
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,880
Why can't it get in?

172
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Let me see.

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,120
Do you have an arrangement?

174
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,680
I brought one.

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
But it can't fit in here.

176
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,960
I can.

177
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,360
I can't.

178
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I'll plug the flower in. What should I do?

179
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,200
I promise you one thing.

180
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,640
Okay.

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,560
None of us can get in.

182
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,520
Hua owes me a request.

183
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,160
I didn’t.

184
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,120
No.

185
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,200
You didn't.

186
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,360
I did.

187
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,000
No.

188
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,120
Let me show you.

189
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,360
I have to hit it in one stroke.

190
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,600
I believe I can do it.

191
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,840
It's lit.

192
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Awesome.

193
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,960
It's dark again.

194
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,000
It's okay. I'll do it.

195
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
There's a plug here.

196
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,360
Here.

197
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,800
Here.

198
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Then forget it.

199
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,040
You didn't turn on the phone.

200
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,360
It's on. It's on.

201
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,200
No electricity.

202
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,760
Okay.

203
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,920
We were just having a heart-to-heart talk.

204
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,400
He even criticized me.

205
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,640
Who was complained by you?

206
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,280
You're mocking me.

207
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,360
What did I say?

208
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,080
I said the most important thing is company and support.

209
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,680
When you find your parents,

210
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,760
the most important thing is to have the same frequency.

211
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,840
Same frequency.

212
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,160
We appreciate each other.

213
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,680
Yes.

214
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,800
I think accompanying those friends can also be given

215
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,280
Besties can also be given.

216
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,800
Right.

217
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,360
The problem is if you

218
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,120
do this with the other person,

219
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
It can have a long aftermath.

220
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,240
It's too deep.

221
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,840
There are some feelings

222
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,120
you always have something in your heart.

223
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,440
That's the joke.

224
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,720
Even though you may not be together,

225
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,400
you still insist.

226
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,400
But some people don't know

227
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,200
I don't know how to put it.

228
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,040
Just like many people have childhood friends

229
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,080
and childhood friends of different genders.

230
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
Although he has been

231
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
he might not like him.

232
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,880
Yes, that's companionship.

233
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,400
But it doesn't mean love will happen.

234
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,720
Yes.

235
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,760
What's wrong?

236
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,040
No, we just finished talking.

237
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,000
Bigger.

238
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,440
Three. Three.

239
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,520
Three.

240
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,960
Three.

241
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,960
Do I use 10 to win?

242
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,200
Yes.

243
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,160
10:30.

244
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,080
10:30. Me too.

245
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,120
729.

246
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,200
Ten.

247
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,960
One for each of us.

248
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,720
Two points for me.

249
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,600
Last round.

250
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,159
Three, two, one. Two, three.

251
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,480
Why are you...

252
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,960
Why are there so many right ones?

253
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,640
No.

254
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,080
Two laps. I win.

255
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,559
Let me think. I got two points and you got one point.

256
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,720
Then ask the three of us.

257
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,600
It feels so good tonight.

258
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,720
Come on.

259
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,000
Tell me what you hate.

260
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
What do you hate?

261
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,920
I hate boys talking about gossip.

262
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
I like crickets with others.

263
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,400
But I don't like the kind of pretentious.

264
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,400
I think

265
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
I don't like dishonest girls.

266
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,720
Thinking affair and physical affair.

267
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,200
Which one do you think is more unacceptable?

268
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,920
Physical affair.

269
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
I have mysophobia.

270
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,600
Isn't that supposed to be thoughts?

271
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,280
No.

272
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,960
My mysophobia

273
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,760
is the body's mental mysophobia.

274
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,280
That's OK.

275
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,960
Because I don't think

276
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,160
it doesn't mean you'll keep cheating.

277
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,320
But physical affair

278
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,280
Phhystic Well,

279
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,720
I did this.

280
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,760
I can't accept it.

281
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,280
I don't think so.

282
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,600
Why?

283
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,080
Your thoughts

284
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,800
It's not that it's not established. It's just that

285
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,280
I may not understand.

286
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,800
Anyway, cheating is not allowed.

287
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
In fact, cheating is definitely not allowed.

288
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,520
There's room to hold him back.

289
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,880
But physical cheating is a fact.

290
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,160
This cannot be changed.

291
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,920
I can't accept it.

292
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,680
But if I can choose,

293
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,920
I won't choose either of them.

294
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,240
Of course.

295
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
Don't see anyone else.

296
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,600
I haven't asked yet.

297
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,200
Why did you remind her?

298
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,360
Yes, it's the same if you ask her.

299
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,200
Let me ask you this.

300
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
What kind of way do you like to get along?

301
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,760
I don't like being together every day.

302
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,520
I like being independent.

303
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,600
She said both of us

304
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
each other's private space.

305
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,960
I agree with that.

306
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,400
I can't accept foreign countries.

307
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,720
I don't think foreign countries are good either.

308
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,480
It depends on how far it is.

309
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,840
Let's see if they're busy with their work.

310
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,080
Yes.

311
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,120
I can bring my boyfriend there.

312
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,680
What's there to "wow"?

313
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,320
I want to know.

314
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,640
I'll say "wow".

315
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,240
Who's going?

316
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,880
Me.

317
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,440
What?

318
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,800
It's a long page. I saw it.

319
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,840
A letter of introduction.

320
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,760
to let people know you better.

321
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,360
Next day, please record

322
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,480
in the form of diary.

323
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,520
When you fall in love,

324
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,320
you should cherish

325
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,360
this wonderful journey.

326
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,600
I'm amazing.

327
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,240
You can't go out from today.

328
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,040
We won't be able to eat.

329
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,760
I'll call and say I'm going out.

330
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
Let's play Truth or Dare.

331
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,920
He said he likes you.

332
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,400
Then I asked why

333
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,800
that you're very weird when playing games.

334
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,280
That's great.

335
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,640
You even asked me why.

336
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,680
Of course.

337
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,960
It's best to meet the game.

338
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,160
Two.

339
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,880
Esther has big eyes.

340
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,680
Smile is warm and bright.

341
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,040
It always brings joy to our family.

342
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,040
It's the brightest star in the house.

343
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
I'll go get the sauce

344
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,200
It's spilled.

345
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,800
Take a photo of the fish.

346
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,280
Two, what's your name?

347
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,480
Your name is Xinxin.

348
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,840
No, what's your name?

349
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,040
What's his name?

350
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,200
You Harry.

351
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,560
If you write a lot or write,

352
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
you will see me

353
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,080
you will see me

354
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,760
in the room.

355
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,560
In fact, in the small house,

356
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,440
our members

357
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,320
have released their own life album.

358
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
For us to know each other,

359
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,360
So we also prepared

360
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,960
our own life albums.

361
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,840
Let's share

362
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,520
OK?

363
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,520
This

364
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,080
should be a photo of a hundred days.

365
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,680
This is on a small car

366
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,400
made by my grandpa.

367
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,680
This was for my brother

368
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,520
After I was born,

369
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,240
I put it here.

370
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,320
This is the first time

371
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
This is the photo of

372
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,320
the first time in my life.

373
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,640
I graduated from high school.

374
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
I don't know why, but I just want to

375
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,600
some abnormal photos.

376
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,160
This is the photo I took

377
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,120
when I graduated.

378
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
I have long hair

379
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,600
Long hair.

380
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,480
This is me.

381
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,400
This is my first time on stage.

382
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,760
a talk show.

383
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,080
When I weighed about 120 kg,

384
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,760
you lost a lot of weight.

385
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,200
This is the photo I took

386
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,720
during the final.

387
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,800
This is mine.

388
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,520
The last special of "Daughter's Red".

389
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,200
This is marriage.

390
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,360
Let's see if there's a letter for your siblings.

391
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,080
No.

392
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,760
My photo is easier.

393
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,960
So pretty.

394
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,720
I think I got this

395
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,880
I took one

396
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Story King Competition.

397
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,400
My head teacher rewarded me to take a photo.

398
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,120
This is my university.

399
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,760
When I first entered the school,

400
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,920
So sunny.

401
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,880
Actually, when I entered school,

402
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,280
I was like a bumpkin.

403
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,120
I really look like a bumpkin.

404
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,440
Comm. Arts Academy thinks

405
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,440
IYI is quite confident.

406
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,920
I found that you are IYI when you go to college.

407
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,000
Not to mention those from Comm. Arts.

408
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,720
the major of broadcasting.

409
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,080
You know what?

410
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,400
Yes.

411
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,880
All beautiful girls.

412
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,160
Yes.

413
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,320
And they dress up.

414
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,600
I'm like a little duck YI

415
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,760
Really, my world has completely changed.

416
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,520
I can't do anything.

417
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,400
This is my second pregnancy.

418
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,400
in front of my hometown.

419
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,080
in front of my hometown.

420
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,800
Yes.

421
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,440
It's a baby and a second child.

422
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,160
I went to take this photo

423
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,040
This is the first time

424
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,160
after giving birth.

425
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,520
This is a documentary of my life.

426
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,440
It's Dancheng.

427
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,840
I went to see the world

428
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,200
and experienced many different occupations.

429
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
This is my second child.

430
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,600
My daughter came to see me.

431
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Happy.

432
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,200
This is

433
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,680
a photo of me and my mom.

434
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
This is a graduation photo.

435
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,200
The graduation photos of kindergarten.

436
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,280
My two babies.

437
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,560
are very happy.

438
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,360
I think my life

439
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,440
my life.

440
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,040
My mom died of cancer.

441
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
Of course she was very sad that she left me.

442
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,080
But she taught me to face life

443
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,920
to face life.

444
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,680
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

445
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,080
Because you've experienced

446
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,320
what I fear the most.

447
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,960
So I think the power she gave me

448
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,640
is infinite.

449
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,560
Then I got to have this family.

450
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,640
I cherish it.

451
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,680
Yes, just like I said,

452
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,160
Let's not wait until we lose

453
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,040
until we lose it.

454
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,160
Yes, so

455
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,640
my mom taught me that.

456
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,840
So you cherish every day

457
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,760
and cherish every day.

458
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,120
You will find that

459
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,480
you'll be more and more lucky.

460
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,360
You'll be happier.

461
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,880
Yes.

462
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,640
So I'm grateful.

463
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,120
It's nice.

464
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,080
I’m playing the speaker for others.

465
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,960
I majored in music performance

466
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,240
in Xinjiang Art Academy.

467
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,079
When I was a freshman,

468
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,480
I stopped asking my family for money.

469
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,359
Then I went to

470
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,760
at the bar.

471
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
and go to Live House. Music scene

472
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,839
as a stage assistant.

473
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,760
I'm a sophomore now.

474
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,359
When I was Music set

475
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,960
as a stage assistant,

476
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,440
it was like a drama.

477
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,560
The director team of a singing show

478
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,599
went to Xinjiang,

479
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,839
many good singers

480
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,880
to the headquarters of Shanghai

481
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,400
for the audition.

482
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,360
I was the one who served these contestants.

483
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,760
The boss said

484
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,920
he could sing too.

485
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,400
I recommended him to the directors.

486
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,080
Then I came on stage with the guitar.

487
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,080
I sang a song for the director team.

488
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,600
Then I said you were good at singing.

489
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,960
Then go to the headquarters for the audition.

490
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,440
After the audition, I was lucky to join

491
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,080
a singing show.

492
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,920
Then I went to Bird's Nest to sing.

493
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,760
I could sing in Bird's Nest

494
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,720
because one year before I was a freshman

495
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,280
when I was a freshman

496
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,520
I had to go to many places to take the school exam

497
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,000
My mom was with me

498
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,480
all over the country

499
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,760
all over the country.

500
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,400
It's very hard.

501
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,680
It's very cold in winter

502
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,520
My mom and I came to Beijing

503
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,680
came to Beijing for the first time

504
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,880
So I went to the entrance of the Bird's Nest.

505
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,480
The Bird's Nest is huge.

506
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,400
I was standing at the door and it was very cold.

507
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,720
But I told my mom

508
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,160
"Mom, wait for me."

509
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,480
I will sing for you

510
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,240
in the Bird's Nest.

511
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,080
It was in the next semester of grade 12.

512
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,840
In the last semester in my sophomore year,

513
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,920
in my second year.

514
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,840
And this is what I want to do

515
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
in 2019.

516
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,880
I formed a band that belongs to me.

517
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,320
It's called a new bee on a trip. Yes.

518
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,760
In 2024,

519
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,240
I did what I wanted to do when I was 18.

520
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,760
It means when I was 29,

521
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,160
at the age of 28.

522
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,640
This is what I wanted to do

523
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,600
my dad and I

524
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,120
So small.

525
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,720
This is a couple outfit.

526
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,640
So when my mom was young,

527
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,920
she liked to dress me

528
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,800
a little boy.

529
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,880
Towel, machine boots.

530
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,600
Like that.

531
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,440
So cute.

532
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,800
GREAT FUN

533
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,920
This should be for a month.

534
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,640
GREAT FUN

535
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,880
My mom said when I was born,

536
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,480
she thought it was ugly.

537
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,480
She said, "Why is there such an ugly thing?"

538
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,680
Come out of my belly.

539
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,960
I don't know how old I am

540
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,400
Three or four years old

541
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,520
It should be like my mom

542
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,080
when I was a kid.

543
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,240
and put a lot of cards in it.

544
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,480
Like a princess.

545
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:32,960
Yes.

546
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,000
Actually my parents

547
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,760
doted on me since childhood.

548
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,560
Compared to my two brothers,

549
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,680
I dote on my daughter.

550
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,480
And my dad dotes on me very much.

551
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,000
This is my first time in sixth grade.

552
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,800
I've grown up.

553
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,360
Yes. When we first moved to

554
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,280
Qingdao,

555
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,640
Every time after school,

556
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,120
I would pick them up

557
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,440
from the class.

558
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,680
When I get home, I play with my friends

559
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
in the neighborhood.

560
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,560
And they are just like me.

561
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,160
Little brother.

562
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,520
Yes. When you go to QIYI,

563
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,720
Yes, the younger one.

564
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
Then they went up.

565
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,560
I'm so happy to have two boys.

566
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,640
And this is...

567
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,440
They are actually...

568
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,920
This stage is not my stage.

569
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,160
It's their English academy performance.

570
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,400
I don't know why

571
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,680
You are the leading actress.

572
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,760
My mom said

573
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,400
a person who has a great sense of acting.

574
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,320
Since I can remember,

575
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,720
the first thing I told my mom was

576
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,480
I know I must be a star in the future.

577
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,000
Actually,

578
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,200
I just came back from overseas practice.

579
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,120
When I was 18.

580
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,480
Yes I practiced abroad for three years

581
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,600
Then I came back and started acting.

582
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,080
This is my first drama.

583
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,360
in my first drama.

584
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
I filmed a show with my mom.

585
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,320
called "Mom, you're so pretty".

586
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,480
And my mom got the first place.

587
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,760
But mom is really beautiful and elegant.

588
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,680
Actually I always think

589
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,000
I have a similar personality to my mom.

590
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,600
We both have the desire to act.

591
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,960
Yes, in every drama,

592
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
my parents and my brother

593
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,800
come to visit me.

594
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,760
So I think it's also because

595
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,880
because my parents

596
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
my parents have given me so much love

597
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,240
and the love my brother gave me.

598
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,440
So I hope I can

599
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,280
my infinite love to them.

600
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,840
Let's go!

601
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,560
Come on

602
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,920
You can do it. You can do it.

603
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,640
Come on!

604
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,160
Why do you say you feel the same as Dunhan?

605
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,560
This is a scribbling pen.

606
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,040
I took one.

607
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,720
It's the same color next to the pants.

608
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,800
So cute.

609
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Because all the pictures are open pants

610
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,160
And with mom

611
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,000
How old were you

612
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,400
Mom took it out to play

613
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,080
Next.

614
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,800
This is my aunt who loves me very much.

615
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,640
My parents divorced when I was young.

616
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,720
My parents were my first love.

617
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,400
So when they recall it now,

618
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,960
they were not ready

619
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
I wasn't ready.

620
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,000
Not ready.

621
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,400
Then we broke up and left.

622
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,360
But my aunt

623
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,520
as a mother.

624
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,560
She raised me up in her family.

625
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,160
Because when they were young,

626
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,040
when they were kids,

627
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,120
they would leave me to Aunt.

628
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,040
I didn't understand them when I was young.

629
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,960
But when you grow up,

630
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,840
a lot of personalities are similar to your parents.

631
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,160
You started to understand them.

632
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,640
It's the first time.

633
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,080
A photo.

634
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,080
Everyone's album

635
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,760
in each album.

636
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,040
Yes.

637
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,080
Okay.

638
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,440
Let me see the next one.

639
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,560
Yes.

640
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,520
This should be the first time.

641
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,720
when I was in primary school.

642
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,440
A Story of Names.

643
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,680
Because my name

644
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,440
Yang Gen is the Dan of New Year.

645
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,800
So when I was a kid,

646
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,200
always bullied me and called me Yang Dan.

647
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,760
Because they don't know his name.

648
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,160
You've always been eloquent.

649
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:43,920
Yes.

650
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,640
Find the feeling to express yourself.

651
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,320
My name is Yang Gen, not Yang Dan.

652
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,680
You can call me Yang Yijin.

653
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,120
Yes.

654
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,160
This was in junior high.

655
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,480
Very hosting. Yeah.

656
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,560
This thick bangs.

657
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,440
thick bangs

658
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,360
and exaggerated.

659
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,800
It was very popular.

660
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,080
Make yourself

661
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,040
like a tropical fish.

662
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,600
I don't know what kind of makeup it is.

663
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,440
Yes

664
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,800
This is the first time I came to Beijing

665
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,000
I came to Beijing for the first time

666
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,920
I just saw

667
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,880
So beautiful and handsome

668
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,520
On the street, on the South-gong Drum Alley,

669
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,880
on the street.

670
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,960
I took a very pretentious photo

671
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,360
This is the opening ceremony

672
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,240
after the art exam.

673
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,320
I went to Shanghai to study.

674
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,920
At school.

675
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,440
I went to the crew for the first time to film.

676
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,240
Yes.

677
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,560
I'm also very lucky.

678
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,200
I came to Beijing when I was a sophomore.

679
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,000
It's my first time hosting a variety show.

680
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,200
The next one

681
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,720
is related to one of you.

682
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,880
We worked together last year.

683
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,360
Yes.

684
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,680
At the end of the year,

685
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,760
with Dan.

686
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,520
Yes.

687
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,480
A dream I didn't even dare to imagine when I was young.

688
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,080
Working with such an excellent senior

689
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,960
Okay.

690
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Wait.

691
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,200
I realized my dream step by step.

692
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,720
Yes.

693
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,600
You're great, Dan.

694
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,840
I'll do my best too.

695
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,720
Thank you.

696
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,680
This is my picture of life.

697
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,560
Yes.

698
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,640
This is my first one.

699
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,280
At such a young age,

700
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,920
meditate?

701
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,000
Not meditation.

702
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,080
At that time, my parents

703
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,000
in a canteen in a university.

704
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,840
I always climbed to the table and played by myself.

705
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,720
Looking for food.

706
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,120
This is my cousin,

707
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,520
and my sister.

708
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
This is a photo

709
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,400
for everyone.

710
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,880
Yes.

711
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,600
This is a photo of me and my mom.

712
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,360
When I was young,

713
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,480
my parents divorced

714
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,240
when I was two.

715
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,560
After that,

716
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,000
I lived with my grandparents.

717
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,680
During the summer vacation,

718
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,560
I would go to my mom.

719
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,160
But every time my mom sent me back

720
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,960
to my grandparents,

721
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,360
she was on the bus.

722
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,480
on the bus,

723
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,160
I saw her crying.

724
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,440
One time, I would chase this car

725
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,920
Then I followed it to the back.

726
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,720
I can't run anymore.

727
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,640
My grandpa came to tell me

728
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,440
a man shouldn't cry. He's fierce.

729
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,280
On the street,

730
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,960
And then he hit me.

731
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,400
After that time, QIYI

732
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,880
After that,

733
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,120
I've been depressed.

734
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,200
All my tears

735
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,840
in the quilt.

736
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,600
I didn't cry at the back.

737
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,840
and then separated from my mother.

738
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,720
Every time I was emotional,

739
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,240
I'll also hold myself back.

740
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,640
That's it.

741
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,800
I grew up.

742
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,600
At that time, I decided to

743
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,680
I decided to

744
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,560
to leave my hometown.

745
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,920
I want to go to Beijing.

746
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,720
Then I came to Beijing.

747
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,880
I was very lucky.

748
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,440
This is when I was a freshman.

749
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,400
I accepted

750
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
my first variety show.

751
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,360
And this.

752
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,040
Strong Stones.

753
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,640
Yes.

754
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,920
I was a psychometrist.

755
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,960
to analyze

756
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,760
others' micro-expression and body language.

757
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,040
I was young at that time.

758
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,800
I had depression.

759
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,320
I was weak inside.

760
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,200
Sometimes when people look at you,

761
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,560
or your actions,

762
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Do you think I'm not good enough?

763
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,920
That's how I feel.

764
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,800
So I started to study psychology.

765
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,840
Psychology

766
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,560
is actually a process of saving myself.

767
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,840
I just want to

768
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,280
a more stable inner core.

769
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,240
So when I was 30,

770
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,080
a platform

771
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,760
a platform and an institution.

772
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,280
These are some images of my class.

773
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,600
Through psychology,

774
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,640
can help more families

775
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,320
and know myself better.

776
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,200
and people around you.

777
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
I think this is very important.

778
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,200
So through psychology,

779
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,680
I also

780
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,200
a lot of settlement

781
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,280
with my original family.

782
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,200
Yes.

783
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,640
So our family

784
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,440
are getting better.

785
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
And this is

786
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,960
the fifth season of "Like You",

787
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,120
I'm a psychologist

788
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,640
as a psychologist.

789
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,480
I'm also looking forward to

790
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,440
of "Love Sisters".

791
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,920
Today is our third day.

792
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,440
It's also Cupid's date day.

793
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
The text I sent earlier

794
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,520
They're going on a date today.

795
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,680
Okay, let's continue.

796
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,520
Maybe I hope

797
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,440
It's from you. (Cupid Invitation Card)

798
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
I'm falling in love.

799
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,520
Let's go.

800
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Let's go.

801
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Don't hit your head.

802
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,480
She didn't hit herself.

803
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,560
We got it.

804
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,240
He bumped himself.

805
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,040
It's too high.

806
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,160
Do you apply hand cream?

807
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,840
Thank you.

808
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,240
I feel like my hands have become

809
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,000
It's dry.

810
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,680
It's too dry.

811
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,160
You should use that...

812
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,560
Enough.

813
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,240
I got it.

814
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,320
It smells good. It's not that moisturizing.

815
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
A little moisturizing.

816
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,400
I think I'm mixed with oily skin.

817
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,160
But it was dry when I was doing it.

818
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,520
My lips cracked before.

819
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,600
And I put on lipstick.

820
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,240
You're weak.

821
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,720
It's okay. I'm an athlete.

822
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Otherwise, you'll get sick every day.

823
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,320
Yes.

824
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,520
I think I've done enough exercise today.

825
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,840
I've run three kilometers.

826
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,240
I'm afraid it'll rust if I don't train for too long.

827
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,320
You must be very focused when playing ping-pong.

828
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,320
I think so.

829
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,120
If you keep doing one thing,

830
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,080
you'll be more focused.

831
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,320
Besides,

832
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,880
I don't know if it's because of the earth elephant.

833
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,280
I don't like changes.

834
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,080
Even if it changes,

835
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,400
it's a little change

836
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,640
I know.

837
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,040
Then add it little by little.

838
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,760
OK.

839
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
If it changes all at once,

840
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,960
I don't think it's good.

841
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,680
You're afraid of all unknown things.

842
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,160
Me too.

843
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,480
I've been to my restaurant many times.

844
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,280
You're a boy.

845
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,680
Because the internet says that once a boy

846
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,320
eat delicious food in your shop,

847
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,880
it will become

848
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,320
a fixed NPC.

849
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,600
Yes.

850
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,080
I said I might need someone to take me

851
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,480
to try something new.

852
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,160
I'm not good at

853
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,560
try something new.

854
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,920
But we feel the same.

855
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,320
Neither of us

856
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,000
try something new.

857
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,040
I think so.

858
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,040
Let's go.

859
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,480
Wait for me.

860
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,920
Of course, you're very polite.

861
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
I didn't want you to be cold.

862
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,120
I'm fine. Actually, I'm fine today.

863
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,880
There's no wind, right?

864
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
It can't be windy.

865
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,040
Thank you.

866
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,920
Do you think we're the first to come back?

867
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,000
I think...

868
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,160
Right?

869
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,080
You're back.

870
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,560
There are cakes.

871
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,680
You eat so much.

872
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,600
Come on, Harry.

873
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,680
I need to have a stomachache.

874
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,160
Harry, what are you going to eat later?

875
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,040
You still want to have a stomachache?

876
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,000
I...

877
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,640
just think

878
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,200
it's better than my own cooking.

879
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,160
So keep your stomach.

880
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,840
Okay.

881
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,520
No need to cook today.

882
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:52,880
No need.

883
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,320
I think everyone can bring some back.

884
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,280
It's okay. I'll order a lot later.

885
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,720
I'll pack them all back.

886
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,200
I'll eat it tonight.

887
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,320
I just need to pack it.

888
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,520
Can you hurry up?

889
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,880
What?

890
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,280
Because I'm hungry.

891
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,880
What did you have for lunch?

892
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,640
I didn't eat

893
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,680
the sandwich you made for me.

894
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,960
was eaten by someone.

895
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,320
Who ate it?

896
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,400
I don't know.

897
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,280
I don't know. I don't know either.

898
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,440
I don't know who ate it.

899
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,640
Can you cook it for me again?

900
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,960
I didn't eat it.

901
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,520
I really want to eat it.

902
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,600
I want a lot of ketchup.

903
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:29,960
Thank you.

904
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,480
Did I do well today?

905
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,680
Delicious.

906
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,080
Not bad.

907
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,000
I didn't eat it.

908
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,840
Why should I answer?

909
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,960
I was very anxious when I came down.

910
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,520
I went around.

911
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,400
Where's my sandwich?

912
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,400
I saw a sandwich at lunch and ate it.

913
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,000
You made it and put it here.

914
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,720
Yes.

915
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,800
No, it's Harry's fault.

916
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,440
Harry told me he made it for me.

917
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,640
I think that's mine.

918
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,520
Who said I'd give it to you?

919
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,760
Didn't you say you don't want it?

920
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,760
I'm just being polite.

921
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,880
I won't.

922
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,040
You're quite polite.

923
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,400
You're not.

924
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,920
I'll be nagged for a year.

925
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,720
You even fried eggs.

926
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,800
I have to

927
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,600
There's a piece inside.

928
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,880
Take the second floor for me.

929
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,280
Yes.

930
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,200
It's open.

931
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,720
Thank you.

932
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,000
Eat this and stop scolding me.

933
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,640
Did you make this?

934
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,560
No.

935
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,960
Do it tomorrow morning.

936
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,920
Sure.

937
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,880
Make one for me too.

938
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Do you dare to eat it?

939
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,960
I'm very proud of you.

940
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,200
Eat alone. I'll cook noodles too.

941
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,920
Do you want some?

942
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,000
No.

943
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'll cook noodles.

944
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,040
I'm good at cooking.

945
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,000
Okay, eat more.

946
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,040
I know what you mean.

947
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,960
I know your elephant.

948
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier

949
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,960
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

950
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,200
Susu and I thought about it.

951
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,160
When Harry just left,

952
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,840
I think dinner

953
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,480
should be solved by ourselves.

954
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
Why didn't you bring it to me?

955
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,680
Why didn't you bring mine?

956
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,960
I didn't know you wanted to eat.

957
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,520
Yes.

958
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,680
He didn't say it himself.

959
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,840
This smells good.

960
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,720
Do you want something sweet or salty?

961
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,520
Anything is fine.

962
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,960
I'll eat everything you cook.

963
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,120
Make it in your heart.

964
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,600
Do you want something sweet or salty?

965
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,160
Do you want something sweet or salty?

966
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,400
Anything is fine.

967
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,640
You can't imitate me.

968
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,880
Then salty.

969
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,320
Okay.

970
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,600
Okay.

971
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,560
Do you know how to fry eggs?

972
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,760
You fry the egg.

973
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,640
You can fry an egg.

974
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,480
But let me try.

975
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,160
Search your phone.

976
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,880
Don't laugh.

977
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,120
It's not funny.

978
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,720
Listen, if you get up early in the morning,

979
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,240
you can fry it.

980
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,840
It's simple.

981
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,520
I'll teach you.

982
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,640
Go back and cook it yourself.

983
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,040
Okay.

984
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Put the oil first.

985
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,680
Pour.

986
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,600
You lead. I'll do it.

987
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,200
Okay.

988
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,040
One by one.

989
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,160
You can't fry them together.

990
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,600
One by one.

991
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,160
Hit the egg now.

992
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,680
Knock at it first.

993
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,960
Will it be leaked?

994
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
No. Knock gently.

995
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,920
Let me call you, okay?

996
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,560
Take a look.

997
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,080
Just knock.

998
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,600
Then squeeze it from here.

999
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,480
Will it collapse?

1000
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,040
No.

1001
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,920
I didn't expect

1002
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,560
I could teach others to cook.

1003
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,159
Can I turn it over now?

1004
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,760
It's more cooked

1005
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,800
or older?

1006
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
You can make your own decision.

1007
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,639
Yes. Then your move

1008
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,960
can get you a plate.

1009
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:26,920
Yes.

1010
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,560
You can check if it's cooked.

1011
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,600
You can turn it over

1012
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,320
to see if it's the familiarity you want.

1013
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,000
Did you sleep?

1014
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,480
Almost.

1015
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,960
You want to do it so many times?

1016
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,480
Not necessarily.

1017
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,239
It's just that

1018
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,159
I always turn off the fire and fire for you.

1019
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,560
What are you doing?

1020
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,600
Are you frying eggs

1021
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,440
Fried an egg for three.

1022
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:49,800
We're learning.

1023
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
They are learning.

1024
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,159
Turn on the smoke engine.

1025
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,280
I'm sorry.

1026
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,760
Your attention is always different.

1027
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,040
We've watched the second week's film.

1028
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,520
There are two sets of Cupid dating this time.

1029
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,240
It feels like this Cupid date

1030
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,960
after this date.

1031
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,480
How will their relationship develop?

1032
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,240
What will happen to Jab's feelings?

1033
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,560
Let's look forward to the next episode.

1034
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,200
Love and Sisters.

1035
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,960
Let love double.

1036
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,080
So scary.

1037
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,720
You're so good at it.

1038
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,200
Come here.

1039
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,520
Three beds.

1040
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,920
Boys' Chat Party.

1041
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,120
What type do you like?

1042
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,480
What will you do with her when you go on a date?

1043
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,800
Fair competition.

1044
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,240
It makes me feel threatened.

1045
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,960
Every Thursday at 18:00, Members enjoy the reproduction of "Sibling Defense Diaries".

1046
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Creation Center and win the bonus.

1047
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,320
I'll be on the news and the clients will search "Super Drama Show". and watch more interesting content.
