1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,160
Su Zihao.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,160
Have you finished?

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,640
Come up after that.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,880
Come with me.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,760
Let's go.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,520
Why should I go?

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's go.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,800
She's calling you.

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,680
Hurry up.

10
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,320
She's calling you.

11
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,800
Hurry up.

12
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,240
Is it possible that she doesn't need me?

13
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,880
I need you.

14
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,280
So cool, Harry.

15
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,960
Thank you.

16
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,680
Thank you.

17
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,800
Are you the "boss" Harry

18
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,760
He's "Mr. Xiao".

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,120
It's okay.

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,240
Bye.

21
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,880
Maybe that's who he is.

22
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,480
that kind of person.

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,400
And he can't say it's bad.

24
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,920
He also said

25
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,280
if I go to

26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,320
you're going to

27
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,200
the romantic house.

28
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,720
He said if I were the landlord,

29
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,560
would you go?

30
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,320
Do you want me to go?

31
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,960
He said yes.

32
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,720
He always says but he doesn't.

33
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,960
For example, what will he say?

34
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,440
He'll make it look like a man and a woman like him.

35
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,400
If I don't go with someone else,

36
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,120
he said he would leave.

37
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,360
But he didn't say anything bad.

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,360
But

39
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,000
I didn't think there was anything.

40
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,600
But now that you mention it,

41
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,680
It's not because I think it's a waste.

42
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,039
I gave you two a chance.

43
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,360
That's why I'm angry.

44
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,880
Especially yesterday, I kept telling him

45
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,360
until 4 a.m.

46
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,000
I said my sister didn't need anything.

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,920
But I think what you can give her

48
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,039
you can take more initiative.

49
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,960
You make her feel your feelings.

50
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,680
and the initiative.

51
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,240
I can feel your feelings from the text,

52
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,600
But I can't feel it from real life.

53
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,160
being together

54
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,759
Not bad.

55
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,960
I just want to be with you.

56
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,240
to be together.

57
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,000
But

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,160
you must be happy to be together.

59
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,280
That's what you get in return.

60
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
I don't think you did much.

61
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
Yes.

62
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,800
That's the feeling.

63
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,760
I don't know if I was too anxious

64
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,440
or too anxious.

65
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,640
Actually, I'm not in a hurry.

66
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,880
It's not about whether I'm in a hurry or not.

67
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,200
You need to start from zero.

68
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,160
But he didn't

69
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,400
the next move.

70
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,520
No progress. Yeah.

71
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,880
It sounds like

72
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,640
a few days ago.

73
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,200
Tell me.

74
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,880
You were in the same state the first two days.

75
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,360
Yes.

76
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,880
You're progressing slowly.

77
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,480
If he doesn't move,

78
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,280
You'll be anxious and annoyed.

79
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,760
If you're anxious, that's how you feel.

80
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,160
it means you care about it.

81
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
If he doesn't make any progress,

82
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,120
you will slowly persuade him to leave.

83
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,640
I really...

84
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,240
I don't know.

85
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm confused right now.

86
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm very irritated right now.

87
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,520
No, calm down.

88
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,000
I think...

89
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm annoyed.

90
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,280
I think you should calm down.

91
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,200
Sometimes when you're emotional,

92
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,320
I'm not emotional.

93
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm very calm.

94
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,880
It's his problem.

95
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,960
I don't think you need to find fault with Susu.

96
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,880
In my impression,

97
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,800
I don't like it if I don't take the initiative.

98
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,079
Right.

99
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,600
Right?

100
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
It's not enough.

101
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,440
I can't say you don't like it at all.

102
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,800
It's not enough.

103
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,640
Because if you really like it,

104
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
you can't help but take the initiative.

105
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,720
Yes.

106
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,520
Yes.

107
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,160
Because I think

108
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,640
no matter how passive they are.

109
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,320
Really?

110
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,160
I suggest we date someone else.

111
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,960
I don't recommend it.

112
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,400
I don't know how to change.

113
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,920
No, just make him angry.

114
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,560
No.

115
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,480
No.

116
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,000
You have to change your attitude.

117
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,760
To be honest,

118
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,800
you really have to change.

119
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,880
Yes, I won't upset him.

120
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,840
I don't have to send it.

121
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,000
but I won't send it to others.

122
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,360
That's right.

123
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,440
This will make misunderstanding.

124
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,160
I think this will deepen the misunderstanding.

125
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,280
If I knew

126
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
I was interested in him,

127
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,000
I wouldn't send it to others.

128
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,079
But I don't have to.

129
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:32,960
Yes, me too.

130
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,680
Gosh.

131
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,560
I'll get ready.

132
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,120
That's what I said.

133
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,040
I think you only care about your heart.

134
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,120
You may never consider

135
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,760
what I think.

136
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,600
or how I feel.

137
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,280
Do you think he likes you?

138
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,880
Yes, but that's not enough?

139
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
I can't say I don't like it.

140
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,640
Yes.

141
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,960
Because he still...

142
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,640
Because of you,

143
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,320
will affect his emotions.

144
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
But he cares more about his feelings.

145
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,440
He likes himself more than you.

146
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,040
Yes, I like myself more.

147
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,080
But I think many people

148
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,280
There's nothing wrong with that.

149
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,200
You don't have to say that.

150
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,080
Yes, people like themselves more.

151
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,880
Yes.

152
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,800
Just...

153
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
tired.

154
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,720
Do you still want to go on a date with him?

155
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,240
I may be emotional now.

156
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
I won't make any decision.

157
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,000
Actually on my way back,

158
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,399
on my way back.

159
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,399
After coming back,

160
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,399
we analyzed

161
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,920
Then you spit it out and summarize

162
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,720
and recall the whole process, right?

163
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,160
The more I think about it, the stranger I feel.

164
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,800
Yes, it's weird.

165
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,080
The more I think he didn't pay, right?

166
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,000
The more I think about it, the weirder it is.

167
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,440
The more I think about it, the more upset I feel.

168
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,040
After hearing that,

169
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,400
I feel even more upset, you know?

170
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,840
Are you going to sleep?

171
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,280
Okay.

172
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm leaving.

173
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,600
Is he asleep already?

174
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,720
What about the gift box?

175
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,240
I think in life,

176
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,920
in life.

177
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,960
and romantic.

178
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,760
Sometimes surprise

179
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
doesn't mean how precious this gift is.

180
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,080
It's just that

181
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,440
Did you listen to her feelings?

182
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,600
Or did you listen to

183
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
what she said to you before?

184
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,760
This kind of surprise is real.

185
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,040
I think it's romantic.

186
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
The most proactive thing he has done to you is

187
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,560
After you told him his question,

188
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,640
he came to talk to me.

189
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,000
Does this count?

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
Please stop this conversation.

191
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,159
Let's go.

192
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,920
Bye.

193
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,520
Take care of yourself.

194
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,400
Calm down.

195
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
Okay, I'll take a rest.

196
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,960
He's asleep.

197
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,840
I know he's sleepy.

198
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,480
Mr. Wang.

199
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,440
Did you see the text?

200
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,960
Yes.

201
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm speechless.

202
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,520
Hua, I really...

203
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,760
I'm really speechless.

204
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,600
A man and a woman.

205
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,280
I'll go in now.

206
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,080
Let's see what you'll do.

207
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,640
I'll kick you out.

208
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,440
Go, Hua.

209
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,920
Go.

210
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,040
Hua, go in.

211
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,320
Tata wants to go in, right?

212
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,880
I won't give him a chance.

213
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,840
Tata, you haven't gone yet?

214
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,480
I'll go now.

215
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
Really?

216
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,320
Go, Hua. Run.

217
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Go!

218
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,280
Hua, run!

219
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,680
Run, Hua!

220
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,040
Hua!

221
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
What kind of girl running champion is that?

222
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,240
It's really in.

223
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,000
Really?

224
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,640
Huahua has entered.

225
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,640
Hua has to go to the romantic house every day.

226
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,200
No matter

227
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,360
Romantic battlefield.

228
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,520
I'm leaving.

229
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,040
The flower lock is locked.

230
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,880
Locked?

231
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
You're not welcome.

232
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,680
Please go back.

233
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,200
Do you want to see it?

234
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,400
Harry, come in.

235
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,520
Harry, come in.

236
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,680
You can't change it.

237
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,120
You can't change it.

238
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,160
I can't change it.

239
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,520
Why didn't we have a TV yesterday?

240
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,720
I applied.

241
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,960
Time starts.

242
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,560
Go away.

243
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,840
Open it.

244
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,240
Yes.

245
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
So annoying.

246
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,760
Bye.

247
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm leaving.

248
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,120
Hua.

249
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
Hua is so naughty.

250
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,720
Yes.

251
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,720
I hope comedians have love too

252
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,680
So cute

253
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,360
So bright.

254
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,480
So funny.

255
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,240
So bright.

256
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,120
This is for you.

257
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,800
Open it.

258
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,440
Really?

259
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,120
What is it?

260
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,760
In a hurry.

261
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,400
So cute.

262
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,640
What is this?

263
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,159
A dog.

264
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,640
Yes.

265
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,120
You said I look like a dog.

266
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,000
So I bought you a dog.

267
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,800
This.

268
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,680
Don't you know this

269
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
It's...

270
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,360
What?

271
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,320
I don't know.

272
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,600
Thank you.

273
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,400
No because I wanted to buy

274
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,600
I just wanted to buy flowers.

275
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,280
But I can't bring it back, you know?

276
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,040
And this thing can be brought back

277
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,600
and Chengdu.

278
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,320
Just buy this.

279
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,040
Why are you eating again?

280
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,840
I haven't started yet.

281
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,840
None of your business.

282
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,560
I watched a TV series recently.

283
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,040
It's pretty good.

284
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,120
Do you want to watch it with me?

285
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,400
Sure.

286
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
What drama?

287
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,320
It's called "White Moon Van Star".

288
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,440
We can watch it on kiwi TV.

289
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,039
This one.

290
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,679
A full screen?

291
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,480
You have to open this when you watch it.

292
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Min Ki Video MAX.

293
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,520
It's clear.

294
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,560
White deer.

295
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,880
It's quite clear.

296
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,560
The color is also cool.

297
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,800
So cool

298
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,040
Like a cinema

299
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,640
Yes.

300
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,480
I used this.

301
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,640
Min Ki Pictures MAX.

302
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,040
I watched so many episodes in one go.

303
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,720
This TV is really...

304
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,280
So sweet.

305
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,640
I love this TV.

306
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,120
Should we watch this or which one first

307
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,040
Didn't you say to look at this

308
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,920
Look at this first?

309
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,480
Are you sure?

310
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:11,960
Yes.

311
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,240
Are you sure you want to watch this first?

312
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,640
To be honest, it's kind of scary.

313
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,480
Haven't you seen it before?

314
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,240
Yes.

315
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
It's not scary if you've seen it, right?

316
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,960
Actually, I haven't seen it.

317
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,240
I don't think it's scary.

318
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,760
Their common hobbies

319
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,240
watch horror movies.

320
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
and horror movies.

321
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
I told you before.

322
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,040
Are you nervous?

323
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,320
No.

324
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,320
No.

325
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,080
Are you cold?

326
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,240
Are you hot?

327
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,280
He said that mom did it.

328
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,040
Kiss her.

329
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,600
I think today

330
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,120
a perfect day today.

331
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,800
We've been watching movies and watching TV.

332
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
We've been sitting together

333
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,920
and keep talking,

334
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,160
being with each other,

335
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
I'm already very satisfied.

336
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,680
Today is

337
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,280
more than the first time

338
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,600
than my first date with her.

339
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,320
Do you want to continue?

340
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Yes.

341
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,160
I'll change it.

342
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,920
I've been writing for two hours.

343
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,440
Today is the first time

344
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,400
watch a movie together.

345
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,840
At the romantic house,

346
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,520
there was only me and him.

347
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,920
watching a movie on the sofa,

348
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
I feel at ease.

349
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,000
and happy.

350
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,240
I feel comfortable

351
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,720
with him now.

352
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,360
a good day.

353
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,760
He's totally in love.

354
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
I don't think Harry is watching a movie either.

355
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,600
Not at all.

356
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,240
The first time I kissed my wife,

357
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,080
I was watching a movie.

358
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,480
At night

359
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,840
When I went to watch a movie,

360
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,600
I had decided

361
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,360
I must kiss her that night.

362
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,320
Do you remember what you watched in the movie?

363
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,240
No, that movie was at her home.

364
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,360
Not in the cinema

365
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,800
He was sitting in the middle

366
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,960
No, he was sitting over there.

367
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,640
And

368
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,880
Just for a moment, I think it's time.

369
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,200
I'll kiss him.

370
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,440
Zun Wu doesn't know

371
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,760
what the movie is.

372
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,880
I wasn't focused on the movie.

373
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,840
I'm always in the mood.

374
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,280
When should we kiss?

375
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
So cute.

376
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,760
Come on, chat with me.

377
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,640
It's so hard, Fatty.

378
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,320
Say something.

379
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,240
My "fat" friend is online.

380
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,520
Actually, I can't let go of my date.

381
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,560
Too many people.

382
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,320
I asked Harry the night before.

383
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,720
I said,

384
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,880
is Susu very against

385
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,400
physical contact?

386
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,360
Because

387
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,640
for a long time.

388
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,280
I can't help but want to approach her.

389
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,440
or hold her hand.

390
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,040
But we didn't do anything

391
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,600
at Cat Cafe.

392
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,680
After I came back,

393
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,600
Harry thought there was no progress between us.

394
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,320
He might want to help.

395
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,600
He and Susu went to the dining table.

396
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,320
And Tarri and I

397
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,800
are at the piano.

398
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,840
Harry told Susu

399
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
about the soup.

400
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,800
I don't know if you will resist.

401
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
If he wants to

402
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,440
physical contact with you,

403
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
I heard

404
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,560
Susu said it had something to do with me.

405
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,680
Is there any progress between you two?

406
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,680
You really...

407
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,840
What does it have to do with me?

408
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,080
There are two different things about "fur".

409
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
Maybe it's just a angry word.

410
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,280
But I was very sad.

411
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,760
I was sad.

412
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,680
Then...

413
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,360
Then...

414
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,400
Listen to me first.

415
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,880
Then...

416
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,520
Then,

417
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,680
Maybe Harry asked her

418
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,840
what she did on today's date.

419
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,560
She might say

420
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
I can't let go.

421
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,120
What? What?

422
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,040
Stand there like a human-shaped watermark.

423
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,680
And

424
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
they were there.

425
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,440
I don't know why they are laughing.

426
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,840
It's quite ironic.

427
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,960
It's...

428
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,400
I thought it was a joke.

429
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,080
What did you do today?

430
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,800
Just talking to Mimi, right?

431
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,600
He's playing with her.

432
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,240
But he doesn't open his mouth.

433
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,960
Just stand there.

434
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
He won't open his mouth.

435
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,760
He doesn't talk.

436
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,520
Just stand there.

437
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,320
It's a watermark.

438
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,960
You know?

439
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,600
Water mark.

440
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
Harry said that.

441
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,360
Yes.

442
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,560
If you really like me,

443
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,080
I don't think

444
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,720
the things you like do as a joke.

445
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,920
In public,

446
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,560
I think

447
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
very disrespectful.

448
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,360
I laughed for a long time.

449
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,640
I was so upset that I went upstairs.

450
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,520
I really don't understand.

451
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,320
Do you want to hear my opinion?

452
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,120
In my opinion,

453
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,760
in love,

454
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,280
in love.

455
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,360
If you can't feel it,

456
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
you can't feel it.

457
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
You have to be firm.

458
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,720
The power is mutual.

459
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,960
OK. After this question,

460
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,560
is a joke you mentioned.

461
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,240
I think everyone is kind.

462
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,560
She subconsciously shared that with her brother.

463
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,480
First, I think Susu

464
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
she doesn't mean subjective consciousness

465
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,720
to hurt you

466
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,480
to hurt you.

467
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,160
Definitely.

468
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,760
Yes.

469
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,680
I'm sure you won't.

470
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,000
Right?

471
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
Maybe she's a joker.

472
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,800
You don't have to think about this.

473
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,120
But this behavior has offended you

474
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,320
or hurt you.

475
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,200
You can think about it.

476
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,800
This is what I've been thinking

477
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,760
I've been thinking about

478
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,840
in this room.

479
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,880
In fact, I thought people were similar.

480
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,520
My deepest feeling here is

481
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,360
living environment.

482
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,880
Family environment

483
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,000
has changed too much.

484
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,600
Susu's family environment

485
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
is very happy.

486
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,880
Their family can make jokes.

487
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,480
They are a harmonious family.

488
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,200
They are open-minded.

489
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,400
Look at her dad.

490
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,600
He said his daughter was ugly at the beginning.

491
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,000
and Harry is ugly.

492
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
If one day your mom tells you

493
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,560
you were born ugly,

494
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
Then you might listen.

495
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,120
But in their eyes,

496
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,520
a joke.

497
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,680
Do you understand now?

498
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,400
Everyone has a different level.

499
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,080
Yes.

500
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,720
That makes sense.

501
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,520
The soup in my eyes

502
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,000
is a joke to friends.

503
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,920
But in love,

504
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,040
soup is not a joke.

505
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,240
So you think it hurts

506
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,040
may sting in your eyes.

507
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,440
In fact, you are delicate.

508
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,920
but I may also say you are too sensitive.

509
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,360
It's so hard.

510
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,320
I feel I'm happy and sad every day.

511
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,920
Happy, sad.

512
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,640
Every day.

513
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,800
I want to

514
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,720
ask you what you think.

515
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,040
Do you want to

516
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,880
in this place?

517
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,320
You think everyone has

518
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,000
I should have one.

519
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,360
Or I really like

520
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,440
a real

521
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,840
a complete Susu.

522
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,760
So sharp?

523
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,240
This should be his question.

524
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,160
This is very important.

525
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,000
I become so serious.

526
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,119
Maybe it's because

527
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,800
I may not

528
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,920
know her well.

529
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
But I do like her.

530
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,680
I have no choice.

531
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,480
I just want to chase her.

532
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,520
and get close to her.

533
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,040
Maybe the answer I got

534
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,400
she likes me too.

535
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,319
Did you ask her?

536
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,640
She said she likes you.

537
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,800
It's vaguely said

538
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,640
if she expresses that she likes you,

539
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,000
did you ask her

540
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,760
if you like me,

541
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,720
why don't you consider my feelings?

542
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,520
Have you asked this question?

543
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,480
Not yet.

544
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm going to ask.

545
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,600
It's me.

546
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,640
I really don't know.

547
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,200
What do you think

548
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
after you ask this question?

549
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,760
I can't imagine it.

550
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,120
The answer I want to get is

551
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,000
she knows.

552
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,440
She knows I'm unhappy.

553
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,680
She knows I'm upset.

554
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,040
You pursue perfection too much.

555
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,480
It's different from playing ping-pong.

556
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,360
It doesn't have

557
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,040
What point?

558
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,880
Feelings keep changing.

559
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,040
You can't find

560
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,560
the most suitable point

561
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,960
to touch it.

562
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,560
It's a change.

563
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,320
She can like you today.

564
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,200
When a new person comes out,

565
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,440
she'll create a wave again.

566
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,000
You can only

567
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,800
your own balance

568
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,200
in the waves.

569
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
You can't always pursue

570
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,120
the highest point in the wave.

571
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,280
You'll be very unhappy.

572
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,400
Actually, I'm much better now.

573
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,040
I really...

574
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,960
I think you can do this.

575
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,360
understand each other.

576
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,680
Don't have so many questions.

577
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,560
You always ask

578
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,920
In summary,

579
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,760
I personally think every chat

580
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,360
every quarrel,

581
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,240
every time

582
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,680
has a result.

583
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,640
If there is no result,

584
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,400
you're wasting

585
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,600
You're wasting your emotions.

586
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,800
Make a summary

587
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,440
in the past few days.

588
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,880
Don't be so fast.

589
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,480
in such a hurry.

590
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,520
This is not training ping-pong.

591
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,800
Don't worry.

592
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,440
I think there's something wrong.

593
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,080
Talk to your brothers.

594
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,000
and your friends.

595
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,600
After that,

596
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,120
Now your mood is much better.

597
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,880
It's very helpful to soup.

598
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,720
This sentence

599
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,440
Yes.

600
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,320
I don't know.

601
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,080
You just think she doesn't care about you.

602
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,320
You've only been together for a few days.

603
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,200
Indeed.

604
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,840
Yes.

605
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,480
Are you too demanding for others?

606
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,800
too high for yourself?

607
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,760
Ten days.

608
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,400
Do you have to go like that?

609
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,600
She wasn't born to be your wife.

610
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
right?

611
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
There's nothing we can do about it.

612
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,880
You've been trained

613
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,080
to achieve this.

614
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,960
People are like this too.

615
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,720
They keep getting along.

616
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,120
You're asking too much.

617
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,280
It's been more than ten days.

618
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,240
I don't think there's such a person.

619
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,160
This is a very accurate enlightenment.

620
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,360
I'm impressed.

621
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,160
Indeed.

622
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,280
You want it to be perfect.

623
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,960
I think so too.

624
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,360
Relax.

625
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,560
You have to relax.

626
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,480
Because you're a man.

627
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,840
You're a boy.

628
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Keep your eyes off me.

629
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,480
To be honest,

630
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
I think so too.

631
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,680
everyone is a master

632
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,440
in other people's love.

633
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,720
Yes.

634
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,800
We are all Counsellor.

635
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,160
And it makes sense.

636
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,320
Fatty is mature.

637
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
Analyze others' feelings.

638
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,360
Fatty is not suitable for dating.

639
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,120
Yes.

640
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,280
He is suitable to be an emotional counsellor.

641
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,520
He is a good love counselor.

642
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,360
Very good.

643
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,480
As a good friend,

644
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
is really good.

645
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,320
A fat friend.

646
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,120
He's charming when he talks to others.

647
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,600
But it's a pity.

648
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,920
If you use these experience

649
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,080
on your feelings,

650
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Yeah.

651
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,400
Everything may go smoothly.

652
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,280
That's why it's called higher-ups.

653
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,080
You can't analyze it when you're up.

654
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,960
They are not very happy today.

655
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,440
Not very happy.

656
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,440
I have a chance.

657
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,400
I will.

658
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,840
Sister

659
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,800
Call me sister.

660
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,320
Sister

661
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,680
Time to put on makeup.

662
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,600
Here's the soup.

663
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,360
No.

664
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,440
I'm just tired from dating too much.

665
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,240
I don't know.

666
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,120
I'll find out later.

667
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,880
Two people in their own world every day.

668
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
in our own world.

669
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,080
It's an ambiguous period.

670
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,040
and then in love,

671
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,680
It'll take at least three months.

672
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,200
Xin.

673
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,800
What are you doing?

674
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,800
You scared me.

675
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,800
What?

676
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,880
Are you giving a lesson?

677
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,640
For whom?

678
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,920
Give it to my eldest disciple.

679
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,560
Map?

680
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:34,800
No.

681
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,640
That's the second disciple.

682
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,440
Soup.

683
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,120
What's wrong with the soup?

684
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Are you unhappy with the soup?

685
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,200
Yes.

686
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,000
Why?

687
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But the class is over.

688
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,560
No.

689
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,480
Why didn't I know about this?

690
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Yes, we were just talking.

691
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,720
Tom.

692
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,320
What?

693
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,000
Come out.

694
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,640
Xiao Ling did the right thing.

695
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,760
She went straight to Tom.

696
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
She didn't listen to Fatty.

697
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,320
Yes.

698
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,160
What's wrong?

699
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,280
What's wrong?

700
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,840
What?

701
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,000
Are you okay?

702
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,560
Did your date not go well?

703
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,400
Listen to me.

704
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,480
I asked Harry last night.

705
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,800
Because I think Susu and I

706
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,560
like each other.

707
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,240
I asked Harry,

708
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,840
if Susu is very against

709
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,640
physical contact?

710
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,200
I don't know

711
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,600
I don't know.

712
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,640
Harry told her about this.

713
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,000
She said it has nothing to do with me.

714
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,720
Susu said that.

715
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,480
He remembered that feeling.

716
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,240
Then he turned that feeling into words.

717
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,080
into "fur".

718
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,480
They said

719
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,320
on the dining table.

720
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,480
It sounds like

721
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,880
judge and mock.

722
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,280
as a joke.

723
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,440
And I think

724
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,840
I was sincere.

725
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,320
I felt very sad.

726
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,360
Then I talked to Fatty.

727
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,720
Fatty also said

728
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,000
No, it's so stuffy here.

729
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,560
It makes sense

730
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,960
I think it makes sense.

731
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,920
I don't want

732
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
to make it so stressful.

733
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,800
No.

734
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,520
My heart is beating so fast.

735
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,680
I can't stay here anymore.

736
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,520
She cares about her brother.

737
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,400
My hair is about to stand up.

738
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,280
Why?

739
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,120
Okay, nothing.

740
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,440
I'm actually fine.

741
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,760
I need to get some fresh air.

742
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,520
I can't stand it.

743
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,360
It's too stuffy.

744
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,520
Let me get some fresh air.

745
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,800
I'm going to get some air. I can't stand it.

746
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,480
I'm crying.

747
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
The most angry thing about me is

748
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,320
this is what Susu said.

749
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,200
It has nothing to do with her.

750
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
In my opinion,

751
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,000
she's interested in the soup.

752
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,720
Since she's interested,

753
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
If you care about each other's feelings,

754
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,200
why did you say that?

755
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,040
I'm a little...

756
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,200
sad, angry,

757
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,400
and some don't understand.

758
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,160
I think this matter will affect my attitude

759
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
affect my attitude towards Susu.

760
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,760
This is a big misunderstanding.

761
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,960
From my perspective,

762
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,600
her words

763
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,440
hurt the soup.

764
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,280
Is she worth it?

765
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,960
my brother to be so sincere?

766
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,760
She can't accept people mocking her brother.

767
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,080
Maybe her brother is her bottom line.

768
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,520
She said in the last episode,

769
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,360
she would choose her brother first.

770
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,880
Mimi.

771
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,640
Mimi, come here.

772
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,480
Okay.

773
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,320
Sit.

774
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,160
Don't...

775
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
It's okay. I want to cry too if you cry.

776
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,040
What's wrong, baby?

777
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,560
It's not that serious.

778
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,680
What's wrong?

779
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,520
What?

780
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,360
Why are you crying?

781
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,760
I was scolded and cried.

782
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,360
I was scolded by the soup.

783
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,240
What?

784
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,080
Dude.

785
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,240
What's wrong?

786
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,760
No.

787
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,080
It's okay.

788
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,360
She's fine.

789
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,480
Don't cry.

790
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,440
It's okay.

791
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,320
They were playing Go.

792
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,520
Then you suddenly cried.

793
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,840
Do you think they are not as good as you?

794
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,400
My sister hugged me when I cried yesterday.

795
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,120
Come and hug her.

796
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,240
Hurry.

797
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
The map is really good.

798
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,720
So warm.

799
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,160
Give me a big hug

800
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,920
Hug her.

801
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,040
The map knows Xiao Ling well.

802
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,400
Yes.

803
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,560
I'll give you a like.

804
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,720
Great.

805
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,120
The essence of the picture is pure and kind.

806
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,560
What should I do?

807
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,440
I'm starting to crave pictures and Xiaoling.

808
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,680
I want to cry even more.

809
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,920
I want to cry even more.

810
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,720
In my opinion,

811
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,200
brothers are more important than friends.

812
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,040
So this is the first time

813
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,120
I cried because of my own brother.

814
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,720
Actually the soup

815
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,840
when he hugged me.

816
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,520
I feel sad.

817
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,000
and feel secure.

818
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,560
Two strange emotions

819
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,040
mixed together.

820
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,200
I feel like my family is next to me.

821
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,920
My injured brother

822
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,280
is comforting me.

823
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,240
But what I told you

824
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,600
is just my subjective idea.

825
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,840
Why?

826
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,440
This is just his subjective consciousness.

827
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,640
It's not objective enough.

828
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,160
Actually,

829
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,720
is not objective enough.

830
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,080
We need time to give the answer.

831
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,720
It's nothing.

832
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,920
I've seen it through. Don't cry.

833
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,840
It's okay.

834
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,360
How could she do that?

835
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,680
Okay, it's okay.

836
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,520
I'll block it for you.

837
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,080
I'll help you.

838
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,400
Tu Tu knows

839
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,880
doesn't want to lose control in front of the camera.

840
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,520
So I helped her block the camera.

841
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,840
That's a good picture.

842
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,400
It's okay.

843
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,600
I'm really fine.

844
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,680
I don't think she can do that.

845
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,440
But it's just subjective consciousness.

846
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,360
But I still feel bad.

847
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,200
It's okay.

848
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,160
So warm.

849
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,920
It's a comfort from a fluffy puppy.

850
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,040
Why did you cry yesterday?

851
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,920
I cried today.

852
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,360
Yes.

853
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,960
Why are we really...

854
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,720
We didn't

855
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,240
cry because of ourselves.

856
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,720
We always cry because of others.

857
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,040
Why?

858
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,400
It's okay.

859
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,320
I'll cover it for you.

860
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,120
I'm starting to have boyfriend power.

861
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,120
He suddenly became a man.

862
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,920
His magnetic field is super positive.

863
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,120
Yes, the sun

864
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,920
wrapped her up.

865
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,760
It's okay.

866
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,080
I'm fine.

867
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,560
It's okay. Just cry.

868
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,200
The comfort he gave me today

869
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,240
I feel

870
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,880
my heart calmed down.

871
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,080
Because he came to me

872
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,440
right away.

873
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,960
Then he patted my shoulder and said,

874
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,800
It's okay

875
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,840
And he keeps giving me tissues.

876
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,240
In the room, besides soup,

877
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,240
other than soup.

878
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,000
For example, drawing.

879
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,480
He cares about my emotions.

880
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,920
Take a deep breath.

881
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,080
Let's go eat. Let's go.

882
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,720
Let's go.

883
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,920
Stop looking.

884
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,000
Let's not...

885
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,120
Have some water.

886
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,640
Drink all the tears back

887
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,520
Drink coke.

888
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,000
You like Coke.

889
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,120
Thank you.

890
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,680
Have a seat.

891
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,000
It's okay.

892
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,280
Feeling better?

893
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,920
Actually, I...

894
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,360
I saw you crying.

895
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,680
You only cry because of that.

896
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,200
You won't cry for anything else.

897
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,440
Then tell me why I cry.

898
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,880
I'll see if you're right.

899
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,920
Yes.

900
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
I got it.

901
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,960
The ice queen is crying.

902
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,440
Let it be.

903
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,640
Help!

904
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,680
He made her laugh.

905
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,720
He took out the map

906
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,440
his ultimate skill.

907
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,280
Let's go eat something.

908
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,000
I think we cry

909
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,040
because of ourselves.

910
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,080
It's all about your own brother.

911
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,560
So I think

912
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,120
we are kind of like

913
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,560
my negative emotions.

914
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,720
has been overwhelmed

915
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,040
by this high happiness.

916
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,960
Mr. Tu is my happy fruit

917
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,040
I’m Happy Guoer.

918
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,400
I'm also crying.

919
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,440
I'm not angry.

920
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,000
I just feel a little wronged.

921
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,840
Harry told me

922
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,640
about the soup.

923
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,720
Will Susu hate

924
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,560
physical contact?

925
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,880
I think this kind of thing can happen naturally.

926
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,440
You can't do it on purpose.

927
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,640
Maybe he pulled me

928
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,520
just to show Harry.

929
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,240
See?

930
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,040
I'm doubting this point.

931
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,960
Maybe because they talked a lot

932
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,040
talked about this last night.

933
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,880
It's kind of like completing a mission.

934
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,640
Susu is also emotional.

935
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,160
But actually,

936
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,000
was also misunderstood.

937
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,600
Okay.

938
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,360
Dinner is here.

939
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,600
Tom, come and eat.

940
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
Put it away. Right away.

941
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,760
Thank you.

942
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,280
I'll go.

943
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,680
I'll go get Susu.

944
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,760
Eat something.

945
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,320
It cracks again.

946
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,520
Wearing headphones.

947
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,760
Susu.

948
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,719
I may not be able to feel it in my world.

949
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,600
I just don't.

950
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,440
If I don't take the initiative, I don't like it enough.

951
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,159
After talking a lot,

952
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,199
I can still come back to these two sentences.

953
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,920
Because in this small house,

954
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,679
if we have any misunderstanding or problems,

955
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,560
I want to know about him.

956
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,360
If he wants to know me,

957
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,600
may be spread through Harry's mouth.

958
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,040
I thought

959
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,840
we came back to our real life.

960
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,760
If we want to keep in touch,

961
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,400
if Harry doesn't

962
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,040
without Harry,

963
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
how do we get to know each other?

964
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm the one who takes the initiative.

965
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,480
I'm the one who gets emotional.

966
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,160
I don't know what to do.

967
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,840
I don't know how to solve it.

968
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,040
I don't think

969
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,440
he did anything wrong.

970
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,240
I don't think I did anything wrong.

971
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,760
But

972
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,080
some emotions piled up there.

973
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,840
Then I wanted to escape.

974
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,760
I'm scared.

975
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,720
I don't want to face it.

976
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,280
He

977
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,920
is not here.

978
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,960
But she doesn't know

979
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,000
the soup is taking the initiative outside.

980
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,680
Susu thinks

981
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,480
I've taken the initiative many times.

982
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,800
The soup didn't take the initiative.

983
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,360
It means you don’t like it.

984
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,720
I’d like to ask

985
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,760
why Susu has this idea.

986
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,440
It's what we just talked about.

987
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
emotional verification.

988
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,640
She has such a mentality.

989
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,680
I feel that

990
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,520
in the beginning.

991
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,360
But you didn't take care of my emotions.

992
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,520
So she always wanted to verify

993
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,440
that the soup cares about my emotions.

994
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,320
He can take care of my emotions.

995
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,080
But when she never got it,

996
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,520
she would think too much.

997
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,720
Then she would say,

998
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,240
"Do you really not like me?"

999
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,560
Maybe not that much.

1000
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,480
Maybe it's not that effective.

1001
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,840
The more I think about it, the more complicated it is.

1002
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,280
But from the perspective of the bystander,

1003
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Do you think

1004
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
the soup is not that proactive to Susu?

1005
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,160
Is it because he doesn't like her enough?

1006
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,040
I think he respects her too much.

1007
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,560
Yeah.

1008
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,160
Because I think

1009
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,040
this is a very polite behavior.

1010
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,920
It's about personality.

1011
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,480
Yes, he asked his brother in advance.

1012
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,160
From what you know about her,

1013
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,000
is she against physical contact?

1014
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,080
That's what he thinks.

1015
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,000
I really want to get close to her at this time.

1016
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,880
But I'm afraid she might think it's impolite.

1017
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,400
or something.

1018
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,800
I think this is actually

1019
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,240
a very gentleman behavior.

1020
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,840
Very polite.

1021
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,520
Yes.

1022
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,720
Add more points.

1023
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
It's better than

1024
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,960
I think

1025
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,320
I think we should get a bigger score.

1026
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,000
Yes.

1027
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,240
They are still playing ping pong.

1028
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,840
Why are there so many people?

1029
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,040
I'm sorry.

1030
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,160
I miss you.

1031
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,520
I'm going upstairs now.

1032
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,960
Nobody cares

1033
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,000
Harry is back.

1034
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,520
Nobody cares

1035
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,080
Let it be.

1036
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,440
No one is allowed to enter.

1037
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,200
Who?

1038
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
No, I was busy just now.

1039
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,320
Busy.

1040
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,480
It's our choice not to enter.

1041
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,400
It's your problem

1042
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,160
is your problem.

1043
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,520
You brought a pot of flowers back.

1044
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,240
Aren't you supposed to be at 9:30?

1045
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,320
I miss you.

1046
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,840
I don't believe it.

1047
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,960
Really.

1048
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Where is my sister?

1049
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
I called her just now.

1050
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,160
But it seems no one is in her room.

1051
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,080
She didn't go in?

1052
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,360
No.

1053
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:05,920
What should we do?

1054
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,160
Who can go in and call her?

1055
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,960
Huahua.

1056
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,360
Where are you going?

1057
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,680
Call Susu.

1058
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,680
If you don't,

1059
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,240
how can I enter a girl's room?

1060
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,200
The map went into my bathroom yesterday.

1061
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,840
Guolifang.

1062
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,400
Really?

1063
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,640
He rushed into my toilet that day.

1064
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,520
I said,

1065
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,760
Stop it in time.

1066
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Go down and eat.

1067
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,160
Go.

1068
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,520
Are you still unhappy?

1069
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,920
He was not happy just now.

1070
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,280
Didn't you feel

1071
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,840
Didn't you feel it?

1072
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,320
He asked you to come for dinner.

1073
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,720
No.

1074
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,320
Let's go.

1075
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,760
I'll go later.

1076
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,440
I'm tired.

1077
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,120
Come on.

1078
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
Go down alone.

1079
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,560
It's okay.

1080
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,120
Don't...

1081
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,200
Don't be sad.

1082
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,600
Don't.

1083
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,760
It's okay.

1084
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,320
You need to fix your makeup when you cry.

1085
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Don't cry.

1086
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,280
It's okay.

1087
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,480
Really.

1088
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,160
I think

1089
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,920
a waste.

1090
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,840
I feel sorry for Su Zihao and Tata.

1091
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,400
Why do you think so much?

1092
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,840
You should do it.

1093
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,560
Look.

1094
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,360
They got along so happily today.

1095
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,160
They stayed at Romantic House for four hours.

1096
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,120
She feels guilty.

1097
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,520
Harry gave her this.

1098
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,640
So she's under a lot of pressure.

1099
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,920
It's not a waste.

1100
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,480
It's not necessarily good to go on a date.

1101
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
I think it's normal to have contradictions.

1102
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,480
We know each other better, right?

1103
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,360
Don't think too much.

1104
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,120
I'm tired.

1105
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,640
He asked me to ask you to eat.

1106
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,360
I'll be right there.

1107
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,800
Let me calm down.

1108
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,480
Okay.

1109
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,600
Take your time.

1110
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,000
Hurry up.

1111
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,280
Or it'll be too late for dinner.

1112
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,640
Go down.

1113
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,080
Okay.

1114
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,000
Take your time.

1115
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,640
Okay.

1116
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,440
It's okay.

1117
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,400
It's okay.

1118
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,000
I feel

1119
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I haven't sorted out my emotions.

1120
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,800
I don't want people to see

1121
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,920
that I'm feeling down.

1122
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,960
I don't know what I'm thinking.

1123
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,680
I'm just scared.

1124
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,960
I don't want to go down.

1125
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,080
Yeah.

1126
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,920
I just feel like I'm running away.

1127
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,840
Escape?

1128
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,040
See the soup.

1129
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,160
She'll come back later.

1130
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,400
What is she doing?

1131
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,760
Go upstairs.

1132
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,000
Did you sleep long?

1133
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
You slept for a while

1134
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,920
But I'm up now.

1135
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,760
I'm going up.

1136
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,240
I need to go up too.

1137
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,360
What?

1138
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,040
What?

1139
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,560
Thinking.

1140
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,400
What?

1141
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,880
(Thinking)

1142
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,000
Talking

1143
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,600
You feel so sad after a sleep.

1144
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,320
I just feel wronged.

1145
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,320
If you think

1146
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,440
you feel wronged,

1147
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
just forget it.

1148
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,880
What?

1149
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,360
Harry.

1150
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,600
Stop interfering.

1151
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,240
Brothers intervene in love.

1152
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,240
No, I think

1153
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,120
it has nothing to do with him.

1154
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,240
He did nothing wrong.

1155
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,000
If everyone is unhappy,

1156
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,280
why go on a date?

1157
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,320
To steal other people's opportunities.

1158
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,240
Then come here.

1159
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,360
I was unhappy.

1160
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,240
Why should I go?

1161
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
Do you want me to ask

1162
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,720
if he's happy?

1163
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,240
What does that mean?

1164
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,200
Isn't he happy?

1165
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,640
I feel...

1166
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,560
Didn't he say anything to you when he came back?

1167
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,920
But it feels like

1168
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,280
if he comes to you now,

1169
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,040
you can make things clear.

1170
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,360
After all, both of you are in a bad mood.

1171
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:52,840
There must be something.

1172
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,480
I don't know

1173
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,040
I don't know what to say.

1174
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,560
Just tell him you don't know what's wrong with you.

1175
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,600
Tell him you think he's unhappy.

1176
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,400
But I don't want you

1177
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,080
to take the initiative every time.

1178
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,560
Although I want him to come to you,

1179
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,320
but I don't want

1180
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,960
to ask him to come to you

1181
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,280
as your friend.

1182
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,560
If he can't feel my emotions,

1183
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
why

1184
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,160
to remind him?

1185
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,680
Will someone remind him later?

1186
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,560
We lost our conversation again.

1187
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,600
He's here.

1188
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,040
Their emotions are wrong.

1189
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,920
It sounds like

1190
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,240
not good at dating.

1191
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,200
It feels like this.

1192
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,800
What should I do?

1193
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,200
What can we do now?

1194
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,360
We didn't take the initiative.

1195
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,800
but he knows it himself.

1196
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,680
Stop thinking about it.

1197
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,040
Dream on?

1198
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,240
Delusion?

1199
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,720
Go downstairs and eat.

1200
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,880
Don't avoid him.

1201
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,200
Just go to him.

1202
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,560
I'm serious.

1203
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm so twisted.

1204
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,200
Stubborn.

1205
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,880
I can't stand myself anymore.

1206
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,080
If you want to break this trap,

1207
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,520
I can bring him here for you two to talk.

1208
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,280
It's us again.

1209
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,200
Let him do it.

1210
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,480
Yes, why me again?

1211
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,040
Why is it always me?

1212
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,880
I'm the one who's unhappy.

1213
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,320
I'm the one who's unhappy.

1214
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,200
He took the initiative just now.

1215
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,520
Yes.

1216
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,760
But she doesn't know.

1217
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,880
I'm so mad.

1218
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,720
I'm so worried.

1219
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,680
I'm so pissed.

1220
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,360
I'm so worried.

1221
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,560
Do you want to eat something?

1222
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,840
Get yourself together.

1223
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,160
Just do what we should do.

1224
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
You're just more sensitive than him.

1225
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,040
I think

1226
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,960
He's sensitive too.

1227
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,400
Soup is sensitive too.

1228
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,480
Taurus.

1229
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Taurus.

1230
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,400
I'm sensitive.

1231
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,200
Me again?

1232
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,440
Why?

1233
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,400
I'm a sensitive little stone.

1234
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,640
I posted a Moment

1235
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,400
I want to become a stupid stone.

1236
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,880
Let's go.

1237
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,120
Have fun.

1238
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,280
Let me play the piano.

1239
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,240
I think he's depressed too.

1240
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,120
Now I feel uncomfortable all over

1241
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,800
Now I feel like an ant is crawling on me.

1242
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,160
I feel helpless.

1243
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,560
Feeling helpless?

1244
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,640
I can't put my hand in and pinch their neck.

1245
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,520
Seriously.

1246
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Are you okay?

1247
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,040
What's wrong? You're so flustered.

1248
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,680
You're flustered.

1249
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,680
What would you do if it were you?

1250
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,280
Am I Susu?

1251
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,960
Put yourself in this position.

1252
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,760
If it were me,

1253
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,840
I would still take the initiative.

1254
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,960
I'll ask you directly.

1255
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,400
You're right.

1256
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,720
But only if I care about him very much.

1257
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,480
So you really care about me.

1258
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,360
Yes.

1259
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,200
Stop.

1260
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,920
Blood pressure.

1261
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,640
Right.

1262
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,440
You really don't know how to choose a place.

1263
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,440
So annoying.

1264
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,480
Indeed.

1265
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
I'm hanging up.

1266
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,520
I want some water.

1267
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Drink water. Do it.

1268
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,200
What are you doing?

1269
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,120
Let me pour you some.

1270
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,240
Get me a glass of water.

1271
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,320
She's already there.

1272
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,240
Help!

1273
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,680
It's okay.

1274
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,080
It's okay.

1275
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,800
I'm guilty.

1276
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,120
If you don't have someone you like,

1277
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,360
you can say "no".

1278
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,200
No Sue.

1279
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,920
No "no" with soup.

1280
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,080
Sit, Sunny.

1281
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,160
I'll sit here.

1282
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,640
I want to sit

1283
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,160
where I can sit alone.

1284
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,560
I don't want to be close to him.

1285
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,640
You're so decisive.

1286
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,560
I'm afraid I'll miss you again.

1287
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,440
I'm just thinking

1288
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,240
if he would sit next to me.

1289
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,960
But I'm afraid after thinking about it,

1290
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,480
he didn't come to sit next to me.

1291
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,440
I feel like he's broken.

1292
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,520
I can only write my composition from soup.

1293
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,480
There's no other way.

1294
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,160
Yes.

1295
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,040
In each episode, we will set up

1296
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,800
based on the content of the show.

1297
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,720
(This episode's guess is)

1298
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,280
today's message.

1299
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,240
How will Susu send it?

1300
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,680
Is it "no" or soup?

1301
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,720
This episode is individual battle.

1302
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,160
Please write down

1303
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,960
on your notebook.

1304
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,680
Whoever gets it right

1305
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,760
will get one

1306
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,680
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

1307
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,440
In the last episode,

1308
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,800
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

1309
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,120
the most guests

1310
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,160
will receive a mysterious award

1311
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,720
provided by Guoli.

1312
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,640
Now let's welcome

1313
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,320
the

1314
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,080
of Love Sisters.

1315
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,880
Let's announce your answers.

1316
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,520
No.

1317
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,480
Jiang Dunhao chose soup.

1318
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,040
Mr. Jiang Dunhao

1319
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,840
is on another floor with us.

1320
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,840
I still have a beautiful dream

1321
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,240
to keep choosing each other.

1322
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,040
What will Susu choose?

1323
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,000
We're going to

1324
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,800
we're going to have wild wine.

1325
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
It's time to reveal the truth.

1326
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,080
What?

1327
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,000
Up.

1328
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,200
Flower likes the finished product today.

1329
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,480
She hung it on my bag.

1330
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,240
I received a message from you today.

1331
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,840
It must be from Terri.

1332
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,520
After watching it,

1333
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,280
Of course I'm happy.

1334
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,240
I'll hang it up soon.

1335
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,080
Action.

1336
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,280
I texted Hua today.

1337
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,320
I'm very satisfied with this date.

1338
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,760
I think the sunflower you made for me

1339
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,400
is really meaningful.

1340
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:22,920
Soup.

1341
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,040
Still showing off?

1342
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:25,880
It's made of flowers.

1343
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,400
Tofu.

1344
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,240
Yes, with beans.

1345
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,080
Are you happy today?

1346
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,240
Yes.

1347
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,600
Just handmade

1348
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,440
There

1349
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,400
See?

1350
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,960
It's on the bag. Let me show you.

1351
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,000
It's made of flowers.

1352
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,320
Show it to the world.

1353
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,360
It's nice.

1354
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,320
In her own words,

1355
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,640
she wants me to be happy every day.

1356
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,600
I think every time I see this,

1357
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,360
I think of her.

1358
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,480
Sweet.

1359
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,320
Thank you for the keychain.

1360
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,480
I think I did a good job.

1361
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,760
This date is easy.

1362
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,600
and fun.

1363
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,360
No restrictions and nervousness before.

1364
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,160
Keep getting along.

1365
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,760
Keep going.

1366
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,440
I received a text from Hua today.

1367
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,440
Her feelings were obvious.

1368
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,880
But when she said she liked me,

1369
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,560
and complained about me.

1370
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,000
Although it's not as good as mine,

1371
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,360
but I still like it.

1372
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,720
I'll text Tae-seo today.

1373
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,720
And today's relationship

1374
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,080
is definitely warmer

1375
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,400
than before.

1376
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,720
So I hope

1377
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,120
to spend more time with each other.

1378
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,000
I think the flowers are getting prettier.

1379
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,640
The joy of love.

1380
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
I understand how you feel.

1381
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,440
You can stand in your position

1382
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,840
to express your thoughts.

1383
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,120
Be happy.

1384
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,200
The picture will comfort you.

1385
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,600
Tonight, it's still for Xiaoling.

1386
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,080
First, I comforted her.

1387
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,040
I understand

1388
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,680
how she feels about her brother.

1389
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,680
I just experienced it yesterday.

1390
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,760
So I think

1391
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,560
you can comfort him.

1392
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,760
But don't be too sad.

1393
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,320
I have to be optimistic.

1394
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,200
Thank you for comforting me

1395
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,640
when I was sad.

1396
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,120
I feel much better now.

1397
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,640
I'm very happy.

1398
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,920
I think I wrote

1399
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,040
I wrote a lot.

1400
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,400
Because today,

1401
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,120
to tell the map.

1402
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,720
Today I get along with Tu

1403
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,320
with Tu Tu.

1404
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,440
I feel happy

1405
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,520
with him.

1406
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,000
Kiddo.

1407
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,480
I don't want to make you sad.

1408
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,080
Seeing you so sad,

1409
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,240
when I see you so sad.

1410
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,600
I know you're not mad at me.

1411
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,560
But I still blame myself.

1412
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,920
If only I had been more determined

1413
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,840
or had some tacit understanding with my sister.

1414
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,320
He sent me a long paragraph.

1415
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,200
And part of it

1416
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,720
the text he edited last night.

1417
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,280
He knew I was sad

1418
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,480
After a mental breakdown,

1419
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,240
he did some self-reflection.

1420
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,400
He also told me how to make me happy today.

1421
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,000
When I saw this part,

1422
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,960
I was quite touched.

1423
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,520
I think today

1424
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,000
a perfect day today.

1425
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,720
We've been watching movies and watching TV.

1426
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,760
We can keep talking.

1427
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,440
and

1428
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,680
I'm happy

1429
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,160
I'm satisfied with that.

1430
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,800
I think

1431
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,320
sometimes

1432
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,280
this kind of plain companionship

1433
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,680
will be more effective than going out to play.

1434
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,360
and know more about each other.

1435
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,800
Although we didn't go on a date today,

1436
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,360
I'm happy

1437
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,480
with you.

1438
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,360
Actually,

1439
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,800
spend the whole day with him,

1440
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,120
I felt very happy.

1441
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,080
In the message,

1442
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,040
in the text message.

1443
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,240
Actually the content I sent today is short.

1444
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,640
But I think

1445
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,120
can include my mood today.

1446
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,960
Susu.

1447
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,240
I didn't expect the most stable team

1448
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,120
Although I wrote "Wu",

1449
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,800
I hope she can send the soup.

1450
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,440
Yes.

1451
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,000
Yes.

1452
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,760
I hope he will come to me

1453
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,400
he should come to talk to me.

1454
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,520
I can't see

1455
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,200
any details.

1456
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,320
makes me feel that he doesn't like me that much.

1457
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,680
Do you have time to chat later?

1458
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,720
Soup takes the initiative.

1459
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,760
Since I like her,

1460
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,040
I might try again

1461
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,960
to make a breakthrough.

1462
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:13,920
I'm thinking

1463
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,160
when will you

1464
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:16,960
When will you talk to me?

1465
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,960
What will I talk about later?

1466
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,080
to face him

1467
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,880
to face him.

1468
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,960
Do you think my sister

1469
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,640
did she send the soup today?

1470
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,400
I think I sent it to him.

1471
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,480
I hope I can become

1472
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,600
at some time.

1473
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,960
I never thought of not sending it to him.

1474
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,080
I don't think I should.

1475
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,440
I won't send it to others.

1476
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,000
Even if we didn't have a good time today,

1477
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,480
or I feel wronged.

1478
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,280
But I think my feelings are clear.

1479
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,160
My feelings

1480
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,720
to him.

1481
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,760
Great.

1482
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,200
Fatty and Xinxin.

1483
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,720
I received a text message today.

1484
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,400
And I'm from Susu.

1485
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,480
I'm not surprised.

1486
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,680
Because I think

1487
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,640
he gets along well with Susu.

1488
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,840
And I think Susu still likes him.

1489
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,920
So I'm not surprised that he received the message.

1490
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,120
But I still want to know the story.

1491
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,840
Congratulations to Jiang Dunhao

1492
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,880
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

1493
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,240
Jiang Dunhao, you are better.

1494
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,600
Do you want to play a game?

1495
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,280
No, I'll eat.

1496
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:02,960
Follow me.

1497
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,080
Good luck with the soup.

1498
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,360
Coming.

1499
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,760
The soup is shining.

1500
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,320
Can I sit here?

1501
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,840
Tarri is opening a romantic house today.

1502
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,000
I think there's a sign for taking the initiative.

1503
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,760
How many points did you give me?

1504
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,200
Because time is running out,

1505
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,880
So do you think

1506
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,440
is necessary?

1507
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,040
You've talked to her.

1508
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,200
You decided to be friends.

1509
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,800
You're making me cry again.

1510
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:50,680
Well...

1511
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,360
