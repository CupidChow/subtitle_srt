1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,560
You're amazing, Tae-seo.

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,640
Try a guy you've never met.

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
Soup, Thailand.

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,120
Terri is so gentle.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,080
You look like a gentleman.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,000
He's manly.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,400
Tell us his shortcomings.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,520
Short?

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,480
There are many shortcomings.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,320
Don't you think

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,960
he changes me so quickly?

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,280
Four in the morning.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,000
He lay on my bed

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,240
and hit me eight times.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,080
I've done so much for this relationship.

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,160
Love Sisters.

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,200
Double love.

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,080
and intervene in love and social therapy.

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,960
"Love Sisters".

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,840
We're lovers' family members.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,160
Welcome.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,360
Today is a good day.

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,880
We have a new member.

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,520
Hello, everyone.

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,840
I'm singer Ziying Zhang.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,280
I'm here to eat sugar.

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,360
Hello.

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,160
Hello, I'm Mi-na.

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,920
I'm very happy

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,280
our "Love Sisters".

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,080
I have a real sister.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes, so when I was watching,

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,880
I was very immersed in the role of my brother.

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,360
I cried a lot.

35
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,520
Especially when Hua danced,

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,479
I couldn't cry.

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,920
Because the sisters I know

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,880
are very close.

39
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,920
Yes, we are like

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,560
close friends.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,960
It feels like

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,919
in the world.

43
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,120
Very good.

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,040
It seems that in my memory,

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,680
in my memory.

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,880
How many years apart?

47
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,720
Five.

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,760
Good difference.

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
Good bad.

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,600
Yeah, different.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
You have to take care of your sister.

52
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,040
And she admires you.

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,200
Yes, we usually

54
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,400
a little weird.

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
My mom will record our weird video.

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,880
And I won't call her sister.

57
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,680
I'll call her by her name.

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,880
Like friends.

59
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
She also called me by my name.

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,880
Yes, I'll just call her by her name.

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,840
Welcome Mi-na from the siblings' perspective.

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,760
Last week, we had a secret date.

63
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,440
Then a secret mirror house

64
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,880
opened again.

65
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,120
So now for our Mirror Room,

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Tarri, Hua, and Fatty,

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,480
The relationship between the three of them has become complicated.

68
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,800
What will happen

69
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,880
will happen this week.

70
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,200
Next, it's time for

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,079
of this episode.

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,880
Hua.

73
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,160
I want to eat the noodles

74
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,520
the noodles you made that night.

75
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,160
I shouldn't have made glutinous rice balls.

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,880
If you want noodles, you have to wait.

77
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,160
I'll go upstairs and ask if the soup eats noodles

78
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,080
Soup dumplings.

79
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,760
Last night,

80
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,240
I was still craving.

81
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,920
I'll ask the other two.

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,680
Do you want glutinous rice balls or noodles?

83
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,120
Noodles.

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,560
Okay.

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you want glutinous rice balls or noodles?

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Noodles.

87
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,600
You play.

88
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,040
Of course not.

89
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,800
Xiao Ling.

90
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,320
What are you doing?

91
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,440
Is Hua down there?

92
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,880
Ask her to fix my face.

93
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,160
Hua.

94
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,920
Everyone up there wants to eat noodles.

95
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,720
Okay.

96
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,840
Fatty wants you to fix his face.

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,800
You said I was here.

98
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Forget it. I'll fix it for him.

99
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,160
Yes, you fix it for him.

100
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,400
She's making noodles.

101
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,280
So I fixed it for you.

102
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,000
Calm down.

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,560
Turn him into a cat.

104
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,880
Calm down.

105
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,040
Can you fix it with a brush?

106
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,720
Yes.

107
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
This is no joke.

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,480
Ask the map to repair it for you.

109
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,760
He won't.

110
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,880
The picture doesn't look good.

111
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,520
He can fix love but not this.

112
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,960
We're born to be excellent. We don't need makeup.

113
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,839
I'll blame you for the zero votes tonight.

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,720
On the map.

115
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,040
Hello, I'm here to take a look.

116
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,880
I think the foundation is a bit dark.

117
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,320
I think I can use another color.

118
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,920
What do you think?

119
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,720
No need, really.

120
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,480
No.

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,840
You were scared to death.

122
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,080
Let me see what you changed his makeup.

123
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,240
I'll look forward to it later.

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,400
Okay.

125
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,760
It's just a makeup.

126
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,960
You can shake his eye socket.

127
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,800
It's too soggy.

128
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,680
OK. Give him the tail of the eye later.

129
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,680
You should have majored in it.

130
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,159
No.

131
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,720
She doesn't need to be pretty.

132
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,840
What's the difference

133
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
What's the difference?

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
I thought it's the same

135
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,280
or not.

136
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,080
After putting on makeup,

137
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,000
her face

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,160
a dark filter.

139
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,720
She doesn't have any filters when she's not wearing makeup.

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,160
That's the only difference.

141
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,280
Open your eyes.

142
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,080
Aren't you afraid when he opens his eyes?

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,760
Can he be saved?

144
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,120
Yes.

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,360
What do you mean?

146
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,520
Trust me.

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,080
Why?

148
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
What do you mean why?

149
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,480
I want to know

150
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,159
why your dark circles can't be covered.

151
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,040
It's like you stayed up all night.

152
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,640
Why is my dark circles

153
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,560
are getting deeper and deeper?

154
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,600
My dark circles weren't that deep.

155
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,920
Yes, why?

156
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,880
I can do it myself.

157
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,120
Then you do it yourself.

158
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,560
I think it'll be better if I do it myself.

159
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,120
Thank you, Chubby.

160
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm sorry.

161
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,520
Now Fatty only has one bowl.

162
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,080
Because of his dark circles,

163
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
because of his dark circles.

164
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,120
and missed his breakfast.

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,600
I'll leave it to you later.

166
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,280
Let's move the table over.

167
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,720
You bought

168
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
a lot of folds.

169
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,920
Where are you going to put it?

170
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,080
Okay.

171
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,159
Really?

172
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,880
No.

173
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,720
I can move the running machine and bicycle.

174
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,600
Yes.

175
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,400
You should be the first guest

176
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,920
to change the love house.

177
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,360
The weather is nice.

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,600
Let's play basketball. Let's play one-on-one.

179
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,680
OK, one-on-one.

180
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,840
Fight with me.

181
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,600
I'll knock you out.

182
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,440
Can you touch the ball when you jump?

183
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,400
Don't be too presumptuous.

184
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,760
Three steps are important for girls.

185
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,440
Boys need to shoot.

186
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,680
Go change your shoes.

187
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,440
Xiao Ling, beat them.

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
Are you going out to play basketball?

189
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,120
Let's play.

190
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
I don't know how.

191
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,480
Give me one hand.

192
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,880
Sure, I'll give you one hand.

193
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,560
I'll only use my right hand.

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,480
Are you good, Tae-seo?

195
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,280
I'm not.

196
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,080
But I think I can hit the tower.

197
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
That's too high.

198
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,400
So interesting.

199
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,240
When you stretch out your hand, you...

200
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
Tarri, you can fight with soup.

201
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,480
I think so too.

202
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,880
I can fight with you, right?

203
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,920
You two play. How about I record for you two?

204
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,160
I don't know how to shoot.

205
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,920
I can't do anything.

206
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,080
It's all random.

207
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,400
Do you want to hit the beat?

208
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,200
Come on.

209
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,480
You too.

210
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,400
Me too.

211
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,120
Me first.

212
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:26,960
Nice shot!

213
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Are you serious?

214
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,679
You shouldn't have clapped.

215
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,760
I know how to do it.

216
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,720
I don't want to play anymore.

217
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,120
Can you shoot like this?

218
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Female shot.

219
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,200
Good.

220
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
Which action will be easier?

221
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,680
Let's see how to shoot.

222
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,760
Oh, no. I'm a little stressed.

223
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,440
Come on.

224
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,560
Let's see how you use your strength.

225
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,240
Too hard.

226
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,600
Is it so accurate?

227
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,000
Nice shot!

228
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,720
He was second to me.

229
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,240
I'm done.

230
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,520
Who's better?

231
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,160
It's in.

232
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,040
I saw it.

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,480
I saw it.

234
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Don't be nervous.

235
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,520
Nice shot!

236
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,560
Look at him.

237
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,600
She smiles like a loving mother.

238
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,040
You have one too.

239
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,760
A loving mother.

240
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
I'll eat you if you score.

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,480
I'll eat you if you score.

242
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,600
No, I mean her.

243
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,800
It's your turn.

244
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,960
OK.

245
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,560
We said queue up, but he gave it to Tata.

246
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,480
Seriously.

247
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,440
Let me help you.

248
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,640
Take it.

249
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,600
Really? Eat it.

250
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,480
I'll raise Hua for you.

251
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,960
I'll lift it for you and you put it in.

252
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,080
That's bad.

253
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,080
Nice shot!

254
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,920
Three, two, three.

255
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,040
Nice shot!

256
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,000
Thank you.

257
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,960
Let's take a photo together.

258
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,800
Let's take one here.

259
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,600
But the back

260
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,480
Me too.

261
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,560
Go away.

262
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,600
His position is good.

263
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,240
That's because I'm pretty.

264
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
Have you ever thought about this?

265
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,560
You really know how to talk.

266
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,800
Let me see.

267
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,360
I do look better.

268
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,520
Be careful.

269
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,680
Let's go.

270
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,960
Let's take the table for a while.

271
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,400
Let's go.

272
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,680
Look at the clothes.

273
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,520
Oh no.

274
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,280
Get changed.

275
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,000
Get changed. It's useless.

276
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,080
There's someone you want to know today.

277
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,920
Go and find out.

278
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,480
If not, who else

279
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,920
Who do you know?

280
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
Go and find out.

281
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,840
Try the boys you've never met.

282
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,960
What if...

283
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,360
you haven't touched

284
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,400
Soup, Tae-seo.

285
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
Thank you so much.

286
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,880
Even the soup

287
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,360
he was nervous when he was with a girl.

288
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,040
I even approached him.

289
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,840
And Tarri.

290
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,720
You didn't even talk to him when he came in.

291
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,040
He happened to hit

292
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,960
that I don't like at all.

293
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,360
So tall and handsome.

294
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,840
Where did I hit your thunder?

295
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,880
I don't know.

296
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,440
Terri is so gentle.

297
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,320
You don't like those gentle ones, do you?

298
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,160
I know.

299
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,600
Actually,

300
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,800
you may not believe me, right?

301
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,760
You look like a gentleman.

302
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,920
He's manly.

303
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,440
I was very cold yesterday.

304
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,000
He just... I didn't say anything.

305
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,920
He just stood like this.

306
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,640
and block the vent.

307
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,360
I didn't think

308
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,200
he would do such a thing.

309
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,400
He'll only ask if you're cold.

310
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,640
But he gave me

311
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,480
on him yesterday.

312
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,120
We're all cold actually.

313
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,760
I'm worried about you, friend.

314
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,640
Let's play five-in-a-row Go.

315
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,960
Who wants to play first?

316
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,600
Anyone.

317
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,800
No.

318
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,440
Just play.

319
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm sweating.

320
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,120
It doesn't matter.

321
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,120
Then I put it here. You have to stop it.

322
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,440
Then I put it here.

323
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,280
You're gone.

324
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,920
Xiao Ling, he's really amazing.

325
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,240
I can't beat him.

326
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,440
You've never played it before?

327
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,040
Five-in-a-row?

328
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,360
Yes, we can't beat him.

329
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,840
Yes.

330
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,200
I have to do it.

331
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,040
Okay.

332
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,320
Come on, play a game.

333
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
He usually wins more.

334
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,640
Try it.

335
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,520
Let me see how good you are.

336
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,200
You won't lose if you play four, right?

337
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,360
What? Four?

338
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,240
Go?

339
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,440
Can you?

340
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,800
Yes.

341
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,160
Let's play Go.

342
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,840
You chase and I chase. Come on.

343
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
Come here.

344
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
Move! Run!

345
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,160
I don't understand.

346
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,640
I'll give you another goal.

347
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,760
I was the Go champion when I was young.

348
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,520
Take a break.

349
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,400
Are you playing Go?

350
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,840
Yes.

351
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,080
I can't beat her.

352
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,840
I can play too.

353
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,440
Really?

354
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,400
Come with Tata.

355
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,560
Who's being twisted?

356
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,800
Forget it.

357
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,840
You're being twisted.

358
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,360
Yes.

359
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,000
I twisted him twice.

360
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,560
Try it.

361
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,120
How is winning or losing?

362
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,960
I have no children to play.

363
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,280
I don't think I can beat her.

364
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,000
Why can't she win?

365
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,640
She said she used to be number one.

366
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,520
Seriously.

367
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,680
Wait.

368
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,240
Repent a move.

369
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,320
Why don't you play over there?

370
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,280
I can't.

371
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,080
The more you eat, the more you eat.

372
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
Swing the lamb head.

373
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,120
In this situation,

374
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,320
in this situation?

375
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,720
I told her to control less.

376
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,720
Oh no, more and more control.

377
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,800
Actually, I'm blocked.

378
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,480
Yes, this part

379
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,720
You can't beat her.

380
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,240
Yes.

381
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,480
I don't want to play anymore.

382
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,960
So boring.

383
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,440
Come on.

384
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,160
Harry.

385
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,080
Did you learn that?

386
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,160
I'm learning.

387
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,800
Okay.

388
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,960
Learn it for Su.

389
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,960
You play high notes.

390
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,280
I'll play the high pitch.

391
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,920
Try it.

392
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,720
Which song?

393
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,280
That one.

394
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,080
"The River of Heart".

395
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,320
Don't cross it.

396
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,200
So many codes.

397
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Secret code?

398
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,920
Just play next to it.

399
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,080
What?

400
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,760
You play first. Each of you try a small part.

401
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,840
Okay.

402
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,440
I think I should play the chord for you.

403
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,800
If you play it,

404
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,960
Try it.

405
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,240
You play.

406
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,560
No, we need to fight.

407
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,480
It's okay. I'll look for the score.

408
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,400
Thank you.

409
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,760
I didn't recognize him.

410
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,359
Let Tata show us

411
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,599
What song can you play?

412
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,720
What song can I play?

413
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,800
I really forgot.

414
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,720
I only know a little.

415
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,280
Let the soup teach you.

416
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,000
What can you play?

417
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,920
I'll sing "To Alice".

418
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,400
Gosh.

419
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,840
Teach me.

420
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,480
I don't remember either.

421
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,960
how to play "To Alice".

422
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
This one.

423
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,280
I can't use my left hand either.

424
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,760
Really.

425
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,760
You're better than me.

426
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,920
I don't remember. It's been a long time.

427
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,480
Let's go, ping pong.

428
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,960
You have to teach me.

429
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,360
I can't.

430
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,200
You don't even know how to play it. Why are you teaching me?

431
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,920
Mr Tang is here to teach ping-pong.

432
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,160
Let me see how Harry taught him.

433
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,800
Okay.

434
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,600
How?

435
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,200
The teacher said two feet are parallel.

436
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,280
Put your left foot here.

437
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,960
Like you holding something.

438
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,720
Okay, start.

439
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,600
I don't want to hear it.

440
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,400
You didn't even play it.

441
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,600
Sorry.

442
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,000
You won't be mad if I hit you, will you?

443
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,840
Why would I be angry?

444
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,520
How could you hit me like this?

445
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,120
I didn't play well.

446
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,640
Pick up the ball yourself next time.

447
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,600
Wait.

448
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,240
I didn't mean it.

449
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,840
Really.

450
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,200
Wait.

451
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,440
Be the Counsellor.

452
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,840
He’s a veteran.

453
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,280
Make yourself at home.

454
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,240
Here.

455
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,680
Here.

456
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,240
Yes.

457
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,200
Yes, it's an advantage now.

458
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,040
I'm at a disadvantage now.

459
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,560
It's okay. Don't listen to him.

460
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,920
Don't listen to me.

461
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,800
Help!

462
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,440
This...

463
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,320
Yes.

464
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,160
Set the formation for me. You stay here.

465
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,040
What formation?

466
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,240
He set the formation for me.

467
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,840
I'll kill you.

468
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,080
This...

469
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Did you win?

470
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,680
Yes.

471
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,560
I'm sorry.

472
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,760
We're brothers and family.

473
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
The family atmosphere

474
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,760
the family atmosphere

475
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,880
of family atmosphere?

476
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,120
I'm an only child.

477
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,800
But I have a cousin.

478
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,200
because I'm the elder sister.

479
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
When a sister does something wrong,

480
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,080
or something,

481
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,400
I was the one who got punished and scolded.

482
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,000
I didn't understand my childhood self.

483
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,160
Back then,

484
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,760
take the responsibility?

485
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,440
So when I was young,

486
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,480
a little introverted and self-abased.

487
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,440
and very careful.

488
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,680
That kind of personality.

489
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,760
This may be the influence

490
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,720
from my childhood.

491
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,920
I'm just relaxed and lively.

492
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,120
Yes, totally.

493
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,520
When my sister and I were adults,

494
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
my parents were strict with us.

495
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,520
Maybe they think girls

496
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,880
For example, when you dress up,

497
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,160
too exaggerated.

498
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,560
When will you get home

499
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,240
before midnight.

500
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,200
These basic principles

501
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,960
will teach us.

502
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,640
When we grow up,

503
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,920
she's very tolerant and respectful

504
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,040
very high.

505
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,960
All this time, the four of us

506
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,280
whether one of us feels uncomfortable

507
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,360
or if there's a problem today,

508
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,880
we can talk directly.

509
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,280
Good.

510
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,080
including my dad and my mom.

511
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,720
is like that.

512
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
If he is not satisfied with

513
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,360
your behavior,

514
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,920
he would call me directly.

515
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,480
to tell you.

516
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,680
When you hear it,

517
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,320
you'll get rid of it right away.

518
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,560
and let it go.

519
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,240
It's easier.

520
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,280
Will I compare you to your brothers?

521
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Not at all.

522
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,200
My parents always told us

523
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,240
you two have different personalities

524
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,320
You're good at different things.

525
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,480
The atmosphere is great.

526
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,160
Yes, very healthy.

527
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,120
I feel a little...

528
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,840
I don't know why.

529
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,960
Washing dishes in groups

530
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,360
Wasn't it always me?

531
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,920
But Harry has changed.

532
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,680
Harry is washing dishes with Tata.

533
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,720
This morning,

534
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,920
I sat here.

535
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,800
The map on the right.

536
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,960
Esther is on the left.

537
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,920
I don't know

538
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,480
After chatting,

539
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
I'll become one of them.

540
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,400
I won't be in this group.

541
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,480
And now,

542
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,920
I don't know what's going on.

543
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,760
I can do it.

544
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,560
Who will do the dishes today?

545
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,240
Yes.

546
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,160
I'll wash it.

547
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,120
Xinxin and I

548
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,440
kicked me out naturally?

549
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,200
He wants to protect you.

550
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,000
No.

551
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,280
So do you know how I feel?

552
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,480
I'm taking turns.

553
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,040
Today,

554
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,320
Master of Serving Water.

555
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,520
Master of Serving Water. Not bad.

556
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,240
Good job.

557
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,720
No.

558
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,760
This is different.

559
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,920
This water is warm water

560
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,040
and the other is cold water.

561
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,320
Actually, I'm a little hurt inside.

562
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,240
Because I think my picture

563
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,800
he didn't say anything.

564
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,120
Okay, I'll change my partner.

565
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,040
I don't think we need to ask Xiao Ling.

566
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,960
It depends on her opinion.

567
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
He just changed it.

568
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,840
What did you send today?

569
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,360
I sent him

570
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,240
I know his family story.

571
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,040
I admire him and Hua

572
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
who can become who they are now.

573
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,080
and said I got to know him more.

574
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,480
He sent me

575
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,640
he wanted me to be happy and be myself.

576
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,280
Don't care too much about family.

577
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,880
It's just family pressure

578
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,880
I can express

579
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,640
my love for my brother.

580
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,320
Because I talked about

581
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,960
how to get along with brothers.

582
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,880
I said we don't usually

583
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,200
very clingy and greasy.

584
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,680
I don't send messages every day.

585
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,440
Yes, so he sent it.

586
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,320
You should be able to see it.

587
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,800
What do you think of Harry?

588
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,320
As you know,

589
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,200
after these two days,

590
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,600
he must be nice.

591
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,600
Tell us his shortcomings.

592
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,360
Short?

593
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,560
It's not like there's no shortcomings.

594
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,920
I don't think

595
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,720
it's just our birthday.

596
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,640
Right?

597
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,760
Very attentive.

598
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,480
Yes.

599
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,400
Don't you think

600
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,720
he changes me fast?

601
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,640
You mean that?

602
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Right?

603
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,560
Find out. Please, fake brother.

604
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,600
He will tell you the truth.

605
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,800
You're not my brother anymore.

606
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,440
He might not be my brother.

607
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,800
He might tell you the truth.

608
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,560
If we are rivals in love,

609
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,080
I pursue you at the same time?

610
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't know.

611
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,720
Actually, I've asked him

612
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,680
asked him face to face.

613
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,440
What did he say?

614
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,520
He said at first,

615
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,400
I grew up in his aesthetic point.

616
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,880
But what he said

617
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,480
doesn't make sense.

618
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,800
Yes, because he didn't send me

619
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,760
to me that night.

620
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,880
He sent it to Xinxin.

621
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,560
I know it's Xinxin who made the choice the next day.

622
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,280
Yes.

623
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,560
What did he think

624
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
what you did,

625
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,800
That's why he changed.

626
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,720
His change is

627
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
our Cupid date.

628
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,560
After that,

629
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,920
he thought we had a good chat.

630
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,680
It makes sense.

631
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,080
It does make sense.

632
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
But I think this should be

633
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,960
step by step.

634
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,520
You think he changed too fast.

635
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,760
He said the first time he saw me,

636
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,440
he said

637
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,600
he didn't like girls with short hair.

638
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,120
He said he never met girls with short hair.

639
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,040
Maybe

640
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,560
four boys came out for dinner.

641
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,360
Do you remember that time?

642
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,080
when everyone wanted to see you?

643
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,200
He said maybe his appearance

644
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,000
of his appearance.

645
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,600
He told me the same thing.

646
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,440
Did you tell your brother about this?

647
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,600
Of course.

648
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,760
What does he mean?

649
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,920
He was also wondering

650
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,360
why he changed so much.

651
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,360
He doesn't understand

652
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,000
where he suddenly got stabbed.

653
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,520
So I just don't understand

654
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,760
why he changed so much.

655
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,360
I think

656
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,240
still care about this relationship,

657
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,040
I think he's already...

658
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,360
We still have time.

659
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,240
Let's keep an eye on him.

660
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,840
At least at this stage, he...

661
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,480
Yes, it's undeniable that

662
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,080
he really cares about me.

663
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,040
I can't figure it out.

664
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Sometimes,

665
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,240
So I think

666
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,160
being too smart is not a good thing.

667
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,160
You think too much.

668
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,240
What do you think?

669
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,800
You think too much.

670
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,560
Little head.

671
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,240
Let's go.

672
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,160
Take a rest upstairs.

673
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,440
He Wenxin was fat when she was young.

674
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,320
I hoped she was a girl.

675
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,280
When I was born,

676
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
I was happy to say I was a girl.

677
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,440
They talk about everything.

678
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,640
After they have a boyfriend,

679
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,360
they have a girlfriend.

680
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,040
They will tell each other

681
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,920
Only the two of them know.

682
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,360
We don't know.

683
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,360
I'll call my mom.

684
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,640
I couldn't get through.

685
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,120
Because he called my phone in Guangzhou,

686
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,000
I have to add a zero to get through.

687
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,880
My mom didn't tell her that zero.

688
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,400
my love for him

689
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,960
to the child.

690
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,160
Actually, when the child is excellent,

691
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,760
I thought it was the joy.

692
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,120
I want to share it with others.

693
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,240
But no one shared it.

694
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,560
Why are you looking at me?

695
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,280
Can't I?

696
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,880
No.

697
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,960
You're so petty.

698
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,000
Your eyes are full of red blood.

699
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,160
Are you that tired?

700
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,720
I'm crying.

701
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,280
The contact lenses are too dry.

702
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
Hello, I'm Su Ziyi.

703
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,480
He is my brother,

704
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,240
Su Zihao.

705
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,560
I'm not used to it.

706
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
He suddenly said his name.

707
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,480
OK, Zihao.

708
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,600
I have something for you.

709
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,520
What is it?

710
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,160
When you fix my makeup,

711
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,240
your makeup is almost gone.

712
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,360
Thank you.

713
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,320
What is this?

714
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,080
A concealer.

715
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,240
The lack of Susu

716
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,400
is the biggest problem in my life.

717
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,560
Yes.

718
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,680
He sent me this saying he hoped

719
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,920
to be myself happily.

720
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,360
Don't care too much about your family.

721
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,240
the pressure in the family.

722
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,200
and say I can express

723
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,040
my love for my brother.

724
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,880
Neither am I.

725
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,040
Actually, I want to ask

726
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,000
Do you have a brother or a sister?

727
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,040
Sister.

728
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,920
And the youngest one.

729
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,040
Little brother.

730
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,840
Two men and two girls.

731
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,360
Yes.

732
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,240
What?

733
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,120
You're the closest to Tom, right?

734
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,840
I think I'm the closest to my sister.

735
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,400
What are you doing?

736
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,480
What expression?

737
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,360
What was your name again?

738
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,200
InFP.

739
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,840
Yes.

740
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,200
Why aren't you J?

741
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,360
I'm not J.

742
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,680
Do I look like J?

743
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,920
I'm very random.

744
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,800
You are very J-type.

745
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,600
I'm really J-type.

746
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,880
And I think something

747
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,320
is out of my control.

748
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,840
I get annoyed and annoyed.

749
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
You wear this?

750
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,200
No, of course not.

751
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,640
What about you?

752
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,280
This one.

753
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,680
You're really relaxed.

754
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,600
It's my sister's.

755
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,480
Why are you wearing this?

756
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,240
It suits you.

757
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,720
No, my sister asked me to wear it.

758
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,480
I'm just obedient.

759
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,600
I can only say

760
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,760
Who doesn't like obedient younger brothers?

761
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,480
I wish the soup was as obedient as you.

762
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,000
Not you and soup.

763
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,480
How often do you text me?

764
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,440
If

765
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
Our school is close to each other.

766
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,600
If we come out for dinner

767
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,320
send it two or three times a month.

768
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,960
I don't contact him often.

769
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,640
Not much.

770
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,960
But when I face the soup,

771
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,880
I have a lot to say

772
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,520
We don't usually meet or chat.

773
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,360
That's because you don't talk to each other

774
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,400
so you talk a lot when you meet.

775
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,960
The way I get along with him

776
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,760
is like a passerby A. A passerby B.

777
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,000
So annoying.

778
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,160
What?

779
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,960
Go. Do you still have internal consumption?

780
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,000
Me?

781
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,360
But I don't perform well, I think.

782
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,120
If I don't perform, who will?

783
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,400
I just want...

784
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,120
Forget it if you don't understand.

785
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,960
Think about it later.

786
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,560
I like when I have internal consumption.

787
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,080
for a walk.

788
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,440
Sit there when you're tired.

789
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,600
So you don't seem to have internal consumption.

790
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,360
Half of your energy?

791
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,880
Me?

792
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,920
And I won't say my emotions

793
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,520
my emotions.

794
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,760
I don't want to say it but I can't.

795
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,800
I can't express it even if I want to.

796
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,560
I don't think I've seen you before.

797
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,600
negative expression on your face.

798
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,360
Do you?

799
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,120
I think

800
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,680
I don't think I've shown it.

801
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,600
Did you see it?

802
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,120
It's possible to be alone.

803
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,680
I don't think so.

804
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,160
alone.

805
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,320
like a dummy.

806
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,640
Who do you think

807
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,320
negative emotions except soup?

808
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,480
Except your roommate and soup.

809
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,640
predict your prediction.

810
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,720
The soup is so petty.

811
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,080
The soup is really as small

812
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,040
What's so small?

813
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,680
Mind.

814
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,720
You don't understand.

815
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,720
I saw him and my childhood shadow.

816
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:54,840
But he...

817
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,880
Tom got angry.

818
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,840
I got angry the next day.

819
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,760
You know I lost that day.

820
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,920
He came to my bed

821
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,200
he came over on my bed.

822
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,080
Harry.

823
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,520
What?

824
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,160
You didn't know?

825
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,720
He hit me eight times after he finished.

826
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,400
I've done so much for this relationship.

827
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,440
You've endured what you shouldn't have at your age.

828
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,840
Who knows?

829
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,600
It's like an old man who guides children.

830
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,120
Really little old man

831
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,960
Little old man.

832
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
It matches your MBTI.

833
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,240
So funny.

834
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,000
Have you helped

835
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,520
in your life

836
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,760
to mediate such emotional conflicts?

837
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,560
No.

838
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,240
I never get involved in other people's feelings.

839
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,400
I always get involved.

840
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,840
I actually have many lovers around me.

841
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
When they fall in love,

842
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,760
he can't see many things clearly.

843
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,240
But when my friends

844
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,520
is going to lose control,

845
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,320
I must drag him back.

846
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,080
Because I will observe

847
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,200
their interactions.

848
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,000
In my opinion,

849
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,680
I don't want them to be together

850
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,760
or force them to separate.

851
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,200
I think there's something wrong with you.

852
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,440
You have to make it clear.

853
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,480
Even if you make it clear,

854
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,240
you don't think it's appropriate.

855
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,800
It's your business

856
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,880
That's your business.

857
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,560
I won't stop him.

858
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,240
But I don't want him

859
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,360
think about it later.

860
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,080
I regret it.

861
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,800
That's how I feel.

862
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,120
If I want to end a relationship,

863
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,040
I must end it clearly.

864
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,800
Or I'll regret it when I think about it.

865
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,880
and leave some room for myself.

866
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,680
That's worse.

867
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,880
I was involved in other people's feelings.

868
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,320
It's my brother's love.

869
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,360
Your brother's story.

870
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,080
Because my brother and my sister-in-law

871
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,200
They got married very quickly,

872
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,600
so they didn't get along well.

873
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,560
We always quarrel.

874
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,880
Every time you came to complain to me,

875
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,360
I'll say it's your problem.

876
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,560
It's definitely your problem.

877
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,440
I kept analyzing.

878
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,280
Look at you.

879
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,440
I watched you grow up.

880
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,000
I always think

881
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,280
you are not a good person.

882
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,400
I love their way of communication.

883
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,680
My brother always comes.

884
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,040
He came to me to complain about his marriage.

885
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,920
I blamed him.

886
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,000
The effect is very obvious now.

887
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,320
He stopped looking for me.

888
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,160
The effect is very obvious.

889
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,600
The more you do this, the more he can't differentiate.

890
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,040
Indeed, every time they talk to me,

891
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,480
Because now

892
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,080
getting closer.

893
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,000
Master.

894
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,640
Applause for you.

895
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,600
I was feeling a question.

896
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,840
It's like I've been facing

897
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,560
or questions,

898
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,680
we say we should let our hearts answer.

899
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,440
But sometimes it's hard to think about it

900
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,000
Because your heart will get different information.

901
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,240
Like a line

902
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,360
like a thread.

903
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,920
How capable do you have

904
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,640
to open these threads slowly

905
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,560
and show your heart.

906
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,800
Sometimes you want it to hide behind you.

907
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,960
because you're afraid it'll get hurt.

908
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,480
you'll move forward.

909
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,360
But you don't know

910
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,840
what will happen to it.

911
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,440
So for every master of the heart,

912
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,280
is moving forward.

913
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,080
They seem to be firing themselves

914
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,880
and growing up.

915
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,960
This is a wonderful process.

916
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,360
I really hope all the guests

917
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,440
can

918
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,920
in such a

919
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,000
Not only did you gain love,

920
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,640
but also

921
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,320
a more real and complete self.

922
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,960
Yes.

923
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,000
In fact, we keep checking

924
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,720
to confirm our relationship with each other.

925
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,480
is also a process of knowing yourself.

926
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,920
So I hope when you are timid and hesitant,

927
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,160
when you are timid and hesitant.

928
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,200
step forward.

929
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,400
Try again.

930
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,239
Let's look forward to the next episode.

931
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,480
Let's sing "Love Sisters".

932
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,679
Let love double.

933
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,000
Thank you.

934
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,440
Let's get straight to the point.

935
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,199
I'm the one being treated differently.

936
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,159
Why should I change myself

937
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,000
because of this?

938
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,639
I can't do it.

939
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,679
You don't need to stress.

940
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,679
Do you want to hear me out?

941
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,440
I can't accept this explanation.

942
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,280
But what you said and did

943
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,040
are different.

944
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,440
No.

945
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,760
I didn't say that.

946
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,040
Yes.

947
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,560
Make it clear.

948
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,199
Okay.

949
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:36,679
I'm sorry.

950
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,440
I apologize for this.

951
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,440
Just say it if you want to.

952
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,719
It doesn't matter if you don't want to.

953
