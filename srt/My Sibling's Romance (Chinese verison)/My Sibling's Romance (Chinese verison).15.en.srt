1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
A small party.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,920
It feels like we'll have some wild wine right away.

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,960
It's as fluffy as a skull. It can breathe.

7
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,480
Post it on Weibo. Participant #Love & Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game You'll get a surprise benefit.

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,560
Love Siblings.

9
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,680
Double love!

10
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,320
Brothers intervene in love.

11
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,000
(Love Sisters)

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,080
This show is called "Little Wild Wine",

13
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,000
I feel there will be a fruit immediately.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,759
exclusively sponsored.

15
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,400
This show is

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
The fluffy shampoo

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,560
(of the fluffy and fluffy)

18
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,440
and sponsored it.

19
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,840
Let's welcome

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,280
Today we also want to welcome

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,920
the new member

22
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,280
Huang Hongfan.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,039
Hello, everyone

24
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,360
Hello, everyone.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm singer Huang Hongfan.

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,640
I'm very happy to be here today

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,520
to join us

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,640
We're a family member

29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,880
Why is it short?

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,040
No, you have to stay.

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
I want to stay too.

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,520
But I'm afraid that people won't welcome me.

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,800
No way.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,840
A warm hug.

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,079
Hwang Ja-Hongfan tied up the first three episodes, right?

36
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,079
Yes, I remember it all.

37
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,960
I can't wait

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,160
to join our family

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,400
to feel the atmosphere.

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,040
Welcome.

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,160
Welcome Huang Hongfan.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,800
Last week we actually finished

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,840
with the members of the cabin last week.

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,160
It seems like a peaceful time

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
We're all starting to eat.

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,360
But now our new boys and girls

47
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,079
Tata and Terri

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,400
the ceiling.

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,840
Which boy will Tata choose

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,320
to go back to the house with her?

51
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,280
Where does Tae-seo's heart point to?

52
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,040
Yes, I'm looking forward to it too.

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,640
I don't know how they'll deal with it.

54
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,120
They said we should compete fairly.

55
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,600
Come on.

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,000
Next,

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,040
let's move on to the update of this episode.

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,280
Am I your first choice?

59
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,079
Entering the house with her

60
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,680
Who will Tata choose?

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,480
I think she'll choose Harry.

62
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,240
She's with Harry.

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,360
The first time boys chatted in the house

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,920
A map is missing.

65
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,560
Yes, there's a map missing. I can't help it.

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,640
Next time, we'll add him.

67
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,280
I'll fix it for him.

68
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,200
Put a cartoon character together.

69
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,520
Fix the big ear map for him.

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,200
I think we missed a lot of pictures.

71
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,840
Yes.

72
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,640
It'll be fun tonight.

73
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,520
When do you think his brothers will show up?

74
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,760
I think they will.

75
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,840
How did you know it was his brother?

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,360
I don't think there's more than ten.

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,600
I know it's impossible.

78
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,720
but his brothers may not be the ones who show up.

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,079
Maybe he's already here.

80
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,960
Yes, I think his brother is Xiaoling.

81
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,960
This one.

82
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,720
Very funny.

83
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,760
That's the smartest idea.

84
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,840
Right?

85
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,280
I just think there's Terri.

86
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm Harry. He's Tarri.

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,600
It's very...

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,000
both of us are confident.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,280
I know his brother is you.

90
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,120
I see.

91
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,440
You two are brothers.

92
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:15,840
You're back.

93
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,160
What's up? You look so happy.

94
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,480
What are you talking about?

95
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,760
A little secret I don't know.

96
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,920
How is it?

97
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Done.

98
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,320
Right?

99
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,160
Much more handsome.

100
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
I like it.

101
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,840
Their hairstyles are totally different.

102
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,800
The four of them are so cute.

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,880
Everyone went to meet one.

104
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,080
We all know what to do.

105
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,360
Yes.

106
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,080
We can't tell each other yet.

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,560
Yes.

108
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,840
Tata chose to go back to the house with Terri.

109
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,480
Other boys can go back on their own.

110
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,200
Why are you laughing?

111
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,680
Look at them.

112
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
Everyone got it.

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,040
Let's go.

114
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
I chose Terri to accompany her back to the house.

115
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,240
Wouldn't that make you think

116
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,360
they are brothers?

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
Yes, follow me home.

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,760
I don't know who Xiaoling is interested in.

119
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,160
No.

120
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,080
She doesn't seem

121
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,240
It's hard for her to express her feelings.

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,920
Yes.

123
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,000
You're back.

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,240
Thank you. Hurry up.

125
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280
Have you eaten?

126
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,440
I'm a little hungry. Tell me the truth.

127
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,360
I'm a busy man.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,280
Good evening.

129
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,800
Wait.

130
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,040
What's wrong?

131
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Did you notice

132
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,880
I just saw

133
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,000
Why is there an extra dressing table?

134
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,159
Take a look.

135
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,920
No way

136
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,280
Really.

137
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,840
I just saw

138
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,520
Xinxin.

139
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
Come here.

140
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,400
What's wrong?

141
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,200
Come on.

142
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Girls don't know Tata is here yet.

143
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,680
right?

144
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,440
Yes.

145
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,720
Only boys know.

146
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,040
You startled me.

147
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,480
Look up

148
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,120
There's a bed.

149
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,920
One more bed.

150
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,840
So there should be a pair

151
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,320
New brothers are coming.

152
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,520
So scary.

153
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,160
Suddenly there's an extra bed.

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,680
A dresser.

155
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,720
I was a little flustered.

156
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,440
But it's okay.

157
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,840
I'm still curious

158
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,040
about this female guest.

159
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,720
So scary.

160
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,960
The crew is a bit scary, right?

161
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,280
Yes.

162
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,920
Put it in quietly.

163
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,960
without telling anyone.

164
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,040
Do you think girls will come together?

165
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,000
Today?

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
I guess tonight...

167
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,480
So we don't need to guess

168
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,880
don't have to guess.

169
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,720
It could be a split.

170
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,200
Yes.

171
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,360
Maybe you all got it wrong.

172
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,320
This is scary.

173
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,880
Yes.

174
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,120
They're all wrong.

175
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,200
So the boys

176
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,720
to have dinner.

177
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,760
to meet the new female guest during dinner.

178
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,320
I guess

179
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,720
and vote for the new female guests.

180
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,680
Living in such an environment

181
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,160
is too complicated.

182
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,640
The new male guest is your type.

183
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,480
I feel...

184
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,000
I...

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,760
She said she likes bosses.

186
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,560
He's not a boss at all.

187
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,880
Yes, but I think when he came in,

188
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
I saw something in your eyes.

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
I think

190
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,080
you've met him.

191
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,240
I haven't seen him yet.

192
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,160
You'll see him soon. I'll look at you.

193
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,480
My first reaction was

194
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,680
to imagine what he would look like.

195
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,240
I want to meet him.

196
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,400
I think

197
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,640
six siblings.

198
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,320
It's only five pairs now.

199
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,200
Do you think there's another pair?

200
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
I think it's possible.

201
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,400
I don't think they look alike.

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,520
They look alike.

203
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,800
Yes.

204
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,600
But they are both models.

205
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,640
It's obvious.

206
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,159
Do you think you and your brother are alike?

207
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,240
Who is my brother?

208
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,400
Still hiding it?

209
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,360
Listen.

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,400
They look very elegant.

211
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,960
They have different styles.

212
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,560
No, that girl is really elegant.

213
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,400
Yes, it's obvious what she does.

214
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,400
But they have different facial features.

215
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,000
Look at their faces.

216
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,280
I think Harry and Xinxin are going to end.

217
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,000
Really?

218
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,360
It's over before we're together.

219
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,640
Everyone is interested in the new ones.

220
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,280
Harry

221
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,480
Let's go.

222
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Let's go straight into the room.

223
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
Let's go.

224
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,960
Why are you laughing?

225
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,039
Yes, why are you laughing?

226
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm speechless.

227
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,440
Don't laugh.

228
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,640
Hold it back.

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,560
Stop.

230
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,560
You're back.

231
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,280
Really?

232
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,920
Let's go.

233
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,320
They live in

234
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,640
like iPartment.

235
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,200
Are you going to eat?

236
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes, we are.

237
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Look, Xin comes to Harry now.

238
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,760
Did you go upstairs?

239
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,960
Look, physical contact

240
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
How close are they?

241
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,840
They are very tense together.

242
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,160
Take a look.

243
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,120
Good evening.

244
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,360
Good evening.

245
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,880
Just the three of you?

246
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,960
Yes.

247
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
I lost it.

248
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
What happened?

249
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,080
There's a big show today.

250
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,160
Hurry up.

251
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,880
Look.

252
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,640
There's a big show.

253
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,360
You have me.

254
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,080
Do you know how wonderful we are?

255
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,040
You have a big show.

256
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,120
How wonderful are you?

257
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
We were so funny today.

258
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,920
You met a girl?

259
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,280
Did you meet the new female guests?

260
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,040
I'm not telling you.

261
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,360
We met.

262
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
What are you doing?

263
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,320
Why can't I say you can go and see it?

264
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,360
I saw him.

265
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,520
We have an extra room.

266
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes, there's one more table in their room.

267
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Not yet.

268
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,320
We should add it.

269
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,440
Am I good?

270
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,120
You two...

271
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,160
Where do you think their new guest lives?

272
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Probably your room.

273
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,440
It can't be our room.

274
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,720
Our room is full.

275
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,200
We can put a bed together.

276
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,080
It becomes a little crowded.

277
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,080
So two

278
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,400
Three.

279
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,720
Your pressure is coming.

280
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,600
I'm looking forward to it.

281
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,200
The first job

282
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,760
It's the same as the second job

283
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
But she's not that tall.

284
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,360
Not as tall as you.

285
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:30,960
Both.

286
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,400
I told you they would have dinner with girls.

287
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,960
Not with girls.

288
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,320
I didn't eat with a girl.

289
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,080
The four of us ate together.

290
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,880
How do you know that girl?

291
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,960
A soul question.

292
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,440
And you know it's not that tall.

293
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,800
Not as tall as Xiao Ling.

294
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,880
You must have seen her.

295
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,280
Who says I'm not as tall as her?

296
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,640
Why are you laughing?

297
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,720
What are you laughing at?

298
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,960
You guys are so mean.

299
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,440
Really.

300
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
Why can't I say it?

301
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,360
Coming.

302
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,880
We're at the house.

303
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,400
Both of them have different music.

304
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,240
These two trench coats.

305
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,760
Idol drama.

306
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,040
Rules of check-in.

307
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,400
Okay, let's go.

308
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,960
Okay.

309
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Press the bell. The white one.

310
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,960
Someone is knocking.

311
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,680
Hurry up.

312
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,480
Don't keep us waiting.

313
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,400
He's here.

314
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,160
Good evening.

315
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,480
Girls must feel a little complicated.

316
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,280
Good evening.

317
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,560
Because I've never seen a girl before

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,800
Yes, none of them.

319
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
She has short hair.

320
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,240
The other girls

321
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,120
either have long hair like me,

322
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,160
or like flowers and Xinxin.

323
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,440
like flowers and Xinxin.

324
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,520
And she has only short hair.

325
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,600
So I think the style is different.

326
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,680
He's tall too.

327
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,000
I guess she's a model.

328
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,240
The first impression is a quiet girl.

329
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,120
She must be a model.

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't say it.

331
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,640
The atmosphere is very Japanese.

332
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,040
Why don't we take the box up first?

333
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Sure.

334
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,240
Let me see if it's heavy.

335
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,160
A little heavy.

336
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Come on.

337
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,360
So active.

338
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
Every day I eat

339
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,720
Hard.

340
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,040
Thank you.

341
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,320
It's a bit heavy.

342
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,680
We didn't know

343
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,560
what's on our attic.

344
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,520
It turns out to be your bed.

345
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,240
I'll go upstairs and take a look.

346
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,960
Is someone here again?

347
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,760
Again?

348
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,560
Is Tu back?

349
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,400
Yes, the map hasn't come back yet.

350
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,920
Map?

351
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,400
I forgot.

352
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,800
No.

353
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
We have a mission.

354
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,760
Mission?

355
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
To Terri and Tata.

356
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,360
Welcome to the lovers' house.

357
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,840
You'll have a Cupid date.

358
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
Please think carefully.

359
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,160
The person you want to date

360
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,400
and write down the date content on the card.

361
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,240
Before sleeping,

362
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,560
to their dates.

363
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,040
It's like replenishing each of them.

364
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,440
Yes.

365
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,360
Guess.

366
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,120
Now?

367
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,800
I'll write it tonight.

368
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
Right. Before sleeping,

369
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,440
before sleeping.

370
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,320
There's one more person.

371
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,640
Yes.

372
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,520
It's okay. Take your time. Take your time.

373
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,920
You can try your best.

374
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,640
to find out who her brother is.

375
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,000
with some connections and means.

376
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,680
Is it that hard to guess?

377
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,080
It's not hard to guess.

378
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,120
I think I've figured it out.

379
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Really? Why does it feel so hard?

380
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,080
I can see a pair now.

381
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,760
Just one pair.

382
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,280
I can see that pair of scores.

383
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,040
Xiao Ling and soup.

384
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,520
You can ask others secretly.

385
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,400
I won't.

386
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,440
We won't say it.

387
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
Right.

388
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,160
It's a secret.

389
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,240
We have to let you experience

390
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,720
what we experienced on the first day.

391
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,640
If you give it to the wrong person,

392
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,280
I'll go on that date too.

393
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,160
Tata.

394
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,320
I knew who you would write to.

395
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,560
I think I've guessed it too.

396
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,120
What's wrong with me?

397
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,800
I gave myself away.

398
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
So scary.

399
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
I think he's pretending to be siblings.

400
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,160
Tu is back.

401
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,080
Tu, you're back.

402
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,400
Tu.

403
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,600
Tu, you...

404
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,760
It's been so long.

405
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,320
You...

406
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,480
What happened?

407
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,000
Something happened.

408
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,960
Come on. We have new friends.

409
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,360
Hurry up.

410
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,200
Okay, let's go.

411
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,320
I don't even want to wear my shoes.

412
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
Hurry up, Tu.

413
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,240
Hello.

414
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,080
You'll be surprised

415
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,120
You'll be surprised.

416
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,920
Really?

417
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,760
Hello

418
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,800
Two new friends.

419
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,560
Hello.

420
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:34,880
I'm back.

421
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,240
I cut my hair.

422
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,160
I found it too.

423
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,520
Can you tell?

424
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,360
It's obvious.

425
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,760
Okay.

426
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,320
I edited it.

427
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,600
Mangkud Head

428
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,360
Is this a compliment?

429
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,680
When I came back,

430
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,200
I found that

431
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,840
in the house.

432
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,600
It makes me feel this situation

433
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,160
is getting interesting.

434
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,400
He's done.

435
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Yes.

436
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Let me introduce myself.

437
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,600
My name is Tu.

438
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,640
The map with big ears.

439
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,040
The first impression of the picture

440
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,920
I think he looks good.

441
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,120
but he has good taste.

442
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,200
When I see a simple guy,

443
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,880
Will you arrive in the afternoon or at night?

444
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,320
I arrived in the afternoon.

445
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
I arrived at night.

446
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,000
My impression of the picture is the sunshine.

447
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,040
What a sunny boy.

448
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,880
He's full of energy.

449
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm sure he likes her type.

450
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,600
They have a strong sense of siblings.

451
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,600
They have to act.

452
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,160
Yes.

453
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,520
How?

454
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,160
I don't know.

455
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,320
Did you guess it?

456
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,120
My mind is empty.

457
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,400
I think

458
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,520
I guessed the pair.

459
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,400
Nothing else was obvious.

460
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,800
Yes.

461
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,200
Since the rookie has moved in,

462
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,880
tonight,

463
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,000
the siblings' house will be open to all members.

464
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,800
and give them a chance to communicate quickly.

465
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,880
Yes.

466
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,240
Make a video call.

467
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,000
You can call her.

468
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
I want to see what her brother looks like.

469
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,040
Her brother is not on camera.

470
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,880
My name is Tata.

471
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,800
I like taking photos.

472
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,680
I like pets.

473
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,640
I like walking dogs.

474
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,080
and watch movies.

475
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,760
When I was a sophomore,

476
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,200
my brothers took me into the industry

477
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,520
and started to be a model.

478
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,800
My brother is

479
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,080
a cheerful boy.

480
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,600
So handsome.

481
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,640
Her brother and Tae-seo are even alike.

482
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:02,880
I think...

483
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,680
Yeah.

484
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,200
She's the best.

485
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
I'm three years older than her.

486
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,119
I happened to see a photo.

487
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,920
when I was five years old

488
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,160
with my family when I was five.

489
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,400
She was wearing sunglasses.

490
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,200
and made a cute pose.

491
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,319
That was the first time I realized

492
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,319
I had a sister.

493
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,960
She has big eyes since she was young.

494
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,640
She's always been like this.

495
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,480
She's so cute.

496
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,680
We planned to get the second child.

497
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,960
I told her when we got married.

498
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,040
I said it'd be best to have two children.

499
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,480
Whether it's two daughters

500
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,880
Both sons and two children

501
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,080
Because when she gives birth to a daughter,

502
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,640
many people told her not to give birth.

503
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,520
I said no.

504
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,320
I want to give birth now.

505
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,520
The two of them are separated.

506
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,920
They are slightly shorter.

507
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,880
Her accent is from Sichuan. Her father is...

508
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,240
So cute.

509
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,320
and have two children.

510
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,960
They both have friends

511
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,880
That's how you consider giving birth to two children.

512
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,840
Children can be

513
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,480
One daughter and one child.

514
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,880
It's good to have both children, right?

515
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,440
A happy family

516
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,920
A happy family

517
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,160
I've liked my sister since I was a kid.

518
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,080
When I first saw her,

519
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
touch her feet.

520
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,760
Kiss her face.

521
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,400
It's still warm.

522
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,120
Seeing this scene,

523
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,880
my daughter is a very beautiful

524
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,600
and adorable little girl.

525
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
She's really a good girl.

526
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,000
In the eyes of others,

527
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,920
they are all very polite.

528
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,400
From elementary school to college

529
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,920
from elementary school to college.

530
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,280
I worked hard.

531
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,720
My family said

532
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,160
they are the best dish

533
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
The best dish.

534
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,760
The most beautiful dish.

535
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,800
That's what I mean

536
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
We fought a lot when we were kids.

537
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,760
Yes.

538
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,800
We had fun.

539
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,560
I didn't

540
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,080
to be a brother.

541
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,400
After she graduated,

542
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,040
we're in the same industry now.

543
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,000
Maybe I have more

544
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,840
like a brother.

545
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,160
When you grow up and grow up,

546
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,360
You know how important he is.

547
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,320
I was at home with him when I was young.

548
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,680
I had a

549
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,280
Mickey watch.

550
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,800
He pretended to take a look.

551
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,600
But he took out Mickey

552
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,480
on my watch.

553
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,680
She cried at home

554
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,880
Then he told his mom to come over

555
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,280
It was memorable.

556
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,920
Until now,

557
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,640
my Mickey watch.

558
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,800
I think you did it on purpose.

559
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,240
Because I feel that he ruined

560
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,560
was ruined by him.

561
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,160
My hands are so weak.

562
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,560
Maybe I have the feeling of being mean.

563
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,320
to tease her.

564
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,200
But I think the brothers

565
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,080
fight with each other,

566
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,520
They will be closer in the future.

567
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,800
Yes.

568
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,000
She's always been a good student.

569
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,440
she's actually a good student.

570
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,280
I've been dancing

571
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,960
in class.

572
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,400
I may be worried

573
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,680
my parents worry about me

574
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,600
more than her.

575
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,320
They don't worry about my study.

576
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,360
Since I was young,

577
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,960
watch TV and play phone.

578
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,000
And sometimes

579
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,960
I'd peel the door quietly.

580
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,560
I used to be the role.

581
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
I saw him there secretly.

582
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
or there.

583
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,760
or playing with something.

584
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
or play with your phone.

585
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,600
I'll snitch.

586
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,120
My sister often complained to us.

587
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,320
The elder brother bullied her.

588
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,720
That's it.

589
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,760
But we spoil our sister

590
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,000
more.

591
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,680
For example,

592
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,040
we have a room in different rooms.

593
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,760
She reserved the room first

594
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,120
Then her son will choose the rest.

595
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
A room that's not good enough

596
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,720
But we'll give her

597
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,680
and give her something better.

598
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,040
I usually nag a lot of kids.

599
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,880
She's not afraid of me.

600
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,160
What her father said at the critical moment,

601
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,960
they are afraid.

602
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,640
I just corrected the big direction.

603
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,080
But when her dad talks too much,

604
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,160
or talk too much,

605
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,480
I feel bad for my child.

606
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,640
I always help my child in the middle.

607
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,000
If a dad sings blushing,

608
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,880
Mom will sing the white face

609
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,600
Mom sings "Red Face".

610
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,560
I'll sing "White Face".

611
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,720
There's division of work.

612
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,600
Clear division of work.

613
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,960
She's a group pet.

614
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,840
She grew up with the care and care of her family.

615
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,560
She's kind and meticulous.

616
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,320
but a little slow.

617
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,640
I have

618
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,680
a strong personality.

619
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,680
My daughter is the one who got into college.

620
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,520
I couldn't help but

621
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
I hugged her and cried.

622
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,160
I was worried that she couldn't eat well or eat well.

623
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,080
I'm afraid she'll catch a cold when she sleeps.

624
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,040
I was worried.

625
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,800
When I get home,

626
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,240
I've been in a bad state for days.

627
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,320
I was thinking about

628
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,480
with my daughter.

629
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,320
I cried for days.

630
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,200
I can't stop

631
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,640
for a long time.

632
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,840
She would share

633
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,160
about her love life.

634
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,080
For example, let me be the judge

635
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,360
or analyze this.

636
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,560
I'll give her some advice

637
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,520
and some feedback.

638
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,240
I don't know if he'll listen or not.

639
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,200
He's very objective.

640
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,800
Who can listen to this?

641
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,840
Because she probably

642
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,280
she would tell me after the deal was done.

643
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,240
I didn't participate in the process.

644
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,080
Because she is

645
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,320
slow to warm up.

646
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
is among a group of people.

647
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,520
if she is willing to talk to someone,

648
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,360
or share,

649
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,920
Maybe she is interesting.

650
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,480
Yes.

651
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,000
Remember.

652
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,600
I hope she can become more independent and stronger.

653
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,720
and make the family less worried about her.

654
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,480
Yes.

655
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,360
Daughter, go to this show.

656
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,440
Dad and mom

657
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,560
are your strong support.

658
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,320
Come on.

659
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
I wish my daughter

660
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,000
find your love.

661
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,080
Come on.

662
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,600
How do you feel today?

663
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,800
How do I put it?

664
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Anyway, I got something unexpected today.

665
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,960
and every male guest

666
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,800
each male guest

667
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,760
I had ten minutes to chat with them.

668
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,000
I talked to everyone.

669
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,880
One-on-one?

670
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,280
One-on-one.

671
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,400
I was a little nervous.

672
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,480
But today a boy

673
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,400
was absent from work.

674
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,200
So we talked about four boys today.

675
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,360
I have a mission to write.

676
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,680
The Cupid invitation card is

677
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,760
I want to write it to the person I want to date.

678
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,040
But I have to

679
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,800
to his brothers.

680
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,320
and ask her brother.

681
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,320
But you know.

682
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,480
Yes, but I don't know who his brother is.

683
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,760
Now we have to guess.

684
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,800
The first boy is...

685
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,440
So she called

686
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,920
to ask her brother to guess her brother.

687
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
She has a cheerful personality.

688
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,600
We can find something to talk about.

689
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,040
The second one is...

690
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,880
can he take the initiative to find some topics?

691
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,200
Yes, yes. He is E.

692
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,920
The second one is I (introverted).

693
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,720
But I think

694
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,200
the E one is the most outgoing.

695
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,840
Because he talks the most.

696
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,440
When he said he was embarrassed,

697
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,160
he kept looking for something to say.

698
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,920
He kept talking.

699
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,280
And when I talked to him,

700
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,120
when talking to him.

701
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,680
So I chose

702
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,080
to keep talking to him for ten minutes.

703
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,840
Being with him

704
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,120
makes you more relaxed, right?

705
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,960
Because he wants to talk more.

706
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
The third one is

707
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,720
the atmosphere is more awkward.

708
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,160
Because

709
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,240
didn't break the ice, right?

710
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,520
Yes, I've been trying to find the topic.

711
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,840
And the soup said

712
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,880
I already had a crush on a girl.

713
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,680
Yes.

714
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,760
We can only talk for five seconds.

715
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,920
Then the world will stop.

716
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,560
Awkward.

717
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,440
The order of choosing people is

718
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,560
to see their childhood photos.

719
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,440
But the third boy

720
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,520
He has thick eyebrows and big eyes.

721
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,560
He looks good.

722
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,600
What about the second one?

723
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
The second one looks

724
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,960
Not bad.

725
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,400
The fourth boy is...

726
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,240
How should I put it?

727
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,600
I can talk to him.

728
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,640
But

729
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,960
I can't give him the invitation card yet.

730
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,600
I can't write it to him.

731
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,360
You'll know later.

732
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,480
I won't tell you.

733
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,800
Okay.

734
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
What do you mean by surprise?

735
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,760
Surprise.

736
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,680
That's what I can't tell you.

737
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,120
He didn't know Tarri was here.

738
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,960
She has a brother

739
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,760
without telling her brother.

740
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,080
and the other is a guy who works outside.

741
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,240
He just came back tonight.

742
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
We just met.

743
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,760
I don't know much about him.

744
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,880
It sounds like...

745
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,080
Based on my consideration,

746
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,600
I think

747
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,200
to someone who talks more.

748
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,840
And he can cook.

749
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,720
Cooking?

750
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,160
Yes, he can cook.

751
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,360
You feel relaxed when you're together.

752
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,680
It makes you relaxed.

753
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,840
Because the other person talks a lot.

754
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,040
Yes.

755
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,480
Did you write this invitation card

756
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,320
just an invitation for a date?

757
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,960
That's what it means.

758
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,360
Since it makes you comfortable,

759
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,840
you can.

760
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,080
But I don't know

761
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,000
who his brother is.

762
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,240
A girl...

763
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
This guy.

764
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,960
He was lying next to that girl.

765
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,440
I knew you two were close.

766
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,880
Is it your turn?

767
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,600
No.

768
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,760
Are you close?

769
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,600
We're brothers.

770
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,960
Did you announce it directly?

771
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,720
Didn't you guess it?

772
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,520
I'll tell you

773
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,320
I'll tell you.

774
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,040
Then they said they were siblings.

775
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,080
But I don't know

776
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,600
or lying to me.

777
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,720
It could be confusing.

778
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,240
Maybe

779
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,480
You did it on purpose, right?

780
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,200
Yes.

781
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,120
What if he didn't get it?

782
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,960
what's the use?

783
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,360
We still need to get in touch.

784
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,240
I have to guess.

785
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,200
But I just came here today.

786
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,560
I don't think I know

787
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,440
What do you think? Should I give it to this girl?

788
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,760
I don't know if she lied to me.

789
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,520
but I do feel that they are close.

790
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,080
They exposed their identities.

791
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,920
I think this kind of

792
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,360
is just a bluff.

793
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,840
I don't think they're siblings.

794
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,440
He's so smart.

795
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,080
You're amazing.

796
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,160
I don't have more information now.

797
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,080
I don't know who to give it to.

798
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,240
I can give it a try.

799
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,160
Okay.

800
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,760
Okay.

801
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,000
Okay, bye.

802
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,640
Okay, bye.

803
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,520
Ms. Lynne.

804
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,560
What is the way

805
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,760
in their family.

806
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,960
I can feel Tata.

807
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,800
Because she has been a group pet since she was a kid.

808
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,200
Right?

809
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,360
When a family like this grows up,

810
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
she has a strong sense of dependence.

811
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,320
So she listened to

812
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
she'll listen carefully

813
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,800
and discuss with him.

814
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,480
I have a strong sense of dependence

815
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,320
with my brother.

816
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,040
Harry is in a good mood.

817
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,320
Happy

818
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,240
I ran here.

819
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,840
Let's talk about the feelings.

820
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,920
It's obvious that I can guess it.

821
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,640
Because we're not

822
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,920
boys' chatting party today.

823
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,840
Then we asked

824
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,600
They said who had the best first impression.

825
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,920
Ask Terri.

826
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,880
Terri said Susu.

827
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,040
But he knows

828
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,160
what my name is.

829
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,560
What's her name?

830
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,480
I couldn't react and suddenly asked.

831
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,120
He did it on purpose.

832
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,000
Let me see.

833
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,200
Okay.

834
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,400
I think we should really forget it.

835
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
or

836
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,000
it can draw some attention.

837
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,400
I think he really forgot.

838
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Maybe.

839
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,080
Who did you send it to? Tell me.

840
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,480
Soup.

841
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,720
I knew it.

842
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,880
I also sent you the soup.

843
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,520
Yes.

844
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,680
He made me

845
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,960
sandwich.

846
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,280
It's okay.

847
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,720
As long as you have one,

848
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,520
as long as you have one.

849
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,320
I'm quite relieved.

850
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:43,760
But...

851
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,520
But now I know

852
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,280
we are roommates after all.

853
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,400
We do get along well.

854
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,080
It's obvious that

855
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,160
I think he gets along well with you.

856
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,480
Really.

857
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,520
I think it's because

858
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
with other girls.

859
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,000
No.

860
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
So he only chose me.

861
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,640
But for example,

862
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,880
there will be other dates

863
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,760
or blind choices.

864
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,560
If he had been in contact

865
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,280
for a whole day.

866
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
I didn't think he would give me

867
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,000
And I don't think

868
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,440
he would choose me.

869
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,400
Don't worry. I don't think he'll give it to others.

870
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
I think he will only give it to you.

871
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,280
You seem to have high expectations for him.

872
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,640
I do.

873
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm disappointed when I have expectations.

874
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,240
I think at least

875
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,400
the fifth, sixth and seventh days,

876
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,200
he will give you

877
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,600
and his sister.

878
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,000
Look how important these words are.

879
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,800
What did you send him?

880
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,440
I sent him yesterday...

881
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,800
Okay.

882
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,560
Next time

883
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,080
more piano songs next time?

884
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,840
You were not home at that time.

885
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,560
You went on a date.

886
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
and he was playing the piano downstairs.

887
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,840
Then I went down.

888
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,920
Let him play

889
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,800
my favorite song.

890
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,880
But he said it was too hard.

891
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,840
so he didn't play it.

892
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,200
I wanted to learn that when I came back.

893
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
but I couldn't.

894
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,600
Is it hard to learn?

895
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,280
No.

896
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,960
It doesn't look like this.

897
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,880
A little hint?

898
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,160
Yes, see if he will

899
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,640
my words.

900
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,680
Yes, let's see if he'll learn.

901
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,200
Yes.

902
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,960
But it's okay if you don't learn.

903
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,760
It's okay.

904
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,680
It doesn't matter.

905
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,360
It does.

906
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
I'm still a little disappointed.

907
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,680
Yes.

908
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,160
It's all a test.

909
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,120
Maybe I really can't.

910
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,800
It's only been a few days.

911
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,400
It's a bit demanding. I can only say

912
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,920
Really?

913
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,000
He can play.

914
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,240
He can play the piano.

915
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,760
That's true.

916
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,080
Let's see if he's willing to learn for you.

917
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,920
It has become her little expectation.

918
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,160
What did he write?

919
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,000
We can go out together sometime.

920
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,440
That's all.

921
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,520
A punctuation symbol and a small expression.

922
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,960
Do you know what else I came here?

923
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,920
What?

924
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,040
I had a good chat with you.

925
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,760
Who's talking to you?

926
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,920
I don't think it's Xiaoling.

927
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,720
It should be the new girl.

928
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,880
Very short.

929
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,080
The other one is Xinxin.

930
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,720
Yes.

931
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,920
Anyway, I think it's good.

932
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,760
You have another choice

933
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,000
Another choice.

934
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,360
They both got two votes.

935
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,920
But I don't think Tarri

936
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,240
pick his brother.

937
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,680
I think so too.

938
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,000
And what's Terri?

939
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,520
Tae-ri is also a happy puppy.

940
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,120
ENFP.

941
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,080
Yes.

942
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,880
And he said

943
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,040
he's more emotional.

944
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,920
In a relationship,

945
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,400
if you can't receive

946
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,600
a little hint,

947
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,800
he will be passive.

948
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,360
But if he received any hints,

949
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,600
he will take the initiative.

950
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,560
That's what he said.

951
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,160
I like happy puppies.

952
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,360
If you just look at MBTI,

953
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,040
I like happy puppy.

954
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,560
Because I think "Happy Puppy" will be

955
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,760
the straight ball will be more passionate.

956
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,320
But you may not like him.

957
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,160
He is very confident.

958
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,000
He's a confident person.

959
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
I just think that girl

960
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,640
she must be...

961
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,080
First, I think she's just simple.

962
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,000
Because she's an introvert.

963
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,360
She thinks the texture of talking to me

964
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:32,920
to chat with me.

965
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,840
It's not that awkward.

966
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
Because you talk a lot.

967
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,000
Yes.

968
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,480
That's all.

969
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,760
Who did you text today?

970
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,320
To Xin.

971
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,480
What did you send?

972
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,120
It's too much.

973
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,000
I edited it in advance.

974
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,960
and didn't see me press it.

975
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,320
Then I put my phone down.

976
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,520
So what did you send?

977
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,240
I'm not telling you.

978
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,960
Why not?

979
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,360
I just don't want to.

980
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,080
I said mine.

981
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,600
I don't want to say it.

982
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,360
What did you send today?

983
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,480
I said it's delicious.

984
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,120
Very talented.

985
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,040
He's better than the master.

986
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,160
Hunger expression.

987
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,360
This is a bit clear. I can only say

988
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,640
So clear.

989
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,760
Then you should use the whole bracket.

990
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,720
Attention. Where's the piano song?

991
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,240
No.

992
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,160
You're too...

993
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,840
You're forcing me.

994
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,760
Asking her?

995
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,080
Because I'm not in a relationship and I'm not sure.

996
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,880
I can't ask others to go because of me.

997
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,800
Yes, of course.

998
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,200
I'll keep watch for you anyway.

999
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,280
I'll watch them for you.

1000
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,480
Both of them are in my room.

1001
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,440
I feel so secure.

1002
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,280
I'll watch it for you.

1003
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,600
What do you mean?

1004
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,640
Let's see who's more compatible.

1005
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,720
First, I think

1006
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,040
Second,

1007
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,520
I think we can get along.

1008
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,960
I'll take a look.

1009
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,960
Do you want to try Terri?

1010
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,600
You want to try Terri.

1011
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,880
I can give him a hint.

1012
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,320
that you were wrong today.

1013
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,800
OK. Anything is fine.

1014
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,600
Do you want to try?

1015
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,240
Sure.

1016
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
Then I can...

1017
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,560
I'll find a chance to tell him today.

1018
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,920
If he gives me the invitation card,

1019
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,320
then you two

1020
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,720
go on a date with Cupid.

1021
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,840
We'll see. It depends on fate.

1022
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,280
So good.

1023
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,360
This is not a younger brother.

1024
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,200
He's just a brother.

1025
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,440
It's good to have a brother.

1026
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,640
Yeah.

1027
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,240
Yes.

1028
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,240
What are you hesitating about, Tae-seo?

1029
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
He knows who he's going to write to.

1030
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,880
Yes.

1031
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,640
But I can't guess who the siblings are.

1032
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,160
It's very troublesome.

1033
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,800
Help!

1034
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,920
Do you need some advice?

1035
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,520
Really?

1036
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,280
Let's go inside.

1037
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,440
Did your brother go to assist again?

1038
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,120
Yes.

1039
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,679
Let's go.

1040
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,639
Sit on the sofa and talk.

1041
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:27,679
Let me ask you first.

1042
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,520
Do you think your guess is right today?

1043
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,080
I'm pretty sure of two pairs.

1044
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,120
Do you think you're sure of me?

1045
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,800
Yes, you and your sister

1046
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,400
and Xiao Ling...

1047
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,560
Let me tell you. You're wrong.

1048
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,840
Really?

1049
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,320
He wants him to know his sister is Susu.

1050
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,600
Yes.

1051
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,840
Don't lie to me.

1052
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,639
Really?

1053
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,320
If you think you want to go on a date

1054
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,040
with someone you like,

1055
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,120
Think about it.

1056
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,600
If you make a mistake,

1057
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,480
it may be a little awkward.

1058
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,120
Could it be

1059
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,040
I don't think it's Fatty.

1060
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,640
I don't know.

1061
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,920
Harry is so anxious.

1062
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,960
I think there are only a few groups.

1063
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,880
Either you go with Xinxin or Hua.

1064
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,560
I don't understand.

1065
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,240
Not necessarily.

1066
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,520
I think so.

1067
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,160
You can guess like that for now.

1068
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,800
Hello.

1069
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,480
You're here.

1070
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,800
Are you alone?

1071
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,680
Am I not human?

1072
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,760
I want to say, just new friends?

1073
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,840
I thought Tata.

1074
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,920
Have a seat.

1075
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
Just sit on the bed.

1076
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,680
It's okay.

1077
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,320
Sit here.

1078
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,840
I was too anxious just now.

1079
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,280
I felt

1080
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,480
Something must have happened

1081
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,760
something happened today.

1082
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,200
Because today,

1083
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,280
we had a good chat.

1084
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,320
After chatting,

1085
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,880
who his crush is.

1086
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,400
First impression.

1087
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,080
Yes, first impression.

1088
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,960
Yes.

1089
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,880
They also have this.

1090
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,400
Cupid.

1091
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,920
So you're hesitating who to write.

1092
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,840
Yes.

1093
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
What's the map for?

1094
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
My sister didn't receive her message.

1095
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,440
So I want to help her.

1096
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
A new friend.

1097
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,840
Give her a chance.

1098
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,880
She's also an assistant.

1099
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,000
We have good siblings.

1100
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,600
Do you think you'll give it to me?

1101
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,640
Do you think

1102
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,000
this brother

1103
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,600
so straightforward?

1104
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,640
If he didn't tell me this,

1105
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,520
I might have given it to you.

1106
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,920
Follow your heart. Don't listen.

1107
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,560
Listen.

1108
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,840
I'm only here today, right?

1109
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,880
That's why you should cover yourself.

1110
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,400
Cover yourself?

1111
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,720
According to my guess,

1112
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,840
I said I'll help you.

1113
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,920
I'll help you when we eat.

1114
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,440
Since she wants to, as her brother,

1115
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,680
I think I should help her.

1116
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,160
It may not be good,

1117
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,360
to my roommate,

1118
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,640
But I can try it.

1119
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,160
I think I know

1120
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,880
who he likes.

1121
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,400
But you have to see for yourself.

1122
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Yes.

1123
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,600
Take a guess.

1124
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
So I'm telling you,

1125
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,440
Follow your heart.

1126
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,720
I'm here to help you.

1127
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
What do you mean?

1128
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,200
I know who he likes.

1129
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,480
I'm here to help him.

1130
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,360
My head is big.

1131
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,520
These two brothers

1132
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,560
They haven't settled their own business yet.

1133
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:50,880
Yes.

1134
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,200
He's trying his best to help his brothers.

1135
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,880
Yeah.

1136
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,720
So warm.

1137
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,480
Okay, I'll check over there.

1138
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:57,880
Sure.

1139
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,520
Go for a walk.

1140
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,360
Did you ask me to vote for you?

1141
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:01,720
Give me the invitation card.

1142
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,680
I didn't say anything.

1143
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,600
You can think about it.

1144
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,480
Yes.

1145
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,200
So I'm sure

1146
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,400
give Fatty this invitation card

1147
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,160
or

1148
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,800
It should be Fatty.

1149
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,760
Why is he fat?

1150
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,160
He got it wrong.

1151
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,680
Shake his head.

1152
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,040
Really?

1153
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,880
Think about it.

1154
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,960
He's actually looking for

1155
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,280
in the crowd.

1156
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,880
I'm helping you now.

1157
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,440
If you say so,

1158
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,200
it must mean to you.

1159
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,280
Don't make it so clear.

1160
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,440
I'm just here to talk to you.

1161
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,240
Okay.

1162
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,760
If you choose someone else,

1163
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,480
you might have made a wrong choice.

1164
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,440
I know and I find that

1165
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,000
Why didn't you listen to me?

1166
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,120
If you chose,

1167
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,280
I hint to you,

1168
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,040
you'll know what that person is like.

1169
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,960
and tell me

1170
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,080
whether I have

1171
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,600
to you?

1172
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,560
Give a good hint.

1173
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,480
Thinking in the wind

1174
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,160
I'm going for a walk too.

1175
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,040
Okay, go ahead.

1176
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,920
Help!

1177
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,480
Let him follow the feeling.

1178
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:06,880
Yes.

1179
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,600
I'm confused.

1180
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,160
I've decided.

1181
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Still thinking.

1182
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,200
Let me think about it.

1183
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,800
Give it to me.

1184
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,080
Give it to me.

1185
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,040
I want to know

1186
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,760
what Harry drugged you.

1187
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,560
He's so sincere.

1188
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,840
I trust you this time.

1189
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,800
Will you choose?

1190
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,720
Bingo.

1191
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
You choose slowly.

1192
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,800
Trust you.

1193
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,640
Just this once.

1194
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,120
Trust me once.

1195
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,880
I hope you didn't lie to me.

1196
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,400
Because Harry...

1197
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,240
When I asked for Cupid's invitation card,

1198
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,920
he told me a lot.

1199
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,360
I think he is a very sincere person.

1200
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,040
So I chose to trust him in the end.

1201
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,440
And I gave him

1202
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,560
my (Cupid) invitation card.

1203
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,840
Good evening.

1204
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,040
Hello.

1205
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,400
You are me.

1206
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,160
I can understand why

1207
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,760
Why don't you have one?

1208
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,680
Why can't you understand?

1209
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,160
I have no contact with anyone.

1210
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,080
And I think

1211
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,680
have someone in their hearts.

1212
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,040
Who are you sending to?

1213
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,080
I'll send it to Xinxin.

1214
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,320
Guess who I sent it to today.

1215
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,720
I'm definitely not a newcomer.

1216
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,920
I sent him a welcome check-in.

1217
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,760
I thought maybe no one

1218
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,160
no one would send it to him.

1219
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,880
So I sent him a welcome message.

1220
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,320
Because in this small house,

1221
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,200
I just want to have more contact with them.

1222
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,320
But from today,

1223
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,360
I think we can send it to the newcomers.

1224
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,360
Let him feel our warmth.

1225
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,080
She was so close to Fatty.

1226
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,840
She said I had no contact with anyone.

1227
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,120
Fatty is hurt.

1228
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,600
No, but the problem is

1229
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,280
Fatty didn't send it to Hua.

1230
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,880
I sent them to the newbies.

1231
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,880
But did Hua tell Fatty

1232
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,960
you need to know more about it.

1233
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,560
Again.

1234
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,400
Impossible. She asked him to know more

1235
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,360
to understand more.

1236
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,640
Girls usually say the opposite.

1237
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,800
Then Fatty said,

1238
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
I'll get to know more about it.

1239
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,400
Okay.

1240
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,000
Then send a message to the newbie.

1241
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,280
Welcome.

1242
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
But both of them

1243
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
texted the newbie.

1244
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
Yes.

1245
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,800
I found that our passion was destroyed.

1246
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,920
The last time we came to the siblings' house,

1247
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,520
Do we look alike now?

1248
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,760
But today, the two of us...

1249
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,120
I'm telling you, I've confirmed it.

1250
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,680
Comedians don't have love

1251
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,560
What?

1252
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,040
So cute.

1253
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,760
So from tomorrow

1254
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,240
I'm not funny anymore.

1255
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,120
Me too.

1256
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,880
I can't do that anymore.

1257
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
I'm here to date.

1258
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,120
I'm not here to be funny.

1259
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,760
You're not here to cook

1260
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,280
Yes.

1261
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,440
I'll behave tomorrow.

1262
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,280
I'll be the cold prince tomorrow.

1263
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,640
I'm a cold and warm man.

1264
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,600
Then I'm the ice queen.

1265
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,960
You're the Ice Princess.

1266
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,000
Then they found out they were talking to you.

1267
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,720
Don't be cold.

1268
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,000
So childish.

1269
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,160
Can I pretend for one day tomorrow?

1270
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,040
Okay.

1271
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,920
Pretend for a day.

1272
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,320
If you don't receive my message at night,

1273
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,000
I'll stop pretending.

1274
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,200
Just funny men and women

1275
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,280
So tired.

1276
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,680
I want to lie down here for a while.

1277
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,600
I think

1278
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,520
Tired.

1279
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,560
Yes.

1280
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,120
It's okay. I'll get it tomorrow.

1281
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,840
So it's still the same conclusion.

1282
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,280
The slogan.

1283
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,320
There's no love between a funny man and a woman.

1284
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,560
I'll focus on observing tomorrow.

1285
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,280
Susu and Xinxin.

1286
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,880
Can you be your master?

1287
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,760
Go for it yourself.

1288
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,320
Why are you observing them?

1289
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,640
You just pick up the dishes left by others.

1290
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,120
Can you take the initiative?

1291
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,760
The drawing is great.

1292
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Well said.

1293
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,480
But after observing them,

1294
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,840
I found out if others have feelings for him.

1295
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,920
If someone else likes him,

1296
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,240
why would I butt in?

1297
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,360
Then why? No.

1298
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,480
She likes him.

1299
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,680
People change.

1300
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,840
Everyone changes.

1301
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,880
It's not fun to grow old

1302
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,240
Get to know each other

1303
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Fight for it.

1304
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,840
Yes.

1305
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,640
I actually want to know about Xiao Ling.

1306
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,080
Xiao Ling...

1307
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,960
Xiao Ling said she's changing too.

1308
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,520
But I don't know

1309
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,160
Really?

1310
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,240
You...

1311
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,840
But I'm sure she didn't send it to me.

1312
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,720
Of course not.

1313
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,880
How can I send you the zero?

1314
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,520
Pay more attention to others.

1315
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,080
And don't "central air conditioner".

1316
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,920
I think Xiao Ling

1317
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,200
I guess there's no rule today.

1318
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,600
Yes.

1319
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,480
You also have zero clauses.

1320
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,560
Two for Susu.

1321
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,160
Then I'll learn from Xiao Ling.

1322
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,680
Dok-mi!

1323
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,480
The heroine.

1324
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,040
It's their loss to not like me.

1325
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,000
It's not my loss.

1326
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,360
I won't be a comedian from tomorrow on

1327
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,240
I won't be a comedian

1328
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,000
Come on.

1329
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,840
Go.

1330
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,080
You suddenly kicked me.

1331
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,960
I'm sorry.

1332
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,360
We have to cheer up.

1333
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,400
Cheer up.

1334
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:14,880
So tired.

1335
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,520
I feel more tired.

1336
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,040
But in this film,

1337
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,600
Hua

1338
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,160
She always put herself in the second place.

1339
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,440
Yes.

1340
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,600
Maybe she was influenced by her original family.

1341
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,520
She has a strong sense of unworthy.

1342
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,160
She often cooks there

1343
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,520
for others.

1344
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,120
and buy things at the supermarket.

1345
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,560
she would say, "Can I take this?"

1346
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,240
And even in front of the person she likes,

1347
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,120
she might say I need to think about it first.

1348
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,000
Susu and Xinxin's (choice).

1349
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,720
Many single women

1350
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
in a relationship,

1351
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,840
I don't deserve it.

1352
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,120
In personal psychology,

1353
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,240
a very important topic is

1354
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,000
beyond self-esteem.

1355
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,240
The first step to overcome self-esteem

1356
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,920
is to accept myself.

1357
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,080
I remember

1358
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,920
in an interview.

1359
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,920
She said I didn't believe it. It's only been three days.

1360
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,440
someone can love me unconditionally.

1361
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,400
Let me give you an example.

1362
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,040
If a person with inferiority complex

1363
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,160
If she keeps avoiding her inferiority complex,

1364
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,720
she may continue to feel inferior.

1365
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,520
But if a person who feels inferior

1366
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,440
I feel inferior.

1367
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,360
I started to accept my inferiority complex.

1368
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,400
That's how you could become

1369
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,240
become confident.

1370
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,840
When you accept it,

1371
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,920
you'll be worth it.

1372
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,240
You're definitely worth it.

1373
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,600
Just like athletes can accept failure

1374
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,320
he can jump out from there.

1375
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,160
and enjoy success.

1376
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,400
If you can't accept failure,

1377
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,240
you've been pessimistic,

1378
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,000
it'll be hard for you to jump out.

1379
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,760
Yes.

1380
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,600
I get up early and say to the balcony every day

1381
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,640
I deserve it.

1382
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,560
I can do it.

1383
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,520
I deserve it.

1384
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,920
We deserve to be loved

1385
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,000
We deserve to be loved

1386
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,680
Yes.

1387
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,840
Good evening.

1388
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,600
Here's something for you.

1389
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,720
Here's something for you.

1390
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,720
What?

1391
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,920
Hand cream.

1392
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,560
The soup is so happy.

1393
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,400
Let me tell you.

1394
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,440
Do you apply hand cream?

1395
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,920
That's enough. Thank you.

1396
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,280
I think I'm a mixed dough.

1397
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,240
But it was dry when I was doing it.

1398
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,800
He said

1399
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,320
he needs a hand cream.

1400
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,480
It's been a few days.

1401
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,360
I haven't found the right time

1402
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,120
to give it to him.

1403
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,800
in front of many people.

1404
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,600
It's quite awkward.

1405
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,000
So I choose

1406
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,120
to give him this hand cream

1407
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,520
when we're alone.

1408
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,400
So she's been holding the hand cream

1409
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,560
and was looking for a chance.

1410
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,200
I'm happy. I'm so happy.

1411
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,200
So sweet.

1412
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,640
Today is the first day.

1413
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,600
Are you nervous?

1414
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,840
A little.

1415
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,400
Do you have anyone

1416
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,280
you really want to date today?

1417
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,400
There's someone who tends to date, right?

1418
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,320
I think I have an idea too.

1419
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,600
There's an answer.

1420
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,960
I guessed it.

1421
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,880
I guessed it.

1422
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,840
Can you drink it?

1423
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,720
Yes.

1424
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,040
Let's add wine together.

1425
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,840
and wish us a sip of peach wine.

1426
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,200
Peach blossoms will be there soon.

1427
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,440
You're really something.

1428
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,880
It tastes good no matter how I mix it.

1429
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,160
Guess who she wrote to.

1430
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:31,840
Harry.

1431
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,360
But she wants to guess her brother.

1432
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,000
Is there a mission?

1433
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,400
Here.

1434
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,440
Do you have a mission?

1435
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,800
When?

1436
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,800
Just now.

1437
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,920
Hurry.

1438
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,280
First come first served.

1439
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,880
Hurry.

1440
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,440
Is there a new mission?

1441
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,400
Come down.

1442
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,360
I'll be right there.

1443
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,240
To members of the house

1444
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,880
Let's play snow together

1445
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,640
In this romantic winter

1446
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,760
in this romantic winter.

1447
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,520
Here are five invitations for partners.

1448
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,440
But on the card,

1449
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,760
on the card,

1450
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,120
to him.

1451
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,240
Finished forming.

1452
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,440
First come first served.

1453
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,520
Attention, those who have received many invitations

1454
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,400
can make a choice.

1455
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,480
You can choose.

1456
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,440
Counter.

1457
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,040
Great.

1458
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,440
Write it. What are you waiting for?

1459
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,280
Those who are rejected

1460
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,080
You need to choose your partner again.

1461
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,200
Okay.

1462
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,280
Sprinkle flowers.

1463
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,640
Come and get it.

1464
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,200
So there are only five invitations.

1465
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,400
to get the invitation card.

1466
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,360
Get the invitation card

1467
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,600
and hand it out, right?

1468
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,640
Yes.

1469
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,520
I didn't receive any text yesterday.

1470
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,040
And I'm not sure

1471
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,160
if someone will pick me today.

1472
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,200
I don't want to choose anyone.

1473
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,200
Because I think

1474
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,720
a little awkward.

1475
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,720
Then I didn't move.

1476
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,200
The soup is too obvious.

1477
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,120
Right away.

1478
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,320
The target is clear.

1479
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,200
Who are you writing?

1480
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:37,920
Susu.

1481
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,240
Look, he got hand cream.

1482
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,400
after receiving the hand cream.

1483
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,680
Because he has solid information.

1484
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,240
Yes.

1485
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,280
Here's your invitation card.

1486
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,040
Thank you.

1487
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,080
Tarri also went to find Susu.

1488
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,920
I gave it to Susu.

1489
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,720
If she chooses

1490
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,080
If she chooses Terri,

1491
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,480
the soup will crack.

1492
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,200
The soup cracked. Yes.

1493
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,240
Are you good at sports?

1494
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,200
I...

1495
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,240
Not bad.

1496
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,760
She's amazing.

1497
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,840
Do I trust you?

1498
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,040
Yes.

1499
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,640
What?

1500
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,400
Pick me.

1501
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,080
Xiao Ling, Fatty.

1502
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,800
Good.

1503
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,720
Take the initiative.

1504
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,640
I'll choose someone who's good at sports.

1505
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,440
Don't let me down.

1506
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,800
He really wants to win.

1507
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,640
Seriously.

1508
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,680
I'll work hard.

1509
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,080
I saw him

1510
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,040
I gave it to Xiaoling.

1511
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,560
I was a little disappointed.

1512
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,520
A little disappointed.

1513
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,120
But you chose someone else.

1514
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,840
Zun thought everyone would be locked to death.

1515
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,400
so I locked them to death.

1516
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,120
Yes.

1517
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,800
Coming.

1518
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,640
Is it for me?

1519
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,280
What else?

1520
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:43,920
Let's go.

1521
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,360
Why are you giving it to me?

1522
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,360
Invite you.

1523
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,920
What does this mean?

1524
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,840
What does it mean?

1525
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,160
What does it mean?

1526
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:08,800
What does it mean?

1527
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,760
Isn't it a boy giving it to a girl?

1528
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,400
Who said that?

1529
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,760
Whoever gets the card has the right to give it

1530
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,160
It makes me

1531
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,440
scratched my ears and cheeks.

1532
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,600
It's amazing.

1533
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,840
This scene is so confusing.

1534
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,760
Wonderful.

1535
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,840
Harry thought only boys write to girls

1536
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,840
So Harry has a chance to make a choice.

1537
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,000
He can choose to continue

1538
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,320
or accept Tata's invitation.

1539
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:40,760
Tata.

1540
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,840
to form a team with Tata.

1541
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,680
Xin has given it to us.

1542
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,560
He can take it back.

1543
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,760
He can't take it back.

1544
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,600
He can only refuse Tata.

1545
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,520
Because he gave it out himself.

1546
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:47,880
Yes.

1547
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,280
He wants to get himself out.

1548
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,720
and see if he's reliable.

1549
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,360
So now Sue is going to choose.

1550
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,280
Now this Suha siblings

1551
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,240
is the most popular one.

1552
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,840
Yes.

1553
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,040
Let's eat.

1554
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,960
It's getting cold for a while.

1555
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,320
Did you make this for everyone?

1556
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,520
Yes.

1557
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,120
First come first served.

1558
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,640
Try the poison for me.

1559
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,320
First come first served.

1560
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,120
Come on.

1561
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,120
Come on.

1562
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,440
I can try five poisons.

1563
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,880
You can try them all.

1564
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,240
This pot is all your "poison".

1565
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,200
I think Xiaoling

1566
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,000
was brave today.

1567
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,840
Yes.

1568
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,320
I think she's braver than Hua.

1569
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,000
I saw you eat.

1570
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,160
Then I saw your expression.

1571
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,240
Dumplings

1572
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,840
is delicious when cooked.

1573
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,080
Then give me a bowl.

1574
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,560
Have you ever seen dumplings taste bad?

1575
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,560
Do you have a portion?

1576
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,120
Everyone has a share.

1577
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,880
What's that look?

1578
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,320
Yes.

1579
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,040
I've been staring.

1580
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,600
Right

1581
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,360
It looks delicious.

1582
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,760
I'll get you chopsticks.

1583
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,880
I'll take it there.

1584
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,440
Thank you.

1585
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,720
It's hot, right?

1586
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,960
Did Xiaoling eat?

1587
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,440
No.

1588
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,320
I'll eat it now.

1589
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,000
Okay.

1590
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,680
In fact, Hua also cares about fatty.

1591
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,320
He noticed her unhappy.

1592
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,800
Flower gave me

1593
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,240
if you want to know more about others,

1594
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,080
try to understand others.

1595
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,960
But today I feel

1596
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,080
a little unhappy today.

1597
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,200
Fatty can see clearly.

1598
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,560
Did you get

1599
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,160
Did you get the invitation card?

1600
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,440
Yes, I got one for you.

1601
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,800
You're really a good roommate.

1602
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,160
I voted for the soup for you.

1603
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,400
I'll go get that.

1604
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,760
Bring me the cake I bought.

1605
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,240
Today's birthday.

1606
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,720
Tae-seo.

1607
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,560
I had no idea.

1608
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,200
Last night...

1609
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,680
You went up yesterday.

1610
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,840
What?

1611
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
Look at the time.

1612
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,920
Today is your birthday.

1613
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,600
Really?

1614
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,760
Today is Tae-ri's birthday.

1615
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,000
I forgot.

1616
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,400
I realized it after my friend sent it.

1617
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,080
Yes.

1618
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,800
Leave the cake to me.

1619
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,600
Harry is so considerate.

1620
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,880
No wonder he's the most popular.

1621
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,960
Terri doesn't know yet.

1622
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,280
Who did you give the map to?

1623
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,080
I don't have the invitation card.

1624
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,360
The map didn't (invite). Cut.

1625
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,920
Actually, I was a little late.

1626
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,960
It's not that

1627
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,640
Why?

1628
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,440
Isn't it good to have the initiative?

1629
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,080
Actually,

1630
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,320
if someone receives two at the same time,

1631
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,640
one of them

1632
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,400
and be abandoned.

1633
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,440
You need to find someone to team up with.

1634
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,120
Yes.

1635
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:41,840
It's a bit miserable.

1636
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,840
I only gave it to one person.

1637
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,000
That person rejected me.

1638
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,640
I'll choose again.

1639
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,520
Is that what it means?

1640
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,120
I think so.

1641
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,920
But if it's only one person,

1642
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,200
I don't think he'll refuse.

1643
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,640
I gave it to him at the same time.

1644
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,000
Soup?

1645
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,560
Yes.

1646
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,200
Tae-seo, let's take a photo.

1647
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,360
Tae-seo.

1648
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,080
Let's take a family photo.

1649
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,200
Come and take a photo.

1650
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,000
Happy birthday to you

1651
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,280
Thank you.

1652
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,000
Okay.

1653
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,160
I'll do it.

1654
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,720
Let's take a video first.

1655
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,240
And the video.

1656
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,640
Blow it.

1657
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:22,280
Happy birthday to you

1658
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,120
Recording videos again

1659
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,240
and sing me a birthday song.

1660
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:24,920
Really

1661
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,200
We ordered cakes again

1662
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,920
I'm so touched.

1663
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,440
This birthday

1664
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,160
I feel really happy.

1665
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,640
Okay, thank you.

1666
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,760
Thank you.

1667
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,800
Thank you so much for the cake.

1668
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,400
Thank you.

1669
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,840
Eat.

1670
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,920
You have cake and

1671
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,920
dumplings.

1672
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,200
Yours.

1673
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,680
Susu is hesitating.

1674
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,680
She has two cards.

1675
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,400
And it's Tae-ri's birthday.

1676
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,680
Yes, it's his birthday.

1677
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,520
Yes.

1678
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,040
What should I do?

1679
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,720
What should I do?

1680
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,000
Come with me.

1681
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,200
It's so hard.

1682
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,360
I can't refuse someone

1683
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,480
who's celebrating his birthday.

1684
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,680
What should I do?

1685
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,480
Who should I return the invitation card to?

1686
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,240
Today is Tae-seo's birthday.

1687
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,440
Don't think about

1688
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,120
about your birthday.

1689
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,320
But I rejected her

1690
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,160
and then rejected her.

1691
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,000
Don't be upset because of your birthday.

1692
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,800
Listen.

1693
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,440
If it's normal,

1694
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,240
I would choose soup.

1695
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:45,680
Why?

1696
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,200
Because he was the first one to give it to me.

1697
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,120
Then you choose the soup first.

1698
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:48,880
Do you know why?

1699
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,280
Because Tae-seo hesitated for a long time.

1700
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,240
I don't know if it's because I'm sorry.

1701
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,400
I was hesitating.

1702
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:58,960
Okay.

1703
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,360
Next,

1704
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,600
it's time to test our teamwork.

1705
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,160
Susu received two invitations.

1706
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,240
According to the rules, she has to refund one.

1707
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,800
So please guess

1708
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,800
who Su will choose.

1709
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,320
as her sports day partner?

1710
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,640
the wrong family members

1711
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,480
will be punished

1712
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,480
by our netizens on Weibo.

1713
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,840
On the day of the show,

1714
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,480
on Weibo.

1715
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,840
Tae-seo. Soup.

1716
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,040
Soup, Tae-seo.

1717
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,760
Soup soup.

1718
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,800
It's like a song.

1719
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,600
Soup.

1720
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,760
Why did you choose Tae-seo?

1721
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,840
I just suddenly thought

1722
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,000
she ran to Harry

1723
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,800
She hesitated.

1724
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,840
Yes, she hesitated.

1725
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,960
Then,

1726
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,080
she said

1727
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,080
she likes ENFP.

1728
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,240
But in terms of personality,

1729
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:56,680
she likes

1730
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,440
If it's an EnFP,

1731
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,880
she'll probably choose Terri.

1732
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,920
So she might want to give it a try.

1733
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,040
I want to add my point of view.

1734
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,760
In the process of

1735
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,840
and her expression,

1736
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,960
she never revealed

1737
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,400
she actually likes soup

1738
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,120
because she likes soup.

1739
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,280
Just like her.

1740
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,680
She said she wanted to choose the soup

1741
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,280
because she gave it to me first.

1742
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,040
She cares about this.

1743
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,760
During this time,

1744
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,800
in this period.

1745
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,600
including Susu.

1746
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,720
She was chatting with Harry

1747
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,760
in her room yesterday,

1748
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,840
I didn't feel anything.

1749
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,240
she actually

1750
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:26,960
to the soup.

1751
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,240
That's not proactive enough.

1752
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,200
The hand cream is used.

1753
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,880
It's been a few days since the girl put the hand cream on her.

1754
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,800
so I wanted to give it to him alone.

1755
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,640
I think her interest

1756
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,800
And she just repays

1757
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,240
the kindness

1758
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,960
for the past few days.

1759
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,680
Do you feel blunt in love?

1760
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,200
No.

1761
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,040
Huang Zihong, you're very blunt.

1762
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,520
I still believe in details.

1763
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,840
If Tae-seo was the first to come today,

1764
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,720
and his birthday,

1765
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,120
Will she still choose his soup?

1766
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:51,920
I think

1767
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,480
Susu is a kind girl.

1768
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,080
She cares about his birthday.

1769
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,000
And she thought

1770
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,240
the soup and I

1771
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,120
with Soup.

1772
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,280
He took the initiative today.

1773
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,320
He gave it to me first.

1774
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,560
I want to reward this kind of good.

1775
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,200
So I hope

1776
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:03,840
Right?

1777
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,360
Yes.

1778
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,240
Let's give her five.

1779
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,680
And I think

1780
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,120
out of politeness.

1781
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:08,400
Yes.

1782
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,120
She was just being polite.

1783
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,800
Today is her birthday.

1784
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,520
The atmosphere is already here.

1785
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,160
What if she thinks

1786
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,200
she's better with soup,

1787
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,240
so the soup can accept it.

1788
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,400
She doesn't choose soup anymore.

1789
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,080
No.

1790
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:17,880
I can't take the soup.

1791
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,440
No.

1792
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,840
Huang Zihong, you are so complicated. Huang Hongfan.

1793
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,440
I'm too complicated.

1794
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,920
Sorry, I'm too complicated.

1795
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,160
Let's take a look.

1796
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,480
Please.

1797
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,480
Can you not wear shoes?

1798
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,400
Can you come over?

1799
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:34,760
Okay.

1800
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,120
What's wrong?

1801
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,320
Happy birthday.

1802
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,160
Thank you.

1803
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,560
I'm sorry.

1804
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,200
OK.

1805
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,000
After KeyNG returned the invitation card to me,

1806
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,840
I feel complicated.

1807
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,560
Because I was quite confident.

1808
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,760
I didn't expect to be rejected.

1809
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,080
Do you have a backpack?

1810
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,040
Do you have something to put in your bag?

1811
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,320
I want to die.

1812
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,200
I returned the invitation card to your brother.

1813
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,720
Why?

1814
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,560
Because I have two.

1815
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,680
I want to return one.

1816
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,680
You rejected him?

1817
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,040
No.

1818
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:19,560
I'm not saying no.

1819
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,400
Because he was the second to give it to me.

1820
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,720
I still want to choose that one.

1821
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,520
Clear.

1822
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,560
Look.

1823
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,320
Choose soup.

1824
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,800
Huang Zihong, you are complicated.

1825
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,520
Huang Zihong, I think you are a little blunt.

1826
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,160
You are blunt in love.

1827
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,840
I absolutely doubt

1828
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,120
if a girl likes you,

1829
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,080
you think he's very polite.

1830
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:43,800
So he

1831
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,400
dating for his friends.

1832
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:45,680
Yes.

1833
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,440
There's a problem.

1834
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,440
No wonder he rejected

1835
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,720
was turned down by him.

1836
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,560
You're a little blunt.

1837
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Then our Weibo netizens

1838
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,880
is

1839
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,000
The wrong family members

1840
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,400
For a partner

1841
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,080
or some siblings.

1842
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,600
and post it on Weibo.

1843
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,160
Let's guess who you're drawing.

1844
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,640
I just want to draw a portrait.

1845
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,920
Yes, I just want to draw.

1846
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,200
I just want to draw.

1847
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,600
I put on a show.

1848
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:14,920
Xiao Ling.

1849
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,840
I'm going to a sports event with Susu's team today.

1850
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,360
Can I borrow your fragrant shampoo

1851
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,440
that fragrant shampoo last time.

1852
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,760
You've learned to flatter yourself.

1853
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,480
Fine, take it.

1854
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,280
This is my dating weapon.

1855
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,280
Olia hydrochloric acid shampoo.

1856
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,240
Can you use it?

1857
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,480
Of course I know.

1858
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,200
It's so fluffy after washing my hair.

1859
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,400
You can grow two centimeters taller.

1860
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,560
OK. You’re really 1.9 meters.

1861
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,680
It’s confirmed.

1862
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,160
Go ahead.

1863
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:37,960
Wish you success.

1864
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,840
Thank you.
