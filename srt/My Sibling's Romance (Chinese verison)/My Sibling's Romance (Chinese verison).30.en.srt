1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,120
Let's introduce

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,160
where you came from.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,000
From Xiaoling.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Where are you from?

5
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,320
Beijing.

6
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,480
Introduce it in dialect.

7
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,840
Beijing, Cao Xiaoling.

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,000
This is how everyone introduces.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,320
Beijing, Xiao Ling.

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,720
We'll use your dialect.

11
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,040
Our dialect is dialect.

12
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,680
I can't speak Chinese.

13
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,520
My hometown is northeast.

14
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,240
But I grew up in Beijing.

15
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
I'm a member of the Virus.

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,640
You're from the Vitlel Tribe. I'm from the Vetlel Tribe.

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,160
Yes.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,280
What?

19
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,920
You believe everything I say.

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,560
You're so easily fooled.

21
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,840
I've been in England.

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,560
In these seven or eight years,

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,640
Tata is your turn.

24
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,960
I'm from Sichuan.

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
And in Shanghai,

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,240
Missy.

27
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,960
Missy in Shanghai.

28
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,720
I’m from Zhejiang.

29
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,720
Ningbo?

30
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,160
Yes.

31
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,600
I'm in Shanghai now.

32
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,280
Shanghai.

33
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,160
In Shanghai.

34
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,599
I'm from Xiangxi.

35
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,480
Jiangxi.

36
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,240
Xiangxi.

37
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,280
Really?

38
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,760
We are minorities.

39
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,800
Miao?

40
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,320
No.

41
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,160
Earth family.

42
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,080
Just like my home.

43
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,160
Really, exactly the same.

44
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,000
My husband is also from a local family in Xiangxi.

45
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,840
Xiangxi is a native family.

46
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
That's what our dialect says.

47
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,080
but it's similar to Sichuan dialect.

48
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,760
I know you're from Guangdong.

49
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm He Wenjie.

50
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,320
I'm from Guangdong.

51
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Let me introduce.

52
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,160
We're from Jiangxi.

53
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,520
Jiangxi?

54
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,440
Do you still want to introduce your family?

55
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,360
We're from Shandong.

56
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,759
How about this?

57
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,640
Then

58
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,000
We are from Guangdong.

59
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,520
And then Guangdong Zhuhai.

60
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,440
Yes, we are from Zhuhai.

61
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,800
We were born in our hometown.

62
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,080
and lived in Zhuhai.

63
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,600
Yes.

64
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,440
Actually, I don't think

65
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,200
my accent.

66
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,640
I mean very standard ordinary.

67
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,400
You mean very standard.

68
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,479
Is my accent that obvious?

69
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,960
Very obvious.

70
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,640
I'm already keeping the tone down.

71
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,840
I think I'm very standard.

72
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,000
You're really funny.

73
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,760
You too.

74
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,920
What are you laughing at?

75
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,480
What's wrong with me?

76
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,199
I'm just a bit tone.

77
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,720
I speak

78
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,080
Mandarin is quite standard.

79
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,039
Right?

80
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,520
I'm really standard.

81
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,280
More standard than me.

82
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,520
Okay, it's my turn.

83
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,160
I think we will speak our hometown dialect.

84
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
So sometimes I can't change

85
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,640
to change.

86
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,800
We like to talk when we see each other.

87
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,880
He was a broadcaster,

88
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,640
so he didn't have that tune.

89
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
I might have a little bit of tune.

90
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,040
I really want to ask

91
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,720
how to say that?

92
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,800
Her father will have...

93
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,920
My dad actually...

94
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,840
He hopes that he'll be able to do well.

95
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
But he won't show it.

96
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,160
I'm old.

97
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,079
Maybe my grandma

98
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,800
has four children.

99
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,040
Four sons.

100
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,960
Every son

101
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,760
want a boy

102
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,880
All boys?

103
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,200
Yes.

104
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,920
And my grandma really wants a grandchild.

105
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,960
When I was a kid, Tu and I

106
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,520
I might ask my grandma

107
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,400
some pocket money

108
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,920
or even 100 yuan.

109
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,080
my grandma might be reluctant.

110
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,960
But my brother was so young that year.

111
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,440
He said he wanted to learn drums.

112
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,560
I gave him tens of thousands of yuan right away.

113
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
a set of drums.

114
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,920
The day before I asked her

115
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,960
the day before I asked my grandma for money.

116
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,280
Were you sad?

117
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Of course.

118
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,640
I think it's a bit...

119
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,120
But I've been used to

120
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,160
the concept of men over women.

121
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Including when I was born.

122
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,960
I knew it.

123
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,160
my family values men over women since childhood.

124
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Although you see me

125
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,920
control him,

126
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,560
Yes.

127
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,680
But at home, I dare not

128
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,200
at home.

129
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,120
Because I will be scolded.

130
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,360
or say,

131
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,960
How could you do this to your brother?

132
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,200
He's observing Hua.

133
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,560
Pay attention to flowers.

134
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,960
I think Terri knows flowers better.

135
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,320
I feel a little depressed.

136
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,560
It's hard. It's depressed.

137
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,600
On the contrary,

138
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,720
our family values women more than men.

139
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,160
Actually, it doesn't mean that women are more important than men.

140
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,920
It's actually love.

141
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,120
But education is different.

142
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,160
Our family is poor to raise boys.

143
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,360
A rich girl?

144
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,040
When I was a kid, I was starving.

145
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,760
I was like this.

146
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,320
It's similar.

147
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,920
It was our pocket money when we were young.

148
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,960
I spent ten yuan in middle school and she paid 100 yuan.

149
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,080
It's normal.

150
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,200
So when I was in college,

151
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,800
I felt like I couldn't stand it.

152
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,159
Because she is good at studying.

153
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,960
I didn't study well since I was a kid.

154
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,000
He was

155
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
was kind.

156
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,960
I have a personality.

157
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,840
He's a good boy.

158
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,520
When I was in college,

159
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,920
when I was in college.

160
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,400
Actually, I'm a fierce person.

161
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,080
Yes.

162
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,400
He will be fierce in private.

163
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
multiply by three times.

164
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,920
I'm scared.

165
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Can't you keep it?

166
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,280
Yes.

167
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,240
That's good.

168
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
I'll say these few days

169
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,120
cherish these days.

170
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,200
Be good to me.

171
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,080
Actually, when I came here,

172
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,320
I never tell her

173
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,040
to express my feelings.

174
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,760
I have to take care of her.

175
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,280
I want to protect her.

176
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,120
Actually, I won't.

177
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,960
But as long as someone bullies her in life,

178
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
I'm the kind of person

179
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,800
I'll just call you.

180
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,160
Yes.

181
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,880
I don't even know when he finished.

182
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,360
Then I said

183
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,120
why he disappeared.

184
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,320
I'm so jealous. I want a brother.

185
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm so jealous.

186
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,320
She protects her weaknesses and protects her sister.

187
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,400
She's so hard to fall in love.

188
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,720
because of me.

189
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,680
We went out for a party

190
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
At the party,

191
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
some friends

192
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,280
For example,

193
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,000
when I think Xinxin is good,

194
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,280
I would stand up and say,

195
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,240
Are you sure?

196
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,720
You're exaggerating.

197
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,200
So I can't date.

198
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,760
you can understand.

199
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,400
Then they said,

200
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,080
you can try another way.

201
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
It's too hard to talk about.

202
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,880
including some boys in our circle

203
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,440
want to know my sister,

204
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,080
he will consider our relationship.

205
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,040
He broke up with my sister.

206
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,360
Will he break up with me?

207
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,640
Yes.

208
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,680
Because it's very simple.

209
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,080
if you break up with my sister,

210
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,480
you'll lose me too.

211
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,960
This is real.

212
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,520
We had a friend

213
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,080
liked her so much that she wanted to pursue her.

214
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,320
I thought about it for two months.

215
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,080
He said, "Forget it, I choose my brother."

216
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you hate him, Xin?

217
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
A little.

218
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,120
I suddenly feel a little annoying

219
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,000
What should I do?

220
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,400
Actually I learned to talk properly here.

221
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,640
We also communicate these days.

222
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,520
I said I cherish these days.

223
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,480
In fact,

224
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,960
I never communicate with.

225
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
But you're willing to teach me.

226
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,200
Yes.

227
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,320
He's willing to tease me.

228
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,440
He teases me and plays with me every day.

229
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,920
I really...

230
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,640
He's different when he's with his friends.

231
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,320
He gets nervous about everything about me.

232
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,400
or frown.

233
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,680
I really feel that

234
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,200
he's afraid of Xinxin.

235
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,320
I think so too.

236
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,240
Xinxin kept telling him

237
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,840
she said stop eating.

238
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,320
Stop eating.

239
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
Don't touch it.

240
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll just tell him to stop eating.

241
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,920
I won't say anything else.

242
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,440
Help me with the rest.

243
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,760
Go and get some.

244
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,320
Yes, I think so too.

245
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,480
So you think he's afraid of me.

246
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,040
Yes.

247
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,680
Actually, yes.

248
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,440
I'm a victim.

249
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,120
I'm afraid of her.

250
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,480
because I might love her more.

251
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,720
He's so sweet.

252
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,560
Yeah, he's quite brave to express himself.

253
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Guoli.

254
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,160
So scary.

255
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
The last sentence is so scary.

256
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,520
That's why I saw others being siblings.

257
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,200
That kind of warm scene.

258
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,680
I was a little jealous.

259
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,240
I told him why.

260
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,680
I said others have breakfast every day.

261
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,880
He said you would cook it yourself.

262
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,000
Why didn't I have breakfast?

263
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,680
Yes.

264
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,920
No.

265
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,720
I think Harry takes more care of you.

266
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,120
Really?

267
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,960
How long are you going to England?

268
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,280
Then Harry.

269
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,240
I don't remember.

270
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,720
Two or three years.

271
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,200
You two...

272
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,240
Do you live together after you go?

273
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,159
No.

274
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:50,840
We...

275
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,920
I live in the school.

276
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,960
At first, she was at Cambridge.

277
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,840
I was in Wensha.

278
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,760
I'm in a girls' school.

279
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,040
Yes.

280
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,320
Then I went to Cambridge.

281
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,560
and she went to London.

282
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Then I went to London from Cambridge.

283
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,440
and she came back.

284
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,680
Right.

285
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,320
And then...

286
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,200
Last year when I came back to London,

287
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,920
I stayed in London for a year.

288
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,640
Yes.

289
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,880
We just

290
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,120
living together in England.

291
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,800
for only a year.

292
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,640
So you don't see each other

293
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,200
in England.

294
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,160
Yes, every weekend.

295
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,760
I live in the school.

296
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,160
Me too.

297
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,360
I'm a girl's school.

298
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,280
Just cook for a week this weekend.

299
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,000
and give it to her.

300
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
Who is stronger?

301
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,280
Me.

302
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,000
You...

303
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,080
Really?

304
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,640
Your brother looks gentle.

305
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

306
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,040
He has a stable personality.

307
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,080
He won't lose his temper.

308
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,600
He always tolerates me.

309
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,320
He will take care of Tata subconsciously.

310
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,799
Yes, he won't let her be alone.

311
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,120
Look at our wine.

312
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,039
After watching that,

313
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,280
you still want me to be here, right?

314
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,960
Juice wine.

315
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,880
Of course.

316
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,120
It's okay.

317
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,640
My family won't have

318
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
My sister and my parents

319
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,320
are relatively independent.

320
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,960
We may not contact each other for months.

321
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,160
That's all?

322
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
You haven't contacted your sister for months.

323
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,280
Yes.

324
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,600
You don't even contact each other in the same city.

325
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,640
No.

326
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,520
Except for something,

327
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,680
There's really something.

328
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,320
That's why we got in touch.

329
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,520
Both of you are in Shanghai.

330
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,760
Why don't you ask us out for dinner?

331
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,800
Sometimes.

332
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,200
We're in the same circle.

333
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,920
But

334
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,760
we have our own lives.

335
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,040
Yes.

336
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,760
Did you get along with other girls today?

337
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,520
I'm curious.

338
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,840
He begins to ask questions.

339
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,000
No.

340
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,800
Why? You don't have time?

341
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't know.

342
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,720
I'm so passive.

343
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,880
But from now on,

344
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,560
you should take the initiative.

345
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,520
Like this?

346
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,600
So if you want to get along,

347
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,240
I think you can

348
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,760
Do you hear me? I'll order you.

349
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,240
You're so generous.

350
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,760
No.

351
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,480
Because you told me you have...

352
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,480
Take a look.

353
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,320
Will you send it to me today?

354
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,160
So direct.

355
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,400
Hana is amazing.

356
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,680
What are you doing?

357
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,400
Excuse me.

358
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,200
Just follow your heart.

359
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,120
Why are you asking this?

360
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,000
Crazy.

361
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,120
That's weird.

362
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,760
Both of them

363
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,920
It's weird to be mad at each other.

364
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,320
What are you doing? You have to make sure.

365
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,960
Then I won't.

366
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,120
Whatever.

367
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,520
I won't.

368
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960
Did you not understand yesterday

369
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,600
or your ability to understand?

370
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,880
I can understand.

371
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

372
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,840
Did you have a fight?

373
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,560
Both of them are so direct.

374
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,440
It's really weird.

375
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,480
I think Fatty is emotional.

376
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,840
Yes.

377
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,280
Fatty thinks she doesn't understand him.

378
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,120
Fatty thinks

379
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,080
he has made it very obvious.

380
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,360
Why don't you understand me?

381
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,480
You still need to be like this.

382
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,120
Be patient.

383
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,680
Yes, he is kind of

384
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,920
He's a bit emotional because he cares about her.

385
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,320
Yes.

386
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,480
Hua wants to see their reaction.

387
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,960
to give yourself an answer.

388
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,080
I think, right?

389
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,200
Because Hua is more eager for favourite.

390
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,000
But because of the lack of love

391
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,960
in her family,

392
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,880
So sometimes,

393
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,000
she pushes me when she's in love.

394
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,400
Are you sure she likes me?

395
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,760
Yes. Through her behavior,

396
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,280
by doing this.

397
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,000
for me.

398
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,560
Yeah.

399
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,480
Maybe because

400
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,000
many misunderstandings before,

401
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
So they are

402
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,280
interpreting their neutral behaviors.

403
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,600
In this process,

404
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,480
there will be more misunderstanding.

405
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,120
Because it's a negative interaction.

406
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,720
Yes.

407
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
But she's different from Tae-seo.

408
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,720
Actually, I think her behavior

409
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,600
is also an objective proof

410
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
we care about each other

411
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,480
about each other.

412
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,920
Because she's too polite with Tae-seo.

413
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,480
You can't tell

414
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,960
how Tae-seo

415
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
in Tae-seo's heart?

416
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,680
A sense of distance.

417
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,240
But her distance with Fatty

418
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,320
is obviously closer

419
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,680
closer.

420
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
Lower a lot.

421
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,560
Yes.

422
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,800
(The biggest suspense)

423
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,520
The biggest suspense

424
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,480
I think it's Hua.

425
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,280
Should I send it to Terri or Fatty?

426
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,800
But the atmosphere between them

427
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,080
has gone that far.

428
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,320
She won't put on weight.

429
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,280
I don't think so.

430
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,720
Omance

431
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,000
Nice

432
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,080
Why are you looking at me?

433
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,840
Look over there.

434
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,920
That's what you want to see.

435
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,560
Harry's thoughts.

436
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
Stop peeking.

437
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,240
Turn around.

438
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,360
So sweet.

439
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,120
They are already

440
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,360
a little couple.

441
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,400
They're flirting.

442
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,280
Hua, I watched your childhood

443
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,480
since childhood.

444
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,040
I think you're really a tough girl.

445
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,280
I feel sorry for you.

446
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,040
Great.

447
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,440
This is good.

448
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,520
No matter who you are,

449
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,440
he won't pressure her.

450
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
She has a sense of propriety.

451
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,680
She's really a tough girl.

452
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,160
I feel sorry for her.

453
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,080
I think

454
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,000
who needs to be taken care of.

455
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,160
I want to know more about you.

456
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,440
Fatty.

457
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,960
They have feelings too. What should I do?

458
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,320
Today's message.

459
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm still the same as yesterday.

460
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,120
like yesterday.

461
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,000
I told her

462
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,560
I want to take care of her.

463
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,880
I want to know more about her.

464
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,040
I received two messages from her today.

465
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,200
I think Fatty and Tarri

466
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,560
I was touched when they sent it.

467
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,600
They were comforting me.

468
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
and they want to care about me.

469
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,320
I've been thinking about it for a long time today.

470
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,240
Who should I send the message to?

471
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,320
Let's see what the heroine will choose.

472
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,880
It's so hard. How to choose?

473
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
It's really hard.

474
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,960
Here we go.

475
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,840
(To Tae-seo.)

476
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,800
but we're all your family.

477
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,560
This is not Hua.

478
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,040
I received a text today.

479
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,120
I guess it's still flower-haired.

480
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,160
The content is

481
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,640
Although my siblings are not around,

482
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,440
everyone will be with me.

483
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,680
I think the consolation will be bigger.

484
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,200
A little bit.

485
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,720
I don't feel comforted.

486
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,240
Today's message

487
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,920
is sent out with friendship.

488
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,720
Because I think in this small house,

489
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,200
in this house.

490
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,640
But Tae-seo might be lonely.

491
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,720
So I sent it to Tae-seo.

492
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,280
But her friendship

493
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
will give Fatty a big misunderstanding.

494
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,680
Although you don't have your siblings,

495
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,200
we can talk face to face.

496
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,120
Yeah.

497
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,800
But you make Fatty think

498
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,200
I have no feelings for Fatty.

499
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,880
So you have to see the bud of love.

500
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,360
Don't care about friendship.

501
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,520
She's actually hesitating.

502
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,800
Their eyes.

503
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,520
This is easy.

504
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,400
You're all amazing. Someone who can become like this.

505
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,600
Mr. See-woo.

506
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,280
Mr. See-woo's words are sweet.

507
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,160
Very sweet

508
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,800
I texted Tu Tu today.

509
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,440
After knowing his family story,

510
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,680
I really admire

511
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,920
I really admire them.

512
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,880
I think their inner energy

513
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,800
is too strong.

514
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,480
If you have love for your brother,

515
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,880
express it boldly.

516
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,600
Relax.

517
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,040
and do more happy things.

518
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,440
And a meme.

519
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,800
Because Xiaoling's nickname is Mimi,

520
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,000
So he grew a kitten.

521
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,000
So sweet.

522
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,440
The map finally makes me feel

523
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,640
that makes my heart flutter.

524
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,840
I'm 100% sure

525
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,040
the map sent it.

526
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
He told me directly

527
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,360
in the message today.

528
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,920
don't worry about the pressure from your family.

529
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,600
So I think he knows me better.

530
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,280
And at that moment,

531
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,920
I just want to see this person.

532
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,280
So far,

533
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,720
I still want to know more about Xiaoling.

534
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,400
Maybe she was a little strict

535
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,800
when she was a kid.

536
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,840
I want to make her happy

537
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,000
to make her happy.

538
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,840
Forget about the past.

539
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,880
Just be happy and healthy.

540
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm touched tonight

541
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,079
Keep protecting her.

542
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,240
It must be his Esther.

543
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll send you

544
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
to Tu.

545
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,440
Because I think his video

546
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,880
touched me.

547
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm also encouraging the drawing.

548
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,760
I'm happy for Hua.

549
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,560
He's such a good boy.

550
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,160
I hope he can do it.

551
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,320
I feel sorry for Xinxin.

552
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,760
She loves someone else.

553
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,800
Because I think she and my sister

554
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,560
are about the same age.

555
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,520
And I think

556
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,360
the way she gets along with me

557
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,600
are very similar to my sister.

558
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,840
So I really

559
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,760
totally

560
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
as my sister.

561
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,600
Map.

562
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,640
We'll be a loving family.

563
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,200
Esther can't live without a relationship line.

564
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,880
There will be.

565
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
I believe there will be changes in the future.

566
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,920
You worked hard in England alone.

567
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,120
Although I was bored,

568
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,240
but when you're unhappy,

569
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,880
you can come and chat with me.

570
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,640
I can see that Susu is satisfied.

571
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,200
I'm satisfied with everything.

572
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,080
I got a text from the soup.

573
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,640
I sent a lot.

574
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,520
It's quite attentive.

575
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,960
It's quite sincere.

576
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,240
She's watching my movies seriously.

577
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,480
Now I know her growth experience.

578
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,840
I know her too.

579
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,360
she would be nervous

580
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,680
and nervous.

581
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,920
Since I chose to trust her,

582
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,000
and I want to believe her.

583
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,320
I think I should take the next step.

584
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,960
To Tom.

585
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,360
What kind of soulmate

586
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,280
is like?

587
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,840
Because his mom said

588
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,640
Yes.

589
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,560
A boy should find a soulmate.

590
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,920
So straight.

591
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,320
What is a soul mate to you?

592
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,240
She saw what my mom said.

593
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,080
My mom wants me to find a soulmate.

594
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,360
and take a step forward.

595
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,360
I'm curious about the soup.

596
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,440
What kind of person

597
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,080
is he?

598
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,800
Or is he looking for

599
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
a soulmate?

600
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,960
My soulmate.

601
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,800
I used to think

602
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,920
that you could comfort me and support me

603
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,960
comfort me, understand me and support me.

604
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,680
But after I came to the small house,

605
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,880
I changed my mind.

606
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,040
The definition of a soulmate

607
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,680
is not just my dependence.

608
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,760
I need to learn

609
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,840
to take care of others' thoughts and emotions.

610
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,600
At the same time, I want to be her support.

611
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
He has changed.

612
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,840
He's grown up.

613
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,480
Love makes people grow up.

614
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,240
Lock it up!

615
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,840
Why are you looking at me?

616
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,720
Can't I look?

617
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,840
You're so stingy.

618
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,040
Look at that body language.

619
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,040
Dating is great.

620
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,120
Did you take a photo?

621
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,560
Let me take one for you.

622
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,480
I'll take one for you.

623
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,000
Can I trust you?

624
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,720
You'll know when you wash it.

625
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,600
I think in this group,

626
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,360
in this group is really sweet.

627
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,240
Yes.

628
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,160
Are you sure it looks better?

629
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,480
Don't pressure me.

630
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,800
His sister.

631
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,960
Have you ever taken care of your sister?

632
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,240
I moved.

633
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,280
You did. No, you didn't.

634
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,000
Probably.

635
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,440
One more.

636
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,480
Okay.

637
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,560
Nice.

638
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,560
Three, two, one.

639
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,560
Nice.

640
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,680
Beautiful.

641
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,480
Okay, I didn't move this time.

642
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,160
Thank you.

643
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,000
It's possible for them.

644
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's possible. They're not brothers.

645
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,200
You're so dumb.

646
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,440
What are you doing?

647
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,440
I feel a sense of crisis.

648
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,360
It's okay.

649
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,320
I thought you were...

650
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,720
Harry is so cute.

651
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,880
Mance.

652
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,000
You're a very considerate and considerate person.

653
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,480
I hope you can love yourself more.

654
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,120
Don't waste time.

655
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,560
It's so happy.

656
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,280
I received

657
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,320
a very sweet text message.

658
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,120
It makes me happy anyway.

659
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,960
But I think

660
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,600
my emotions

661
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,560
are very different.

662
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,120
His text is very bad.

663
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,520
Yes.

664
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,280
I also want to say

665
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,040
It's not his style.

666
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,360
I received a text

667
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,600
a very calm text.

668
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,520
The whole text

669
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,600
very plain.

670
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,920
I can't feel his emotions.

671
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,280
I added some expressions

672
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,600
and some words.

673
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,760
I even added

674
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,560
add more content,

675
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,360
he just summarized

676
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,840
today's short video.

677
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,480
After watching your video,

678
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,200
your family is very similar to mine.

679
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,000
I feel a sense of gap.

680
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,480
So I want to send three words tomorrow.

681
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,880
She looks a little cold

682
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,960
she looked a little cold.

683
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,440
So I know she's angry.

684
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,120
I don't know why I wrote that.

685
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,560
I'm not that simple-minded.

686
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,360
So I'll apologize to her tomorrow.

687
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,920
I won't do it again.

688
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,480
Who can save me?

689
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,040
(The message is sent today.)

690
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,840
The misunderstanding has gotten deeper.

691
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,840
When I didn't receive the reply,

692
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,480
I was a little confused.

693
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,280
You can see my expression now.

694
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,120
I was a bit serious.

695
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,280
And she's really angry.

696
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,600
I've sent her

697
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
for two days.

698
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,760
and every day during the day,

699
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
I'm already very proactive.

700
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,200
I think

701
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,720
feel my feelings.

702
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,200
I think

703
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,240
very obvious.

704
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,840
I think she can understand my feelings.

705
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,040
But in her heart,

706
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,400
she wants to know more about Terri.

707
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,240
So today,

708
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,040
if I don't receive your message,

709
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,880
I'll probably know what's going on.

710
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,000
He decided to let go.

711
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,160
I just feel sorry for him.

712
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,320
It's a misunderstanding.

713
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,680
Your eyes are bloody.

714
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,640
Are you that tired?

715
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,520
Maybe Hua wants to test his patience.

716
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Yes, I think so too.

717
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,920
Hang in there.

718
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,480
She's crying.

719
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,640
Depressed.

720
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm crying.

721
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,520
The contact lenses are too dry.

722
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,240
He's crying.

723
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,840
My brother

724
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,280
received a sincere message today.

725
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,840
from Susu.

726
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,880
When I read this message,

727
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,000
I said it was from Susu.

728
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,480
So, who sent it today?

729
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,960
Then I took a look at Susu first.

730
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,720
and said, "Think about it."

731
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,880
I sent it to Tu today.

732
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,400
Painting Brothers Flowers

733
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,240
This shows that

734
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,160
we have announced our relationship.

735
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,560
So they don't have to hide their relationship

736
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,800
they don’t need to hide their relationship.

737
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,040
I'll take part in Weibo #Love and Siblings' Sincere Protection Chart #The exclusive way to get surprise benefits

738
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,360
We will receive each text from someone.

739
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,680
And we know each other.

740
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,360
I don't know why.

741
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,520
We both look up

742
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,440
and look at each other.

743
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,960
for about three or five seconds.

744
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,840
Why?

745
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,000
This subtle expression is so cute.

746
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,360
I got a message

747
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,200
a sincere message.

748
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,920
Tata.

749
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,560
I want to laugh.

750
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,440
Wait.

751
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,560
Happy.

752
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,000
I feel so bad for them.

753
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
It's hard to break the ice

754
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,800
An

755
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,280
Okay, we're full and full.

756
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,000
Let's go home.

757
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,760
Let's go.

758
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,720
Let's go.

759
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,800
Let's go, Su Zihao.

760
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,080
Okay, Mi.

761
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,440
I have 18 friends named Zihao.

762
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,560
Zihao.

763
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,560
It's freezing.

764
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,040
Today's message

765
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,400
I think we should talk.

766
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,120
Xinxin.

767
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,320
Xinxin.

768
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,840
A familiar passing by

769
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,440
Hang in there, Fatty.

770
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,320
I think she can feel

771
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,560
my feelings.

772
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,240
I think I've made it very obvious.

773
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,920
I just need to confess.

774
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,640
If I don't receive your message today,

775
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,520
I'll probably know

776
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,560
what happened.

777
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,520
Actually, I'm scared in the house.

778
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,360
Send some messages and invitations.

779
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,680
and make a judgment.

780
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,600
You should understand what it means.

781
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,640
This is a problem.

782
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,720
You can guess.

783
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,560
Yes, don't guess what others think.

784
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,600
You only do your own things.

785
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,160
is probably better.

786
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,560
Did you send it to the map today?

787
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:38,960
Yes.

788
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,040
Can you see it?

789
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,360
Yes.

790
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,560
It seems to have changed.

791
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,440
It says your brother.

792
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,200
How many messages did you receive today?

793
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,480
from whom and who.

794
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,600
So who else?

795
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,920
You sent it to the map?

796
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,120
I sent it to him every day.

797
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,840
Really?

798
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,160
I sent them to him.

799
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,400
to encourage him.

800
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,120
Really?

801
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,080
Yes.

802
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,400
It's okay.

803
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,800
I'm texting you again today.

804
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,400
I'm also encouraging you today.

805
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,640
Who?

806
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,680
To encourage those who have no siblings.

807
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,080
I understand

808
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,120
I can understand.

809
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,720
You encouraged him.

810
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,320
But some people may not understand.

811
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,800
I think it's also possible.

812
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,920
I'll talk to him first.

813
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,480
Okay.

814
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,680
Did she call Fatty

815
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,600
through Xinxin?

816
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,400
Fatty.

817
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:24,880
Look.

818
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,520
What I sent today is also a friendly text.

819
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,280
Yes.

820
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,800
Fatty.

821
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,000
The map is not here.

822
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,880
Let's resolve the misunderstanding.

823
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,080
Let's talk.

824
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,720
I talked to her just now.

825
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,200
Then she said,

826
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,080
she sent it out of friendship.

827
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,080
because she thought she had no siblings.

828
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,760
and sent it to someone who has no siblings.

829
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,040
The point is I still have one word.

830
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,280
If we didn't talk about

831
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,360
about yesterday's secret mirror (House),

832
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,600
I think it makes sense.

833
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,360
We're done talking.

834
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,280
After that,

835
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,280
I think my performance today

836
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,440
is very obvious.

837
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,640
He thought he understood.

838
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,040
No.

839
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,880
But it's not at all.

840
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,600
You made her angry.

841
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,040
Do you think you hinted to her?

842
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,040
You don't know me?

843
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,440
Everyone has different standpoint.

844
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,920
Girls may think they have their own considerations.

845
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,840
Fortunately, we have brothers to pass a message to him.

846
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,680
I'll help you understand.

847
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,240
Please understand.

848
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,920
Xinxin is really good.

849
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,240
I can understand what makes you unhappy.

850
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,400
is your anger.

851
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
What do you think now?

852
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,880
I won't contact her anymore.

853
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,440
No need.

854
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,720
Where is the point?

855
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,080
It's a sincere message.

856
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,440
She sent it to Tae-ri yesterday.

857
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,880
That's because they went on a date yesterday.

858
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,120
And today,

859
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,480
I can't accept that at all.

860
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,440
I can't accept it at all.

861
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,320
I won't...

862
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,600
Actually, I've been working hard

863
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,640
and that.

864
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,520
I think the love she thinks

865
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,920
may be

866
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,320
make her breakfast every day.

867
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,440
who makes breakfast for her every day.

868
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,320
No.

869
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,000
Of course not.

870
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,200
Then enjoy the next day.

871
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,760
No.

872
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,200
I don't think it's possible.

873
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,440
Since I'm on this show,

874
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,240
I just want to say

875
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,960
I have no choice.

876
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,480
That's not the reason.

877
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,800
At the beginning,

878
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,880
a few days ago,

879
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Now I think

880
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,880
it's been ten days.

881
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,640
We know who to aim at.

882
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,600
It's normal.

883
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,040
And yesterday, I already...

884
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Yesterday?

885
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,520
We asked that question directly.

886
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,240
The question we discussed together is

887
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,200
will you discriminate?

888
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,040
She said yes.

889
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,080
Is it discrimination?

890
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,400
Different?

891
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,440
I'm the one being discriminated.

892
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,600
But is it possible that

893
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,880
Maybe she wants to know more about Tae-seo.

894
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,120
Because they went on a date.

895
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,840
We can't just blindly think

896
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,160
she didn't follow her heart.

897
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,560
This is not what we can guess.

898
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,080
Maybe

899
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,720
I'm presenting

900
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,560
I just want to

901
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,520
I don't know anything else.

902
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,560
Maybe others won't understand

903
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,240
Why are you doing this?

904
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,960
But everyone has a different personality.

905
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Fatty didn't receive his message today.

906
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
He's a little unhappy.

907
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,240
He thinks he knows more about

908
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,760
about flowers and flowers.

909
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,720
including these three days.

910
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,800
he sent

911
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,920
to Hua.

912
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,040
But Hua didn't send it to him today.

913
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,920
He was a little depressed.

914
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,040
So I'm a little worried.

915
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,120
Fatty will give up.

916
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,920
Okay, I got it. It's okay.

917
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,760
You should have a good chat.

918
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,480
Forget it.

919
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,520
I know what to do.

920
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,360
I may care if I'm fat.

921
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:58,920
Just not?

922
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,240
This is a sincere message.

923
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,200
And I've been

924
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,320
and you've been sending messages to others.

925
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,960
It bothers me too.

926
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,000
But I think there's another reason

927
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,840
for another reason.

928
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,360
It's really because I'm a little fat.

929
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,040
Actually Xinxin

930
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,560
to comfort Fatty.

931
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,800
and sort it out for him.

932
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,240
But I don't seem to understand.

933
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,880
So I think Xinxin

934
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,360
I wanted to convey the meaning of flowers.

935
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,680
Flower means friendship.

936
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,720
But after Fatty interpreted it,

937
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,520
Xinxin was a little unsure.

938
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,160
At that time,

939
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,120
at that moment.

940
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,920
emotionally.

941
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,200
I can't listen to anything.

942
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,360
Can you understand

943
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,480
when Fatty was angry?

944
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,360
If it were me, I would do the same.

945
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,640
At least I'll be angry at the moment.

946
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,520
I'll say this out of anger.

947
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,320
I won't continue.

948
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,840
I don't have the right to be angry.

949
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,600
but I still have to be angry.

950
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,680
Really

951
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,360
From a fat perspective,

952
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,760
I did what you said.

953
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,960
You asked me to know more about others.

954
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,120
I'll do that.

955
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,160
and came back.

956
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,520
I've been moving forward to you.

957
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,760
but you never took a step towards me.

958
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,800
and you even took a step towards someone else.

959
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,760
So he got angry.

960
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,680
It's just a misunderstanding.

961
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,600
Maybe Hua said it.

962
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,040
Get to know more about others.

963
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,000
She doesn't really want to say

964
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,760
You really know

965
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,680
And then boys...

966
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,640
Okay, I'll get to it.

967
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,160
That girl might get angrier.

968
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,920
It's a matter of men and women's thinking.

969
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,520
He's straightforward.

970
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,240
He's still different.

971
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,680
One more thing is that

972
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,360
Every time you text her,

973
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,920
it's about my friendship.

974
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,960
What do you want?

975
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,159
If you like her,

976
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,320
You're really showing your feelings.

977
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,400
and my side was broken.

978
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,159
But you said it was friendship.

979
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,639
What am I then?

980
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,400
What Fatty cares about is two messages.

981
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,120
Let's continue.

982
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,199
Because there's a lot of room to spend time with.

983
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,239
I hope they can sit down and face each other

984
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,159
to clear up these misunderstandings.

985
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,800
Tu.

986
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,800
Hello, Tu.

987
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,480
First of all, why do you ignore me every day?

988
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,560
I'm sorry.

989
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,639
You're such a good sister.

990
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:52,400
You're a good person now.

991
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:52,840
No.

992
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,719
It's a fruit cube.

993
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,679
Yes, very sincere.

994
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,840
So I'm very happy.

995
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,040
Thank you very much.

996
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,000
Fatty didn't receive his message.

997
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,040
He's a little upset.

998
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,960
The family has started to communicate.

999
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,080
Good family.

1000
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,000
I think my sister

1001
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
she doesn't have

1002
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,200
for Tae-seo.

1003
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,320
But after seeing that today,

1004
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,600
she turned to Fatty today.

1005
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,520
she might think Tarri is very...

1006
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,760
And his brother isn't here.

1007
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,480
The map knows flowers well.

1008
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,000
The map explained why Hua did this.

1009
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,400
I don't think that's the reason.

1010
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,960
I don't understand.

1011
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,880
Fatty can't understand.

1012
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,560
Because first,

1013
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,440
First, they don't have a date today.

1014
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,040
Secondly, it's a love message.

1015
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,440
It's a heart.

1016
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,320
It's not sympathy.

1017
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,400
Xinxin is great.

1018
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,560
They have a good chat.

1019
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,880
Yes.

1020
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,960
You can use other ways.

1021
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,280
For example, we will play together.

1022
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,080
We'll use many ways

1023
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,640
to make him feel not lonely.

1024
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,480
But you're not

1025
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
send a message

1026
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,960
to tell him.

1027
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,920
And she knows

1028
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,040
Fatty likes her.

1029
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,240
And she asked

1030
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,760
if Fatty will send it to her.

1031
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,640
After all, Fatty

1032
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,480
in the past three days.

1033
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,440
Yes.

1034
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,760
He thinks he doesn't understand

1035
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,080
what Hua did.

1036
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,240
Why did they fight?

1037
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,120
or something.

1038
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,040
when you look at him from a different angle,

1039
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,560
you'll find that he thinks he's right.

1040
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,160
She thinks she's right too.

1041
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,680
Because no one is perfect.

1042
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,240
She would think if she didn't send it to Tae-seo,

1043
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,280
He has no one.

1044
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,200
Tarri, no one can say it.

1045
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,480
She thinks it's cruel.

1046
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:23,960
Because she has been

1047
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,080
with Terri these days.

1048
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,160
I haven't been in touch with Fatty for a long time.

1049
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,880
No, I think sometimes

1050
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,840
she neglects the feeling of being fat.

1051
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,520
She can ask Terri about it.

1052
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,920
And she can also say that

1053
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,720
he doesn't have his sister by his side.

1054
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,440
But I think we should

1055
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,880
about the message.

1056
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,560
and decisive.

1057
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,960
That's why I'm giving you

1058
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,200
I want to text you my feelings.

1059
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,440
and cheer for you.

1060
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,000
But Tae-seo treats her differently.

1061
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,960
Tae-seo likes her.

1062
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,080
It's just a cover of friendship,

1063
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,360
but you're responding.

1064
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,400
what he accepted is different.

1065
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,600
So I can understand that you don't send it to me.

1066
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,800
But...

1067
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,400
Guolifang.

1068
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,440
It's the trouble caused by your message again.

1069
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,240
Guolifang.

1070
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,400
Okay, I'll talk to her.

1071
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,400
Okay.

1072
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,000
What is she doing down there?

1073
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,480
What if Hua tells Fatty and Xin

1074
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,840
what I sent to Terri,

1075
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,880
Do you think it's okay?

1076
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,640
I think she has

1077
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,520
to impress her.

1078
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,040
People can be moved too.

1079
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,520
She has the right to choose.

1080
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,640
It's normal.

1081
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,600
Because I didn't accept Fatty clearly.

1082
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,280
But you're making both sides wrong.

1083
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,680
Tae-seo will misunderstand.

1084
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,520
I've been two-sided with you for two days.

1085
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,080
Fatty misunderstood

1086
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,920
You must have no feelings for me.

1087
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,320
Because you haven't responded to me for two days.

1088
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,520
I think Hua is thinking about both sides.

1089
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,200
She is struggling

1090
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,080
who is more suitable

1091
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,880
who is more suitable for me.

1092
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,560
But Fatty didn't cry.

1093
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,960
When she looked at him,

1094
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,600
she said,

1095
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,280
you cried and said it with a smile.

1096
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,560
It's not good.

1097
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,320
She's probably trying to hide the embarrassment with a smile.

1098
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,000
Because she knew it was her fault.

1099
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,520
But this way of expressing emotions

1100
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,200
to express emotions.

1101
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,360
When you know

1102
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,240
when others are sad because of you,

1103
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,920
you cried.

1104
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,040
You cried.

1105
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,840
Right?

1106
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,520
She didn't.

1107
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,840
But I think

1108
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,120
If it bothers me,

1109
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,080
just show it.

1110
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,880
You cried.

1111
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,440
It became serious.

1112
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,240
She may use a smile

1113
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,600
with a smile.

1114
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,400
You cried. You brought it with a joke.

1115
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,120
Maybe.

1116
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,840
Right?

1117
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,120
Let's get over this now.

1118
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,640
And the map is to Tarri.

1119
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,680
There's actually a little wrong information.

1120
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,360
He thought

1121
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,000
there was a mistake.

1122
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,040
You're not interested in him at all.

1123
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,600
Yes.

1124
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,120
Actually Hua had a lot of good interactions

1125
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,720
with Tarri before.

1126
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,560
Yes.

1127
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,120
Tae-seo asked her who you want to know.

1128
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,880
Hua said you...

1129
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,560
Yes.

1130
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,200
The biggest problem

1131
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,360
is that they keep sending messages.

1132
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,760
I think

1133
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,000
you should let Fatty and Hua sit down.

1134
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,120
and make it clear.

1135
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,640
Yes.

1136
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,360
Let me tell you.

1137
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,400
I hesitated for a long time today.

1138
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,480
but you still sent it to Tae-ri.

1139
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,840
I didn't send it

1140
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,720
the text

1141
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Those texts sent

1142
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,480
I think he and Tata

1143
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,640
have no siblings in this house.

1144
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,840
I still want to give him some comfort.

1145
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,720
I think if he didn't receive

1146
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,040
his feelings today,

1147
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,640
It's...

1148
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,040
I think it's too miserable.

1149
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,720
But it doesn't mean

1150
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,920
just friendship.

1151
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,320
I don't think

1152
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,840
I have feelings for Tae-seo.

1153
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,720
I sent this letter.

1154
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,040
Of course.

1155
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,520
Look.

1156
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,120
Right.

1157
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,960
It's not that I don't like him.

1158
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,320
Do you know

1159
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,240
is?

1160
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,600
The Mirror Room.

1161
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I asked Fatty.

1162
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,760
Before Tae-seo came in,

1163
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,680
he didn't send it to me for two days.

1164
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,160
I asked him yesterday

1165
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,600
I mean it's more fun to have a sports day.

1166
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,840
or go on a date with me?

1167
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,440
He said he liked dating with me.

1168
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,280
But after the sports day,

1169
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,120
he still sent it to Xiaoling.

1170
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,520
She also misunderstood.

1171
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,160
Yes.

1172
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,600
But I think he wants me

1173
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,720
to understand his actions.

1174
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,400
I really don't understand.

1175
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,040
So when he sat next to me today,

1176
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,520
he was testing me.

1177
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,880
So I don't know how he feels?

1178
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,120
I was wondering how I knew you.

1179
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,040
I don't know at all.

1180
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,160
Although you're nice to me,

1181
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,440
I think he's nice to Xiaoling too.

1182
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,080
He said

1183
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,440
He said he was happy to be with me.

1184
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
But his actions and actual actions

1185
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,960
including his last date.

1186
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,880
he brought back a gift.

1187
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,560
It's also for Xiaoling.

1188
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,480
Really?

1189
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,840
I brought her a fish tank.

1190
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,960
I thought it was strange.

1191
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,920
See? It's all a misunderstanding.

1192
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,040
But I asked Tae-ri

1193
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,760
if he wants to meet other girls.

1194
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,600
He said yes.

1195
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,920
So I asked him

1196
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,480
I asked him too.

1197
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,800
Hey.

1198
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,680
Did you contact other girls today?

1199
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,360
He said no.

1200
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
Just do it if I say you want to.

1201
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,680
He said I was generous.

1202
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,360
What did I say?

1203
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,480
When did I care about you?

1204
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,400
I think I know

1205
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,320
how they feel.

1206
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,360
But

1207
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,920
Fatty may have seen it.

1208
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,720
Everyone may think I'm the most suitable one.

1209
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,400
but I haven't seen it yet.

1210
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,880
But I think

1211
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,840
I was the one

1212
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,520
I always took the initiative.

1213
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,880
Although I can continue to take the initiative,

1214
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,080
but I didn't get a good result.

1215
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,200
So I want to try something different.

1216
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,120
But now Tarri

1217
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,520
is a little passive.

1218
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,480
Afraid of getting hurt.

1219
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,600
Don't let your past experience

1220
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,400
by your past experience.

1221
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,720
My point of view now is

1222
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,680
you and Fatty go offline.

1223
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,720
Let's talk like this.

1224
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,160
No.

1225
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,640
I don't think Fatty and I can talk normally.

1226
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,520
Don't be afraid of having an offline chat.

1227
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,920
Well said.

1228
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,160
Go.

1229
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,760
I think he doesn't want to talk to me now.

1230
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,280
I don't want to touch this wall.

1231
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,520
It's okay.

1232
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:46,960
Come on.

1233
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,280
I don't want to touch it.

1234
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,080
Just touch it.

1235
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,040
I don't want to touch it.

1236
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,640
What are you afraid of?

1237
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,960
Let's go to the romantic house together, okay?

1238
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,600
Sure.

1239
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,280
I think this is

1240
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,200
a good way.

1241
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,360
Good job.

1242
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,960
Great.

1243
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,240
I think I might go to Fatty

1244
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,160
to talk to Fatty.

1245
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,120
So I'm sorting it out.

1246
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,640
I think after I'm done,

1247
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,800
and talk to him.

1248
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,160
instead of asking him a question.

1249
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,200
Just ask him one question.

1250
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,320
Fatty, hold on.

1251
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,600
Fatty, don't let us down.

1252
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,160
Stop being angry.

1253
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,640
Okay.

1254
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,760
Soup.

1255
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,480
Who's calling me?

1256
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,760
Come here.

1257
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,640
What's wrong?

1258
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,320
Are you upset?

1259
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,800
What did I do?

1260
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,360
Didn't you tell me something?

1261
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,240
After dinner,

1262
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,200
On the way back,

1263
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,840
Fatty is going to collapse.

1264
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,840
So?

1265
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,640
Okay.

1266
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,160
I'll explain to her.

1267
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,200
She didn't go back with her.

1268
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,760
Fine.

1269
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,160
Explain to her.

1270
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,080
She's very sad.

1271
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,920
Indeed, I should tell her.

1272
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,320
It's so hard.

1273
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,320
I heard you got angry earlier.

1274
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,360
No.

1275
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,640
It's nothing.

1276
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,840
I'm not angry.

1277
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,760
For example, if you make him unhappy,

1278
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,320
You make him angry.

1279
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,200
He cares about his feelings.

1280
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,280
But he can't observe others' feelings.

1281
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,880
You know?

1282
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,000
Yes.

1283
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,040
He's too self-centered.

1284
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,280
He's not a meticulous person.

1285
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,360
But I think he is sincere enough.

1286
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,440
I asked him

1287
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,960
Is it the same state

1288
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,640
in the same state?

1289
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,760
He said it's not like that at all.

1290
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,560
What is it?

1291
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,600
Tom Cat.

1292
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,720
Write a letter.

1293
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,920
What letter?

1294
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,080
He's not romantic.

1295
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,920
He's not considerate.

1296
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,640
He doesn't care about my feelings either.

1297
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,240
He didn't tell me when he was angry.

1298
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,400
He's narrow-minded.

1299
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,240
and not considerate.

1300
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,280
Yeah.

1301
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:56,760
It's over.

1302
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,280
Stop it.

1303
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,280
You have to talk again.

1304
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,480
She doesn't want to talk to me now.

1305
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,200
Tata.

1306
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,760
She's a little annoying.

1307
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,920
I think I sent it too proactively today.

1308
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,360
Actually, I regret it.

1309
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,160
I think the text is very plain.

1310
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,600
It makes me look worthless.

1311
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,480
Girls' thoughts

1312
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:14,960
Really.

1313
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,400
Really sensitive.

1314
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,640
Why didn't you order me?

1315
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,400
Do I have to ask you to order me?

1316
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,360
I wanted to tell you.

1317
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,440
But I forgot.

1318
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,400
Hello.

1319
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,120
Ziyi is back.

1320
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,080
Do you want to go?

1321
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,600
I was stunned just now.

1322
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,320
I just came back.

1323
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,560
You can go.

1324
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,160
Where?

1325
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:38,440
I just came back.

1326
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,320
I just went back to my room.

1327
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,040
So funny.

1328
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,160
Let's have a chat.

1329
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,760
Okay.

1330
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,440
Let's go.

1331
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,520
Take the initiative.

1332
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,960
I heard you were unhappy.

1333
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,000
How did you know?

1334
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,560
I'm not upset.

1335
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,680
But fortunately,

1336
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,360
I'm not unhappy.

1337
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,440
I didn't want to ask you.

1338
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,480
Because Xin told me

1339
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,680
Fatty was a little upset.

1340
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,720
Because Hua didn't send it to him.

1341
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,400
I think so.

1342
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,080
And...

1343
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,960
Maybe I didn't think that much.

1344
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,040
But how did you know about this?

1345
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,960
telepathy.

1346
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,120
Impossible.

1347
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,280
Someone must have told you.

1348
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:21,840
No.

1349
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,640
No way.

1350
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,360
Liar.

1351
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,480
Tata reminded me.

1352
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,640
Okay.

1353
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,760
It's quite awkward.

1354
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,840
Because I didn't want to talk about this.

1355
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,440
At first,

1356
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,080
But Tata told me

1357
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,760
she was a little unhappy today.

1358
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,560
She said she was annoyed.

1359
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,880
but I don't know what she's upset about.

1360
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,480
She said she felt

1361
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,560
she sent it sincerely.

1362
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,080
She thinks Harry isn't that sincere.

1363
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,840
but she thinks it's sincere.

1364
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,520
I feel

1365
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,080
But I was too proactive.

1366
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,120
We have similar personalities.

1367
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,000
We are a little stubborn.

1368
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,360
Am I not sincere?

1369
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,080
No, your text is very sincere.

1370
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,320
I also told Tata.

1371
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,440
Okay.

1372
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,800
Because I don't want to make you unhappy.

1373
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,280
Sure.

1374
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,680
But I'm not happy.

1375
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,640
Not this.

1376
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,320
I might think

1377
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,040
sometimes

1378
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,040
you only care about your feelings.

1379
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,640
You care about it.

1380
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,120
I made you uncomfortable,

1381
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,760
or I made you unhappy,

1382
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,720
But you don't care.

1383
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,160
If you do this,

1384
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,200
if you do this?

1385
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,360
How do I look?

1386
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,000
Good. Just say it.

1387
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,560
Yes, just say it.

1388
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,520
You may feel a little uncomfortable

1389
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,320
what I did

1390
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,120
what I do

1391
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,560
will affect others.

1392
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,320
But I didn't think about that.

1393
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,600
Can I understand that?

1394
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,720
It doesn't mean it'll affect others' mood.

1395
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,680
or my mood.

1396
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,520
I'm sorry.

1397
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,600
It's okay.

1398
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,720
I forgive you.

1399
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,440
It's amazing that I'm here.

1400
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:59,560
I can change a lot of things.

1401
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,920
Is there anything I want to change?

1402
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,720
No.

1403
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,920
No.

1404
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,800
I can say

1405
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,320
Because I like to hear

1406
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,920
people's thoughts and impressions.

1407
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,520
Think about it.

1408
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,960
Stop being reasonable.

1409
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,400
It'll be done after a hug.

1410
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,920
For example, my words

1411
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,640
I don't know.

1412
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,640
Maybe I...

1413
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,880
I talked to Fatty.

1414
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,520
Because I thought we were too bored.

1415
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,400
We were bored.

1416
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,320
I really want to talk to you.

1417
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,040
And...

1418
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,720
But I don't know how to talk to you.

1419
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,200
He actually said

1420
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,280
my...

1421
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,480
Like what I did that night.

1422
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,040
Maybe my emotions are written on my face.

1423
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,040
Brother Tata.

1424
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,560
You were supporting me.

1425
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,160
But I felt very sad.

1426
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,120
Are you jealous?

1427
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,200
A little.

1428
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,680
I felt very sad.

1429
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,800
And...

1430
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,520
So direct.

1431
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,160
I felt bad on the spot.

1432
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,120
I felt bad for a moment.

1433
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,760
Did you want to walk away?

1434
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,240
I already...

1435
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,440
Yes.

1436
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,840
I don't really want to hear the letter.

1437
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,200
You cried so much.

1438
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,080
There.

1439
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,800
I'm so pissed off.

1440
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,920
You're so annoying.

1441
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:26,760
Yes.

1442
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,040
Fatty told me that

1443
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,800
I think so too.

1444
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,640
I'm too sensitive.

1445
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,160
and too anxious.

1446
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,600
and think too much.

1447
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,880
Not only is it not good for myself,

1448
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,080
but also for girls.

1449
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,440
And maybe when I get along with you,

1450
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,200
when I was with you.

1451
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,880
So I don't feel so relaxed.

1452
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,920
I don't joke with you.

1453
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,360
But I've been joking with you.

1454
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,640
I should be relaxed.

1455
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,920
You can do anything like this.

1456
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,600
and make everyone happier.

1457
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,920
A lot of things are improving.

1458
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,280
It's quite interesting.

1459
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,280
I think this kind of thing

1460
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,080
in a way of joking.

1461
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,560
Or you can ask me.

1462
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,440
For example, on that night,

1463
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,480
you would ask me

1464
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,280
Do you really think he's handsome?

1465
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,760
I think he's cute.

1466
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,880
But if you get angry

1467
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,720
and shake your face,

1468
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,240
But I...

1469
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,440
I can see that you're angry.

1470
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,240
But you didn't tell me.

1471
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,360
why you're angry.

1472
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,120
If you refuse to communicate again,

1473
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,040
I'll get angry.

1474
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:22,960
Susu is really good.

1475
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,440
Yeah.

1476
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,200
And the soup has changed a lot.

1477
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,520
It made a small misunderstanding

1478
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,040
a big misunderstanding.

1479
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,960
Nothing really happened.

1480
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,280
OK, Sunny.

1481
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:37,800
Yes.

1482
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,440
Okay.

1483
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,480
Thank you, Tom.

1484
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,400
The way they get along is quite healthy.

1485
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,440
At least two people sit down

1486
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,120
Communicate.

1487
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,000
and express in time.

1488
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,600
OK.

1489
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,880
Don't beat around the bush.

1490
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,880
After every self-reflection,

1491
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,920
our relationship will go further.

1492
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,960
Yes.

1493
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,600
This is a very kind thing.

1494
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,880
Today, I was...

1495
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,480
When Tata and her brother were interviewing,

1496
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,960
when Tata and her brother interview.

1497
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,040
I dare not say anything.

1498
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,400
Everyone says you're so handsome.

1499
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,840
I knew it.

1500
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,880
Shut up!

1501
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,360
Stop talking.

1502
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,480
I'll change it slowly.

1503
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,920
Should I be angry or angry?

1504
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,360
Because it's impossible

1505
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,800
change because of a small matter.

1506
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,360
For example, your personality

1507
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,520
for over 20 years.

1508
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,080
But you can open your mouth.

1509
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,080
We can use it if we have mouth.

1510
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,120
Please.

1511
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,680
So cute.

1512
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,080
They made a promise.

1513
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,000
Yes, but I didn't want to tell you

1514
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,240
to tell you today.

1515
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,440
Tata.

1516
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,640
I think it's a small matter.

1517
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,160
She even mentioned it to me.

1518
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,280
I don't want you to be unhappy.

1519
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,120
But I think you're unhappy.

1520
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,960
I'm quite happy.

1521
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,680
You're happy when I'm not happy.

1522
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,800
Why?

1523
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,400
Because you care about it.

1524
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,640
Okay.

1525
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,960
Did they already order this much?

1526
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,880
I don't know.

1527
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:57,960
When I came back,

1528
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,520
I was hesitant.

1529
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,680
Should I say it?

1530
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,000
No.

1531
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,800
I went to find you.

1532
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,960
and didn't find you.

1533
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,440
Why are you looking for me?

1534
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,480
I want to stay with you.

1535
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:07,840
You want to stay with me?

1536
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,800
Why didn't you stay with me in the car?

1537
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,560
You two stay.

1538
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,400
Let him stay.

1539
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
General.

1540
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,720
I hold a grudge.

1541
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,560
I'm sorry.

1542
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,600
No.

1543
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,040
I didn't expect to be jealous.

1544
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,480
I'm not jealous.

1545
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,320
I think

1546
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,520
you only care about your feelings.

1547
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,000
You don't care about my feelings.

1548
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,160
When I made you uncomfortable,

1549
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,040
when I made you uncomfortable.

1550
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,120
When you make me uncomfortable,

1551
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,840
I'm normal.

1552
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,360
I'm narrow-minded.

1553
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,640
I'm not that petty.

1554
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,320
I praised myself.

1555
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,880
I didn't praise myself.

1556
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,560
I just stepped on it.

1557
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,320
Okay.

1558
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,160
But you didn't

1559
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,280
because I sent you

1560
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,480
because I didn't text you today.

1561
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,680
No, I think you care about the details.

1562
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,080
I'm not upset.

1563
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,080
I've been sending you a message.

1564
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,360
Because

1565
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,840
I'm not sure

1566
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,720
if you will...

1567
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,440
I don't know other words.

1568
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:22,960
I'm not sure

1569
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,720
if you like me too.

1570
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,320
Did they just come?

1571
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,840
At 12:00 on Thursday,

1572
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,520
A party.

1573
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,600
We need to adjust the atmosphere.

1574
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,480
Funny.

1575
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,040
There's no funny part.

1576
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,760
How?

1577
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,360
Forget it.

1578
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,240
We can't be together.

1579
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,680
If you have a chance,

1580
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,360
would you want to go on a date with other boys?

1581
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,120
Love?

1582
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,680
He practiced it for me alone.

1583
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,640
Both of you are rappers.

1584
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,600
The DNA is moving.

1585
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,840
Tata.

1586
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,680
Is this a tower sleeping next to me?

1587
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,480
You can't name the soup.

1588
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,880
Let me share

1589
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,280
of your brothers.

1590
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,920
Okay, this is the story I'm sharing.

1591
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,720
Look.

1592
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,400
Actually, most of the time,

1593
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,160
his care and care for his sister

1594
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,920
is not good at expressing himself.

1595
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,280
Just like how our parents treat us.

1596
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm also curious behind my back.

1597
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,920
And more

1598
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,440
I'm worried about my brothers.

1599
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,240
to be hurt in love.

1600
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,360
I believe you must be a good brother.

1601
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,320
Because if your sister

1602
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,280
hurt,

1603
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,080
You're not just curious.

1604
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:06,680
You should

1605
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,600
to stand up for her.

1606
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,160
Right?

1607
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,160
So I have you as my brother.

1608
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,040
I think

1609
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,440
your sister can go on a date. It's approved.
