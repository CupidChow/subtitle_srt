00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,040
Come on. Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,480
Let's have a drink together.

5
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,320
Let's have a party. Let's have a drink.

6
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,360
It's fluffy like a scalp.

7
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,400
0 sugar tastes good, young and innocent.

00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,920

00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,640

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,400
It's good to see you

Love Sisters.

15
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,280
This show is called "Little Wild Wine",

16
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,000
I feel there will be a fruit immediately.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,480
It’s a show. It’s a show.

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,000
(It's a show where the sun shines.) (The sun shines.)

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
It's like

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,160

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,079
sponsored.

22
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,400
This show is made by jasmine and fragrance.

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,280
It's good. It's good.

24
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,560
sponsored the show.

25
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,480
We are

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,200
family members in love.

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,320
We're wearing pink and tender this episode.

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,560
You're right. You're right.

29
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,240
Yes.

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,440
"Look, look, look, look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look, look."

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm "da".

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,760
Look at this. Look at this.

33
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,920
Yes, I'm "da".

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,440
A week passed quickly

35
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,160
A lot happened last week

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,720
Come on. Come on.

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
Tarri and Tata.

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,520
Come on.

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,000
"Look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look."

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,840
and the emotions

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,280
of our house.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,960
and the soup.

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
Can you solve it?

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,640
Let's go. Let's go.

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,120
Come on. Come on.

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,280
It's all your fault

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,000
I think he's disappointed.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,320
He didn't want to talk to me.

49
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,440
When I was talking with Tae-seo,

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,400
You two are more like siblings.

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
and the soup.

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,200
What about you guys?

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,480
He may not want to talk today.

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,960
His eyes are red

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,680
He really breaks my heart.

56
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,360
I think he is a sincere person.

57
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,480
Susu has explained it.

58
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,800
Like this. Like this. Like this.

59
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,720
Like this. Like this.

60
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,480
After sending it,

61
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,600
I looked through the Book of Answer.

62
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,440
I was surprised.

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,160
"Look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look, look, look, look, look."

64
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,600
"Look, look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look."

65
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
You need to be more careful. You need to be careful.

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,040
(It's like this.) (It's like this.)

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
Nice shot.

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,079
It's here. It's here.

69
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,079
"Be careful, everyone." "Be careful, everyone."

70
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,760
and change the next day.

71
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,440
He needs time to digest.

72
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
Come on.

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,560
Yes cooking

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
It's like this. It's like this.

75
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,440
It's here. It's here. It's here.

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,920
Steamed rolls.

77
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,280
I'll make some glutinous rice balls.

78
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,720
and make some glutinous rice balls.

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,360
You have to make breakfast for me

80
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,400
I'll make it for you. I'll make it for you.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,880
You can do it. You can do it.

82
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,080
Okay.

83
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,000
Like this. Like this.

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,040
Okay.

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,720
Let's get started.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Look at this. Look at this.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,720
Look at this. Look at this.

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,000
Personal customization.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,480
You can have it. You can have it.

90
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,280
I want glutinous rice balls.

91
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,440
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three, three. One, two, three, three, three. One, two, three, three, three. One, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three. Okay.

92
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,400
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

93
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,120
Just four.

94
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,040
The bird's stomach.

95
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,600
It's good that you didn't say it subconsciously.

96
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,480
something else.

97
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,960
Then don't.

98
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,600
I won't.

99
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
how to cook glutinous rice balls.

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,800
The water is boiling. Put it in.

101
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
How to cook the rice balls

102
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,440
After the water boils,

103
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,360
This is the first time you answer this question.

104
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,040
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

105
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
Come on, let's do it. Let's do it.

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,040
It's like this. It's like this.

107
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,600
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

108
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,240
Sure.

109
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,400
You can do it. You can do it.

110
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,720
You can have more. You can have more.

111
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
You need to cook more. You need to cook more.

112
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,800
Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.

113
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,440
Do you hear me?

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,159
Put it there if you can.

115
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,159
Like this. Like this.

116
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,040
I think Tarri and Xinxin

117
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,720
You can see it. You can see it.

118
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,280
Come on. Come on. Come on.

119
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,080
Come on. Come on. Come on.

120
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,000
Come on, test expert.

121
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,920
It's cooked. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.

122
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,159
Come on, come on, come on.

123
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,360
It's like this.

124
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,400
It's hot. It's hot. It's hot. It's hot.

125
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,280
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

126
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,400
Come on, get a fork.

127
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,120
You don't have a name?

128
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,120
I'll call you tomorrow.

129
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,640
Let's play basketball.

130
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,360
So quiet.

131
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,120
Yes.

132
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,640
"Look, look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look, look, look."

133
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,720
After getting to know each other these days,

134
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,440
I think Xin and Harry

135
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,480
It's obvious.

136
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,960
That's what I think.

137
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,520
After all,

138
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,960
All girls are good.

139
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,080
I want to know more about them.

140
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,520
and get to know each other better.

141
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,240
If you don't do it, you'll miss it.

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,080
You'll miss it if you don't touch it.

143
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,520
Here you go. Here you go.

144
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,280
Glutinous rice balls.

145
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
What are you making?

146
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,800
I'll cook whatever you want to eat.

147
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,080
I want dumplings.

148
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,760
Okay, I'll make it for you.

149
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,760
What do you want to eat?

150
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,160
You punk.

151
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
Is it lunch now?

152
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,800
It's fast food time

153
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,760
Time for fast food.

154
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,159
Do you want dumplings?

155
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,240
Sure.

156
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,880
Don't eat dumplings.

157
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,280
You just had dumplings yesterday.

158
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,040
Make more.

159
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,720
We are starving.

160
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,560
We are just hungry.

161
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,240
Glutinous rice balls.

162
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,040
Here you go.

163
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,760
I'll steam some rolls for you.

164
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,520
What else?

165
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Tell me what you want to eat.

166
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,040
I think he went up there for...

167
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes, he doesn't mean wine.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,760
Say it.

169
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,240
What do you want to eat?

170
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,000
What do you want to eat?

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,800
Look.

172
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,760
I want to make sandwiches.

173
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,520
Or you can eat it.

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,400
some traditional projects like ours.

175
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,360
What filling is this?

176
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,080
Sesame.

177
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,320
Try it.

178
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,360
You don't like it, right?

179
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,960
Fine.

180
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,440
Try it.

181
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,120
She eats fast food every day.

182
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,480
Xin cares about Harry and Tata's interaction.

183
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
Yes.

184
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,280
I'm sure I'll cook a good meal today.

185
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
Who will cook today?

186
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,400
Or us

187
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,640
Because we didn't cook yesterday.

188
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,040
But we have to wash the dishes today

189
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,679
I have to cook and wash dishes today.

190
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,240
It's okay. I'll wash the dishes later.

191
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,320
It's okay.

192
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,080
Then I'll eat this.

193
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,000
Who cooked it?

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
I cooked it.

195
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,520
Of course. Who cooked it?

196
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,880
You want it, Xin?

197
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,120
Yes.

198
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,000
Is Su awake?

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,240
I've sent her the food.

200
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,600
Take the food.

201
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I just started to put on makeup.

202
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,880
Active again.

203
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,720
Yes.

204
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,200
Take an egg.

205
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,120
How many do you want?

206
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,360
Two.

207
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,800
That's all. One.

208
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,760
There's more in the fridge.

209
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,920
Three are fine.

210
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,520
Two for him.

211
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
I really...

212
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,040
Really.

213
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,320
Can you

214
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,200
a cup of coffee?

215
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Coffee Yes

216
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,840
Latte.

217
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,040
Add some milk in Americano.

218
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
It's just latte.

219
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,160
But I think that granny is weird.

220
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,800
Stop drinking.

221
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,120
You're so annoying.

222
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,560
Really?

223
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,480
Fine.

224
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,440
Is her brother helping Tower?

225
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,400
My real brother.

226
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,440
Hello.

227
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,200
What breakfast do you want?

228
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,440
Tu Tu made glutinous rice balls. Thank you.

229
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
Let's eat. It's not cold.

230
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,640
Do you eat glutinous rice balls with chopsticks?

231
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,040
What are you using?

232
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,240
We use spoons.

233
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,240
It seems not the same place.

234
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,640
Let me take a spoon.

235
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,360
We all take chopsticks.

236
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,880
Thank you.

237
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,280
There happens to be black glutinous rice and black sesame.

238
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,840
So I chose black sesame for you.

239
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,240
Thank you.

240
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,880
I bought the rice.

241
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,600
I was really happy after the picture came back.

242
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,280
Tu won't make me envy others.

243
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,040
I will have my own breakfast.

244
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,040
I think he wants to make up for it.

245
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,600
Maybe he didn't receive his message the other day.

246
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,520
He didn't want me to be disappointed.

247
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:41,920
Yes.

248
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,160
So I'm quite touched.

249
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,360
The rice is delicious.

250
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,080
Do you want some?

251
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,400
Sure.

252
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,600
Thank you.

253
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He's actually paying attention to Hua's emotions.

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,720
He seems to realize that Hua is not happy.

255
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,120
Hello.

256
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,760
Have you had breakfast?

257
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,360
Not yet.

258
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,320
Xiao Ling, have you had breakfast?

259
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,040
No.

260
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,240
What do you want to eat?

261
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,640
Eat whatever you have.

262
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,680
Sandwich.

263
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,520
Sure, no problem.

264
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,280
OK?

265
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,360
Yes, thank you.

266
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,760
I'll fry more eggs.

267
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,800
My good roommate in China.

268
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,280
Xiao Ling.

269
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,160
Thank you.

270
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm so happy.

271
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,320
Yes.

272
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,600
I'm happy again.

273
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,640
Bowl.

274
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
The dark flow is flowing.

275
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,760
You feel that in this kitchen,

276
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,160
everything is possible.

277
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,000
Why aren't you wearing gloves?

278
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm not used to wearing gloves.

279
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,360
Did the soup cry all night?

280
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,600
Your eyes are swollen.

281
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,320
"Prince of Depression."

282
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,400
You go this way and I'll wash.

283
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,560
Okay.

284
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,920
That's a bonus.

285
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,000
Tae-seo, wash the dishes.

286
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,160
No, I washed the pagoda.

287
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,880
I just washed the rest.

288
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,080
That's a bonus.

289
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,760
You even praised others.

290
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,080
I sent a message.

291
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,240
I texted you.

292
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,560
Why didn't I?

293
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,120
Boys.

294
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,880
This is important.

295
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,600
It's going to crack.

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,400
Make a decision carefully.

297
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,760
Who are you sending it to?

298
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,440
Guess. I won't tell you.

299
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,360
I know who it is.

300
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,120
She's the girl

301
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,080
I want to know more about.

302
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,400
I didn't think too much.

303
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,360
I sent it right away.

304
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,880
Are you done?

305
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,200
So soon?

306
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
Just name it.

307
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,360
Fatty is still hesitating.

308
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,680
What's there to worry about?

309
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,960
He's thinking about Hua or Xiao Ling.

310
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,600
When a boy makes a choice,

311
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,200
When inviting girls to a date,

312
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,680
Because I think

313
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,640
is more difficult than a heart message.

314
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,480
After all, it's a big date.

315
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,560
Will you choose Susu firmly?

316
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,440
or

317
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,760
try to approach other girls?

318
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,080
Soup.

319
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,640
On the soup.

320
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,160
Please choose Susu.

321
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,840
Yes.

322
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,560
I'm done.

323
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,280
Are you still thinking

324
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,000
Because of that.

325
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,240
I didn't pick him yesterday.

326
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,440
I have a clear goal.

327
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,200
But I dare not send it.

328
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,080
I'm not hesitating.

329
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,240
I'm afraid today.

330
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,400
I was hesitant and scared.

331
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,000
Afraid of being rejected.

332
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,840
I really want to escape from this place.

333
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm done.

334
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,640
The map must choose the tower.

335
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,360
I received a message yesterday.

336
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,760
It's too hard.

337
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,800
I want to get to know Xiaoling as soon as possible.

338
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
But I instinctively

339
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
to talk to Hua.

340
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,320
with Hua.

341
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,800
So when I texted her today,

342
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,360
I was in a dilemma.

343
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,760
He really listened.

344
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,560
Hua asked him to get to know other girls first.

345
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,400
and then pick me.

346
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,960
He really went to find out.

347
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,240
That straight man.

348
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,440
Forget it. Don't think too much.

349
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,720
This is the first week.

350
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,560
It's a formal first date.

351
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,600
Let's guess

352
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,400
our first guardian date.

353
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,040
will the boys choose

354
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,600
to send an invitation to?

355
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,920
Do you think the soup will shrink?

356
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,440
He won't.

357
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,640
He has no way out.

358
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,480
No.

359
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,080
Where's Harry?

360
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,280
Harry will definitely invite us.

361
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,000
A formula tower.

362
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,600
Harry has already...

363
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,400
basically the scale

364
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,320
Very obvious.

365
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,400
Tata.

366
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,880
At the beginning

367
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,160
at the fridge,

368
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,000
he didn't look at Xinxin.

369
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
He avoided it.

370
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,520
Then in the corner of the kitchen,

371
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,960
when he was looking at his phone,

372
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,280
Xinxin was talking to him.

373
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,440
He even moved

374
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,760
by the side.

375
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,680
Yes.

376
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,280
So I think

377
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,440
the cruel thing is

378
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,840
that they were in the same place.

379
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
It was two or three days ago.

380
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,240
two or three days ago.

381
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,000
Now the female lead has changed.

382
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,080
in the same place.

383
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,800
This is right.

384
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,520
familiar formula.

385
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,480
Yes.

386
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,839
What Fatty meant just now.

387
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,640
It sounds like you need to understand.

388
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,400
Yes.

389
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,680
He's struggling.

390
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,119
But he expressed that he likes flowers.

391
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,480
I think he likes flowers too.

392
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,800
I think he'll send it to Xiaoling.

393
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,880
Yes, when the last time

394
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,760
I want to get to know her soon.

395
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Forget it.

396
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,079
I'll write Xiaoling.

397
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,560
Hua will understand.

398
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,359
Where is the map?

399
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,319
Map. Tata.

400
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,160
I don't think there's anyone else besides Tata.

401
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,520
I don't know about Terri.

402
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,720
I think either Xin

403
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,440
or Hua.

404
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,960
But it's more likely to be flowers.

405
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,160
Because in the sports day,

406
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,960
we came to see

407
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,360
(if the flowers are in good luck.)

408
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,680
Depressed siblings.

409
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,760
"The River of Heart".

410
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,080
He doesn't want to know about Xiaoling, does he?

411
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,120
Can you play Jay Chou's song?

412
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,080
I don't know how to make soup.

413
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,720
Soup party.

414
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,120
Yes.

415
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,080
Who plays well?

416
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,920
I don't know.

417
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,080
I don't know him.

418
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,120
Okay.

419
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,760
Yes.

420
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,520
Okay.

421
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,160
Got it in a second.

422
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,400
Come on.

423
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,800
Let's play Yuno. I won.

424
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,680
What do you mean?

425
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,520
Any punishment?

426
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,560
You decide.

427
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,920
Ask each other a question.

428
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,360
Sure.

429
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,080
But what happens in the house

430
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,480
Okay.

431
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,920
Okay.

432
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,320
There's no blue one.

433
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:27,960
Okay.

434
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,960
Okay, go ahead.

435
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,480
Who did you send the message to on the first day?

436
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,400
You said before you came in.

437
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,880
Of course it was my first night here.

438
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,440
I sent it to you.

439
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,120
Really?

440
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,160
Thank you.

441
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,400
Yes, she welcomes him.

442
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,840
Okay.

443
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,320
Now we are

444
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,920
The winner can ask the loser.

445
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,360
What happened in the house

446
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,240
is what he wants to know the most.

447
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,160
Yes, I want to know that.

448
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,480
Don't you want to ask me about Huahua?

449
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,640
Don't you want to ask me about Xinxin?

450
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,560
Yes.

451
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,080
What do you want to ask me?

452
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,960
Okay, don't let Xiaoling hear it.

453
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,040
Why?

454
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,360
Why is he hiding it?

455
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,800
Yes.

456
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,480
I need to get some information.

457
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,320
What are you doing? A privilege?

458
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,880
After so many days of contact,

459
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,120
no girl in your room

460
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,560
in your heart?

461
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,360
Got it.

462
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,520
I think there's a tie.

463
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Together.

464
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,880
You're so loud.

465
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,240
You're tied first.

466
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,360
Ling and Tata.

467
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,640
Xiao Ling and Tata.

468
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
Okay.

469
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,640
I mean it.

470
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm not lying.

471
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,840
Okay.

472
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,760
Share it.

473
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,720
There's nothing to share.

474
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,400
My voice was so loud and scary.

475
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,240
I think there's a tie.

476
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,880
You can't ask. No.

477
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,240
We can't discuss it in public.

478
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,520
Come on. Be my buyer.

479
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,280
Let's go.

480
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,080
It's okay. Let's fight one-on-one.

481
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,760
Okay.

482
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,840
You two choose.

483
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,360
This one.

484
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,120
I have no choice. I don't have that card.

485
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,000
Come on, ask him.

486
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,880
Let me ask you.

487
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,680
Come on.

488
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,360
What do you want to ask?

489
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,640
Of course, you didn't win.

490
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,560
What are you playing?

491
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Talk to him.

492
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,400
Join us.

493
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,080
Come on.

494
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,800
Since you entered the house,

495
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,720
since you entered the house?

496
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,080
So far, right?

497
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,080
I think so.

498
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
Flower.

499
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,000
After getting close,

500
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,960
Okay.

501
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,520
Hua.

502
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,320
You're back.

503
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,760
He's shy.

504
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,080
I asked a very normal question.

505
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,760
Do you want to play?

506
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,560
Come on.

507
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,480
If there are more people,

508
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,400
let's do this.

509
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,360
First, ask second.

510
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,120
Second, ask the third.

511
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,840
Third, ask fourth.

512
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,840
Second.

513
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
"Prince of Depression."

514
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,520
Why is he more handsome?

515
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,680
Depression is the best medicine for men.

516
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,880
She came to me yesterday

517
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,320
Anyway,

518
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,480
I think I'm 550.

519
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,960
I think

520
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
to make a choice.

521
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,560
It's over.

522
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,120
Look at the last card left.

523
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,600
One, two, three, four, five.

524
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,640
One question.

525
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,000
Okay.

526
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,920
Let's go.

527
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,680
It's nothing.

528
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,920
Soup and Susu.

529
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,200
Are you going both ways now?

530
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,320
No cage.

531
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,200
You asked me how I feel, right?

532
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,600
Yes.

533
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,400
I think so.

534
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,520
Come on.

535
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,720
Based on your feeling,

536
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
who do you think Tata is interested in now?

537
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,800
I think she will choose

538
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Harry.

539
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,160
Because I think

540
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,200
they might know more about each other.

541
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,400
Now you may be far from the tower.

542
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,840
or Xin?

543
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,800
Tata.

544
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,120
We haven't...

545
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,920
We are already

546
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,520
friends.

547
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:36,920
Yes.

548
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,840
Very good.

549
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,360
Really?

550
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,400
I didn't notice.

551
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
You just found out?

552
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,120
I thought you still had feelings for her.

553
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,840
No.

554
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,400
Right now,

555
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,760
You don't know what's more exciting.

556
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,360
I don't know what's more exciting.

557
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:49,800
Yes.

558
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,000
Xin, do you want to play?

559
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,400
Yes.

560
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,880
Okay.

561
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,880
Turn red.

562
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,440
Okay.

563
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,360
Red.

564
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,800
Really.

565
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,840
One, two, three, four, five, six.

566
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,240
Choose.

567
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,840
OK.

568
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,680
Let's go, Xinxin.

569
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,760
Ask me.

570
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,720
Where to ask?

571
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,080
Just here.

572
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,240
Who did you text yesterday?

573
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,680
Harry.

574
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,520
Okay, that's all.

575
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,560
What a boring question.

576
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,800
She said my question was boring.

577
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,280
After your date with Susu yesterday,

578
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,080
Except Susu,

579
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,160
do you want to

580
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,600
do you want to know more?

581
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,400
Actually, I want to know.

582
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,160
Because

583
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,920
All

584
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,880
Because I've never touched

585
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,520
First,

586
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,960
except Susu.

587
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,120
I think it's Hua Hua.

588
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,960
What should I ask?

589
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,120
Go ahead.

590
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,960
You?

591
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,120
You've been staying here for so many days.

592
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,080
all the boys

593
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,720
who are you most interested in?

594
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,640
So straightforward.

595
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,360
You got double arrows so fast.

596
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm sweating.

597
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,640
Why is it red again?

598
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
I'm warm again.

599
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,520
The questions they asked are tricky.

600
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,120
Is it sharp?

601
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,960
Yes.

602
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm sweating.

603
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,640
I'm sweating.

604
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,760
It's warm

605
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,600
It's really red.

606
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,080
The color changed.

607
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,720
You look...

608
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,240
Do you still feel the same today?

609
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,880
Now?

610
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,800
I don't know.

611
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,640
The truth.

612
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,200
I really don't know.

613
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,800
In the investigation.

614
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,960
Okay.

615
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,840
This is fun.

616
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,520
This part.

617
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,360
I wish they could continue playing.

618
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,640
You were happier last afternoon.

619
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,440
or last night?

620
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,760
I'm happier with you.

621
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,280
So I sent you the message.

622
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,640
Awesome.

623
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,520
So straightforward.

624
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,080
I like it.

625
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,160
It's a good thing.

626
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,840
Stop asking.

627
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,560
I'm happier with you.

628
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,040
Boss.

629
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,520
They think it's dangerous.

630
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,920
If I don't confess,

631
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,680
if I don't confess.

632
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,320
I love this kind of straight ball.

633
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,600
That kind of fun.

634
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,240
It's not like

635
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,880
their old-fashioned stories.

636
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,160
No one knows what's inside.

637
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,200
until the last episode.

638
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,360
Yes, until the last episode.

639
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,560
It makes us feel so good.

640
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,600
Feels good.

641
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
I'm tired.

642
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,960
I might have to go to class with you.

643
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,880
Are you the only one who cares about details?

644
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,400
I think so. I can see a lot.

645
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,960
Can you understand?

646
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,400
At this stage,

647
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,560
I think I can understand it.

648
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,360
Is it that fast?

649
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:54,920
Not just that.

650
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,800
Sometimes I don't understand.

651
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,760
just don't read it.

652
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,480
Are you avoiding the problem?

653
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,200
Probably.

654
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,400
Yes, you're avoiding the problem.

655
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,520
But the best way

656
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,240
is to escape.

657
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,320
Just get to the point.

658
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,160
I mean it.

659
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,320
No, you can't say that.

660
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,840
Anyway, when something happens to me,

661
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,360
I'm going to find

662
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,680
a solution quickly.

663
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,480
Yes.

664
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,800
But I don't know if this is your personality.

665
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,200
I'll tell you too.

666
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,720
Well,

667
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,800
Dating is the most important thing.

668
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,720
If you have feelings,

669
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,360
I'll try to approach her.

670
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,200
I'll keep an eye on her

671
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,480
I'll keep an eye on her.

672
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,240
But I think

673
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,560
in a healthy relationship,

674
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,840
in a healthy relationship

675
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,960
adjust to another person

676
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,840
and solve her problems.

677
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,200
If he doesn't change,

678
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,160
we might not be together.

679
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,480
Have you figured it out?

680
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,760
I don't know. It's a bit messy.

681
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,720
I personally think

682
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,160
I think

683
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,040
Whether it's studying or not,

684
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,360
I think you can do this.

685
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,240
But love is the only thing

686
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,040
or mature.

687
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,800
You are impulsive when you should.

688
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,600
Emotions are emotional.

689
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,960
or rational.

690
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,640
Yes.

691
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,960
Funny.

692
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,240
Red.

693
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,600
Eight.

694
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,480
Oh no.

695
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,360
How many cards?

696
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,880
Five cards.

697
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,480
Let me help you.

698
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,040
Okay.

699
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,960
Add two.

700
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,600
What?

701
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,440
Nothing.

702
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,040
I didn't say anything.

703
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,800
I was scolded.

704
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,280
No.

705
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,200
You heard it wrong.

706
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,240
My ears are red.

707
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,280
You're right.

708
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
It's really awkward to stay there.

709
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,240
Who should it be?

710
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,000
to

711
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,960
Xinxin.

712
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
My turn.

713
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,480
No more cards.

714
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,600
You draw.

715
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,920
Change.

716
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,800
What color?

717
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,200
What is this?

718
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,480
Green.

719
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,480
Now I can clearly feel

720
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,360
After coming from the tower,

721
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,520
his mind and mind

722
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,800
should be on the tower.

723
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,080
Let me help you.

724
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,560
It's yours?

725
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,760
Because I'm actually

726
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,360
competitive.

727
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,640
I was a little embarrassed.

728
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,120
Xinxin was so angry that she was already...

729
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,040
It's going to explode.

730
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,720
His blood pressure is up.

731
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,680
Anyone wants to take a photo?

732
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,160
Take a photo with Xiaoling.

733
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:51,960
Three.

734
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,000
Don't say I took it.

735
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,760
Then who took it?

736
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,080
I said you wanted to do it.

737
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,480
No.

738
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,480
It's Xiao Ling.

739
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,680
Is it that obvious?

740
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,000
I was a little upset.

741
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,240
Today,

742
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,520
he didn't interact with me at all.

743
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,480
He has been interacting with Tata.

744
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,480
When he was playing games,

745
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,120
they sat next to her

746
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,520
and took photos for her.

747
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,160
And yesterday,

748
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,600
he had a date with Tata.

749
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,680
So I think

750
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,720
his feelings have changed.

751
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,160
I'm Xinxin. I can't sit still.

752
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm leaving.

753
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,520
Map, what are you doing?

754
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,360
I'm making that thing.

755
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,920
What are you doing?

756
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,200
What are you doing?

757
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,320
I feel sorry for Xinxin.

758
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,280
Let me help you.

759
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,040
Sure.

760
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,600
If you help me, do something simple.

761
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,000
Here's the mission.

762
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,520
What mission?

763
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,920
I just want you to do something simple.

764
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,680
Make candied haws.

765
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,960
Okay.

766
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,040
Dry all these strawberries.

767
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,160
and dry them with paper.

768
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,520
Okay.

769
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,200
Let's try the strawberries first.

770
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,000
Okay.

771
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Here we go.

772
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,040
No, it must be wet.

773
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,920
You can't wrap it like this.

774
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,720
Try it.

775
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,960
One more.

776
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,400
No.

777
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,360
Go on.

778
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,160
Again.

779
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,880
No.

780
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,800
No.

781
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,200
So bumpy.

782
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,720
Come on.

783
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,680
Ready.

784
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,960
Got it.

785
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,480
Good.

786
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,640
It's hard.

787
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,240
Try this. It must be delicious.

788
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,480
Really?

789
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,360
What?

790
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,640
News.

791
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,760
Look.

792
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,520
Okay, we did it.

793
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,680
You can eat the finished food later.

794
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,320
I'm looking forward to it.

795
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,960
Make a sugar-coated haws.

796
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,040
So many people are watching.

797
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
It'll be thick, right?

798
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,760
Definitely.

799
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,400
Let me do it.

800
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,320
I'm definitely more professional than you.

801
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,080
This is his mission.

802
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,520
Hurry up. Put it on the map.

803
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,080
Here.

804
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,720
Three spoons of sugar and two spoons of water.

805
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,200
Okay.

806
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,120
Okay.

807
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,920
Okay.

808
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,720
Come on, show us its crispy.

809
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,840
Thank you.

810
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,400
Wait a minute. It's a bit ugly.

811
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,920
OK. Come on.

812
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,720
Right?

813
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,800
Did you finish the mission?

814
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,320
Yes.

815
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,920
Come on, dance a victory dance.

816
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,480
A mission is coming.

817
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,560
Come here together.

818
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Boys' guardian date

819
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,480
have been invited.

820
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,920
The siblings invited by many boys

821
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,760
will be interviewed

822
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,840
to the Mirror House.

823
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,560
Through a secret conversation,

824
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,880
to decide the girl's final date.

825
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,680
So exciting.

826
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,280
You can't tell girls

827
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,160
in any way.

828
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,560
Remember to keep a secret for your date.

829
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:52,920
Okay.

830
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Explain it.

831
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,080
We have a date with five boys today.

832
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,960
There must be two invitations.

833
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,480
Then...

834
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,080
the one who decides which date

835
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,120
is decided by her siblings.

836
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,800
who will compete with me.

837
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,320
Don't sleep tonight.

838
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,240
Mirror Room.

839
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,720
I predicted it 100 percent.

840
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,560
Because I know

841
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,480
the map must choose the tower.

842
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,640
Do you want to take a rest upstairs?

843
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
Let's go.

844
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,560
I think you're going for an interview.

845
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,920
Yes.

846
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,040
I think so too.

847
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,360
Interview me.

848
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,040
It's hot.

849
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,000
Come here

850
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,560
Egg tart.

851
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,880
Thank you.

852
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,720
I was going to give it to everyone.

853
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,160
But after thinking about it,

854
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,520
I still have to be a little biased.

855
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,880
I bought 11.

856
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,360
But I don't want to give them to everyone now.

857
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,600
It's too obvious.

858
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,960
It's too obvious.

859
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,160
He prefers to give a man an egg tart.

860
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,640
Don't tell others.

861
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,960
I know.

862
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,360
Make it look good.

863
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,920
Is it good?

864
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,159
Not yet.

865
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,159
But if I were Susu, I would be angry.

866
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,239
I might wait until later.

867
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,639
I was a little angry.

868
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,520
Yes.

869
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,280
Right?

870
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,679
Call him.

871
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,159
Give him a sweeping leg.

872
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,199
Is this the legendary cold war?

873
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,080
That's it.

874
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,000
No communication.

875
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,800
Yes, we don't communicate.

876
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,960
What do you think?

877
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,320
I don't know. To be honest,

878
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
I asked the map just now.

879
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,000
Ask for me.

880
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,120
Brothers are in the heart

881
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,200
Roommate is in the heart.

882
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,080
He said he's interested in Tata.

883
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,520
I know.

884
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,240
It's obvious.

885
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,680
Interviewer.

886
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
We guess you'll be an interviewer later.

887
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,600
Really?

888
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,280
How should I put it?

889
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,960
This is a brother-in-law triangular formation.

890
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,640
Yes.

891
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,920
Roommates are different.

892
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
Anyway, I just want to say

893
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,440
what someone told me last night.

894
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,600
what someone told me last night.

895
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,000
Are you threatening me?

896
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,800
I didn't hear what you said,

897
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,640
but I know something like that.

898
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,400
It's not a threat.

899
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,560
It's just...

900
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,320
You know that, right?

901
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,920
I was accused of being a bad person.

902
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,720
I was actually a good person.

903
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,840
I don't understand.

904
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,680
But I understand.

905
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,440
No matter who it is,

906
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
I'm very strict.

907
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,840
I'll have a lot of questions.

908
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,720
I received a text message.

909
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,120
saying that I received invitations from many boys.

910
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,520
so I need my brother.

911
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,120
to be an interviewer.

912
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,280
But he just called me.

913
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,800
I actually feel

914
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,880
I'm a little lonely.

915
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,040
I hope he's here.

916
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,640
Ask her brother first.

917
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,080
It's so noisy over there.

918
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,640
Is it noisy?

919
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,560
Because I'm in the restaurant.

920
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,200
Here.

921
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,320
Can you go somewhere quiet?

922
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,240
Somewhere quiet.

923
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,040
What about now?

924
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,320
Better.

925
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,920
Let me tell you the current situation.

926
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,560
I was invited to this date

927
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,720
by many boys.

928
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,840
But I don't know who it is.

929
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
Like this?

930
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,760
Yes, but I can guess who it is.

931
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,600
Map and Harry.

932
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,960
We're going to interview them later.

933
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,040
who chose their date.

934
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,800
Then let's

935
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,320
a structural interview.

936
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,120
Just make the same question.

937
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,560
You're so smart.

938
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,320
A structural interview.

939
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,560
Sure.

940
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,480
Ask everyone.

941
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,280
OK.

942
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,400
Your side.

943
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,640
As my brother,

944
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,920
What do you want to ask?

945
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,480
The first question.

946
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,960
How was your first impression of Tata?

947
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,000
In the past few days,

948
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,280
Did Tata

949
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,040
that makes you unhappy?

950
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,920
Let me write it down.

951
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,880
What else?

952
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,760
Have you talked about love?

953
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,000
For example, love at first sight or love grows over time?

954
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,560
I talked to Harry about this.

955
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,560
This is the map.

956
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,880
You can ask if you're passive.

957
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,520
When you have a problem,

958
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,400
you want to change yourself

959
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,680
or change others?

960
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,520
Change yourself?

961
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,360
I think it's quite difficult.

962
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,800
Yes, I think.

963
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,360
We can

964
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,800
more specific.

965
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
In the past relationship,

966
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,160
in the past relationship,

967
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,040
or accept more?

968
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,440
How can I feel

969
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,320
who treats me better?

970
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,000
You're really a brother.

971
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,880
If I had a sister,

972
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,560
I'll prepare 160 questions too.

973
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,480
If there's a problem, do we communicate right away?

974
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,640
It will take some time to calm down.

975
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,280
to communicate.

976
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,760
what the people around you

977
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,440
the people around you?

978
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,480
Say one to two words.

979
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,400
OK.

980
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,200
Anything else to add?

981
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,040
I think it's almost done.

982
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,600
Almost.

983
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,320
Let's wait and see.

984
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,160
Bye.

985
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,600
Okay, bye.

986
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,160
Bye.

987
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,360
So this is a one-sided mirror.

988
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,080
Two spaces apart.

989
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,960
Yes.

990
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,080
The interviewee can't see the interviewee.

991
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,280
Are you ready?

992
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,800
I have a few questions for you.

993
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,960
Are you ready?

994
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,680
I have a few questions for you.

995
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,400
I can hear you.

996
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:17,960
Come on.

997
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,840
Okay.

998
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,360
Hello.

999
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,720
I'm nervous.

1000
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,680
I'm afraid they might find out that I'm not my brother.

1001
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,160
I'm not my brother.

1002
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,800
I think

1003
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,920
you can see

1004
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,960
their physical expressions and expressions.

1005
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,240
This will be more real.

1006
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,400
Here's the map.

1007
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,040
In the snow activity,

1008
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,880
I think I get along well with Tata.

1009
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,680
Trust me, Tata.

1010
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,880
Come on.

1011
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,560
I want to know more about

1012
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,520
what kind of state

1013
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,040
when she's on a date?

1014
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,440
Hello, Tu.

1015
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,720
Can you hear me?

1016
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,400
Hello, Tu.

1017
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,120
Can you hear me?

1018
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,680
Hello.

1019
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,400
I can hear you.

1020
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,800
I have a few questions for you.

1021
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,800
First, what was your first impression of Tata?

1022
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,360
I think she is

1023
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,240
a very quiet girl.

1024
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,200
Did anything affect your mood?

1025
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
I think it's more about happiness.

1026
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,040
Well,

1027
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,360
when we were in the same group

1028
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,720
and went to the competition together,

1029
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,800
During the competition,

1030
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,480
we were very immersed.

1031
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,080
She was the first.

1032
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,600
and slipped in the front.

1033
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,840
She turned around and looked this way.

1034
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,360
It made me very happy.

1035
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,880
I'm reporting it seriously.

1036
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,240
It's like an interview.

1037
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,720
If you quarrel with him,

1038
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,200
will you take the initiative

1039
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,360
or

1040
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,200
you'll be calming down.

1041
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
I don't like cold violence.

1042
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,560
I think we can calm down.

1043
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,440
How long do you think

1044
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,640
for you to calm down?

1045
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,400
I like to solve something right away.

1046
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,880
For example,

1047
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,720
maybe we quarreled

1048
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,680
at lunch

1049
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,640
or something is wrong.

1050
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,240
I think we can communicate in the afternoon.

1051
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,040
Will you like rational

1052
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,480
Or

1053
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,840
the kind of lovey-dovey

1054
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,400
I don't like it.

1055
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,640
We're always together.

1056
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,040
Personally, I don't like

1057
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,920
to report everything.

1058
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,400
His answer is a little surprising.

1059
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,600
Maybe in the future,

1060
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,680
in the future,

1061
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,760
we have some conflicts.

1062
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,880
If you fail

1063
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,800
the date successfully,

1064
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,320
how would you feel and feel?

1065
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,080
Be confident in yourself.

1066
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,440
And you can't restrict her too much.

1067
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,920
Okay, it's done.

1068
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,560
Thank you.

1069
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,880
Okay.

1070
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,600
Thank you.

1071
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,600
The answer is very standard.

1072
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,200
You really look like a good student.

1073
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Yes.

1074
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,440
After these two days,

1075
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,360
I had a good chat with Tata.

1076
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,200
I might get closer to him.

1077
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,320
I'm someone

1078
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,280
I was chosen by you by accident,

1079
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,200
Or did you just want to give me

1080
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,120
I guessed.

1081
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:48,800
Here.

1082
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,760
Okay.

1083
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,720
You're in my heart, aren't you?

1084
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,080
No.

1085
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,880
Suddenly

1086
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,160
I thought it was thundering.

1087
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,400
What was that?

1088
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,040
So I want to try

1089
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,480
to get to know more about it.

1090
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,760
and spend more time with him.

1091
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,160
Did he think they couldn't see him?

1092
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,920
He's here.

1093
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,160
Yes. He thought he couldn't see.

1094
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,160
Hello.

1095
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,720
Hello.

1096
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,120
Are you ready, Harry?

1097
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,880
Wait.

1098
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,160
I'm ready.

1099
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Come on.

1100
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,920
I have a few questions for you.

1101
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,120
First of all,

1102
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,920
your first impression of Tata.

1103
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,080
I think...

1104
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,160
To be honest,

1105
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,640
you've grown to my point.

1106
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,080
Like Terri said,

1107
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,160
Su Su has reached his point.

1108
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,800
I think so too.

1109
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,920
He purposely mentioned Terri.

1110
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,440
He thought Tarri was sitting inside.

1111
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,520
In terms of personality,

1112
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,200
I think she is a quiet

1113
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,600
In one word,

1114
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,520
I think she is

1115
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,680
who can't express herself

1116
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,160
in front of people.

1117
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,480
will need more care.

1118
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,640
Even if

1119
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,000
when she wants to eat,

1120
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,960
she won't say she wants more.

1121
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,760
She will eat it if you make it for her.

1122
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
If you didn't,

1123
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,120
she wouldn't have said this.

1124
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,280
or do something else

1125
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,320
or do something else quietly.

1126
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,440
I'm so happy.

1127
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,920
The corners of your mouth are here.

1128
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,040
Details.

1129
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,440
Yes, details.

1130
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,720
Did anything affect your mood

1131
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,240
did anything affect your mood?

1132
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,840
Let's talk about our date yesterday.

1133
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,000
I was very nervous.

1134
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,440
At that time,

1135
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,080
I was a little nervous sitting there.

1136
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,160
I feel better

1137
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,080
after the chat.

1138
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,600
I think I can help her.

1139
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,520
I think this is a happy thing.

1140
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,200
Not really.

1141
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,880
Actually, I'm quite embarrassed.

1142
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,200
to return the card.

1143
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,360
And then...

1144
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,600
Like when I texted her yesterday,

1145
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,320
but she didn't reply.

1146
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,600
She must be a little disappointed.

1147
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,560
But

1148
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,320
from an objective perspective,

1149
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,200
I think I can understand.

1150
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,400
Yes.

1151
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,480
Do you talk to each other

1152
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,240
or

1153
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,120
you need to calm yourself down?

1154
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,920
I'll try.

1155
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,320
I'll coax my other half first.

1156
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,440
and then talk to her

1157
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,120
before communicating with her.

1158
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,560
If she really pissed me off,

1159
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,040
I said...

1160
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,800
Okay.

1161
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,480
Wait for me.

1162
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,120
Wait for me. Let me calm down for ten minutes.

1163
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,680
Then I'll talk to you about this.

1164
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,120
I think my calming period

1165
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,200
for more than 10 to 20 minutes.

1166
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,160
Yes.

1167
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,520
Then you'll like

1168
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,920
Your other half is clingy.

1169
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,760
Would you mind?

1170
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,520
I can only say if the other half is clingy,

1171
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,760
I'll be more clingy than the other half.

1172
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,240
Bingo!

1173
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,960
Awesome.

1174
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,240
Full marks.

1175
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,560
Full marks.

1176
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,360
Are you

1177
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,000
you always report to each other.

1178
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,120
Say something like this.

1179
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,520
I don't think

1180
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,920
is not appropriate.

1181
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,320
I think I'm more like sharing.

1182
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,360
I agree.

1183
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,400
I agree.

1184
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,760
Woman's heart.

1185
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,360
Awesome.

1186
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,120
That's good.

1187
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,880
Happy.

1188
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,800
I don't know.

1189
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,520
Well,

1190
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,840
After he said that,

1191
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,080
I was comparing

1192
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,400
compared with the map.

1193
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,200
It's a big difference

1194
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,040
is quite different.

1195
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,480
Actually his idea and my expectation

1196
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,080
is more...

1197
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,240
When I hear this answer,

1198
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,440
when I hear this answer.

1199
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,800
Very satisfied.

1200
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,160
You are devoted in love.

1201
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,680
or acceptance type?

1202
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,320
I'm only devoted in love.

1203
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,040
acceptance type

1204
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,320
has nothing to do with me.

1205
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,800
I can only say

1206
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,440
If Tata didn't choose you in the end,

1207
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,320
how would you feel and feel?

1208
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,240
You didn't choose me.

1209
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,400
Of course.

1210
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,720
He must be unhappy.

1211
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,440
I guess I won't

1212
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,000
with other girls

1213
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,320
with each other,

1214
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,080
is over.

1215
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,520
Actually, it's over for me.

1216
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,400
Okay, got it.

1217
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,040
Okay.

1218
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,560
Thank you.

1219
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,040
Bye.

1220
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,440
So sure?

1221
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,640
Really?

1222
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,680
He thought it was Terri.

1223
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,720
But somehow,

1224
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,600
Tata interviewed herself.

1225
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,880
It's fate.

1226
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,160
Harry really didn't

1227
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,520
for himself.

1228
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,240
Yes.

1229
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,320
He did his best.

1230
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:20,640
He did his best.

1231
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,560
He did everything.

1232
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,800
Harry is crazy.

1233
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,480
HAVE GREATF is full.

1234
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,040
I learned

1235
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,440
Even the passing ants will fall in love.

1236
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,880
You deserve it.

1237
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,120
The picture was a bit different from Harry.

1238
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,080
whether they're in a relationship or not.

1239
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,840
on this question,

1240
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,360
in this question.

1241
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,680
Are you two

1242
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,680
in love?

1243
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,160
I look a bit like the picture.

1244
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,120
I hope we can be independent.

1245
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,040
But unfortunately,

1246
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,600
I met a clingy husband.

1247
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,920
My husband is really

1248
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,760
who always drags me along.

1249
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,000
But later you will find that

1250
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
it's good to have a clingy husband.

1251
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,000
He gives you a lot of sense of security.

1252
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,600
You'll be remembered

1253
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,680
and be needed.

1254
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,560
And gradually,

1255
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,960
I'll become more flexible.

1256
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,880
Little woman

1257
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,800
Because I'm a lion girl

1258
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,600
Business type.

1259
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,280
VE GREA. I can tell.

1260
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,800
Is it that obvious?

1261
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,760
No, just very (similar).

1262
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,000
It's like fire.

1263
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,360
Yes, in love,

1264
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,040
People change.

1265
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,600
I'm so happy.

1266
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,920
Because I want to be with each other

1267
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,200
only when you love each other, right?

1268
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,160
Yes.

1269
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:13,720
I'm not clingy.

1270
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,320
But I like being clingy.

1271
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,680
The feeling of being needed.

1272
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,640
Yes.

1273
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,760
Look at us.

1274
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,240
the same.

1275
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:20,800
Aries.

1276
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,600
I think you should be a clingy husband.

1277
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,080
I'm clingy.

1278
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,280
I'm not only clingy to my wife,

1279
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,720
I'm also very clingy.

1280
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,120
Maybe when I passed by my mom,

1281
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,400
you will cherish it.

1282
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,600
You're afraid of losing.

1283
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,080
For example, when I take a plane,

1284
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,600
I will tell my wife that I love you.

1285
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,520
and say it every night. Yes.

1286
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,360
Because you're scared.

1287
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,520
I don't know what will happen tomorrow.

1288
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,200
Yes.

1289
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,200
So you cherish every minute and every second.

1290
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,360
I'm sticky too.

1291
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,600
Really.

1292
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,640
What are you doing without sticking?

1293
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,520
Yes.

1294
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,760
Why don't you stick together

1295
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,200
Yes.

1296
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
But my stickiness should be good too.

1297
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,440
For example, when we work,

1298
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,440
we'll leave space for each other.

1299
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,320
Me too.

1300
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,520
And I'll be the same.

1301
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,400
I hope they're clingy too.

1302
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,440
Two mouse pads.

1303
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,320
I can't pull my hands out.

1304
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,560
So what Zun said just now,

1305
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,360
before the plane takes off.

1306
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,640
Because I'm the same.

1307
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,840
I hope we can meet more.

1308
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,200
Because I like the feeling of being together.

1309
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,080
Compared with video messages every day,

1310
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,720
than video messages every day.

1311
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,920
in the same space

1312
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,480
in the same space.

1313
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,160
I'm sticky.

1314
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,320
Really.

1315
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:23,960
Yes, very.

1316
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,200
I don't think girls can get close to me.

1317
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,440
Anyway, I can't accept

1318
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,160
I can't accept their indifference.

1319
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,320
If girls keep telling you

1320
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,720
I need some space.

1321
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,440
Don't be so clingy.

1322
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,320
If I think it makes sense,

1323
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,560
I think

1324
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,720
I think

1325
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,320
to respect each other.

1326
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,640
I'm the "sticky" type.

1327
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,920
"Sticky" should be called

1328
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,960
Sticky.

1329
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,840
Sticky means the same thing.

1330
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,680
So it's still sticky.

1331
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,000
Whatever.

1332
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,160
At least sticky and sharing.

1333
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,720
represents caring and love.

1334
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,640
Yes.

1335
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,480
Yes.

1336
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,320
Drink some wine

1337
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,400
That's how I feel.

1338
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,560
Carry me.

1339
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,600
Actually, the recipe just now

1340
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,680
called "Miss You".

1341
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,560
Remember I miss you all the time.

1342
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,400
It's obvious who you're with.

1343
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,600
Yes.

1344
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,200
I was chosen.

1345
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,320
He must be happy.

1346
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,400
The result is good.

1347
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,400
The process is also important.

1348
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,360
My heart is upside down.

1349
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,560
It looks like an AK that can't be suppressed.

1350
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,760
I want to find a place to calm down.

1351
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,760
Run!

1352
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,080
Run!

1353
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,400
Too many people.

1354
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,600
So excited.

1355
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,040
So nervous.

1356
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,240
I...

1357
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,520
to visit my roommate.

1358
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,760
He feels like he won the grand prize.

1359
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,640
Yes.

1360
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,000
What do you think?

1361
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,480
I think it's quite different.

1362
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,920
Yeah, me too.

1363
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,880
Their answers are the opposite.

1364
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,000
Yes, the map said

1365
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,440
Before we set off,

1366
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,880
he wanted to invite?

1367
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,280
He said

1368
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,680
he was also very confused.

1369
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,520
If it wasn't you and him

1370
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
not you and him,

1371
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,760
Maybe he had fun

1372
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,520
with another girl.

1373
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,920
Then he'll continue to get along.

1374
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,240
After hearing Harry's answer,

1375
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,680
I was impressed.

1376
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,480
It's all very sincere.

1377
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,440
I can feel more confident.

1378
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,600
I think Harry Picture

1379
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,200
is more determined to choose me.

1380
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,920
In terms of the date,

1381
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,000
I would suggest

1382
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,920
than Harry.

1383
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,600
Okay.

1384
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,600
I think

1385
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,000
Harry wants this chance more.

1386
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,600
I feel like he's firmly choosing me.

1387
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,800
Where's my roommate?

1388
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,760
What are you doing, Mom?

1389
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,680
Today is the time for us to pick a date.

1390
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,560
I chose the same person.

1391
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,400
Now I know she chose me.

1392
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,920
I want to tell you

1393
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,720
I'm very nervous and thrilling.

1394
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,200
Do you have anything to say?

1395
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,520
I've never experienced it. I don't know.

1396
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,720
Share it with mom

1397
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,560
It's really good.

1398
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,240
Aren't you going to be happy for me?

1399
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,080
I'm happy for you.

1400
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,000
Don't be too deliberate.

1401
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,880
Too pretentious.

1402
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,640
or the real me?

1403
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,520
Let me tell you.

1404
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,080
I've never been so sincere in my life.

1405
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,440
I've never been so sincere in my life.

1406
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,600
I think I've said everything I can.

1407
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,840
Just you two?

1408
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:53,880
Of course.

1409
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,160
Can I take my sister there?

1410
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,600
Can you be more composed?

1411
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,880
Why do I feel that you are very excited now?

1412
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,640
Excited.

1413
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,520
You have no idea

1414
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,480
I've been depressed for days.

1415
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,280
Bring the girl you like.

1416
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,760
I'll treat you to dinner tomorrow. Be calm.

1417
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,960
I feel so calm that I can't be calm anymore.

1418
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,480
I'm so excited to hear that.

1419
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,480
Because I just got the news.

1420
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,120
Choose me.

1421
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,320
I've been depressed for two days.

1422
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,240
You treat someone to dinner tomorrow.

1423
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,920
Be polite.

1424
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,920
Be a gentleman.

1425
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,040
and show your excellent side.

1426
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,360
Okay.

1427
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,200
I plan to take her to play rugby tomorrow.

1428
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,120
A girl shouldn't play rugby.

1429
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,760
Don't tire her out.

1430
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,240
Okay, bye.

1431
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,000
Bye.

1432
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,440
So cute.

1433
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,000
But they are close.

1434
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,720
When he had this news,

1435
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,120
he would share it with his parents.

1436
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:37,840
Really?

1437
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,600
Does anyone know where the soup is?

1438
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,640
Can anyone talk to me?

1439
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,320
He has two candidates.

1440
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,400
One is...

1441
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,320
Xiao Ling.

1442
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,520
And Xiao Ling. Yes.

1443
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,120
It's quite painful.

1444
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,360
Because I doubt myself.

1445
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,640
After I fail,

1446
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,240
I feel a sense of defeat.

1447
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,760
I'll go upstairs.

1448
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,960
I didn't expect to be an interviewer.

1449
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,080
Because from the text

1450
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,600
a few days ago,

1451
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,360
there's no one else to choose except for one day.

1452
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,640
There was a man

1453
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,920
chose my brothers.

1454
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,720
I didn't expect my brothers

1455
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,120
two invitations.

1456
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,400
I love the soup.

1457
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,760
When I texted you today,

1458
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,720
I was struggling.

1459
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,360
I want to get to know Xiaoling as soon as possible.

1460
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:02,920
It's so funny.

1461
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,640
He knows it's soup.

1462
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,120
I'm sure he knows.

1463
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,880
Yes.

1464
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,160
Hello.

1465
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,880
You can tell us

1466
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,520
why you want to ask Xiao Ling out.

1467
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,920
I think

1468
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,200
she's good-looking.

1469
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,920
Second, I think

1470
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,440
when she smiles,

1471
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,920
and her personality

1472
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,760
I think

1473
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,960
with a good personality.

1474
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,880
So I want to know more about

1475
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,840
What will you do

1476
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,320
what will you do?

1477
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,520
Soul torture, right?

1478
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,720
Difference?

1479
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,320
Actually,

1480
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,520
in love,

1481
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,520
I should be more rational.

1482
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,760
If there are disagreements,

1483
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,080
I can obey most of the things

1484
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,400
or listen to the other half.

1485
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,360
But I will also express my thoughts.

1486
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,680
I like it more.

1487
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,520
I like discussion and discussion.

1488
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,320
After a few days of contact with Xiaoling,

1489
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:25,120
do you think

1490
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,480
to choose Xiaoling?

1491
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,880
That's a good question.

1492
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,800
When I first saw Xiaoling,

1493
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,720
she was a girl

1494
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,160
very much.

1495
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,680
I've been looking for a chance to get in touch with her.

1496
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,200
But due to the time,

1497
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,840
yesterday's sports meeting was the first time

1498
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,280
I had a chat and contact with her.

1499
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,080
So I'm saying I was firm at the beginning.

1500
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,200
Now I think

1501
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:54,520
This is...

1502
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:55,640
This is...

1503
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,440
This is wrong.

1504
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,880
You can feel her.

1505
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,840
the happy moment in your heart.

1506
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,840
and the difference

1507
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,280
when she's happy?

1508
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,520
They all know how to ask.

1509
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,960
Actually the questions about soup

1510
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,520
are very specific.

1511
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,760
It's hard.

1512
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,760
I got him.

1513
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,280
I don't think he can sense it now.

1514
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,160
So honest.

1515
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:34,960
I like their honesty.

1516
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,400
Sincerity. Good.

1517
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,000
Her brother asked a high question.

1518
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,960
There's nothing we can do.

1519
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,400
I don't know.

1520
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,680
Because I don't know her yet.

1521
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,880
I'm still

1522
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,720
at an initial stage.

1523
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,920
I don't know much about it.

1524
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,000
That's why I chose this date.

1525
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,600
I want to know more about it.

1526
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,120
Because she

1527
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,920
She's not an outdoor type.

1528
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,960
Yes.

1529
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,000
If Xiao Ling didn't choose you,

1530
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,240
what would you think?

1531
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,200
If she didn't choose to go on a date with me,

1532
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,640
maybe she thinks

1533
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,040
I'd be better friends with her.

1534
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,800
I think this result is also good.

1535
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,800
I feel very happy

1536
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,600
I also feel very happy.

1537
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,000
This is also a perfect answer.

1538
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,760
From my impression of Fatty,

1539
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,280
he has been persistent.

1540
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,320
But his messages are everywhere.

1541
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,040
Sometimes,

1542
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,320
I think

1543
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,840
Fatty will like Xiaoling more.

1544
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,680
Okay, it's over.

1545
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,040
I wonder if he can learn a lesson

1546
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,720
from the last interview.

1547
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,160
I think

1548
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,720
I feel more interactions and laughter

1549
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,040
in daily life.

1550
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,440
So I want to know

1551
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,400
how she was

1552
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,960
in the activity.

1553
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,720
Hello.

1554
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,520
Please tell us

1555
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,120
why you chose Xiao Ling.

1556
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,760
as your date this time?

1557
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,720
I actually

1558
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,680
the first impression

1559
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,160
I thought

1560
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,320
I voted for Xiaoling.

1561
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,120
In the past few days,

1562
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,320
in games

1563
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,000
or eating together,

1564
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,360
I think

1565
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,200
get along well.

1566
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,800
I want to know more about you.

1567
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,600
You chose her

1568
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,120
to understand Xiaoling.

1569
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,760
Or

1570
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,160
you want to

1571
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,040
with her.

1572
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,160
I should have known it

1573
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,440
It's only been a few days because of me.

1574
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,200
I can't

1575
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,760
100 percent.

1576
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,800
I want to know more about it.

1577
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,680
You can feel

1578
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,000
when Xiaoling is really happy

1579
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,600
to cater to everyone's emotions.

1580
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,520
Is there a difference?

1581
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,400
The soup is very careful.

1582
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,440
Very careful

1583
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,240
Actually, I think

1584
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,080
when she is really happy

1585
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,520
is eating.

1586
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,560
No matter what she eats,

1587
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,680
she's willing to share with us.

1588
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,480
I can see that she's really happy

1589
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,080
to play the game she likes.

1590
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,560
At other moments,

1591
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,440
I might not be able to express her emotions.

1592
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,640
Through these days,

1593
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,320
when you've been together these days?

1594
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,200
The most exciting thing is

1595
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,240
when she was playing,

1596
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,480
when she's having fun.

1597
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,400
when she's having fun.

1598
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,360
Like what we did together.

1599
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,760
what we did together,

1600
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,480
when we look at each other,

1601
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,520
or something like that.

1602
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,000
all kinds of moments make my heart flutter.

1603
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,920
I feel Tu Tu is a little bit like a pupil now.

1604
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,400
like a primary school student now.

1605
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,360
Yes.

1606
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,520
In the process of getting along,

1607
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,800
in the process of getting along,

1608
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,080
how will you solve it?

1609
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,720
If there are disagreements,

1610
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,640
we will communicate first.

1611
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,480
Actually I am

1612
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,120
who doesn't have any opinions.

1613
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,240
Because I will adjust it

1614
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,160
or preference.

1615
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,520
I don't have any experience in love.

1616
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,400
Yes.

1617
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,720
The answer given by two boys.

1618
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,720
Fatty said he would consider girls first.

1619
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,040
But he has his own persistence.

1620
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,360
He will also

1621
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,720
to girls.

1622
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,640
I think they may take care of each other.

1623
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,080
But the answer the map gave me

1624
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,800
he prefers to girls unconditionally.

1625
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,000
I think

1626
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,200
it may be irresponsible to say this.

1627
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,640
Because you can't always suppress yourself

1628
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,240
with your unhappy emotions.

1629
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,120
We'll break up when we're depressed.

1630
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,040
So I think

1631
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,000
are quite childish.

1632
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,400
very sober and rational.

1633
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,440
I personally think

1634
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,120
Fatty answered better.

1635
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,400
Failed again.

1636
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,760
The map will doubt himself again.

1637
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,680
His experience

1638
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,560
in all aspects of his experience.

1639
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,680
From what I know about her,

1640
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,240
she's easy to get.

1641
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:05,280
She doesn't try anything

1642
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,520
because they are afraid of bad results.

1643
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,960
But I think

1644
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,280
we should start from

1645
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,200
from the perspective of liking and happiness.

1646
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,920
Pick him.

1647
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,440
Maybe from my observation these days,

1648
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,040
Xiaoling doesn't want to

1649
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,960
to get too close to Fatty.

1650
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,760
So I want Xiaoling and Tu

1651
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,640
to get to know each other more.

1652
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,400
I'm sorry, fatty.

1653
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,400
You didn't pass the interview.

1654
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,800
Now you can choose again.

1655
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,640
Even if you tell me

1656
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,480
Xiao Ling is the second choice for the drawing,

1657
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,440
Because I think

1658
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,320
it's most important for Xiaoling to like it herself.

1659
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,320
Maybe the soup

1660
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,280
is more mature in his perspective.

1661
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,280
But he changed his position

1662
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,480
his sister Xiaoling.

1663
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,040
Yes.

1664
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,400
He thinks the drawing is more suitable.

1665
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,800
He thinks Xiaoling is easy to get.

1666
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,480
Yes.

1667
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,000
The picture may make her happier.

1668
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,640
Maybe he just wants his sister

1669
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,560
go out and have fun tomorrow.

1670
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:09,960
Yes.

1671
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,920
Obviously, he made

1672
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,800
surprised all of us.

1673
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,240
He said the most mature thing

1674
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,440
and doing the most childish thing.

1675
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,240
Yes.

1676
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,160
Fatty will choose flowers.

1677
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,840
He will choose Hua.

1678
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,120
Two circles.

1679
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,320
You're here.

1680
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,240
Yes.

1681
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,160
What's wrong?

1682
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,040
Why are you here?

1683
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,200
I don't want to play anymore.

1684
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,200
I want to take a break.

1685
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,680
I didn't expect you to be like me.

1686
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,480
I'm tired too.

1687
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,520
So tired.

1688
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,200
I can't play anymore.

1689
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,360
He was a competitor just now.

1690
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,560
He suddenly came to his senses. Look.

1691
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,960
Something's on your mind.

1692
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,640
I was so happy.

1693
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,720
It's finally my turn.

1694
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,760
After I was rejected,

1695
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,320
when I knew I had the chance,

1696
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,800
I was very happy.

1697
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,440
Then I immediately

1698
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,320
the tricky questions they asked

1699
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,680
on their memo.

1700
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,480
The questions I asked them

1701
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,440
is very tricky.

1702
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,680
I'm learning it now.

1703
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,000
So cute.

1704
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,200
The Avenger Project.

1705
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,680
I'll wait for Tarri and Fatty.

1706
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,640
Let me tell you.

1707
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,600
I'll ask them.

1708
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,360
Come on.

1709
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,840
He knows who's coming.

1710
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,960
Do we have to wait so long?

1711
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,840
We don't have patience.

1712
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:17,560
Smile.

1713
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,280
So funny.

1714
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,040
I mean it.

1715
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,080
I saw Soo Ho's text.

1716
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,040
My first reaction was

1717
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:29,800
to Hua.

1718
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,440
Because yesterday, the day before yesterday,

1719
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,640
Huahua sent it to me.

1720
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,840
So today,

1721
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,200
I didn't think too much.

1722
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,200
So I sent it to her directly.

1723
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,920
Hello.

1724
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,120
Let's get started.

1725
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:49,840
Okay.

1726
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,040
What do you think attracts you?

1727
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:01,600
Oh no.

1728
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,440
The difficulty of this question

1729
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,000
to Tae-seo.

1730
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,240
I think

1731
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,160
Tell me more.

1732
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,080
We went to the snowfield a few days ago.

1733
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,120
I was in the same team with her.

1734
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:18,000
When I was in the competition,

1735
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,960
every time I win,

1736
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,880
she was very happy.

1737
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,560
cheering for me.

1738
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,160
What's your first impression of her

1739
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,360
and the changes after getting along?

1740
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,440
First impression.

1741
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,680
The girls in our house are all great.

1742
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,920
When I was in a relationship,

1743
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,480
I might look for an older sister.

1744
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,160
Maybe

1745
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,720
take care of me

1746
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,160
and tolerate me.

1747
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,640
And she really

1748
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,360
can bring me emotional value.

1749
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,960
She doesn't feel secure.

1750
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,520
Why did you provide her

1751
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,400
a sense of security?

1752
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,360
I may be a little bit in love.

1753
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:53,120
I'm mostly following my boyfriend.

1754
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,840
If you compete with others,

1755
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,160
what will you do?

1756
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,680
You may give more signals

1757
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,760
and take the initiative

1758
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,680
to win her favor.

1759
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,720
If you keep getting to know her,

1760
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,360
and find it inappropriate,

1761
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,680
or how would you react?

1762
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,160
I think I'm a straightforward person.

1763
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,000
Well,

1764
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,479
If it's true, it's inappropriate.

1765
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,240
There are things that I can't get over.

1766
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,560
I'll tell her.

1767
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,439
I don't mean to hang on to her

1768
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:30,319
and go on a date with other female guests.

1769
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:31,439
I just know

1770
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,720
Why didn't she

1771
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,240
last night?

1772
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,520
Good question.

1773
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,479
This is indeed my problem.

1774
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,840
I didn't think about it

1775
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,160
before I thought about it.

1776
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,200
At first, I thought

1777
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,680
to get in touch with every girl.

1778
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,000
and get to know each other more.

1779
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,600
After going back to the room,

1780
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,040
and played

1781
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,160
with another girl.

1782
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,800
I didn't think carefully.

1783
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,040
If she didn't choose you,

1784
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,080
what would you show?

1785
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,000
or fight for it?

1786
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,040
It depends on the number of times.

1787
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,479
I'll try again and again.

1788
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,720
But with more, I'll definitely...

1789
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,080
You know, right?

1790
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,200
Yes.

1791
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,520
Flower gives me many signals.

1792
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,399
Her siblings may hope

1793
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:24,520
her own siblings

1794
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,479
with someone you like.

1795
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:28,560
So I'm quite confident

1796
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,000
in her brother interview.

1797
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:32,920
Hello.

1798
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,319
Hello.

1799
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,200
Say our first question.

1800
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:39,760
Okay.

1801
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:40,720
First impression.

1802
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,399
after getting along with each other?

1803
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,520
Actually,

1804
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,800
my first impression of Hua

1805
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,800
to today,

1806
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,479
I don't think she has changed much.

1807
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:55,880
On the first day, I thought

1808
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,680
a nice girl.

1809
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,200
If others compete with you,

1810
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,560
what's your advantage?

1811
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,080
I think...

1812
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,240
How should I put it?

1813
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,480
I think after these days,

1814
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,320
I think I can understand her better.

1815
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,640
And we have

1816
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,840
a little tacit understanding.

1817
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,760
How will you make her feel safe?

1818
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,520
In fact, after a few days of observation,

1819
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,760
I found that

1820
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,840
if someone can take care of her,

1821
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,760
she would still want to be a little girl.

1822
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,520
But if no one takes care of her,

1823
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,360
she is also a very strong girl.

1824
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,160
I may observe the details

1825
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:43,520
and do it slowly.

1826
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,400
When she is sad,

1827
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,000
how will you comfort her?

1828
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:51,520
I personally think

1829
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,560
it's written on her face.

1830
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,840
When she was sad,

1831
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,760
I can feel a little bit

1832
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,680
I can feel a little bit.

1833
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,000
In the past few days,

1834
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,600
I'll try to comfort her.

1835
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,560
Actually, I'm not quite satisfied.

1836
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,200
I think it's quite formalized.

1837
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,760
Excuse me.

1838
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,440
Who are you to say that?

1839
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,120
You're just lucky.

1840
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,040
They always answer me to comfort her.

1841
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:26,960
I will accompany her.

1842
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,480
I think this is the most basic.

1843
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,800
I didn't know

1844
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,440
a creative answer.

1845
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,600
So cute.

1846
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,400
Yes.

1847
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:37,240
Why did you vote for Hua today?

1848
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,720
Because after today,

1849
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,600
I had more interactions with Hua.

1850
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,840
And I find that I subconsciously

1851
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,280
care about her every move.

1852
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:51,160
If you were not chosen today,

1853
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,080
what would you have done?

1854
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,680
I don't think you've been chosen.

1855
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,120
Because today's choice

1856
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,720
is not up to her.

1857
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,760
I think

1858
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,000
even if I'm not chosen today,

1859
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,280
I still have a lot of time and opportunities in the future.

1860
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,600
I sent this this this afternoon.

1861
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,040
this text message this afternoon,

1862
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,960
Is Hua your first choice?

1863
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,520
No.

1864
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,320
This question

1865
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,520
Very sharp.

1866
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,360
Yes.

1867
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,800
Hua is not my first choice.

1868
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:27,960
So honest.

1869
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,520
I like their honesty.

1870
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,480
Because Tu has been through two interviews.

1871
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:34,800
Yes.

1872
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,720
He knows he has a chance to choose again.

1873
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,280
Yes.

1874
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,920
So he asked this question.

1875
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,240
I didn't expect it to be fatter.

1876
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:41,920
Yes.

1877
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,960
Because he asked me

1878
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,040
if my first choice was...

1879
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,840
I said no.

1880
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,480
Everyone thinks that

1881
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,920
are always the best.

1882
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,720
I don't want to say anything. You choose.

1883
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,120
You chose me

1884
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,280
to choose my brother.

1885
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,920
Yes, this feeling is definitely not good.

1886
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,520
Through these two interviews,

1887
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,040
I can clearly feel it.

1888
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,880
I think I know how I feel.

1889
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,800
Xiao Ling's answer is...

1890
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,800
to be good friends.

1891
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,160
But Hua's answer is...

1892
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,040
I'll continue to

1893
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,920
to understand his feelings.

1894
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,800
That's good.

1895
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,920
Yes.

1896
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,120
I think everyone is

1897
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,720
is quite straightforward and sharp.

1898
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:27,160
Yes.

1899
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,080
The soup actually cares about Xiaoling's feelings.

1900
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,760
Only true love can ask that.

1901
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,400
Yes.

1902
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,640
including the map.

1903
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,760
her sister Hua

1904
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,080
She has no sense of security.

1905
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,160
You can think about

1906
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,680
in your life experience

1907
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,040
is the most memorable

1908
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,000
or the most memorable one.

1909
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,800
I have.

1910
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,480
When I first took part in these work,

1911
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,160
I had limited work opportunities.

1912
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,800
The company wanted me

1913
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,520
to film and audition.

1914
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,440
Then I met

1915
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,240
various films.

1916
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,440
But because I'm not an actor,

1917
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,440
So I'm not familiar with these things.

1918
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,160
I saw a dozen of groups.

1919
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,640
They would be curious about my resume.

1920
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,880
Because I just finished

1921
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,880
singing bel canto.

1922
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,400
saying you are not a singer?

1923
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,520
Didn't you sing bel canto?

1924
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,280
Sing a song.

1925
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,640
This will

1926
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,200
makes me feel uncomfortable every time.

1927
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,320
It's like

1928
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,560
a kid

1929
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,080
for you.

1930
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,440
After the performance,

1931
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,800
Good. Good.

1932
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,880
Then there's no result.

1933
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,320
This experience during this period

1934
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,200
I'm actually

1935
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,000
I really don't like audition.

1936
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,240
And about filming,

1937
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,320
I've done it before.

1938
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,560
I went to interview a group.

1939
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,760
At that time,

1940
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,320
a host that you are familiar with.

1941
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,720
When I came in, I said

1942
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,920
Host can act.

1943
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,080
The first sentence is not friendly.

1944
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,320
I said among the hosts,

1945
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,760
there will be good actors.

1946
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,200
I said I've done it before.

1947
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,720
Then he stopped talking to me.

1948
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,520
During the interview,

1949
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,440
I sat there.

1950
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,320
He chatted in front of others.

1951
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,000
for over 20 minutes.

1952
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
At last, I said sorry to this teacher.

1953
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:57,560
I said,

1954
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,920
If you think my interview is over,

1955
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,120
we're done.

1956
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,760
I took the box and left.

1957
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,840
But I felt very uncomfortable.

1958
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,680
He ignored you all the time.

1959
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,080
and disrespectful.

1960
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,320
He was chatting with others.

1961
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,160
Actually, I understand how you feel.

1962
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,640
Just a little.

1963
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,480
a bad situation.

1964
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,200
Actually, when I saw their interview,

1965
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,080
I don't know why.

1966
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,480
They have a lot of questions.

1967
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,880
reminds me of

1968
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,680
Because we've been recording

1969
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,520
When we do the interview,

1970
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,640
what's your advantage

1971
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,520
compared to others.

1972
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,000
Then I...

1973
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,680
are almost the same.

1974
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,120
I think

1975
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,680
when you answer the questions,

1976
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,840
when you answer the questions.

1977
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,320
I think sincerity is very important.

1978
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,760
Because no one will hate you

1979
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,600
because you can't do anything.

1980
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,680
Yes, interviews are scary.

1981
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,080
Me too.

1982
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,440
But I'm luckier than you.

1983
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,000
The first time I went to Taiwan, China,

1984
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,400
Then a producer saw me.

1985
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,960
and asked me to audition.

1986
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:51,720
Yes.

1987
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,640
I've never acted before.

1988
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,640
I've never been on stage.

1989
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:54,880
I was very nervous.

1990
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,240
He gave me a script and asked me to memorize it.

1991
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,160
It's too hard to memorize it.

1992
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,320
Memorize it and then act.

1993
01:15:59,320 --> 01:15:59,880
Show it.

1994
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,640
Yes.

1995
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,400
I was not good at Chinese at that time.

1996
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,440
So when they heard my Chinese,

1997
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,600
when they hear my Chinese.

1998
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,040
When I was acting,

1999
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,440
they were smiling.

2000
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,880
I had no choice.

2001
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,680
But the producer told me

2002
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,080
the director told him

2003
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,040
how can he act?

2004
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,760
You blush when you act. How can you act?

2005
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,280
You can do it.

2006
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,120
I blushed when I act.

2007
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,200
Shy.

2008
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,760
Yes, he's shy.

2009
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,280
He said he couldn't do it.

2010
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,840
Yes, but in the end,

2011
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,920
the TV station still chose me.

2012
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,080
He had no choice.

2013
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,400
Because my first drama was with Yichen Lin.

2014
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,680
Yes.

2015
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,080
Is it Oriental Juliet?

2016
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,240
Oriental Juliet? Yes.

2017
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,280
There were many intimate scenes.

2018
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,960
Once, I wanted to act as a close friend with her.

2019
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,640
I was blushing too. I couldn't do it.

2020
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,120
Do you know what happened?

2021
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,440
Say, Yichen, come on, Yichen.

2022
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,520
Ask Lord Wu to sit on your leg.

2023
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,120
So cute.

2024
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:58,960
But it's so awkward.

2025
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,160
Everyone was there.

2026
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,760
I sat on Yichen's leg

2027
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,560
and she was holding me there.

2028
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,600
More than 60 people squatted there.

2029
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,480
Is it faded?

2030
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,840
So awkward. Yeah.

2031
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:09,800
But I have no choice.

2032
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,440
You don't blush anymore, but you're blushing.

2033
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,440
It's gone in the end.

2034
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,040
There's always a change.

2035
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,920
Let's continue to talk about the topic.

2036
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,640
Teach them quickly.

2037
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,480
Coquetry

2038
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,400
Coquetry.

2039
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,600
Your stuff hasn't arrived yet.

2040
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,640
Can you teach me when we arrive?

2041
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,000
Depends on mood

2042
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,840
I'll teach you

2043
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:43,920
Seriously

2044
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,960
will you teach me seriously?

2045
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,720
Are you kidding me?

2046
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,840
No.

2047
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:49,520
Pay the tuition fee.

2048
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,320
It won't make my face so big.

2049
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,480
If you make your students ugly,

2050
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,320
would you be happy?

2051
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,000
I don't have a disciple.

2052
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,560
It's not enough for you to sit here.

2053
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,400
I'm afraid I'll be too close to you.

2054
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,760
Childish.

2055
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,880
No, I want to use my waist.

2056
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,880
I want to play with her.

2057
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,920
I thought he'd set me up.

2058
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,960
I was afraid I might sit down.

2059
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,240
He's really...

2060
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:29,920
"38 Line".

2061
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,120
Did you get the parcel?

2062
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,200
I'll get it for you tomorrow.

2063
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,840
I'm going to get it tomorrow.

2064
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,200
Do you have a nickname

2065
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,440
"Prince of Depression"?

2066
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,120
I can see it.

2067
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,600
Did you give it to me?

2068
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,400
Yes.

2069
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,200
Do you like it?

2070
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,000
Great.

2071
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,080
Okay.

2072
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,360
Do you have anything to say?

2073
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,440
No, let's talk tomorrow.

2074
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,400
Can you understand me?

2075
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,640
Not now.

2076
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,280
I've been emotional these days.

2077
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,360
I will be affected by Su's actions.

2078
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,080
No matter how much I think,

2079
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,880
or she did wrong,

2080
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,640
I don't think it's a positive development.

2081
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,920
I want to know

2082
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,440
how to break the deadlock.

2083
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,360
He loves Book of Answer so much.

2084
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,240
He even searched several times.

2085
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,000
He wants to see the answer he wants to see.

2086
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,120
Yes.

2087
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,400
When I was reading the Book of Answer,

2088
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,000
I wanted to see

2089
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,600
if you want to tell me

2090
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,320
or you can

2091
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,800
try to contact other girls.

2092
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,840
As a result of reading,

2093
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,080
I made three decisions firmly.

2094
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,360
I was advised to try others.

2095
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,480
But

2096
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,560
I already have the answer before I turn it.

2097
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:22,840
Yes.

2098
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,520
Look.

2099
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,240
Why are young people so popular now?

2100
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,720
is to push their own decisions

2101
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,320
by external force.

2102
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,400
This is a kind of tiredness of making decisions.

2103
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,920
When we make decisions,

2104
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,520
we use our left brain

2105
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,360
to deduct the advantages and disadvantages.

2106
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,720
are all in our left brain.

2107
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,880
If you think too much

2108
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,600
when you make a decision,

2109
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,760
In the end, you find that you are very tired.

2110
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,680
Then your brain will try

2111
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,960
to give one of these decisions.

2112
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,280
and give them to one.

2113
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,320
For example, throwing coins.

2114
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,600
For example, use the Book of answers

2115
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,160
to save your psychological burden.

2116
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,360
Mental consumption.

2117
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:56,720
Yes.

2118
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:59,720
What if the coin he threw is the opposite?

2119
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:00,440
what would he do?

2120
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,960
He will justify it.

2121
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,040
Just like he chose

2122
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:05,960
to get to know other girls.

2123
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,960
Maybe the first time is to get to know other girls.

2124
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,160
but he'll do it three more times.

2125
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,440
That means he doesn't expect the answer.

2126
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,040
Yes.

2127
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,360
He just wants to vote for himself.

2128
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,240
Right. The answer is not important.

2129
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,200
Because we already have the answer.

2130
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,760
Yes.

2131
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,320
Your steps are lighter.

2132
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,640
She even walks haughtily.

2133
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,880
Yes, it's powerful.

2134
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,640
I finally figured out myself.

2135
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,080
Come on.

2136
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,360
What's wrong?

2137
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,640
We didn't finish talking yesterday.

2138
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,280
Shall we talk?

2139
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,480
Let's go.

2140
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,560
We're waiting for you to talk.

2141
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,160
I've been waiting for you for so long.

2142
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,800
You've been lying here.

2143
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,040
I feel bad.

2144
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:58,440
What's wrong?

2145
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,760
I'm not feeling well. I'm sick.

2146
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,320
I slept for two hours

2147
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,760
and went down for a while.

2148
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,160
Are you cold?

2149
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,400
I feel uncomfortable all over.

2150
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,320
Actually, Susu is really generous.

2151
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,040
She's not pretentious.

2152
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,360
or give him a face.

2153
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,480
Yeah.

2154
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,560
Let me think.

2155
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,560
But now the face expression

2156
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,920
the beginning.

2157
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:27,880
There seems to be nothing to talk about.

2158
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,040
Then call me.

2159
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,320
Think about what we haven't finished yesterday.

2160
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,000
So,

2161
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,400
you will choose me.

2162
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,320
Of course.

2163
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:40,800
So straightforward.

2164
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,960
OK.

2165
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,560
When do you mean?

2166
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:45,800
I don't know.

2167
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,240
From now on,

2168
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,840
you want me to promise

2169
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,680
No, I'm not saying...

2170
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,800
Like...

2171
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,040
Text message.

2172
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,240
So I just want to confirm

2173
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,400
how you feel right now.

2174
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,960
You should know how you feel.

2175
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:15,760
You should...

2176
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,000
I'm sure

2177
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,760
But I still

2178
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,000
to hear it out.

2179
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:21,640
Yes.

2180
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,360
Because I think

2181
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,880
a message to comfort

2182
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,280
another guy

2183
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,960
is more...

2184
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,960
Yes, because

2185
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,560
we have different definitions

2186
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,600
are different.

2187
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,320
Yes.

2188
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,560
Yes.

2189
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,760
It's the definition of my feelings.

2190
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,560
I didn't expect

2191
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,520
You mean

2192
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,720
send it to the person you like.

2193
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,640
One is the feeling of understanding.

2194
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,880
and the other is the heart.

2195
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,480
And I sent that text because...

2196
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,200
I think

2197
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,040
I can't really say anything.

2198
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,640
If I want to text,

2199
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,040
it's more formal.

2200
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:03,760
Yes.

2201
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,400
Okay.

2202
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:04,840
Yes.

2203
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:10,760
Then...

2204
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,440
You...

2205
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,560
I...

2206
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,440
No.

2207
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,400
What?

2208
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,000
Nothing.

2209
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,240
That's why it's gone.

2210
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,160
I just want Susu to tell me about the soup.

2211
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,120
No matter what,

2212
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,200
pick me.

2213
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,680
I thought you wouldn't tell me today.

2214
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,200
I thought...

2215
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,520
What do you mean?

2216
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,880
And?

2217
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,440
I thought you would tell me.

2218
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,840
And then?

2219
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,360
I didn't see you.

2220
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,720
Then I thought I should stop waiting.

2221
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,640
I've been looking for you twice yesterday.

2222
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,080
You said

2223
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,160
Let's talk tomorrow.

2224
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,400
Yes.

2225
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,160
We're family, right?

2226
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,000
Together.

2227
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,400
Family.

2228
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,440
You cried yesterday?

2229
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,360
No.

2230
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,960
Really?

2231
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,120
Don't get caught by me.

2232
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,440
Don't cry in secret next time.

2233
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,640
Cry in front of me first.

2234
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,480
Okay?

2235
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,960
That's sweet.

2236
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,160
You're a little pervert.

2237
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,840
Men's tears.

2238
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,240
I was in a bad mood yesterday.

2239
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:21,600
Who?

2240
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,240
You.

2241
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,240
Yes.

2242
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,480
Then why did you recover?

2243
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,920
Have you figured it out?

2244
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,480
Yes, like you said,

2245
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,200
your definition of it

2246
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,120
different from mine.

2247
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,320
I didn't consider

2248
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,840
what you said.

2249
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,840
Yes.

2250
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,920
Send this to other boys.

2251
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,000
I do feel

2252
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:47,640
it'll be hard.

2253
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,120
It's okay. I'm not sure.

2254
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,120
you'll send it to other girls later.

2255
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,800
It's okay.

2256
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,160
Just see if you can receive it or not.

2257
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,560
What if I'm zero one day?

2258
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,680
Then I'll go.

2259
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:03,440
I'll take my phone and question you.

2260
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,200
I wondered why I didn't receive it today.

2261
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:06,960
Okay.

2262
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:07,920
Okay?

2263
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:08,400
Sure.

2264
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,160
Really?

2265
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,600
Then you would say no.

2266
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,840
So what?

2267
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,320
It's up to me who I send it to.

2268
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,320
Maybe you make me cry again

2269
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,240
It's sweet again

2270
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,840
You make me cry again.

2271
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,760
Take it back.

2272
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,400
If I let you cry,

2273
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,120
you wouldn't have sent it to me.

2274
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,200
You always make me sad.

2275
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,360
I have to keep sending it to you.

2276
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,920
It's a bit domineering.

2277
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,880
Yes.

2278
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,160
That's how I am.

2279
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,240
It feels like they're getting closer

2280
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,840
after they solved the problem.

2281
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,440
Yes.

2282
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,360
Did you go out today?

2283
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,320
No.

2284
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,000
So I said

2285
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,040
I think everyone is busy today.

2286
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,920
I've been sleeping

2287
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,120
since I woke up.

2288
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,080
I'll lie on the sofa.

2289
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,280
Lie down here.

2290
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,960
No one cares about me.

2291
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,640
No one will bring me food when I go out.

2292
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,120
No one cares

2293
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,200
Are you acting cute?

2294
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,720
Susu is so cute.

2295
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,280
Maybe she's too sad.

2296
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:17,800
Okay.

2297
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,640
Let's go, Soup!

2298
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,120
Come in.

2299
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,760
Who is it now?

2300
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:25,480
Who is it?

2301
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:28,800
Bye.

2302
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:34,920
Bye.

2303
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,120
No, she's fine.

2304
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,000
She's better than Harry.

2305
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,360
Harry is coming in.

2306
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,280
Join us.

2307
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,360
Yeah.

2308
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,680
Talk together.

2309
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,560
and made up.

2310
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,520
If there's any misunderstanding

2311
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,800
or conflicts,

2312
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,320
how will you solve it?

2313
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,200
Huang Zihong will digest it himself.

2314
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,160
Leave me alone, right?

2315
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:00,640
In most cases,

2316
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,680
in most cases,

2317
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:02,400
I have to

2318
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,800
immediately.

2319
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:05,600
If it's like

2320
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,200
you really need to take a long time.

2321
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,360
In this process,

2322
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,160
don't talk to me about anything.

2323
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,360
Wait for me.

2324
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,240
Ten years later.

2325
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,720
That's all.

2326
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,920
Normally,

2327
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,760
one hour or two hours.

2328
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,840
Then at some moment,

2329
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,880
at a certain moment.

2330
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,240
For example,

2331
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,000
when I eat,

2332
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:24,600
I suddenly recovered.

2333
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,560
OK.

2334
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,120
Or watch a short video

2335
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,240
I'm very happy.

2336
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,840
It's over.

2337
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,240
Yes.

2338
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,400
So crazy.

2339
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:32,240
It's "psycho".

2340
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,760
It's very jumping.

2341
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:34,280
Okay.

2342
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,520
Maybe I forgot.

2343
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,760
Everyone seems to be upset

2344
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:37,440
because of something.

2345
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,120
Look.

2346
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,480
He even shared it with others.

2347
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,040
It seems

2348
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:40,320
Yes.

2349
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,920
Let's talk about what happened just now.

2350
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,560
Like this.

2351
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,280
At this moment,

2352
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,520
if she's already in love,

2353
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,840
she won't pick a fight with you anymore.

2354
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,120
She thinks you left us for two hours.

2355
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,200
I'm angry.

2356
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,200
I won't talk to you anymore.

2357
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,560
You have to grind it now.

2358
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:50,920
Grind.

2359
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:51,480
That's it.

2360
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:52,360
to be softhearted.

2361
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,320
I'm sorry.

2362
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,000
Acting cute.

2363
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,400
Yes, that's it.

2364
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,880
When I first lived with my wife,

2365
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,000
we fought a lot.

2366
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,400
Sometimes I fight for a couple of days.

2367
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:03,840
I told you

2368
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,520
to solve it today.

2369
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,720
In the beginning,

2370
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,040
I would say,

2371
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,280
Maybe everyone is angry.

2372
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,280
Maybe one or two days.

2373
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,360
But in the end,

2374
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,120
like them.

2375
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,600
Look. It's been a couple of days.

2376
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,960
But those two days were hard.

2377
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:16,960
Yes.

2378
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:17,960
Then I'll tell her

2379
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,320
why we have to work so hard.

2380
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:19,640
Yes.

2381
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,360
Why don't we solve it today?

2382
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,440
Yes.

2383
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,280
Then you can sleep in peace.

2384
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:24,960
Yes.

2385
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,600
So we won't spend the night in the end.

2386
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,280
Talk to IYI

2387
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,160
Otherwise, it'll be too hard.

2388
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,720
Someone has to give us an out.

2389
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,680
Yes.

2390
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:32,120
One person apologizes first.

2391
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:32,920
or something?

2392
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:33,400
Yes.

2393
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:33,950
I'm the kind of person

2394
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:34,840
No matter how angry I am,

2395
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,480
if you give me a hug before sleep,

2396
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:36,960
Tell me.

2397
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,470
Okay.

2398
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:38,480
Stop arguing.

2399
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,320
we won't reason with each other.

2400
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:40,920
That's right.

2401
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,880
And your theory...

2402
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,640
After two or three days,

2403
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:44,990
after two or three days,

2404
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:45,360
That's good.

2405
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,840
Yes.

2406
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,120
Sometimes I think quarrels

2407
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,400
you need to come up with a bottom logic.

2408
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,160
you're fighting to break up.

2409
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,790
It won't solve the problem.

2410
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,200
Or

2411
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,240
it's just a small matter.

2412
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,480
I want you to prove that you love me.

2413
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,080
I want your care.

2414
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:01,600
and your love.

2415
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,480
because of your love.

2416
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,670
Actually these two points are very different.

2417
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:05,150
Yes.

2418
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,750
So if it's the latter,

2419
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,280
it's just a small conflict.

2420
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,440
When it comes to emotional problems,

2421
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,560
I think we should quarrel.

2422
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,200
Give me an out.

2423
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,560
Just do what you can.

2424
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,950
Yes.

2425
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,000
Just a little bit.

2426
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,200
It can actually promote the relationship.

2427
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,320
It's what Mr. Zhou said.

2428
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,320
I'll give you an out.

2429
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,560
Do you want to come down?

2430
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,440
No.

2431
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,440
I'm afraid to hear these words.

2432
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,790
Can't you see that I haven't been singing?

2433
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,960
Brother, sometimes you need to be aware.

2434
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,440
Stop talking about this.

2435
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,280
I'm scared.

2436
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,120
Let's continue

2437
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,680
what happened in the house.

2438
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:40,320
Your brother told you

2439
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,080
the person he chose for you

2440
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,080
I'm sure you'll be happy.

2441
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,600
Which time do you think you are the happiest?

2442
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,080
Of course today.

2443
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,040
Why?

2444
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,440
I can go skiing and eat with Tu.

2445
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,040
Was I awkward just now?

2446
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,080
He suddenly turned.

2447
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,680
He should be embarrassed.

2448
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:56,400
If he's not,

2449
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,520
Why are you embarrassed?

2450
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:58,680
