1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,040
I gave a hand to Xiaoling.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,040
Do you think I'll avoid you and Terri?

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm not saying what to do.

7
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,000
A party with wild wine.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,840
Let's have a party. Let's have a drink.

9
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,880
It's as fluffy as a scalp.

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,400
Post it on Weibo. Participant #Love & Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game You'll get a chance to get a surprise reward.

11
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,360
Love Siblings.

12
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Double love.

13
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,440
intervention.

14
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,120
Love and Social Healing.

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Love Sisters.

16
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
This show is called "Little Wild Wine",

17
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,200
I feel there will be

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,160
by Guoli.

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,840
This show is

20
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,760
The fluffy shampoo

21
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,400
(of the fluffy and fluffy)

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,520
and sponsored it.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,840
We're a dating family member.

24
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,120
Last week, we officially announced our siblings.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,280
And on the night of siblings,

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,320
our members

27
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,200
know each other better.

28
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,079
The date of confidence

29
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,280
will change the situation

30
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,760
of our house?

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,360
We're going to

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,120
of this episode.

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,520
Let's meet in the name of family.

34
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,560
I'm hungry.

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,440
Let's eat.

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,079
Let's eat.

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,480
Let's eat.

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,200
Let's go.

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,600
I'll take it.

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,840
Luckily, it's not spicy today.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,880
Otherwise, I can't even eat the skewers.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
You can't eat spicy food.

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,520
Yes.

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,480
Soup.

45
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
More.

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,079
No.

47
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,720
I'll get it myself.

48
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,800
Hurry.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Do I understand you?

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,360
You know me.

51
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,600
Tata.

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,160
Help me get the fruit cube with grapefruit flavor.

53
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,000
Add some ice to alleviate greasy.

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,000
Here.

55
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,280
I also added ice for this lemon

56
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,680
And the juice with grapefruit and lemon

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,400
I think it tastes good.

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,800
Just drink them and mix them.

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,440
They're all good

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,360
Next time we get together,

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,200
when we get together next time.

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,880
Let's have a toast.

63
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,200
Come on.

64
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,840
Sure.

65
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,160
Cheers.

66
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,280
The first party.

67
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,960
Happy.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,240
Delicious.

69
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,040
It's so good.

70
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,800
So cool.

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,240
Watching them eat at night

72
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,160
Show me I'm hungry

73
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
I'm so hungry.

74
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,680
I eat barbecue like Harry

75
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,000
I have to drink something cold to relieve the greasy taste.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,520
Jiang Dunhao.

77
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,560
I brought Guoli at the party two days ago.

78
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,960
It's good to drink it directly.

79
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,280
Yes.

80
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,800
Look at Harry.

81
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,040
He pretended not to get the fruit cube.

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,160
and ask Tata to help.

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
But his yuzu flavor is really good.

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
It tastes better with ice.

85
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
No more words.

86
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,080
Come on. Raise a bottle.

87
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,720
I wish you success in pursuing love.

88
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
Cheers.

89
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,440
Sing another song.

90
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,480
OK. Sing one.

91
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,880
Let's welcome the soup.

92
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,360
What?

93
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,640
ELE YAN's

94
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,560
I Want to Say.

95
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,160
Can you lower the key?

96
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,560
Thank you.

97
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,280
No.

98
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,080
I've asked.

99
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,680
You can't lower the key.

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,280
I won't sing then.

101
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,360
Little humor.

102
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,440
He sang it for Susu.

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,440
So sweet.

104
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Let go.

105
00:04:59,800 --> 00:04:59,880
The public side.

106
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,960
He was watching her singing.

107
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,240
This music should have a good ending.

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,520
Okay, the end.

109
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,360
Lovers will be together.

110
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,840
Jiang Dunhao, who sang this background music?

111
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,320
So good.

112
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,680
It's me.

113
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,120
But now I want to say

114
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,840
if you don't kiss one of us, you'll be sorry.

115
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,840
This is the theme song

116
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,280
of Love Sisters.

117
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,760
Yes.

118
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,960
Nice.

119
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,640
Jiang Dunhao,

120
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,680
Can you sing

121
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,440
Can you sing a few lines for us?

122
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,159
OK.

123
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,880
I want to hear it.

124
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,800
Don't be too embarrassed.

125
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,040
When I was a kid, I felt like

126
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,800
I will cry.

127
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,960
Come on.

128
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,880
Okay, the first one.

129
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,360
Coming.

130
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,840
The piano prince is good at singing.

131
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,560
I got two.

132
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,720
To Tom, one more charm.

133
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,800
You look great in today's clothes.

134
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,680
At first, I couldn't tell

135
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
which one belongs to.

136
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,520
One of the receivers is soup.

137
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,440
One is Tom.

138
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,000
I think it might be the Tom.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,760
But there's another supplement.

140
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,840
Susu hasn't sent any supplements recently.

141
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,400
This should be from Susu.

142
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,600
Susu always sends TOM.

143
00:06:59,600 --> 00:06:59,840
Yes.

144
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
She didn't write Chinese.

145
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,200
I sent it to soup.

146
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,600
Actually, there's a meaning to add one and one.

147
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,760
The first one is

148
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,560
when he plays the piano.

149
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,960
He's charming.

150
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,840
The second one plus one.

151
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,240
He has

152
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,360
singing to me,

153
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,560
to sing to me.

154
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,000
So I wrote two plus one.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
I added that

156
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,760
the clothes he's wearing today look good on him.

157
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,240
Very cool.

158
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,600
This is what I think.

159
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,680
I sent the message to the soup.

160
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,960
Because first of all, I know

161
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,280
he's good at playing the piano.

162
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,680
and good at playing basketball.

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,440
But I didn't expect him to sing.

164
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,360
In my eyes,

165
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,880
handsome guys can't sing.

166
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
So I sent this message

167
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,720
to him.

168
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,680
to encourage him to sing more.

169
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,280
So long.

170
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,520
The song I Want to Say

171
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,040
is for you.

172
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,520
It's a bit straight.

173
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:03,880
Yes.

174
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,520
He's getting better at expressing himself.

175
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,680
The soup is good.

176
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,480
This is nice.

177
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,760
I want to date.

178
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,160
I want to confess to you.

179
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,200
It's a bit too straightforward.

180
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,040
But I think if I tell her,

181
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,360
she can feel it too.

182
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,840
The drawing.

183
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,440
When dancing,

184
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,720
when dancing.

185
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
Very attractive.

186
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,040
The message I received

187
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,400
Xiaoling sent it to me.

188
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,919
She said she saw the other side of me.

189
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,200
the other side of my dance.

190
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,039
Very cool.

191
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,200
She has a different view of me.

192
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,320
Maybe I am

193
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,799
smile

194
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,760
and cheerful.

195
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,200
But when I dance,

196
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,400
when I dance.

197
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,840
It's kind of cool.

198
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
She might think

199
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,720
my style will change.

200
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,880
I sent a message to Tu Tu today.

201
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,680
I've never seen

202
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,840
I've never seen.

203
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,160
Today, I saw

204
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,480
I think it's very attractive.

205
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,640
To Xiao Ling.

206
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,360
You played the piano better than Tom today.

207
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
And you sing well. Be confident.

208
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,680
We're from the courtyard.

209
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,520
Map?

210
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,920
I guess it's from Tu Tu.

211
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,320
I've been texting him for days.

212
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
That's why I'm more certain.

213
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,600
I didn't get a good text yesterday.

214
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,880
(Bracket has been reflected.)

215
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
You were a little annoyed yesterday.

216
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,720
Then I realized

217
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,240
I was too shy to ask.

218
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,440
I was so exhausted.

219
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,000
Luckily,

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,400
my sister is here to make you complain.

221
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Otherwise, you won't be able to imagine it.

222
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
Of course you can come to me.

223
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,040
I'm better at babbling than my sister.

224
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,440
When you are unhappy,

225
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,760
express your emotions.

226
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,520
But don't be influenced by others.

227
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,200
It's so sincere.

228
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,680
Harry sent me

229
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,360
a long text message

230
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,920
to make up for yesterday's mistake.

231
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,560
And I was in a good mood.

232
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,400
Because I've been playing straight.

233
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,360
In my relationship,

234
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,680
is not always like this.

235
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,600
As long as

236
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,480
a girl like Tata

237
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,520
needs me,

238
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,840
when she needs me.

239
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,880
and my question directly.

240
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,240
and my thoughts directly.

241
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,920
Because I think

242
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,960
if I don't express it directly,

243
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,040
and play straight,

244
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,840
we might fight and get angry.

245
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,080
So I don't think it's necessary.

246
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,400
I think as long as I can hit it straight,

247
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,160
if I can handle this,

248
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,240
you have to go straight.

249
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,160
Why not?

250
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,680
Right?

251
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
Tata received two.

252
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,960
To Tata, you did a great job tonight.

253
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,200
I'm rooting for you.

254
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,120
Actually,

255
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,880
I don't know who it is.

256
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,160
I sent the message to Tata today.

257
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,280
Fatty.

258
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,120
No way.

259
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,440
I'll support her.

260
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,360
Of course, that's pure friendship.

261
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,040
A support.

262
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,840
We can see that

263
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,080
I'll send it to whoever performs well.

264
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,520
You're just cheering for me.

265
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,320
Did they not study the questions?

266
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,600
I'm surprised.

267
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,240
I'm happy to be with you

268
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,720
with you.

269
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,480
Wait.

270
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
This is a tower.

271
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,520
Tata sent to Terri.

272
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,320
So look.

273
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,160
You mean Hua?

274
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,560
different understanding of feelings?

275
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,440
What are you doing?

276
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,800
This is all wrong.

277
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,760
I suggest cancel the message session.

278
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,520
I knew it was Tata.

279
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,800
Because I'm in the same group with her today.

280
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,080
I think Tata sent me this message

281
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,880
means

282
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,560
we both did great today.

283
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,080
Maybe the affirmation between partners

284
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,680
I sent it to Tae-seo.

285
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,920
There are two reasons.

286
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,240
On one hand,

287
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,280
I should send it to Harry

288
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,040
I should send it to Harry.

289
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,600
But because I wasn't angry

290
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,880
I wasn't mad at Harry.

291
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,760
I don't think he sent me well.

292
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,800
I wanted to piss Harry off.

293
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,480
On the other hand,

294
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,680
I was with Tae-seo all day.

295
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,640
I didn't really get to know Harry.

296
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
I think I should

297
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,080
to Tae-seo.

298
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,600
Today, I'm going to

299
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,120
with him.

300
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,200
I think both of them are excellent.

301
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,160
and happy.

302
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,040
To Tae-seo.

303
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,000
Thank you, international supermodel

304
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
for making me breakfast today.

305
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,280
Flower.

306
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm happy to receive Hwa's text.

307
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,440
Today's message was for Tae-seo.

308
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,240
At that time,

309
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,680
he was stylish when walking the model.

310
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,920
It's very eye-catching.

311
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,080
To Flower.

312
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,520
Flower.

313
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,240
Thank you for caring about the wound at the corner of my eye.

314
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,840
I had two choices.

315
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,000
One is Tata.

316
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,920
and the other is Flower.

317
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,840
Because this is a sincere message.

318
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,200
I should write it to myself.

319
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,480
interested in.

320
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,440
Tata is really a sister to me.

321
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,560
So I sent the message

322
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,000
to Hua firmly today.

323
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,320
When I was rehearsing today,

324
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,480
I hurt my eyebrows.

325
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,320
She saw

326
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,040
and she cared about me.

327
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,360
This is the question reading.

328
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,160
I didn't get it.

329
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,280
This is a total mess.

330
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,800
These brothers...

331
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,760
I feel bad for her.

332
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,160
My brother didn't receive a message from her.

333
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,720
For the sake,

334
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,000
I feel a little sad

335
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,480
feel a little sad.

336
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,960
We all have feelings.

337
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,600
We don't.

338
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,440
But I think it's normal.

339
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,600
I can't beat them in terms of looks.

340
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,840
It makes sense.

341
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,000
It's not about his looks.

342
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,640
He's looking for objective reasons.

343
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,520
Did he receive it?

344
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,720
I feel totally different.

345
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,640
I can see their expressions.

346
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,240
Yes, they will.

347
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,440
Wake up.

348
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,520
Actually, I thought

349
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,360
he might not receive it today.

350
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
Because Tata told me

351
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,400
I didn't want to send it to him today.

352
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
But I thought she was angry.

353
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,760
she might send it to him.

354
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,040
But she didn't send it to him.

355
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,480
I was also surprised.

356
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,760
and shocked.

357
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,480
Then I thought

358
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,240
what happened.

359
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,720
Tata didn't send it to him today.

360
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,200
Oh no.

361
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,920
Look at Harry.

362
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,680
She's autistic.

363
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,760
Because she told me

364
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,800
she wouldn't send it to me.

365
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,160
But I didn't expect she didn't send it to me.

366
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,520
I was very annoyed.

367
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
I didn't say I was unhappy.

368
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,040
But I can't figure it out.

369
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,120
One said to give the straight ball,

370
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,040
Then they stopped.

371
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,600
Right.

372
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,760
He just hung up.

373
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,360
But he didn't receive my message.

374
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,520
he would be unhappy.

375
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,720
I dare not visit him.

376
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,640
You can clearly feel

377
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,680
the person sitting next to you

378
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,920
his air pressure dropped.

379
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,560
It feels like a cloud on his head.

380
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,720
on my head.

381
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
The best performance partner

382
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,640
The best performance partner is

383
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,840
Tarri and Tata.

384
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,120
The two have the right to choose one man each.

385
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,880
together.

386
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,400
Let's ask Terri and Tata

387
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,200
to choose.

388
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,760
Close your eyes when it's dark.

389
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,280
What are you doing?

390
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,160
I'll tell you later.

391
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,360
Don't be sad.

392
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,120
Hand.

393
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,400
I held his hand.

394
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,440
Choose me, right?

395
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,280
Tae-seo's choice is very important now.

396
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,320
He must choose Hua.

397
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,080
Yes.

398
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,160
Flower.

399
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,920
What do you mean?

400
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,920
Don't peek. I'm leaving.

401
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,960
Nodding?

402
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,200
It's so loud.

403
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,600
Let's go.

404
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,320
My kitty.

405
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,920
Bye.

406
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,440
Let's

407
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,760
Let's go.

408
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,240
Let's go.

409
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,160
Follow them.

410
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
Follow them.

411
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,680
Go home.

412
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,520
You said

413
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,000
You said you wanted to know more about others.

414
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,680
Why did you choose me today?

415
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,839
I won't pick you tomorrow.

416
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,040
But didn't you say

417
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
you want to know more about others?

418
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,599
Since you said so,

419
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,240
I guess you don't miss me that much.

420
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,119
Okay.

421
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,480
Right?

422
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,119
I don't have the right to refuse.

423
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,880
I don't know what to do.

424
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,040
Yes.

425
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,960
You'd better

426
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,240
You're trying to sound Tae-seo out.

427
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,760
So did you hesitate?

428
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,120
On the way back with you,

429
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,920
Did you hesitate?

430
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,480
What are you hesitating about?

431
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,720
Choose someone else.

432
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,320
Who should I choose?

433
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,560
Who?

434
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,720
Who do you want to go back with?

435
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,000
Drawing.

436
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,840
Who do you want me to choose?

437
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,480
Go ahead.

438
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,320
Go to sleep.

439
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,280
I'm really sleeping.

440
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,760
I didn't ask you to choose anyone.

441
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,160
You said you wanted to get in touch.

442
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
I didn't see you.

443
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,840
Again.

444
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,920
I asked yesterday when we were eating

445
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,560
Now on the way home

446
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,640
This is a good chance

447
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
to let you

448
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,760
I'm very confident.

449
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,960
It's up to you.

450
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,520
Mind your own business.

451
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,120
Okay.

452
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,320
The winner is us.

453
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:00,880
Okay.

454
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,960
We have the right to choose.

455
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,240
Okay.

456
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,880
I can't refuse it.

457
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,160
How about

458
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,880
Try rejecting one.

459
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,120
Okay.

460
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,560
The acting master is on.

461
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,480
Yes, the boss is on.

462
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,000
OK.

463
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,480
I feel it.

464
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
I'm in love.

465
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,480
I mean feelings.

466
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,960
Okay.

467
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,760
It's quite sweet.

468
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,360
Yes.

469
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,800
If I were the winner today,

470
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,880
if I didn't invite you,

471
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,240
who would you have invited?

472
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,280
I need to think about it.

473
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,280
Who would you invite?

474
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,800
If I didn't invite you,

475
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,840
If, there's no if.

476
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,200
I'm sorry, Poshin guy has spoken.

477
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,960
Will you ignore me?

478
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,160
No.

479
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
I'm not a kid like Harry and the others.

480
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,440
How old am I?

481
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,360
I lost my siblings and was forced to carpool.

482
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,680
So who did you send to before?

483
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
It's the same person.

484
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,120
Xinxin.

485
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,000
Almost like you.

486
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,600
Xinxin.

487
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,040
Really?

488
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
Why do you think so?

489
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,160
So who?

490
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,280
Like this?

491
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,520
I didn't see it at all.

492
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
I'm sorry.

493
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,840
I didn't know you two would interact.

494
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,200
Really?

495
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,920
Yes.

496
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,080
But it's hard to tell.

497
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,000
I think Harry and Tata

498
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
are

499
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,840
I think it's nailed.

500
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,680
Not necessarily.

501
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,040
Tata didn't send it to Harry today.

502
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,160
It's getting interesting.

503
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,000
These two.

504
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,120
What are you doing?

505
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,360
Don't be angry.

506
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,600
I'll explain.

507
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,920
Go ahead.

508
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,520
Let me hear it.

509
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,400
I'm listening.

510
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,520
I was with Tae-seo

511
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,440
with Tae-seo all day?

512
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
In the end, Tae-seo and I

513
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,200
with Tae-seo.

514
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,960
Then I...

515
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,200
I thought I could send it to him.

516
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,040
The content I sent him is very normal.

517
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,760
I'm very happy

518
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,720
to get the first place.

519
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,120
We did well.

520
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,160
That's all.

521
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,840
I was thinking to send him the message.

522
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,720
And...

523
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,320
And I'll invite you to ride a car with me.

524
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:30,840
Yes.

525
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,920
Can we sleep?

526
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,360
I think...

527
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,120
Can we sleep?

528
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,280
Do you want to sleep?

529
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,400
Really? You don't want to talk to me anymore?

530
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,040
You're silent.

531
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,040
I'm introverted. I'm silent.

532
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,480
No.

533
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,200
Sorry.

534
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,240
I regretted it after I sent it.

535
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Really?

536
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,280
She apologized to him.

537
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,360
She said she was sorry.

538
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,560
Do you think my explanation is unreasonable?

539
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,760
It does.

540
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,000
I never said it's unreasonable.

541
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,720
What's wrong?

542
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,920
Why aren't you talking to me?

543
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,680
I don't know what to say.

544
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,160
You don't know what to say. Why?

545
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,760
I don't know what to say.

546
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,800
Just don't know what to say

547
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,480
It's okay.

548
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,880
Don't regret what you did.

549
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,560
I was not sure

550
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,120
because I never had

551
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,760
with him.

552
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,360
he didn't say a word to me in the car.

553
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,680
I really had no choice.

554
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,240
Okay, next,

555
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,880
this situation...

556
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,000
Just coax her.

557
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,480
You'll be done later.

558
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,600
Yes.

559
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,320
Tata will be angry soon.

560
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
Don't be rude.

561
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,960
You're done.

562
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,520
Go coax him.

563
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,880
Why does he become

564
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,240
the soup from the beginning?

565
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,880
Yes.

566
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,800
What's going on?

567
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,160
I think he has always been positive.

568
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,480
He sent it so long today.

569
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,920
but he didn't send it to him.

570
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,240
He might be like this.

571
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,400
Although I explained it,

572
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,040
he might still be immersed in

573
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,600
when he saw

574
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,320
the ceiling,

575
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,320
I was on the floor.

576
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,040
I do feel

577
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
on the floor.

578
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:48,640
Silver states Silver stations, Silver states, five silver coins.

579
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:48,960
Silver, Silver, Silver, Silver, Silver, Silver.

580
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,720
It's scratched.
Five silver for five silver, five silver for five silver.

581
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,080
Is that where I should go?

582
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
I may be a little unconfident.

583
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,240
Second, I was a little angry.

584
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,240
Don't be like this.

585
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,200
You're acting cute.

586
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,000
What's wrong with me?

587
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,440
I just don't talk.

588
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,280
What do you want me to do?

589
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,400
I don't know.

590
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,000
what you want me to do to make you forgive me.

591
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,480
I don't know.

592
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,120
I think Tata is good.

593
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,360
Really. She kept coaxing him.

594
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,960
Yes.

595
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,840
Why don't you send it to me tomorrow?

596
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
To whom?

597
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,040
How would I know?

598
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,960
If you don't send it to me,

599
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
You'll balance.

600
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
So childish?

601
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,320
What are you doing?

602
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,440
I don't know.

603
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,280
I don't know who to ask for help.

604
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,960
Who?

605
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
Help you.

606
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,960
Help me.

607
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,680
Help me.

608
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,680
Normally, I don't like to talk.

609
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,360
To be honest,

610
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,880
So you don't want to talk to me now?

611
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,960
Go ahead.

612
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,560
How can I tell you if you're in a bad mood?

613
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,520
Sleep.

614
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,280
Lean this back.

615
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,560
I'll lean this back for you.

616
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,600
She kept telling me

617
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,960
she was a passive girl.

618
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,240
She apologized to me.

619
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,320
She explained to me

620
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,920
She kept interacting with me.

621
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,320
I'm relieved.

622
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,840
So you're the one

623
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,480
who can't help apologizing.

624
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,400
Sort of.

625
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,720
I don't know.

626
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,960
Got it.

627
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,680
You don't know.

628
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,880
I might have to cold you for a while.

629
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,360
Who cares?

630
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,560
Okay.

631
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,480
Okay.

632
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,680
Okay.

633
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,560
You don't know.

634
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,400
I got it.

635
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,840
No.

636
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,600
You said it yourself.

637
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,480
I lied to you.

638
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,720
How can you believe a man?

639
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,640
What did you say?

640
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,440
You're so smart. You can tell it by yourself.

641
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,080
I don't know.

642
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,800
It's true that you asked me to get off.

643
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Then why are you still in the car?

644
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,960
I like to fight against you.

645
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
I don't like it to go your way.

646
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,400
Okay.

647
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,640
Yes, I know you want me to get off.

648
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,560
I won't.

649
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,680
Okay.

650
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
In this case,

651
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,440
there should be

652
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,920
in your modeling circle.

653
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,560
Why?

654
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,240
You're still single.

655
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,680
We're talking about the key question.

656
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,560
After a long round,

657
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,440
Yes.

658
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,480
I don't really like

659
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,840
I have five girlfriends.

660
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,320
You even counted.

661
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,280
One of them is in the same industry.

662
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,880
Nothing else.

663
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,000
Who takes the initiative or you?

664
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,520
Others?

665
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,280
Have you ever thought about taking the initiative?

666
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,640
It's always someone else who takes the initiative.

667
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,440
Okay.

668
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,680
I took the initiative for a while.

669
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,040
Okay.

670
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,800
I'm touched. Okay.

671
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,200
After being together, OK.

672
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,960
Because you take the initiative

673
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,280
and get into a relationship. Okay.

674
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,280
I started to take the initiative.

675
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,600
Then someone started to lower their head.

676
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,440
Then they broke up.

677
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,400
About this.

678
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,800
Me too.

679
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,200
I always take the initiative.

680
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,800
So others told me

681
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,520
to change.

682
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,800
But it seems

683
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,600
It's not that simple.

684
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Because it's mutual.

685
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,920
Whether it's initiative or passive,

686
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,080
you have to respond

687
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,720
to keep going.

688
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,520
So it's always someone who takes the initiative

689
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,760
and then someone asked you to break up.

690
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,120
Yes, and I got dumped.

691
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,240
Have you thought about the reason?

692
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,760
Maybe you're too proactive

693
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,360
because you're too emotional

694
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,320
Too passive, right?

695
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,000
My friend said

696
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,960
he said you should take the initiative next time.

697
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,360
and say you'll take the initiative.

698
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,640
What did you do to her?

699
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,960
Did you listen to your friend's advice?

700
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:31,760
No.

701
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,560
I did.

702
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,760
I did.

703
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,960
But I think it's a bit...

704
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,640
to change.

705
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,840
I don't know. I don't know.

706
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,080
It seems

707
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,160
We are similar.

708
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,880
Very sincere.

709
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,760
Yes.

710
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,120
I shared my love experience.

711
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,000
When I went back with Tae-seo,

712
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,720
we kept chatting.

713
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,360
It feels like

714
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,440
It's more urgent than our first date.

715
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,920
I'll be happier if we go home together today.

716
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,280
My face is ruined.

717
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,760
I'm fine.

718
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,880
I brought some scars.

719
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,800
I think it's a scar.

720
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,200
Come closer.

721
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,760
Then Harry will...

722
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,640
What's wrong?

723
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,200
Go back and apply some medicine.

724
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,240
Did they apply medicine for you?

725
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,040
Yes, I got iodine.

726
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,880
I'll go back.

727
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,080
Do you have a quick healing wound?

728
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,520
I think we should go back and apply ice on it.

729
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm worried

730
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,400
his eyelids will swell.

731
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,560
Yes, because your upper eyelid

732
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,040
Yes.

733
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,560
Close your upper eyelid and apply it like this for a while.

734
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,360
Poor thing.

735
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,040
It's cold.

736
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,600
Let's go.

737
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,480
Let's go.

738
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Let's go.

739
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,320
It's cold.

740
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,560
How can it be so cold?

741
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,760
Tu.

742
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,560
Come up. I need to talk to you.

743
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:01,960
Coming.

744
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,000
You saw it yesterday.

745
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,720
I was a little out of control.

746
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,000
Then you came to me yesterday and told me

747
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,400
you said it was a comforting message.

748
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,800
She also followed

749
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,400
Well,

750
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,080
My brother says it's a comfort message.

751
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,280
Right?

752
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,440
You saw the same thing today.

753
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,720
I didn't receive it either.

754
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,440
Did she tell you

755
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,720
what text she sent today?

756
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,240
Because she noticed today

757
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,920
your emotions are...

758
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,480
Do you understand?

759
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,760
So,

760
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,760
she felt that my emotions were...

761
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,120
That's why she didn't text me.

762
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,960
Is that what you mean?

763
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,000
Because you ignored her all day?

764
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,440
Yes, you ignored her.

765
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,040
I think comforting this person

766
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,600
doesn't mean

767
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,160
a heart message.

768
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,360
And if the two of us

769
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,680
between us,

770
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,400
you two can talk face to face.

771
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,000
I really support you to talk face to face.

772
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,160
Let me

773
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,480
I need to compare the information to it.

774
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,000
Don't chew it yourself.

775
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,320
You won't understand.

776
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,440
Yes.

777
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,240
From her actions,

778
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,840
she can understand my feelings.

779
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,560
She can feel your feelings for her.

780
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,760
And she can feel

781
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,000
Tae-ri's feelings for her.

782
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,280
Actually, that day,

783
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Objectively speaking,

784
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,840
she might love you more.

785
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,600
But you missed it.

786
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,160
Yes.

787
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,000
But Tae-ri's siblings weren't there that day.

788
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,720
She wanted to comfort him.

789
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,640
Because she thinks

790
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,040
Text messages aren't just one kind.

791
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,800
It may be just a way to express your feelings.

792
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,760
But do you know

793
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,320
why I was so angry?

794
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,400
It's because the day before,

795
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,840
I was just about to confess my love.

796
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,880
Except that I didn't say it directly,

797
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,440
I've already made it very obvious.

798
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,120
I asked her a question

799
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
I asked her a question.

800
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,160
I said you were

801
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,760
two boys treat you well at the same time.

802
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,680
Are you a person who treats you differently

803
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,320
or the same?

804
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,800
She told me she answered discrimination.

805
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,800
But now when I see her behavior,

806
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,880
she doesn't treat me differently.

807
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,920
She accepted it at the same time.

808
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
She treated it differently today.

809
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,520
It's different today.

810
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,080
So today,

811
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,440
I'm talking about

812
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,160
But you sent me another message.

813
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,600
She wanted to send it to me today,

814
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
but she saw me ignoring her today.

815
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,240
Yes.

816
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,880
So she didn't send me

817
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,000
because of her pride.

818
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,440
Is that what you think?

819
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
It's not for face.

820
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,520
It's just a little...

821
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,960
She's a bit...

822
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,040
and emotional.

823
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,160
Yeah, I think you two are really...

824
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,240
You two talk alone.

825
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,720
Really?

826
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,400
You need to

827
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,800
some things need to be

828
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,000
Don't pass it around.

829
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,920
Actually, I'll think about it.

830
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,520
I'll think about it.

831
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,240
Don't think about it. Go find her now.

832
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,880
I'll call her.

833
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,360
No.

834
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,880
Right away.

835
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,360
No need.

836
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,760
Do you want to talk?

837
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,080
No.

838
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,160
Do you want to talk?

839
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,880
I don't want to talk now.

840
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,520
You must want to talk.

841
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't want to talk now.

842
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,920
Call him over.

843
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,480
I don't want to talk.

844
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,680
What are you doing?

845
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,200
Are you applying a mask?

846
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,960
I'm not going to talk to Fatty.

847
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,240
I think we should...

848
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,040
I have nothing to say.

849
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
Talk?

850
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,480
Let's talk now.

851
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,040
No.

852
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,840
I think I should take a break.

853
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,040
I think I want to be angry.

854
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,880
They don't want to talk anymore.

855
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Talk?

856
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,360
Can you stay here?

857
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,840
Yes.

858
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,880
Coming.

859
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,040
You have your brother.

860
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,560
Why did he run away?

861
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,400
So weak.

862
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,680
Fatty, come up.

863
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,600
What?

864
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,280
Come up.

865
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,840
Tomorrow.

866
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,840
You can't do this.

867
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,440
You can't be like this.

868
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,200
I haven't written my diary yet.

869
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,880
Tomorrow.

870
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,920
This really makes me angry.

871
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,440
It really makes me angry.

872
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,280
Let's not talk then.

873
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,080
What's there to think about?

874
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,600
Tomorrow.

875
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,240
Let's stop talking.

876
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,960
They are so funny.

877
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,560
These two majors are broadcasting.

878
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,360
Me too.

879
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
Even broadcasters

880
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:48,880
In the morning,

881
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,840
in the morning.

882
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,720
Yes.

883
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,000
Your breath is so short.

884
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,760
Three, two, one.

885
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,760
He doesn't care about others' lives at all.

886
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,840
Magic Attack!

887
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,320
Again.

888
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,560
Raise your legs.

889
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,080
Raise your legs.

890
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,400
800 pacesetters go to the north slope

891
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,040
Then the white stone tower and white stone set up. Come on.

892
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,880
OK.

893
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,440
One, two, three, go.

894
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,280
Eight hundred.

895
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,360
Slow down.

896
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,719
800 pacesetters go to the north slope.

897
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,760
You two found the common topic.

898
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,000
The way you date

899
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,199
is a bit strange.

900
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,120
You two are in a business line.

901
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,440
A white tower with white stones.

902
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,600
White stones build white tower

903
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,800
White tower and white stones.

904
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,040
Set up the white tower.

905
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,040
The white tower is white and big.

906
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,840
Excuse me.

907
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,800
Do you want glutinous rice balls or wontons?

908
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,679
I'm fine with anything.

909
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,920
Choose one.

910
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,360
Wonton.

911
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,480
You just want to choose wontons.

912
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,720
Tata, have breakfast?

913
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,480
Yes.

914
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,400
How about I make glutinous rice balls together? The fastest.

915
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,120
Sure.

916
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,320
We met.

917
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,520
I don't think he can talk.

918
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,840
I didn't wash the dishes.

919
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,360
Put it here. I can wash it.

920
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,400
I'll finish it in a few minutes.

921
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,880
You want to make it harder for me?

922
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,560
Wash your hands.

923
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,520
I didn't touch your stuff.

924
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
This tone

925
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,920
It feels like a cold war.

926
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,400
Right?

927
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,680
Yes.

928
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,600
I need to argue with him.

929
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,480
Take this. Hurry up.

930
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,520
It's hot.

931
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,160
One minute difference.

932
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,640
I know you're hungry.

933
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,720
Don't worry.

934
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,600
Can you wash the spoon for me?

935
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,680
I'll be back soon.

936
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,160
Don't ask for anything.

937
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,240
I can do it myself.

938
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,080
It's okay. I can do it myself.

939
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,920
This one?

940
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,040
Just one.

941
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,160
Okay, I'll do it.

942
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,040
Really?

943
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,480
I won't forgive you if you hurt me.

944
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,400
Hua, let me tell you.

945
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,040
We are enemies now.

946
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,840
What else to say?

947
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,800
Look.

948
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,840
It's all negative feedback.

949
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,000
Don't do this.

950
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,240
I don't like this atmosphere.

951
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,280
I think we should make it clear.

952
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,240
Actually not.

953
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,080
We live together every day.

954
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,240
See you every day.

955
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,560
It's actually quite awkward

956
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,680
Men who work are the most handsome

957
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,480
Better.

958
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,720
Do you have a problem with praising me?

959
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,560
Here comes Master Hua.

960
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,240
Okay.

961
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,160
Does it fit?

962
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,720
Is it suitable?

963
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,160
Take out the trash.

964
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,200
Throw these two garbage out.

965
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,280
Get a new trash bag.

966
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,000
Go.

967
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,240
Take a look.

968
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,280
Slow down.

969
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,560
Come here.

970
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,040
Look at handsome guys.

971
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,720
Shut up.

972
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,120
He's obviously caring about each other.

973
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,320
He just can't let go of his identity.

974
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,360
It's killing me.

975
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,920
Do you want dumplings

976
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,120
What did you do

977
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,560
Should I just eat it?

978
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,200
Really

979
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,080
It was supposed to be for them.

980
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
You eat first.

981
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,520
Okay.

982
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,040
Take it away.

983
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,920
Thank you.

984
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,880
It's delicious.

985
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,360
Okay.

986
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,240
The feedback is correct.

987
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,080
It's delicious.

988
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,760
Don't put it in the pool.

989
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,960
Today is the day.

990
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:46,760
Okay.

991
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,160
Where should I put it?

992
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,960
Put it inside.

993
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,680
It doesn't matter.

994
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,000
Eat slowly next time.

995
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,640
Thank you.

996
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,960
I can't hold this.

997
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,360
You need to hold it and pour it.

998
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,480
The small pot is big.

999
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,280
I'll wash while you eat.

1000
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,200
I can't finish.

1001
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,960
He said to put it aside.

1002
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,240
You insisted on coming.

1003
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,200
Actually, this is caring.

1004
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,960
Yes.

1005
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,880
They don't talk properly.

1006
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,640
You wash first.

1007
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,720
I'll kill you!

1008
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,200
Wait.

1009
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,440
I don't want to hear your nagging.

1010
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,760
Is there anyone else?

1011
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,400
What do you want?

1012
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,200
I want to wash some fruits.

1013
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,320
Wait.

1014
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,200
Wait.

1015
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,760
Okay.

1016
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,480
Don't come again.

1017
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,760
Increase the workload of fat.

1018
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,440
Communication is really important.

1019
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,240
I found that many people

1020
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,040
actually meant well.

1021
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,080
It sounds awful.

1022
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Fatty actually cares about Hua.

1023
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,920
He's just too stubborn.

1024
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,320
Yes, too hard.

1025
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,160
You need to have a mouth.

1026
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,640
Yes.

1027
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,280
You have to have a mouth.

1028
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,640
You have to.

1029
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,080
But when we jump out,

1030
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,840
I think

1031
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,520
they are lovers.

1032
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,520
It's like a cold war between lovers.

1033
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,720
But because we have emotional foundation,

1034
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,960
That's why there's such a conversation.

1035
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,160
Yes.

1036
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,560
I care.

1037
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,480
Yes, I do.

1038
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,840
If you're really boring

1039
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,240
If you're in the kitchen I'll avoid it

1040
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,480
But she still walks over.

1041
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,560
and even hand to him.

1042
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,800
This is actually

1043
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,200
ambiguous magnetic field.

1044
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,400
are still there.

1045
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,440
It's just that

1046
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,080
of their personality.

1047
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,400
They need to

1048
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,840
in this process

1049
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,880
and confirm your heart.

1050
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,440
and see who takes the first step.

1051
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,920
and find the apology in it.

1052
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,840
The two of them

1053
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,400
awkward.

1054
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,560
Yes, they all think they're right.

1055
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,240
No, some people know they were wrong.

1056
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,680
but they're not used to saying sorry.

1057
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,240
Yes.

1058
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,560
I'm not used to lowering my head first.

1059
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,040
Because in many people's knowledge,

1060
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,960
I lowered my head first.

1061
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,200
I lost.

1062
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,320
But in a close relationship,

1063
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,040
the most valuable thing is the person who lowers his head first.

1064
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,520
He knows

1065
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,080
being with you is the most important thing.

1066
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,560
I don't care about the minor problems and dignity.

1067
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,520
Yes.

1068
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,200
I can only say that

1069
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,120
or heartbeat.

1070
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,640
are not enough

1071
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,480
their own stubbornness and persistence.

1072
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:58,960
Yes.

1073
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,760
When one day

1074
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,560
you love each other more,

1075
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,640
you're willing to lower your head for him.

1076
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,080
But now because they are still testing each other,

1077
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,600
their feelings are unclear.

1078
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,560
They're still playing.

1079
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,720
Yes.

1080
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,480
Actually, in emotional psychology,

1081
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
before we

1082
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,680
before we knew each other,

1083
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,920
there was a time like this.

1084
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,160
called emotional vulnerability.

1085
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,080
such a period

1086
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,720
you and the other person

1087
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,040
because of some misunderstandings

1088
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,240
because of some misunderstanding.

1089
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,000
They are

1090
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,080
negative feedback.

1091
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,360
And he will be

1092
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,680
You're actually very attractive

1093
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,800
and a lot of attention.

1094
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,720
But both parties

1095
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,840
a very low sense of security.

1096
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,120
So I want to communicate.

1097
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,040
But I have to avoid it.

1098
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
That's it.

1099
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,000
They are

1100
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,400
like this.

1101
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,840
If these misunderstandings

1102
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,120
all the negative emotions

1103
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,120
all kinds of negative emotions

1104
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,080
all kinds of negative emotions.

1105
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,400
Then your relationship

1106
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,040
Yes, it will be better.

1107
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,200
to a better position.

1108
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,880
But if you keep being negative,

1109
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,480
you might not be able to do it.

1110
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,880
I'll teach you how to play the piano.

1111
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,200
What do you want to play?

1112
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,240
I want to play something simple and pleasant.

1113
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,880
I'll learn "Happy Birthday to You".

1114
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,840
I want to compete with Hua.

1115
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,840
You want to play two hands and one hand.

1116
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,280
Two hands.

1117
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,840
Play it.

1118
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,440
It's a bit complicated.

1119
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,880
You should learn to use your hand first.

1120
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,160
You play the right hand first.

1121
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,520
Okay. Which side?

1122
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,640
This is "bang".

1123
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,720
I put it on.

1124
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,640
Ta-da.

1125
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,640
Dadadadadadadadadada.

1126
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,880
Bounce.

1127
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,840
Thumb.

1128
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,920
Thumb.

1129
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,000
Then

1130
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,600
Boom.

1131
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,920
Ta.

1132
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,600
Shake hair.

1133
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,520
Shake hair.

1134
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,240
Yes.

1135
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,520
This should be demoted.

1136
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,600
This is bang.

1137
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,680
Come down

1138
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,400
It's coming down.

1139
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,480
Let's go.

1140
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,160
Let's play Eagle and Chicken later.

1141
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,920
Who is the eagle?

1142
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,000
The soup is like an eagle.

1143
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,840
An athlete is an eagle.

1144
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,840
Let's go to the grass.

1145
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,920
I'm afraid you'll fall down.

1146
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,080
No.

1147
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,120
Your team is too long.

1148
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,520
It's easy to catch it.

1149
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:35,920
Let's see

1150
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,200
Let's see who gets caught.

1151
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,280
Go.

1152
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,680
Go.

1153
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,320
Your legs are too long.

1154
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,200
Wait.

1155
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,560
He fell down.

1156
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,600
Are you okay?

1157
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,120
I got caught.

1158
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,360
No.

1159
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,080
This is too slippery.

1160
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,280
It's inside

1161
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,400
Let's go to the grass.

1162
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,760
I was afraid you would fall.

1163
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,360
But everyone fell.

1164
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,560
Now there are two eagles.

1165
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,520
Two eagles?

1166
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,040
Why are there two?

1167
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,800
Why are you grabbing me?

1168
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,640
What the hell?

1169
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,280
Who is the eagle?

1170
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,920
You three hawks.

1171
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,120
You three hawks.

1172
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,160
Did you catch them?

1173
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,200
I got Susu.

1174
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:37,720
Susu, let's go.

1175
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,800
Catch Susu.

1176
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,040
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

1177
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,480
No.

1178
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,520
I don't know.

1179
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,600
Yes.

1180
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,240
I'm a little tired.

1181
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,120
Tired.

1182
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,880
I got you.

1183
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,400
No.

1184
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,280
You have to hold it.

1185
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,240
Your hands are so long.

1186
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,000
Arm stretching, right?

1187
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,320
Touching it means catching it.

1188
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,200
Go down.

1189
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:55,880
I'm tired.

1190
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,240
Are you okay?

1191
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,240
Are you okay?

1192
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,920
He's going to hug you.

1193
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,000
Great.

1194
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,000
Because I don't hug him

1195
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,520
I don't have any physical contact.

1196
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,120
It's like being cared

1197
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,600
to be loved.

1198
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,640
Good.

1199
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,680
I'm so happy.

1200
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,760
Another one.

1201
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,520
The chicken is caught.

1202
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,120
Come on.

1203
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,040
No.

1204
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,280
I ran away from home.

1205
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,320
Hide ball.

1206
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,160
Help me!

1207
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,560
What?

1208
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,840
It's so scary.

1209
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,360
I want to be with you.

1210
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,760
I want to hit someone.

1211
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,800
I'll take off my clothes.

1212
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,560
Someone is serious.

1213
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,240
What's going on?

1214
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,080
Master Hua.

1215
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,800
You hit your sister so hard.

1216
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,880
Hit her hard.

1217
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,280
The flower looks pale.

1218
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:05,920
So tired.

1219
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Really tired

1220
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,000
Take a break.

1221
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,640
I got a text.

1222
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,960
From today onwards,

1223
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,760
will be upgraded to House of Feelings.

1224
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,400
Management inviters

1225
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,920
We can only invite one man in.

1226
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,680
It only opens once a day.

1227
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,880
No time limit.

1228
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,560
We can't turn down the invited man.

1229
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,360
Harry has made an appointment.

1230
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,960
Harry has an appointment with Tata.

1231
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,680
Because for the members of the house,

1232
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,840
our siblings are clear.

1233
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,720
So we don't have to

1234
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,880
talk about siblings there.

1235
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,800
We can talk anytime.

1236
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,560
So from today on, our siblings' house

1237
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,440
will be upgraded to a house of love.

1238
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,280
It becomes a space

1239
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,480
to be alone.

1240
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,120
I want to say something.

1241
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,880
I didn't have time to say it yesterday.

1242
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,640
It could be two people.

1243
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,280
more private space.

1244
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,760
We can talk about something else.

1245
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,640
You can ask

1246
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,080
or questions you want to answer,

1247
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,400
So choose the House of Feelings.

1248
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,120
Go ahead.

1249
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,240
Let me ask you.

1250
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
If I don't apply,

1251
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,600
Will you?

1252
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,720
Why?

1253
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,520
I just want to say

1254
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,480
what happened last night.

1255
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,160
Go ahead.

1256
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,760
You go first.

1257
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,440
After sending that message,

1258
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,880
I think I'm more sure of my feelings.

1259
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,400
After you texted me,

1260
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,240
What do you mean?

1261
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,920
I regret it.

1262
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,400
Yes.

1263
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,120
I don't think I should do this.

1264
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,480
I just feel

1265
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,240
against my will.

1266
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,520
I just want to say

1267
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,440
we were in the car yesterday.

1268
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,600
in the car.

1269
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,080
You talk to me.

1270
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,640
and ignored you.

1271
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,600
Then I apologize to you.

1272
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,880
I thought about

1273
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,120
to take a ride with me.

1274
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,760
You might not even ride with me.

1275
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,800
If I'm angry,

1276
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,760
Why should I sit for you?

1277
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,560
Normally,

1278
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,560
I think Harry is good at

1279
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,560
in a relationship.

1280
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,240
Yes.

1281
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,880
I won't sit with you then.

1282
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,000
I'll definitely go back to my room.

1283
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,240
I'll still look for you.

1284
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,160
Really?

1285
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,360
But if you keep ignoring me,

1286
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,040
I have to find Susu.

1287
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,120
Why?

1288
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,640
What for?

1289
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,000
Su Zihao.

1290
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,720
I have to let her know.

1291
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,800
What should we do?

1292
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,160
Then I found that she didn't tell her.

1293
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,080
what you told her.

1294
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,240
She forgot.

1295
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,720
every time

1296
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,640
she was going to tell me

1297
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,800
was interrupted by something else.

1298
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,240
After that,

1299
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,080
she forgot.

1300
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,840
It's not reliable at all.

1301
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,160
But if it were me,

1302
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,680
I won't go back with you.

1303
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,760
That's terrible.

1304
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,040
What are you talking about?

1305
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:04,920
I won't sit with you.

1306
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,640
You're like...

1307
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,920
Double standard.

1308
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,000
You've never had a younger one than yourself.

1309
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,160
Yes.

1310
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,840
I hate boys younger than me.

1311
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,280
I can feel that you are younger than me.

1312
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,920
I'm definitely younger than you.

1313
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,920
But your psychological age

1314
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,240
is quite mature.

1315
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,920
So I can understand

1316
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,600
age is not important.

1317
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,440
But you need to find someone

1318
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,200
someone older than you.

1319
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,440
I think I have expressed

1320
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,160
what I want to express.

1321
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,400
And I'm happy

1322
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,720
I can accept her answer.

1323
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
So I think many questions

1324
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,000
can be mysterious.

1325
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,440
Some are slowly getting to know

1326
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,120
and develop slowly.

1327
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,040
The process of excavation

1328
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,920
is always better than

1329
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
what the answer is.

1330
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,520
I'm more excited.

1331
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,320
After this experience,

1332
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,600
I think I can firmly believe my feelings.

1333
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,840
The two of them

1334
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,440
have some feelings

1335
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,640
in the process of contact.

1336
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,040
Will you do it?

1337
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:03,920
Yes.

1338
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,720
Go ahead.

1339
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,320
Try it.

1340
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:10,960
Wait.

1341
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,880
I can't hold my hand.

1342
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,800
Go ahead.

1343
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,440
Why do you have to do it when I'm talking?

1344
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,680
I really...

1345
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,840
I think they are

1346
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,080
It's a house of sincerity.

1347
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:25,880
Yes.

1348
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,960
Take a look first.

1349
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,600
Last night's cuteness.

1350
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,600
You wore your sister's cuteness last night.

1351
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,880
Tata talks to Harry as well.

1352
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,520
Acting cute.

1353
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,080
Yes.

1354
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,160
I thought about it.

1355
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:39,920
If I send it to you,

1356
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,880
I've figured out what to send.

1357
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,240
Then I thought

1358
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,440
I gave it to Bobo.

1359
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,640
OK.

1360
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,040
Okay.

1361
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:47,440
Okay.

1362
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,320
Don't send it tonight.

1363
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,000
If you don't kill me,

1364
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:51,960
I won't kill you.

1365
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,000
Calm down.

1366
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,840
I'm going home.

1367
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,640
You're home

1368
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,280
I'm coming home.

1369
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,160
You won't see me tomorrow.

1370
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,000
I'm going home.

1371
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,120
I'm going home already.

1372
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,720
I have a big face.

1373
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,120
Go through the photo first.

1374
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,280
You can nail it on your head.

1375
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,000
This is fun.

1376
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,720
Okay.

1377
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,560
Okay.

1378
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,280
Let's go.
