Small gathering with wild liquor, instantly feeling the vibe.

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
Fluffy like the top of a skull.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
Fluffy like a scalp perm, the scalp feels fresh and can breathe.

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
Small gathering with wild liquor, instantly feeling the vibe.

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
Fluffy like a scalp perm, the scalp can breathe.

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,560
It's been a long time since I heard this voice.
Tutu.

10
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
It really is, I'm not used to it.
Xiaoling.

11
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,720
Huahua.
Those with long legs go.

12
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,039
Let's see.
Xiaoling.

13
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,440
Xiaoling.
Come on.

14
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,640
I'll read it.
Xiaoling.

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
Xinxin.
What?

16
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Xiaoling.
We're going to Tianjin.

17
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,240
Tutu.
What?

18
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,440
Xiaoling.
Listen to me read.

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,920
This weekend, we'll have a two-day-one-night trip.
Xiaoling.

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,800
Xiaoling.
The destination is Tianjin.

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
We'll depart at 7 AM tomorrow morning.
Xiaoling.

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,040
Xiaoling.
Please everyone, for

Huahua.
Tianjin.

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,520
Tianjin weather.
Huahua.

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,880
Xinxin.
I've never been to Tianjin before.

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,280
Have you been there?
Xinxin.

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,800
Is Tianjin where you eat roujiamo?
Xinxin.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,600
Xinxin.
Roujiamo is from Xi'an.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm sorry.
Xinxin.

35
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,560
Susu.
I can't believe this.

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,640
Tutu.
We can go watch the old men dive.

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,800
But we can't see it now in winter.
Tutu.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,079
Susu.
Old men dive even in winter.

39
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,560
Really?
Tutu.

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,440
Xiaoling.
It's actually in winter when the old men dive.

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,120
Tutu.
That sounds fun.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,040
Xiaoling and I,
Tutu.

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,079
Tutu.
our whole group cheered out loud.

44
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,920
We're very happy.
Tutu.

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,200
Tutu.
Actually, what I'm looking forward to the most is

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,400
eating in Tianjin,
Tutu.

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,200
Tutu.
enjoying the delicious food.

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,280
They say
Tutu.

49
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,160
Tutu.
a trip is a test to determine

50
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,320
whether two people are compatible or not.
Tutu.

51
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,160
Tutu.
whether two people are compatible or not.

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,600
I want to go and observe more.
Tutu.

53
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,600
Terry,
I think we don't have much time left now.

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,440
having a journey like this
Terry,

55
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,520
is quite exciting.
Terry,

56
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,680
Pangpang,
My first reaction is

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,960
because the misunderstanding between Huahua and I
Pangpang,

58
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,160
Pangpang,
was just cleared up, wasn't it?

59
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,440
we can use this trip to get to know each other better.
Pangpang,

60
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,400
Pangpang,
I think a trip

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
can help you
Pangpang,

62
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,280
Pangpang,
understand a person in many aspects

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,720
and see them clearly.
Pangpang,

64
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,200
Huahua,
Traveling together,

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,880
makes me happy just thinking about it.
Huahua,

66
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,280
Huahua,
Everything is unknown.

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,040
Xiaoling,
Tom,

68
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,920
I want the small suitcase.
Xiaoling,

69
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,640
let's go.
Tangtang,

70
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,120
Xiaoling,
What about you?

71
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,760
Tangtang,
go ahead.

72
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,640
I'll carry a backpack.
Tangtang,

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,520
Aren't you bringing a suitcase?

74
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,480
Xinxin,
My suitcase is huge.

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,120
mine too, it's super big.
Tata,

76
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,800
no worries, you can put it in my bag.
Harry,

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,160
Tata,
You carry the backpack,

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,960
Xinxin,
I can share with Xiaoling.

79
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,760
we can both fit in one suitcase.
Xinxin,

80
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,240
Terry,
Siblings can share one suitcase.

81
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,720
Xinxin,
right.

82
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,000
Susu,
but my brother won't share a suitcase with me.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,440
what should we do?
Susu,
but my brother won't share a suitcase with me.

84
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,880
Terry,
Then ask your brother.

85
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
why are you asking me?
Terry,

86
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,200
Harry,
We can share one suitcase.

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,120
that little purple one
Harry,

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,800
won't the blue one work?
Harry,

89
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
then help me with the blue suitcase first.
Susu,

90
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,920
Harry,
You sort it out yourself.

91
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,720
Susu,
I brought all my clothes today.

92
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,120
take them out for me.
Susu,
I brought all my clothes today.

93
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Harry,
Sort it out yourself.

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Susu,
but I still need to pack my makeup

95
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,440
Susu,
and my skincare products.

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,960
I won't share a suitcase with you.
Harry,

97
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,320
Susu
Are you sure?

98
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,800
Su Su
Are you sure?

99
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Harry
bring

100
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,840
You can
Harry

101
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,880
I can bring a suitcase.
Harry

102
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,480
Su Su
let's go.

103
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
come with me to pack the luggage.
Su Su

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,560
Harry
You pack first.

105
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Su Su
help me take it out first.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,440
Harry
let's chat.

107
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,320
I'll find you after chatting.
Harry

108
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,760
Xiao Ling
please put it next to my bed.

109
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,640
Thank you.
Xiao Ling

110
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,680
Tang Tang
Which one is your bed again?

111
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,840
The one by the window.
Xiao Ling

112
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,240
He
We're off.

113
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,520
Tang Tang
going to the Tianjin Eye.

Pang Pang
I want to eat Jianbing Guozi.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,760
Arrived in Tianjin.
Tu Tu

116
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,480
Tang Tang
You haven't been here before.

117
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,720
First time here.
Terry

118
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
Are you happy?
Tu Tu

119
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,720
Tang Tang
So happy!

120
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,000
Ta Ta
Have you been here before?

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,640
Xiao Ling
No.

122
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,480
Just passed by.
Xiao Ling

123
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,080
Xiao Ling
How about you?

124
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,880
I haven't been here either.
Ta Ta

125
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,960
let's go.
Tang Tang

126
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,480
Harry
Task card

127
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,400
There's a task card here.
Tu Tu

128
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,880
Yes.
Harry

129
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,040
Director
We partnered with Weibo.

130
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,200
Launched 'Love Siblings'.
Director

131
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,560
Director
Unlocked the 'Winter Date Spots' submission event.

132
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,080
Received.
Director

133
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,920
Director
Submissions from various romantic cities.

134
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,600
We finally decided to accept the recommendation.
Director

135
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,880
Director
Came to Tianjin for filming.

136
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,240
Started the exciting journey.
Director

137
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,520
Harry.
Let's take a look first.

138
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,800
Welcome everyone to Tianjin.
Tutu.

139
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Tutu, next we'll choose rooms by drawing cards.

140
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Tutu.
Next, we'll choose rooms by drawing cards.

141
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,880
Choose rooms.
Tutu.

142
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,720
Suites. What rooms are below?
Harry.

143
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,120
Tutu.
Yes.

144
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
There are two standard rooms and two suites.
Tutu.

145
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,440
Tutu.
So now we need to draw cards.

146
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
To choose rooms.
Tutu.

147
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,640
Is this it?
Harry.

148
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,120
Yes.
Tutu.

149
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,240
Xiaoling.
My first thought is

150
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,000
If we're assigning rooms by drawing blindly,
Xiaoling.

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,920
Xiaoling.
to assign rooms,

152
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,880
then surely
Xiaoling.

153
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,600
Xiaoling.
there will be many different combinations.

154
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,880
And then there might be some new sparks.
Xiaoling.

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,160
Pangpang.
Come on, let's decide with rock-paper-scissors.

156
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,360
Rock, paper, scissors!
Tutu.

157
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,040
Rock, paper, scissors!
Tutu.

158
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
Paper!
Tutu.

159
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,600
Tutu.
He's first.

160
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,080
Pangpang.
First.

161
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,080
Tutu.
You're second and third.

162
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,680
You two go.
Tutu.

163
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,440
Pangpang.
I'm telling you, I can't be last.

164
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,840
Come on.
Tutu.

165
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,000
Then you have no choice.
Tata.

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,880
Terry.
Not necessarily.

167
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,960
You never know what you'll draw.
Terry.

168
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,320
Susu.
Right.

169
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,680
The first one drawn might be (a standard room).
Susu.

170
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,120
Terry.
Right.

171
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,040
Tata.
Tutu is speechless.

172
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,440
At an age where you can't hide things.
Tutu.

173
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,159
Huahua.
It really is an age where you can't hide things.

174
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,520
Terry.
If Huahua and I

175
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,760
draw a suite,
Terry.

176
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,080
Terry.
I'd actually be happier.

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,240
Pangpang.
Suite.

178
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,600
Tutu.
Next, you girls.

179
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Huahua.
Let's just draw directly, okay?

180
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,240
Go ahead, you draw.
Tata.

181
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,560
Huahua.
At that time, I actually wanted to room with Xiaoling.

182
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,800
Or share a room with Xinxin.
Huahua.

183
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
Susu.
I didn't think much about it.

184
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,680
I just thought, let it be.
Susu.

185
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,240
Susu.
Whoever I got paired with would be fine.

186
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,200
Xinxin.
We'll definitely be together.

187
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,760
Xinxin.
What I wanted most was definitely...

188
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,080
to live with my roommate.
Xinxin.

189
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,400
After all, I'm already used to living with her.
Xinxin.

190
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,680
Xiaoling.
At that time, I thought...

191
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,480
Xinxin, please.
Xiaoling.

192
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,800
Xiaoling.
I'm begging you.

193
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
I want to live with Xinxin.
Xiaoling.

194
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,440
I'm in standard room one.
Tutu.

195
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,360
Terry.
We're the same.

196
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,080
So we'll be living together.
Tutu.

197
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,960
Terry.
I'm quite happy to be living with Tutu.

198
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,560
Because Huahua will often come to visit him.
Terry.

199
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,800
Terry.
This way, I can...

200
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,200
have more interaction with Huahua.
Terry.

201
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,320
What about you guys?
Tutu.

202
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,840
Tangtang.
I'm in suite two.

203
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,760
Pangpang.
I'm...

204
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,200
Suite two.
Pangpang.
I'm...

205
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,560
Susu.
I'm in suite two.

206
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,480
Tangtang.
We're together.

207
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,560
It's a bit funny.
Tangtang.

208
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,440
Funny.
Harry.

209
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,320
Susu.
I'm quite satisfied.

210
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,200
I'm sleeping in the suite.
Susu.

211
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,120
Still sleeping alone in a big bed room.
Susu.

212
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,320
Susu.
And with the person I wanted to get to know...

213
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,720
in the same suite.
Susu.

214
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,640
Susu.
It feels like a coincidence.

215
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,960
It feels like fate.
Susu.

216
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,560
Tangtang.
Happy.

217
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,360
Tangtang.
Although I don't know what good it'll do.

218
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,080
But I'm happy.
Tangtang.

219
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,080
Pangpang.
Definitely.

220
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,680
Not happy.
Pangpang.

221
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,320
Pangpang.
Right.

222
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,360
I drew a suite at that time.
Pangpang.

223
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,880
Pangpang.
I thought...

224
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,799
Pangpang.
It must be a very big room.

225
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,200
Pangpang.
But I didn't expect that when I got there...

226
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,559
I became a big third wheel.
Pangpang.

227
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,320
I'm in Suite One.
Tata.

228
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,360
Xiaoling.
So we're staying together.

229
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,240
What are you?
Xiaoling.

230
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,360
Harry.

231
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Susu.
Su Zihao is in Suite One.

232
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,040
Tata.
I'm very surprised.

233
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,680
because I never expected
Tata.

234
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,160
Tata.
that the room I drew would be

235
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,400
the one with Harry.
Tata.

236
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,160
It feels like there's something in the universe,
Tata.

237
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,800
like it's meant to be.
Tata.

238
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,200
Harry.
Because being with Tata,

239
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
I feel very happy.
Harry.

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,280
Xiaoling.
I've always known my luck isn't good,

241
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
Xiaoling.
but I didn't expect to draw

242
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,280
such a big third-wheel room.
Xiaoling.

243
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,920
Xiaoling.
Things didn't go as planned.

244
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,040
I ended up being a big third wheel.
Xiaoling.

245
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,240
Xiaoling.
Let's just say,

246
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,960
Xiaoling.
I don't talk much with Harry,

247
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,560
I don't talk much with Tata either,
Xiaoling.

248
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,840
Xiaoling.
but they talk a lot with each other.

249
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,400
And I'm staying in the same room with them.
Xiaoling.

250
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,440
Xiaoling.
So I'm wondering,

251
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,160
what should I do?
Xiaoling.

252
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,320
Huahua.
Label Two.

253
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,200
Xinxin.
We're both Label Two.

254
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,160
Huahua.
I ended up drawing Xinxin.

255
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,600
I'm very satisfied with this result.
Huahua.

256
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,240
Xinxin.
The most unexpected thing is

257
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,160
that boys and girls can stay together.
Xinxin.

258
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,920
Xinxin.
I always thought

259
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,040
it would definitely be three girls, two girls,
Xinxin.

260
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,280
that kind of combination.
Xinxin.

261
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,800
Xinxin.
I'm very surprised.

262
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,160
Xinxin.
Here.

263
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,520
It's not bad.
Huahua.

264
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,240
Huahua.
Not bad.

265
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,800
Can you help me with the suitcase?
Huahua.

266
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,320
Huahua.
We're destined to share a room.

267
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,080
Xinxin.
Yes.

268
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,880
When you went to draw,
Xinxin.

269
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,160
Xinxin.
I thought we would be locked together.

270
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,440
Huahua.
Yes.

271
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,080
Luckily,
Huahua.

272
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,040
Huahua.
how are we staying in a suite?

273
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,320
Luckily, it's not us.
Huahua.

274
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,520
Huahua.
It's really awkward.

275
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,960
Huahua, I think this is truly fate's arrangement.

276
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,440
Xinxin.
If it were me, I'd die of embarrassment.

277
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Terry.
I think it's quite good too.

278
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,320
It's okay.
Tutu.

279
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,160
Terry.
Yes, I think this standard room is similar to their suite,

280
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
shouldn't be much different.
Terry.

281
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,520
Much more comfortable.

282
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,840
And we don't have to be the third wheel.
Terry.

283
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,440
Xiaoling and that one,
Tutu.

284
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,200
Terry.
Xiaoling and Pangpang really,

285
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,520
Really unfortunate.
those two are really unfortunate.

286
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,720
Terry.

287
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,280
Xiaoling.
Not bad.

288
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,360
Really good.
Xiaoling.

289
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,920
Tata.
Not bad.

290
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,000
What a coincidence.
Tata.

291
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,680
Xiaoling.
Tata.

292
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,480
What can I say?
Xiaoling.

293
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,800
Fate is indescribable.
Xiaoling.

294
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,840
Who is Susu rooming with?
Tata.

295
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,280
Susu.
Xiaoling.

296
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,240
She's with Tangtang and Pangpang.
Harry.

297
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,200
Xiaoling.
They are too.

298
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,000
Is it that funny?
Tata.

299
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,200
Xiaoling.
What kind of existence am I?

300
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,440
May I ask,
Xiaoling.

301
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,080
Pangpang.
which one is the king bed?

302
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,320
Susu.
This one, I saw it.

303
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,360
Thank you.
Susu.

304
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,160
Pangpang.
Shouldn't it be mine?

305
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,720
Thank you.
Susu.

306
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,640
Pangpang.
Okay.

307
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
Susu.
I'm so thrilled.

308
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,440
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Tangtang.

309
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,160
Pangpang
You seem very upset.

310
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,600
Tangtang
No.

311
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm so happy.
Tangtang

312
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,400
Susu
It feels so good.

313
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,600
Tangtang
Kick her out.

314
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,240
Pangpang
She's gone.

315
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,720
Let's go.
Tutu

316
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,600
Let's go.
Tutu

317
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,200
Pangpang
Go downstairs.

318
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,360
Huahua
This is such a coincidence.

319
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,040
I think
Huahua

320
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,320
Huahua
it's just these two couples.

321
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,680
Xiaoling
Right.

322
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,160
Xinxin
And why is Tutu sleeping with Terry?

323
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,880
I just want to see Pangpang sleeping with Terry.
Xinxin

324
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,440
Xinxin
I don't understand. It's really frustrating.

325
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,920
Xinxin
Why isn't it you and Terry

326
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,360
living with Pangpang, the three of you?
Xinxin

327
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,960
Xiaoling
I want to see that.

328
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,720
If that's the case,
Tata

329
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,120
Xinxin
I would definitely get involved.

330
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,600
I got goosebumps for a moment.
Susu

331
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,640
Me too.
Tata

332
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,920
Xinxin
Wouldn't you say I saved you?

333
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,400
Huahua
Yes.

334
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,800
Xinxin
Right?

335
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,280
Xinxin
To celebrate everyone's first group trip, Xinxin

336
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,160
'Love Siblings'
Xinxin

337
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,760
Xinxin
is hereby hosting the first photography contest.

338
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,680
Please feel free to take photos and check in at the beach,
Xinxin

339
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,000
Xinxin
capturing your siblings and their partners through your eyes.

340
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,160
Each person should submit three photos
Xinxin

341
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,720
Xinxin
as contest entries.

342
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,200
Huahua
Siblings and their partners.

343
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,360
This 'partner'
Xiaoling

344
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,200
Huahua
means everyone.

345
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
You can take photos of anything in the cabin.
Huahua

346
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,200
That should be the idea.
Tata

347
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,760
Susu
Strike a pose for me.

348
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,560
I want to win.
Susu

349
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,200
Susu
Ta

350
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,720
Xiaoling
Strike a pose for you.

351
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,360
You want to win.
Xiaoling

352
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,600
Susu
Strike a pose for me.

353
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,560
Is it for taking photos of siblings?
Hali.

354
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,360
Siblings and them.
Together.

355
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,640
Tutu.
With them.

356
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,240
Then I won't take photos for my sister.
Hali.

357
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,200
Pangpang.
Someone else will take photos with your sister.

358
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,720
Terry.
I think so too.

359
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,160
Tangtang.
No, this is too difficult.

360
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,800
Terry.
How's your photography skills?

361
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,360
Do you want me to teach you?
Terry.

362
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,200
Tangtang.
Come on, quickly.

363
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Terry.
When taking photos, make sure to compliment her looks.

364
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,320
This looks good, right.
Terry.

365
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
Terry.
That's it.

366
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,560
You must do it like this.
Terry.
That's it.

367
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,800
Give emotional value.
Terry.

368
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,880
Tangtang.
Zoom in the phone camera by 1.3 times.

369
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,200
Terry.
Right.

370
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,680
Tangtang.
Why?

371
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,960
Terry.
It means the person will take up a larger proportion of the frame.

372
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,680
Tangtang.
I need to memorize the tips.

373
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,480
Terry.
When taking photos, the person should be the main focus.

374
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,280
Tangtang.
The person is the subject.

375
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,720
Terry.
Yes.

376
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,920
Tangtang.
The person is the subject.

377
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,560
Don't make her look short in the photo.
Tangtang.

378
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,520
Then zoom in by 1.3 times.
Tangtang.

379
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,840
Terry.
Were you this serious when you were studying?

380
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,440
Tangtang.
No.

381
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,160
Tangtang, otherwise I wouldn't know how to take the photos.
Tangtang.

382
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,200
Hali.
Just take a few more shots.

383
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,320
Then just choose from them.
Hali.

384
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,960
Terry.
Don't panic.

385
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,560
It's no big deal.
Terry.

386
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,120
Still not panicking?
Tangtang.

387
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,000
What's the big deal?
Hali.

388
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,280
Tangtang.
Oh no, something's going to happen.

389
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
We've arrived at the seaside.
Tutu.

390
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,600
Tutu.
Are you confident for later?

391
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,800
No.
Xiaoling.

392
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,120
I think we'll definitely win, I'm telling you.
Tutu.

393
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,320
That depends on who takes the photos.
Xiaoling.

394
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,360
Tutu.
We'll win anyway.

395
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,720
You two have the best looks.
Tutu.

396
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,280
Xinxin
Have you learned it?

397
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,840
Don't make me look 1.2 meters tall in the photo.
Xinxin

398
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,560
Pangpang
What are you photographing?

399
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,440
Xinxin
Take a photo of your siblings.

400
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,080
Pangpang
I'm not photographing you, I'm photographing Huahua.

401
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,960
Xinxin
You must photograph your siblings and them.

402
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,200
Pangpang
I ignored the part about siblings.

403
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,880
Huahua
Don't take photos.

404
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,320
That thing of yours
Huahua
Don't take photos.

405
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,600
Huahua
forget it.

406
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,040
Pangpang
I'm telling you, mine has the best image quality.

407
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,920
Huahua
I don't want to.

408
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,120
Let's go.
Xiaoling

409
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,280
Xinxin
Let's set off.

410
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,200
Be careful, everyone.
Tutu

411
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
Tangtang
Don't sprain your ankle.

412
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
Balance ability
Tangtang

413
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,600
Tangtang
Can you walk on the stone path?

414
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,480
Tangtang
Don't sprain your ankle.

415
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,200
Tangtang
Walk this way, the stones are flatter here.

416
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,560
I might as well carry you across.
Tangtang

417
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,560
Xinxin
Okay, you can carry me across.

418
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,120
Tangtang
She's already halfway across.

419
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,480
Susu
I'm scared.

420
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,880
Huahua
Are we participating in a live competition or

421
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,960
Pangpang
It's definitely static.

422
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,080
How could it be a live competition?
Pangpang

423
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,760
Pangpang
You just want to

424
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,680
Huahua
Yours can't record live footage.

425
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,360
Pangpang
I have live recording.

426
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
Who says I don't have it?
Pangpang

427
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,040
Pangpang
Pangpang, my phone camera is definitely better than yours.

428
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,400
Take a look yourself, is there any problem?
Pangpang

429
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,440
Pangpang
Look at how many cameras there are.

430
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:58,760
Four.
Pangpang
Look at how many cameras there are.

431
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,640
Huahua
The camera also has skin smoothing.

432
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Take the photo quickly.
Huahua

433
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,040
Huahua
Hurry up.

434
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,240
Pangpang
Smile, you don't look happy.

435
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,920
Hali
Let's find a place.

436
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,040
Pangpang
The smile looks fake.

437
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,280
Pangpang
Look at her smile like this.

438
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
Huahua
Come on, I'll take a photo for you.

439
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,640
Come on.
Huahua

440
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,800
Yuan Bo.
Huahua.

441
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,960
Huahua.
Bo Ge.

442
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,320
Huahua.
What you just did.

443
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,200
Huahua.
That was amazing.

444
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,560
Let's go. I'll help you take photos.
Pangpang.

445
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,240
Huahua.
Where are you guys going?

446
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,680
Xinxin.
Huahua.
Where are you guys going?

447
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
Pangpang.
We're going to take photos where there's no one around.

448
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,040
Terry.
I'll take a close-up of your face.

449
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,080
Huahua.
My face doesn't look good in close-ups.

450
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,800
Let's try it.
Terry.

451
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,520
Huahua.
I don't want to.

452
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:37,960
Terry.
Come on, hurry up.

453
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,320
Huahua.
I don't want to.

454
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,200
If I had a big face, I'd be a supermodel.
Huahua.

455
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,520
Terry.
Hurry up.

456
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,640
Huahua.
If I had a big face, I'd be a supermodel.

457
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,880
Huahua.
No, not too big.

458
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,160
Huahua.
Do you think it's better to smile?

459
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Or is it better not to smile?
Huahua.

460
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,880
Terry.
I'll adjust the exposure a bit.

461
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,920
Let's try both smiling and not smiling.
Terry.

462
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,680
Huahua.
Okay.

463
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,680
Terry.

464
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,840
Terry.
This one is good.

465
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,360
Make it a bit more exaggerated.
Terry.

466
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,240
Terry.
Look happier.

467
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,680
You can bend your waist a little.
Terry.

468
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,280
Terry.
Three, two, one.

469
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,960
Huahua.
It's a sure win.

470
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,440
Terry.
I'm going to choose the photos now.

471
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,280
Huahua.
My face is frozen from smiling so much.

472
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,800
We even caught the seagulls in the shot.
Terry.

473
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,000
We got them all.
Terry.

474
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,880
There are so many here.
Terry.

475
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,160
Huahua.
Got it.

476
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,760
Terry.

477
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,680
Terry.
You sit there.

478
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,120
Terry.
Aren't you scared?

479
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,800
Huahua.
I'm not scared.

480
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,280
Terry.
Not scared.

481
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,240
Terry.
Come on, sit here.

482
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,880
Put your legs outside.
Terry.

483
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,400
Huahua
Do you think it looks good?

484
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,360
Terry
It looks good.

485
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,880
They're all here.
Huahua

486
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,360
Really?
Terry

487
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,760
Terry
The back view.

488
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,840
The side view is good too.
Terry

489
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,440
Terry
Looks good.

490
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Perfect score.
Terry

491
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,840
Terry
Good, that works.

492
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,280
Terry
What are you wearing inside? Let me see.

493
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,080
Huahua
It's a sweater inside.

494
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,480
Off-shoulder.
Huahua
It's a sweater inside.

495
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,640
Terry
That works too.

496
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,000
Show a little.
Huahua

497
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,720
Terry
This side is absolutely beautiful.

498
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,560
It's truly stunning.
Terry

499
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,800
Huahua
Gorgeous. So, did we win?

500
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,720
Terry
It's much better than the previous one.

501
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,079
Terry
Look back.

502
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,760
Smile.
Terry

503
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,040
Huahua
Give a look of disdain.

504
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,240
Huahua
Terry, international supermodel.

505
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,360
Terry
That's good.

506
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,560
I told you this side looks good, right?
Terry

507
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,680
Terry
Shall we go down and check on Tang Tang and the others?

508
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,320
Let's go.
Huahua

509
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,120
Terry
Are they in front?

510
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,680
Huahua
You say, 'Princess, please disembark.'

511
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
Terry
Are you getting off?

512
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,160
Huahua
Princess, please descend the stairs.

513
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,960
Is that a seagull's cry?
Terry

514
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,840
Huahua
Isn't that what they said?

515
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,960
Is that a seagull's cry?
Terry

516
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,360
Let me take a photo for you first.
Harry

517
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,760
Look at me.
Harry

518
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,640
It really looks good, honestly.
Harry

519
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,400
Hurry.
Harry

520
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
I don't know how to take photos.
Tata

521
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,560
Let me show you.
Harry

522
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,840
Choose a few.
Harry

523
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,000
Harry
You don't need to delete any.

524
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,240
I can see even if you delete them.
Harry

525
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,480
Tata
Delete it.

526
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,400
Hali
I think this angle makes you look fat.

527
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,440
I definitely didn't take that photo.
Hali

528
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,800
Idiot.
Hali

529
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,760
Tata
You're so annoying.

530
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,840
Hali
Let's change locations.

531
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,040
Okay.
Tata

532
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,440
Look at me.
Hali

533
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,000
Hali
Can you make it so that

534
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,280
I look a bit thinner?
Hali

535
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,360
Tata
Don't go down.

536
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,640
Don't go down, come up a bit.
Tata

537
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,160
Tata
Turn to the side a bit more towards me.

538
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,560
Turn your body to the side a bit.
Tata

539
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,320
Hali
That angle just now.

540
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,920
Look over there.
Hali

541
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,640
Bro, I really think it looks good.
Hali

542
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
Tutu
Just be cool.

543
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,360
Right.
Tutu

544
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,520
Xiaoling
Don't step into any holes.

545
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,040
Tutu
I won't.

546
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,040
Tutu
Good.

547
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,480
Look over there, yes.
Tutu

548
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,520
What a magnificent face.
Tutu

549
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,320
Xiaoling
I broke character.

550
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,720
Tutu
Okay, wait a moment.

551
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,560
I'll try again.
Tutu

552
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,320
Tutu
Keep looking over there, yes.

553
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,240
It looks great.
Tutu

554
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,440
Tutu
Good.

555
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,560
It looks really good.
Tutu

556
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,920
Very good.
Tutu

557
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
I'm telling you, it's a winner.
Tutu

558
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,320
Xiaoling
I think my left side is ugly.

559
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,440
It looks great.
Tutu

560
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,640
Okay, take a look yourself.
Tutu

561
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,120
Xiaoling
Why is it in black and white?

562
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,960
Tutu
Yes, this look really suits your face.

563
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,120
This black and white feeling.
Tutu

564
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,400
Tutu
Because, believe it or not,

565
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,440
Tutu, they're definitely all shooting in these vivid colors.

566
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,240
Come on, let's continue.
Tutu

567
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,120
Xiaoling
Let me take photos for you.

568
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,080
Come on.
Tutu

569
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
I'll think of a way.
Tutu

570
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,960
Let me pretend to feed them.
Tutu.

571
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,600
Xiaoling.
Okay.

572
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,800
Xiaoling.
I'm dying of laughter.

573
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,080
Xiaoling.
Three, two, one.

574
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,360
Can one of them come and eat from you?
Xiaoling.

575
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
No one's coming.
Tutu.

576
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,240
Xiaoling.
Don't fall down.

577
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,280
Move up a bit.
Xiaoling.

578
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,040
Xiaoling.
That's right.

579
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,960
Xiaoling.
Impressive, Wang Jieyu.

580
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,160
Xiaoling.
How can you be so good-looking?

581
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,720
Xiaoling.
Your smile is so bright.

582
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,360
Let's go, let's walk that way.
Tutu.

583
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:34,920
Let's go.
Xiaoling.

584
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,880
Tutu.
Let's go over there.

585
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,040
The seagulls are all over here.
Tutu.

586
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,280
Xiaoling.
Tutu.

587
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,800
Come over here.
Tutu.

588
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,640
Tutu.
Get in the frame.

589
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
Xinxin.
You need to zoom in, about 1.4 times.

590
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,760
Pangpang.
It's a sure win.

591
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,720
Pangpang.
Trust me.

592
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,400
Pangpang.
Look here.

593
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,200
It's a sure win.
Pangpang.

594
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,600
Pangpang.
I'm sorry.

595
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,240
I pressed the video button.
Pangpang.

596
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200
Pangpang.
Is this the feeling you're going for?

597
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,120
Xinxin.
Yes, that's exactly what we want.

598
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,080
Take a few more shots.
Xinxin.

599
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,960
Just take a few good shots seriously.
Xinxin.

600
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,000
Xinxin.
I can choose one out of twenty.

601
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Pangpang.
Turn around and smile.

602
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,320
Xinxin.
That's right.

603
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,440
Pangpang.
Bring that out.

604
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,760
Pangpang.
Okay, turn around.

605
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,120
Turn back again.
Pangpang.

606
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,760
Turn around.
Pangpang.

607
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,360
Pangpang.
Turn back, look up, and smile at me.

608
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,640
Pangpang.
Perfect.

609
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,360
Pangpang.
Look here, look up.

610
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,760
Look up, a little towards me.
Pangpang.

611
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,000
Pangpang.
I think you look good no matter what.

612
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,880
Pangpang.

613
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,240
Xinxin
It's all thanks to my face.

614
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,360
Pangpang
Aren't you going to take a photo for me?

615
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,560
Xinxin
It's all thanks to my face.

616
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,000
Your sister really looks like this for you.
Xinxin

617
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,880
Pangpang
Won't you take a photo for me?

618
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,680
Xinxin
after I take the photo for you,

619
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
you'll feel very uncomfortable.
Xinxin

620
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,280
Pangpang
Why?

621
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,200
because you'll feel that
Xinxin

622
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,960
Xinxin
it's not the sea's fault.

623
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,360
Xinxin
Give me a

624
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,000
Come here and look at the front view.
Xinxin

625
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,360
Xinxin
Let's take a photo together.

626
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,960
This one is good.
Xinxin

627
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,480
Xinxin
Okay.

628
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,840
Susu
Does it look good?

629
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,560
How about taking off the white clothes?
Tangtang

630
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,640
Susu
Okay.

631
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,280
Tangtang
Are you cold?

632
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,920
Susu
I'm not cold.

633
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,160
Susu
But, then I'll take it off.

634
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,120
Tangtang
I'll hold it for you.

635
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,520
Susu
Don't fall down.

636
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,400
Susu
What are you laughing at?

637
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Tangtang
I'm a bit scared to take the photo.

638
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,840
Susu
It's okay.

639
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,760
Tangtang
1.3 times.

640
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Tangtang
I think it looks pretty good anyway.

641
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,040
If you think it doesn't look good,
Tangtang

642
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,520
Susu
take more photos.

643
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,800
Just take many, many photos.
Susu

644
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,080
Susu, I think there will definitely be one that looks a bit better.

645
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,760
Alright.
Tangtang

646
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,000
Tangtang
It looks so good.

647
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,840
Tangtang
Maybe it's because you're good-looking.

648
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,560
Thank you.
Susu

649
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Tangtang
Don't come over here.

650
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,800
This is my phone.
Susu

651
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,920
Tangtang
It's okay, no problem.

652
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,880
Let's go back quickly.
Tangtang

653
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,960
Tang Tang.
Actually, I'm a bit nervous.

654
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,760
Because...
Tang Tang.

655
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,080
Tang Tang.
if I don't take good photos for a girl...

656
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,960
it might...
Tang Tang.

657
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,480
Tang Tang.
the girl might get upset or something.

658
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,760
So, with a nervous feeling...
Tang Tang.

659
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,960
Tang Tang, I've been trying hard to take better photos for her.

660
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,760
Su Su.
Never mind.

661
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Su Su.
I'll help you find a nice spot first.

662
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,480
Then I'll stand there.
Su Su.

663
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,400
Tang Tang.
Are you sure?

664
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,920
Su Su.
Yes.

665
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,440
Is this angle okay?
Tang Tang.

666
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,000
Su Su.
Yes.

667
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,040
Tang Tang.
I've learned something.

668
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,760
Su Su.
Let's take another one.

669
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,640
Tang Tang.
One more.

670
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,800
Tang Tang.
What should I do?

671
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,600
Whatever you like.
Tang Tang.

672
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,080
Su Su.
Just do whatever, just move.

673
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,040
Action.
Tang Tang.

674
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,200
Su Su.
Don't move too fast.

675
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,080
Tang Tang.
I don't know how to move.

676
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,320
Su Su.
Don't look at me.

677
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,600
Okay.
Tang Tang.

678
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,400
Su Su.
Can you look over there?

679
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,160
Su Su.
Don't be so nervous.

680
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,480
Su Su.
Don't suddenly look at me.

681
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,520
Just hold a pose...
Su Su.

682
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,600
Su Su.
for a bit longer.

683
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:16,920
Tang Tang.

684
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,120
Tang Tang.

685
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,600
Tang Tang.
What? Have you found a good angle?

686
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,840
Su Su.
No, I'm taking a selfie.

687
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:23,960
Let's go.
Su Su.

688
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,160
Tang Tang.
Let's walk forward and find some seagulls.

689
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,880
Tang Tang.
Wait a moment, or...

690
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
Su Su.
Dangerous.

691
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,400
Be careful.
Su Su.

692
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,320
Tang Tang.
I want to sit here for a while.

693
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,880
Su Su.
Sit.

694
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,680
Tang Tang.
Don't fall off.

695
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,800
There's sunlight here.
Su Su.

696
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
Su Su.
There's a beam of light.

697
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,600
Tang Tang.
There might have been some conflict a few days ago.

698
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,440
Let's find a place to sit down.
Tang Tang.

699
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,120
Tang Tang.
It might allow us to

700
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
reach a calmer place in our hearts.
Tang Tang.

701
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,080
make us feel more at ease.
Tang Tang.

702
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,880
Tang Tang.
Like instant noodles.

703
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,680
Su Su.
You dyed it,

704
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,400
Tang Tang.
it's fading.

705
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,520
Su Su.
I like black hair.

706
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:13,920
Tang Tang.
What?

707
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,880
Su Su.
I like black hair.

708
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,680
Tang Tang.
Dye it back.

709
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,720
Tang Tang.
I feel this angle doesn't look good.

710
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,600
Su Su.
Who doesn't look good?

711
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,280
Is it you who doesn't look good or me?
Su Su.

712
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,160
Tang Tang.
Do you look good?

713
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,680
Su Su.
I can't see clearly.

714
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,400
Su Su.
I'm okay.

715
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,200
Su Su.
Look, it's pink.

716
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,960
Su Su.
It's pink.

717
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,120
Tang Tang.
The phone should be able to capture it.

718
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,440
Su Su.
That day was foggy.

719
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
I found that the sea was blue,
Su Su.

720
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,640
Su Su, and then the sky was pink and purple.

721
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,960
Su Su.
It felt particularly blissful.

722
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,440
And I was also very happy.
Su Su.

723
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,280
Tang Tang.
Jump down.

724
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,560
Tang Tang.
You need to go from here.

725
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,800
Foreigner.

726
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,080
Tang Tang.
I'm from Xinjiang.

727
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,280
Tall, rich, and handsome.

728
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,240
Wait a moment.
Tang Tang.

729
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,240
Tang Tang.
Are you unable to come down?

730
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,640
Su Su.
Is he a foreigner?

731
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,240
So handsome.
Su Su.

732
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,120
Su Su.
Are you cold?

733
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,360
Su Su.
I'm wearing more than you.

734
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,280
Terry.
What are you doing?

735
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,760
Tang Tang.
What?

736
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,520
Hua Hua.
What are you doing?

737
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:42,960
Tang Tang.
It's a bit cold.

738
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,920
Su Su.
It's too cold.

739
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,560
Tang Tang
It's a bit cold.

740
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,320
It looks so embarrassing.
Tu Tu

741
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,480
Pang Pang
It's not easy to hold hands for once.

742
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,400
You really are something.
Pang Pang

743
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,000
Su Su
The first time holding hands is usually more natural.

744
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
No one asked if they could hold my hand.
Su Su

745
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,800
Su Su
Just that kind of talk.

746
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,000
It's just that he might have finally taken the initiative.
Su Su

747
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,160
He took a step forward.
Su Su

748
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,640
Tang Tang
Happy

749
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,200
Tang Tang
Very nervous.

750
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,520
Tang Tang
My heart is racing.

751
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,720
Tang Tang
I feel out of breath.

752
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,440
Tang Tang
My heart keeps pounding.

753
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,240
Tang Tang
In my mind,

754
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,960
Tang Tang
if I hold hands with someone,

755
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,480
it means
Tang Tang

756
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,080
Tang Tang
that I want to

757
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,600
have a good relationship with her.
Tang Tang

758
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,440
Tang Tang
I can finally

759
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,840
put my anxious feelings to rest.
Tang Tang

760
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,760
Tang Tang, holding hands means we've confirmed our relationship.
Tang Tang

761
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,120
How did the photos turn out?
Tu Tu

762
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Xiaoling
I'll take a couple for you.

763
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Let me submit an assignment.
Xiaoling

764
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,920
Tang Tang
Is that so?

765
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,880
You're so cold.
Tang Tang

766
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Su Su
Take two photos for me.

767
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,240
Let me submit an assignment.
Su Su

768
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,000
So handsome.
Tu Tu

769
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,480
Too handsome.
Tu Tu

770
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,640
Su Su
Let me see.

771
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,320
Tang Tang
Bro,

772
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,840
so that's how emotional value is given.
Tang Tang

773
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,080
Tang Tang
I should have shouted too just now.

774
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,040
Quick, go over there.
Tang Tang

775
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,720
Let me submit an assignment.
Tang Tang

776
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,600
Tang Tang
How are you so good-looking?

777
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,360
Xiaoling
Nonsense.

778
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,720
Tang Tang
To be honest, I don't really want to take photos anymore.

779
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,080
Terry
Tu Tu is teaching Tang Tang how to take photos.

780
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,880
Tu Tu
I want to take photos for you.

781
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,800
I need to submit photos.
Tu Tu

782
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,720
I need to complete my task. Let me take a few photos for you.
Tu Tu

783
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,280
Hua Hua

784
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,680
Huahua
We can't let them succeed.

785
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,760
We can't let them take good photos.
Huahua

786
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,120
Terry
Guess what I'm doing.

787
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,000
Hua
Recording a video.

788
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,800
Terry
I'm zooming in.

789
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,560
Pangpang
Come on, let's take a photo.

790
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,520
Terry
Show him our seagulls.

791
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,360
Huahua
Take a look.

792
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,240
Xiaoling
It's photoshopped, right?

793
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,320
Huahua
Take a look.

794
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,360
Xiaoling
It's photoshopped, right?

795
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,160
Xinxin
It looks great.

796
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,480
He Wenjie, take a look.
Xinxin

797
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,000
Pangpang
What's up?

798
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,040
Xinxin
Take a look.

799
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Huahua
He's so busy.

800
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,640
Let's go, Xinxin.
Pangpang

801
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
Pangpang
Hurry, take a photo.

802
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,880
Are you taking it or not?
Pangpang

803
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,560
Huahua
Hurry up.

804
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,360
Huahua
You hurry up.

805
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,600
Hurry up.
Huahua

806
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,200
Xiaoling
There are so many seagulls here.

807
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,680
Let's go feed the seagulls.
Xiaoling

808
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,960
Terry
So many seagulls.

809
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,400
Huahua
You're drinking in broad daylight?

810
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,520
Tata
Can't have a little wild drink while enjoying the breeze?

811
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,520
Xinxin
I have some too.

812
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,640
Huahua
Who else brought Fruit Cube?

813
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,480
I want some too.
Huahua

814
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,600
Terry
Let's drink and play freely today.

815
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,040
Plenty of Fruit Cube to go around.
Terry

816
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,360
Xiaoling
Can you get me a white grape one?

817
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,560
I want this one.
Tutu

818
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,880
Thank you.
Tata

819
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,720
Huahua
Here you go.

820
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,240
I want a special mix.
Huahua

821
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,840
Terry
Do you want a special mix?

822
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,160
Huahua
I want a special mix.

823
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,840
Xiaoling
Impressive.

824
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,560
Terry
Here it comes.

825
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,520
Thank you.
Huahua

826
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,320
Huahua
Let's have a toast together.

827
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,960
Together
Cheers!

828
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,200
Let's go wild
Together

829
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,520
Together
and enjoy the world.

830
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,520
So high!
Tata

831
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,320
Harry

832
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,840
Xiaoling
Get in the car.

833
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,800
Alright, let's go.
Tutu

834
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
How did the shooting go today?
Harry

835
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Awesome.
Huahua

836
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,160
Really?
Harry

837
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,280
Huahua
I'm telling you, it's absolutely beautiful.

838
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,800
Because Terry can be photographed anytime.
Huahua

839
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,160
Huahua
I just need to wait for the seagulls to come.

840
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,320
Then I'm all set.
Huahua

841
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,640
Tata
Why don't I have any seagulls?

842
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,440
Harry
No,

843
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:15,880
you took over 200 photos.
Harry
No,

844
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,680
Harry
It's impossible not to have a single one with seagulls.

845
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,480
Let me tell you.
Harry

846
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,960
There weren't any big seagulls.
Tata

847
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,680
Big seagulls?
Harry

848
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,080
There were small seagulls.
Tata

849
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,480
Xinxin
How come you all have seagulls? I'm so jealous.

850
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,000
Huahua
We deliberately looked for them.

851
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,960
Xinxin
I only have my face.

852
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,320
Pangpang
Your face is enough, you don't need seagulls.

853
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,280
Xinxin
The main thing is that we two don't have the right vibe.

854
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,160
They all have the atmosphere.
Xinxin

855
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,600
Pangpang
Enough, you just need to be stunningly beautiful.

856
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,120
No need.
Pangpang

857
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,400
Susu
Let me put it on for you.

858
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,080
Susu
I'm afraid you'll be cold.

859
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,960
Susu
Let's play hand slapping.

860
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,800
Susu
Use that hand.

861
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,120
Susu
Have you played before?

862
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,400
Tangtang
No, why are you standing up?

863
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,880
There's still a charge-up here.
Tangtang

864
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,680
Susu
That's so loud.

865
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,080
Susu
You can't keep faking, it's not fun.

866
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,480
Susu
This place is too small.

867
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,440
Hold it higher.
Susu

868
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,400
Tangtang
You do it.

869
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,360
Tangtang
What are you doing? I'm not ready.

870
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,160
Playing this with table tennis players.
Tang Tang.

871
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,120
Pang Pang.
We're here.

872
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,520
Hua Hua.
Goubuli VIP Building.

873
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,159
Hua Hua.
Time to eat.

874
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,719
Hua Hua.
Sit here.

875
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,760
Terry.
You sit here.

876
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,480
Hua Hua.
I don't want to sit in the main seat.

877
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,120
How do we sit in these seats?
Pang Pang.

878
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,239
This is the main seat.
Xiao Ling.

879
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:38,840
Terry.
The main seat.

880
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,239
Pang Pang.
Since you're all so shy,

881
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,280
let me do it.
Pang Pang.

882
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,880
Hua Hua.
You insisted on sitting in the seat originally reserved for Tu Tu.

883
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:49,840
Hua Hua.
No.

884
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,600
Just kidding.
Hua Hua.

885
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,120
Xin Xin.
Tu Tu, sit here.

886
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,360
Pang Pang.
Come on, boss, please.

887
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,120
Xin Xin.
Hello.

888
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Xiao Ling.
You should sit in the main seat.

889
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,240
I'll sit here.
Tu Tu.

890
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,240
I'll sit here.
Tu Tu.

891
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,720
Here.
Tu Tu.

892
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,960
Hua Hua.
Look at the beautiful ladies on your left and right.

893
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
This is a bit...
Tu Tu.

894
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,960
I'm too honored.
Tu Tu.

895
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,000
Pang Pang.
Shouldn't the main seat propose a toast?

896
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,600
Tu Tu.
Come on, everyone.

897
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,000
We're gathered here together,
Tu Tu.

898
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,320
Tu Tu.
let's have a toast.

899
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,440
Terry.
Cheers!

900
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,080
Tu Tu.
Let's laugh freely together.

901
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,360
Ta Ta.
Let's be unrestrained together.

902
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,400
Pang Pang.
Can we start now?

903
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,840
Boss,
Pang Pang.
Can we start now?

904
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,440
Tu Tu.
we can.

905
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,320
Let's eat, everyone, dig in.
Tu Tu.

906
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,440
Thank you.
Hua Hua.

907
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,160
Pang Pang.
Where's your bowl?

908
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,160
Pang Pang.
I'm sorry.

909
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,880
Thank you.
Hua Hua.

910
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,160
Terry.
You want to eat spicy food, right?

911
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,560
Hua Hua.
Let me taste it for you.

912
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,680
Huahua
Not spicy.

913
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,440
It's just garlic.
Huahua

914
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,960
Pangpang
Her level of non-spiciness

915
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,840
compared to your level of non-spiciness
Pangpang

916
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,080
Pangpang
is not the same level of non-spiciness.

917
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,200
Xinxin
That day when Terry stir-fried shredded potatoes,

918
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,680
he only added a tiny bit of chili,
Xinxin

919
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,720
Xinxin
but he told me it was so spicy.

920
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,680
Huahua
He was sweating from the spiciness.

921
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,040
Terry
My sweat was dripping down.

922
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,120
Terry
So exaggerated.

923
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,040
Pangpang
I should be a bit better than you at eating spicy food.

924
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,560
Pangpang
Bro, you've lost.

925
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,280
You're definitely better at eating spicy food than I am.
Terry

926
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,040
Chili sauce.
Tata

927
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,120
Or is it garlic chili sauce?
Tata

928
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,320
It's quite spicy. Scoop less.
Harry

929
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,600
Tutu
Mullet roe soup.

930
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,960
This soup is quite tasty.
Xiaoling

931
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
So flavorful.
Tutu

932
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,880
Isn't this your favorite?
Tangtang

933
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,240
Xiaoling
Yes.

934
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,200
Currently, right?
Tutu

935
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,320
Tangtang
No, she's liked it since

936
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,600
Xiaoling
she was little.

937
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,960
Tutu
She's liked this soup since she was little.

938
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,280
Tangtang
Wait a moment.

939
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,920
Okay.
Tangtang

940
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,080
Tata
You're holding the chopsticks so low.

941
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
Susu
This is how I hold chopsticks.

942
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,960
Really?
Tata

943
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,600
Susu, why are you holding your chopsticks so low?
Huahua

944
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,840
Huahua
I've heard that holding chopsticks close means you'll marry nearby,

945
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,840
and holding them far means you'll marry far away.
Huahua

946
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,240
Pangpang
At this rate, you'll be marrying someone in Southeast Asia.

947
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,280
Goubuli is here, Goubuli.
Terry

948
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,120
Goubuli is here.
Tutu

949
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,200
Goubuli buns.
Xiaoling

950
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,320
These are delicious too.
Xiaoling

951
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,000
Yes.
Tutu

952
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,400
Dipping them in vinegar is really authentic.
Tutu

953
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,960
Xinxin.
Delicious.

954
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,000
Huahua, I think even people who don't eat baozi are delicious.

955
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,560
Xinxin.
Me too.

956
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,960
Distinguished guests and friends,

957
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,720
good evening everyone.

958
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,600
Good evening.
Tutu.

959
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,520
Huahua.
Hello.

960
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,960
Welcome everyone to Goubuli.

961
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,160
Taste our traditional Tianjin cuisine,

962
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,040
Goubuli baozi.

963
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,560
Next, I'll perform a Tianjin kuaiban for you,

964
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,120
'The Legend of Goubuli.'

965
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,960
I hope you all enjoy it.

966
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,920
Wishing you a pleasant meal,

967
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,320
and may you always be smiling.

968
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,520
Huahua.
Good.

969
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,920
As I clap these bamboo clappers,

970
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,600
I won't praise anything else,

971
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,320
but I'll praise

972
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,080
Tianjin's

973
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,040
Goubuli baozi.

974
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,360
These Goubuli baozi,

975
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,960
what makes them so good?

976
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
They're good because of their fine craftsmanship,

977
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,000
never adulterated.

978
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,800
They have thin skin and big filling,

979
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,720
eighteen pleats,

980
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,960
just like a flower.

981
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,080
Enjoy your meal.

982
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,400
Thank you.
Huahua.

983
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,240
Tata.
We've experienced Tianjin's local

984
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,840
cultural customs.
Tata.

985
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,000
Tata.
The whole atmosphere

986
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,800
has become lively for us.
Tata.

987
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,520
The entire ambiance is joyful for everyone.
Tata.

988
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,200
Thank you.
Tutu.

989
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,920
Let Tutu go first, Tutu's in the main seat.
Pangpang.

990
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,680
Tutu.
Then I'll start.

991
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,920
The first one is
Tutu.

992
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,280
this one.
Tutu.

993
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,240
Huahua.
So beautiful.

994
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,920
Xinxin.
A great shot.

995
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,600
Tutu.
Indeed.

996
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,520
Why did I put this photo
Tutu.

997
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,200
Tutu.
as the first one?

998
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
And take a photo in this style?
Tutu.

999
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,480
Tutu.
My first impression when entering the cabin

1000
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,040
was about Xiaoling,
Tutu.

1001
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,640
Tutu.
it might be a bit biased,

1002
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,000
she doesn't like to talk much,
Tutu.

1003
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,760
and she seems a bit aloof.
Tutu.

1004
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,840
Tutu.
I've thought about it, I've envisioned it.

1005
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,720
I said she should take this type of photo.
Tutu.

1006
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,840
Tutu.
It will definitely have that kind of vibe.

1007
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,000
So I just,
Tutu.

1008
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,960
Tutu.
took a shot for her.

1009
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,280
a high-scale black and white photo.
Tutu.

1010
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,240
Tutu.
And it perfectly matches the sea and the ripples.

1011
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,600
And her,
Tutu.

1012
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,240
Tutu.
chiseled profile.

1013
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,360
It's so beautiful.
Tutu.

1014
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,000
This is really beautiful.
Susu.

1015
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,560
Tutu.
Then for the second one, I thought it should also match.

1016
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,160
Today's theme is the ocean.
Tutu.

1017
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,840
Tutu.
Highlighting this blue feeling.

1018
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,880
A state where the hair flows freely.
Tutu.

1019
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,400
Tutu.
Very chic.

1020
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,840
Following the wind.
Tutu.

1021
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,600
Just be someone like the wind.
Tutu.

1022
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,360
Pangpang.
Like the wind.

1023
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,480
A woman like the wind.
Huahua.

1024
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,400
Tutu.
Not only beautiful and graceful,

1025
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,680
but also a bit handsome.
Tutu.

1026
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,320
Tutu.
Next one,

1027
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,920
Thank you.
Xiaoling.

1028
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,320
Tutu.
The next one is my sibling.

1029
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,600
Tutu.
In my eyes, my sibling,

1030
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,480
she is a playful sister.
Tutu.

1031
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,880
Tutu.
In my eyes, she is such a,

1032
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,280
a mischievous little girl.
Tutu.

1033
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,640
And I think,
Tutu.

1034
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,200
Xiaoling.
so beautiful.

1035
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,280
Very good-looking.
Tutu.

1036
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,600
Thank you, Xiaoling.
Huahua.

1037
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,880
Tutu.
These are my three photos.

1038
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,320
Thank you.
Tutu.
These are my three photos.

1039
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,120
Pangpang.
I'll review it.

1040
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,600
Pangpang.
Qiaozui.

1041
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,160
Qiaozui.
Terry.

1042
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Huahua.
It really is Qiaozui.

1043
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,280
Xiaoling.
This is my first photo.

1044
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,200
Xiaoling.
Tutu.

1045
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,800
Xinxin.
Youthful vibe.

1046
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,280
Very youthful vibe.
Xiaoling.

1047
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,400
Susu.
Truly youthful vibe.

1048
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
You are 'Lin Yi'.
Susu.

1049
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,680
Xiaoling
I remember the first day I arrived at the cabin.

1050
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,160
Because I was the one who opened the door for him.
Xiaoling

1051
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,440
Xiaoling
and at the moment I opened the door,

1052
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,000
I said he had such a bright smile.
Xiaoling

1053
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,360
Xiaoling
Hello.

1054
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,520
Tutu
Hello everyone.

1055
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,280
Xiaoling
So today,

1056
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,720
I actually took two photos of him.
Xiaoling

1057
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,440
Xiaoling
He's smiling in both of them.

1058
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,480
I think this is
Xiaoling

1059
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,320
Xiaoling
the deepest impression of him

1060
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,560
in my mind.
Xiaoling

1061
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,400
Xiaoling
So this is

1062
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
a very sunny Tutu,
Xiaoling

1063
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,920
Xiaoling
basking in the sunlight.

1064
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,360
And I think I took good photos,
Xiaoling

1065
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,800
and the model was also very, very good.
Xiaoling

1066
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,960
We worked well together.
Tutu

1067
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,400
Xiaoling
Yes, and this one is also Tutu.

1068
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,200
smiling very happily.
Xiaoling

1069
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,000
Xiaoling, smile again.

1070
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,920
Tutu
It doesn't have that feeling anymore.

1071
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,760
I was very happy at that moment.
Tutu

1072
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Xiaoling
just very happy at that moment.

1073
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,400
The camera captures moments, right?
Xiaoling

1074
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,960
Well said.
Tutu

1075
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,160
This is Tom.
Xiaoling

1076
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,280
Huahua
Tom

1077
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,720
Susu
A jawline like a blade.

1078
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,080
Xiaoling
There's actually a reason for this.

1079
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Xiaoling
It reminds me of Greek statues.

1080
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,880
So I chose this photo.
Xiaoling

1081
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,360
Xiaoling
I think in this one,

1082
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
my brother looks quite handsome.
Xiaoling

1083
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,520
Thank you.
Tangtang

1084
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,080
Tangtang
Okay.

1085
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,560
The first one is...
Tangtang

1086
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,920
Tangtang
I didn't expect Susu

1087
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
would like this photo.
Tangtang

1088
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,000
Huahua
So cute.

1089
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,160
Tangtang
A bit cuter.

1090
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,920
Just a bit more playful.
Tangtang

1091
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,360
Tangtang
Like a red bean bun.

1092
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,680
Red bean bun.
Susu

1093
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,960
Tangtang
Like a happy little hamster.

1094
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,800
Tang Tang,
Tang Tang, I might not be very good at taking photos of girls either.

1095
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,840
but Susu didn't blame me.
Tang Tang,

1096
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,880
Tang Tang,
On the contrary, she's been helping me take photos too.

1097
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,080
to capture such a happy moment.
Tang Tang,

1098
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,800
Tang Tang,
The second photo is of us walking along the coastline

1099
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,520
towards the other side.
Tang Tang,

1100
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,680
Tang Tang,
We found some steps

1101
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,440
and we sat down.
Tang Tang,

1102
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,960
let's quietly appreciate the scenery.
Tang Tang,

1103
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,400
Xiaoling,
It's Susu appreciating the scenery.

1104
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,680
you're admiring Susu, aren't you?
Xiaoling,

1105
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,360
Pangpang,
You're looking at the scenery, I'm looking at you.

1106
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,880
Tang Tang,
I actually think this sentence might be more like

1107
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,240
'Like a rainbow, only known when encountered.'
Tang Tang,

1108
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680
and the last photo is of my sister.
Tang Tang,

1109
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,960
smiling so happily.
Terry,

1110
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,920
Huahua,
So beautiful.

1111
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,480
this is a bit like something created by Nüwa,
Tang Tang,

1112
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,720
Tang Tang,
I think she's a very bright and cheerful sister.

1113
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,440
and she's always been my emotional support.
Tang Tang,

1114
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,600
Tang Tang,
Didn't you know?

1115
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,440
Xiaoling,
I didn't know.

1116
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,000
Tang Tang,
okay.

1117
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,120
Susu,
let me talk about this photo first.

1118
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,360
when we were taking it,
Susu,

1119
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,600
Susu,
it looked especially good on the phone.

1120
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,920
it's that kind of vitality,
Susu,

1121
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,880
Susu,
a sense of life.

1122
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,960
they were talking,
Susu,

1123
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,520
Susu,
and I just took a candid shot.

1124
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,360
Susu,
and they were laughing so happily.

1125
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,480
I'm like Tata's hands and feet,
Susu,

1126
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,000
Susu,
taking very nice photos of Tata.

1127
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,840
thank you.
Tata,

1128
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,120
this photo is
Susu,

1129
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,360
Tang Tang,
so much like a captain.

1130
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,960
Susu,
I didn't think it looked like a captain anywhere.

1131
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,240
Harry,
like a sailor.

1132
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,560
Tang Tang,
you're the captain, I'm the sailor.

1133
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,120
Susu,
this photo turned out very nice.

1134
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,880
it makes your nose look especially high.
Susu,

1135
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,000
Huahua,
It makes the nose look especially high.

1136
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,240
his nose is already very high.
Huahua,

1137
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,960
Terry,
It's already very high.

1138
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,800
and this photo is
Susu,

1139
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,600
Su Su.
That kind of Polaroid filter.

1140
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,360
then just try it casually.
Su Su.

1141
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,840
Su Su.
I think this one looks pretty good.

1142
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,440
Su Su.
because it's not overly posed.

1143
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,920
Tang Tang.
Quick, compliment.

1144
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,360
Pang Pang.
Really handsome.

1145
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,520
Terry.
So handsome.

1146
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,400
Tang Tang.
Really impressed.

1147
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,720
I still have to remind you.
Tang Tang.

1148
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,160
Terry.
No matter how you shoot, it's handsome.

1149
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,560
Tang Tang.
No, it's well shot.

1150
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,080
Where is this?
Tang Tang.

1151
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,560
Su Su.

1152
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,160
Xin Xin.
This jawline.

1153
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,920
This little Adam's apple.
Xin Xin.

1154
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,920
Pang Pang.
You two both have sharp jawlines.

1155
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,800
Terry.
'Sharp Jawline Siblings.'

1156
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,640
Xiao Ling.
'Sharp Jawline Siblings.'

1157
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,160
Tata.
You speak first.

1158
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,240
Then I'll speak first.
Harry.

1159
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,720
My sister isn't in these three photos.
Harry.

1160
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,240
Pang Pang.
Pure Love Warrior.

1161
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,560
Harry.
My sister looks pretty good.

1162
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,080
Her photos are also our photos.
Harry.

1163
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,400
Harry.
Actually, we didn't really,

1164
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,280
just interact much.
Harry.

1165
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,480
Harry.
So I want to keep this peaceful moment,

1166
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,080
for the two of them.
Harry.

1167
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,440
Harry.
Didn't disturb them.

1168
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,560
So they can produce photos,
Harry.

1169
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,320
Harry.
so many beautiful photos.

1170
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,400
It's also because I didn't disturb them.
Harry.

1171
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,840
Harry.
This photo is just,

1172
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,640
I just think the colors are pretty nice.
Harry.

1173
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,200
The sky and sea are like a mirror.
Harry.

1174
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,120
Really looks good.
Xiao Ling.

1175
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,520
Isn't it because the model looks good?
Hua Hua.

1176
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,720
Terry.
I think so too.

1177
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,680
Harry.
I told you.

1178
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,520
I took over two hundred photos.
Harry.

1179
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,120
She was dissatisfied with two hundred of them.
Harry.

1180
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,200
Tata.
There's no such thing as two hundred unsatisfactory photos.

1181
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,080
I haven't even finished selecting, okay?
Tata.

1182
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,200
Tata.
You're slandering me.

1183
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,280
And then this photo is just,
Harry.

1184
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,480
Huahua,
So beautiful.

1185
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,040
Harry,
zoom in.

1186
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,360
I think it looks better when taken from further away.
Harry,

1187
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,640
Harry,
The person should still be the main focus,

1188
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,280
with the scenery as a complement.
Harry,

1189
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,080
this photo hasn't been edited.
Susu,

1190
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,800
it hasn't been edited.
Harry,

1191
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,800
I took it really well.
Harry,

1192
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,480
okay, I'll praise you.
Tata,

1193
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:26,640
really.
Tata,

1194
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,040
Harry,
There's also a photo of us together.

1195
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,240
it's the first time I feel we've taken a photo together at the beach,
Harry,

1196
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,600
so I included it.
Harry,

1197
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,400
Terry,
It has commemorative value.

1198
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,600
Harry,
yes, it has commemorative value.

1199
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,800
it's a milestone.
Harry,

1200
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,720
Pangpang,
You've said all the words I wanted to say, buddy.

1201
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,320
Terry,
it's okay, you can say it again.

1202
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,360
I'm too late.
Pangpang,

1203
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,840
Tata,
All the photos I took are of Harry too.

1204
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,760
the first one is
Tata,

1205
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,840
Tata,
a photo of Harry crouching by the sea.

1206
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,960
this one looks good.
Huahua,

1207
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,080
Tata,
And there are many seagulls in the background.

1208
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,640
this photo has quite a nice atmosphere.
Tata,

1209
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,800
Tata,
The second one is still Harry,

1210
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,040
but it's a photo of his back,
Tata,

1211
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,280
Tata,
taken while he was feeding the seagulls.

1212
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,640
He's been feeding them all day today.
Tata,

1213
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,360
It looks good.
Tata,

1214
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,880
Tata,
And then this one is still

1215
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,520
I included a photo of us together.
Tata,

1216
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,240
Terry,
Isn't it a different one?

1217
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,160
Huahua,
is it different?

1218
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,320
Tata,
it's different from the one just now.

1219
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,400
it's just that my expression is different.
Tata,

1220
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,280
Terry,

1221
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,280
Tata,

1222
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,720
Huahua,
his expression is the same.

1223
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,720
Harry,
no, my expression is different too.

1224
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,760
my eyes look bigger in this photo.
Harry,

1225
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,200
Huahua.
I'll start first.

1226
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,280
Terry.
Okay, you go ahead.

1227
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,760
Huahua.
All three photos I took are of Terry.

1228
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,160
Because I took two hundred photos.
Huahua.

1229
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,680
Huahua.
Maybe he can appear in one hundred ninety-nine of them.

1230
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,080
Huahua, so I basically gave him close-ups in all of them.
Huahua.

1231
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,800
Huahua.
Just like this one.

1232
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,280
Huahua.
Look at his melancholic vibe.

1233
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,280
The man and the sea.
Tang Tang.

1234
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,520
Huahua.
Everyone can take a look.

1235
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,080
Huahua.
And the second one has a lot of seagulls.

1236
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,080
Because we've been attracting them,
Huahua.

1237
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,080
Huahua.
I want a lot of seagulls to come over.

1238
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,520
And take pictures with us.
Huahua.

1239
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,640
Huahua.
Well, we ended up waiting for a flock of seagulls.

1240
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,240
Huahua.
This one is also mine,

1241
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,680
Basically, all of them are his close-ups.
Huahua.

1242
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,000
Huahua.
I think Terry is perfect for close-ups.

1243
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,920
Huahua.
Look at the chiseled jawline.

1244
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,160
I captured it too.
Huahua.

1245
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,320
Xiaoling.
Join our 'Blade Siblings'.

1246
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,280
Terry.
'Blade Family', I'm joining you.

1247
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,120
Pang Pang.
Come, Blade.

1248
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,800
Pang Pang.
Look at you three.

1249
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,120
Huahua.
Aren't you all good-looking?

1250
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:16,400
Yes.
Tu Tu.

1251
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,160
Huahua.
I think Terry is so photogenic.

1252
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,680
Is this the same as the first one?
Ta Ta.

1253
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,440
Huahua.
There's a left side and a right side, okay?

1254
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,240
Every angle is showcased.
Huahua.

1255
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:26,480
Ta Ta.
Got it.

1256
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,240
Ta Ta.

1257
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,240
Huahua.
It proves that Bo Ge,

1258
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,440
He's not just good-looking on one side.
Huahua.

1259
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,240
Terry.
Then it's my turn.

1260
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,400
Like the first one,
Terry.

1261
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,560
Terry.
It's probably Huahua feeding the seagulls.

1262
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,720
Xin Xin.
So beautiful.

1263
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,280
Terry.
This photo is full of atmosphere.

1264
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,160
Everyone take a look.
Terry.

1265
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,080
Terry.
And then,

1266
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,760
I know you all want this seagull.
Terry.

1267
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,640
Huahua.
It's really obedient.

1268
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,800
This is amazing, the atmosphere.
Terry.

1269
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,040
Terry.
The last one is also my favorite.

1270
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,680
This one looks good.
Susu.

1271
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,520
Terry.
It's super sweet and super beautiful.

1272
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,440
Last time I was in the old town,
Terry.

1273
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,080
Terry.
when I took photos of her,

1274
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,800
I already noticed that Huahua was very cute in photos.
Terry.

1275
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,520
Huahua.
Yes.

1276
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:14,800
It's fun.
Harry.

1277
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,240
These two big seagulls,
Harry.

1278
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,600
Terry.
they're so obedient, our seagulls.

1279
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,480
Huahua.
They're really obedient.

1280
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,800
Tata.
Your seagulls.

1281
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:21,800
Pangpang.
They know them.

1282
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:22,920
Tutu.
They raised them.

1283
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,320
Pangpang.
They called them over.

1284
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,000
Pangpang.
Let me do it.

1285
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,680
Pangpang.
Let's take a look at this photo.

1286
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,240
Huahua.
It's very beautiful.

1287
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,400
Pangpang.
There's no special technique.

1288
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,200
My sister is purely beautiful.
Pangpang.

1289
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:35,960
Huahua.
It's all emotion.

1290
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,760
Pangpang.
My sister is strikingly beautiful.

1291
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,960
Pangpang.
When I was taking photos of her,

1292
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,520
I was just trying to capture that moment.
Pangpang.

1293
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,640
Pangpang.
Pangpang, I realized that every movement of my sister

1294
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,120
and every expression is beautiful.
Pangpang.

1295
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:45,960
Pangpang.
My sister is purely beautiful.

1296
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:46,920
Huahua.
Absolutely beautiful.

1297
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,440
Pangpang.
The second one is the same.

1298
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,800
My sister's different expressions,
Pangpang.

1299
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,720
Susu.
beautiful.

1300
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
Huahua.
So beautiful.

1301
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,160
Pangpang.
Although she wanted to attract the seagulls,

1302
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,160
but she couldn't.
Pangpang.

1303
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,160
Couldn't attract them.
Xinxin.

1304
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,080
Pangpang.
Indeed, I don't know them.

1305
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:00,520
Pangpang.
Indeed.

1306
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,880
Terry.
You should have asked for our help.

1307
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,120
Pangpang.
Indeed, I don't know them.

1308
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,000
I was just focused on taking photos for Xinxin.
Pangpang.

1309
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,040
Pangpang.
The next one is of me and Huahua.

1310
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,160
Pangpang,
I didn't take any photos with Huahua along the way.

1311
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,480
because they were taking pictures.
Pangpang,

1312
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,440
Pangpang,
Then when we were leaving, I said,

1313
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,680
let's take one after all.
Pangpang,

1314
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,960
Pangpang,
We were in a rush when taking it.

1315
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
it was right against the sunlight.
Pangpang,

1316
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,680
Pangpang,
Pangpang's phone just happened to shade my face a bit.

1317
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,640
but this photo,
Pangpang,

1318
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,000
Pangpang,
I think it's okay.

1319
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,600
it represents my unknown love.
Pangpang,

1320
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:36,080
Xinxin,
Unknown love.

1321
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,120
Terry,
I was actually quite surprised inside.

1322
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,200
in front of so many people,
Terry,

1323
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,520
Terry,
it felt like he was staking his claim.

1324
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,160
Pangpang,
since it's out there,

1325
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,920
and this opportunity is rare,
Pangpang,

1326
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,000
Pangpang,
because I'm not sure if in the future

1327
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,840
I'll have a chance
Pangpang,

1328
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,080
Pangpang,
to go on a date alone with Huahua.

1329
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,880
that's why I said those words.
Pangpang,

1330
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,080
Huahua,
I think Pangpang was joking,

1331
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:55,560
just giving everyone
Huahua,

1332
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,400
Huahua,
a bit of truth in jest.

1333
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,760
but
Huahua,

1334
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,040
Huahua,
I've already decided in my heart

1335
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,160
to develop it as a friendship.
Huahua,

1336
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,520
Huahua,
I didn't think too much about it.

1337
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,800
Pangpang,
alright, let's take a serious look.

1338
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,800
you'll see it again in the future.
Pangpang,

1339
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,880
Xinxin,
Put it at home, take it straight home.

1340
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,200
give it back to him quickly.
Huahua,

1341
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Xinxin,
It's my turn.

1342
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:17,880
this one,
Xinxin,

1343
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,160
these three photos.
Xinxin,

1344
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,960
Tangtang,
Handsome.

1345
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,520
Xinxin,
taken at 0.5x zoom, indeed.

1346
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,040
no leg lengthening, very tall.
Xinxin,

1347
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,280
Xinxin,
The head is quite small too.

1348
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,680
Huahua,
1.9 meters tall.

1349
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,360
Xinxin,
it's completely without technique.

1350
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,680
just naturally handsome, nothing else.
Xinxin,

1351
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,320
Xinxin,
When I go out with him, basically

1352
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,440
I'll first take a sample photo for him.
Xinxin,

1353
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,240
Xinxin,
That is, I tell him,

1354
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,320
I say I want this angle.
Xinxin,

1355
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,520
Xinxin.
I'll take a photo for you first.

1356
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,440
Then when I get it right,
Xinxin.

1357
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,600
Xinxin.
he can aim at this.

1358
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,800
He can replicate it exactly.
Xinxin.

1359
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,720
Xinxin.
Otherwise, he won't be able to capture it.

1360
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,000
Pangpang.
It's purely for teaching purposes.

1361
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,680
Xinxin.
Pangpang has indeed lost a bit of weight.

1362
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,280
Indeed.
Xinxin.

1363
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,600
Although this jawline isn't as sharp as a blade,
Xinxin.

1364
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,880
Xinxin.
but...

1365
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,160
You can keep working on it.
Xinxin.

1366
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,560
Terry.
That's possible.

1367
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:58,960
Pangpang.
Okay.

1368
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,280
Terry.
You'll join us sooner or later.

1369
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,000
Join us.
Terry.

1370
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,320
Xinxin.
Pangpang is the most difficult to photograph.

1371
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,760
So I think everyone should choose me.
Xinxin.

1372
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,480
Huahua.
Alright.

1373
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,560
Pangpang.
It is indeed quite challenging.

1374
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,080
What's so difficult about photographing Terry?
Xinxin.

1375
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,840
Pangpang.
Right.

1376
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,080
Pangpang.
Just stand there.

1377
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,920
Terry.
Regardless, you still have to choose us.

1378
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:11,920
Tutu.
Let's do this.

1379
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,640
Let's hold each photo in our hands.
Tutu.

1380
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,720
Tutu.
Then face outwards.

1381
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,920
Let's all take a look at each other.
Tutu.

1382
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,760
Huahua.
Tutu is afraid you'll forget about him (his photos).

1383
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,080
There's a text message.
Tutu.

1384
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,560
The best photographer in our hearts.
Tutu.

1385
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,720
Susu.
Tutu received five votes.

1386
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:49,760
Huahua.
Tutu.

1387
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,720
Xiaoling.
Five votes.

1388
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,200
Awesome!
Xiaoling.

1389
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,160
Thank you all for your kindness.
Tutu.

1390
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,200
Thank you to the most beautiful model.
Tutu.

1391
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,520
Huahua.
I'm not.

1392
00:51:59,080 --> 00:51:59,520
Tutu.
You are.

1393
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,480
Xiaoling.
You forgot about your sister.

1394
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,080
Automatically ignoring you.
Terry.

1395
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,640
Tutu.
We're about done eating.

1396
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:03,960
Let's go.
Tutu.
We're about done eating.

1397
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,800
Xiaoling.
Let's leave.

1398
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,240
Let's go.
Harry.

1399
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,760
We're on the bus.
Tutu.

1400
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,640
Tutu.
Going upstairs.

1401
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,480
It feels so good.
Tutu.

1402
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,240
Here.
Harry.

1403
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,360
Let's sit on this side.
Tutu.

1404
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,440
Everyone's sitting in pairs.
Pangpang.

1405
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,760
Pangpang.
You sit with my sister for a bit.

1406
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,040
Pangpang.
Hello, unknown love.

1407
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,440
Huahua.
What?

1408
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,920
Pangpang.
Hello, unknown love.

1409
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,880
Huahua.
Cut it out.

1410
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,200
Get off, get off the bus.
Huahua.

1411
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,400
I don't even dare to ride this Ferris wheel.
Terry.

1412
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,200
Pangpang.
I bet I won't dare either, bro.

1413
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,320
Huahua.
Let's go ride the Ferris wheel.

1414
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Terry.
When I reach the highest point.

1415
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:47,920
I'll be completely flat.
Terry.

1416
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,040
Pangpang.
You're talking about the highest point?

1417
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,960
When I'm just one-sixth of the way up,
Pangpang.

1418
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,280
Pangpang.
I'll be shaking, let alone the highest point.

1419
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,320
Terry.
I'll be shaking too.

1420
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,120
Those two are having a peaceful moment over there.
Xiaoling.

1421
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,120
Susu.
Your hands are so cold.

1422
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,280
You look a bit warmer.
Tangtang.

1423
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,160
It's not much use.
Tangtang.

1424
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,040
Susu.
Because I have a clip on the back.

1425
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,040
Tangtang.
My left hand isn't cold.

1426
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,200
Susu.
I'm not cold, I'm fine.

1427
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,600
Only my cheeks are cold.
Susu.

1428
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,480
Tangtang.
I forgot you gave me your scarf.

1429
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,520
Otherwise, you could just show your eyes.
Tangtang.

1430
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,200
Tata.
Actually, I can.

1431
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,320
Never mind, it's nothing.
Tata.

1432
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,200
Harry.
You can what?

1433
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:00,800
It's nothing.
Tata.

1434
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,360
Harry.
Tell me.

1435
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:01,920
It's nothing.
Tata.

1436
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,040
What's wrong?
Harry.

1437
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,160
Then what's the matter?
Harry.

1438
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,400
Huahua.
Xiaoling, how come you're not afraid of the cold?

1439
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,960
Xiaoling.
I don't know.

1440
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,080
Tutu.
Because Xinjiang is at a high altitude.

1441
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,000
This level of cold is nothing.
Tutu.

1442
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,760
Tutu.
You know what?

1443
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,560
Tata.
People from Xinjiang.

1444
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,000
The first time I met Tangtang,
Tata.

1445
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,440
Tata.
Tangtang told me he was of mixed American descent.

1446
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,320
Then I went back to the cabin,
Tata.

1447
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,640
Tata.
and you all said he was from Xinjiang.

1448
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,520
I started to suspect he was lying to me again.
Tata.

1449
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,160
I thought he was from Xinjiang at first.
Harry.

1450
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,520
Tata.
You two really do look like people from Xinjiang.

1451
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,520
Xiaoling.
I can even say something in Uyghur to trick you.

1452
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,720
Xiaoling.
I love you.

1453
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,200
Harry.
Why are you saying 'I love you'?

1454
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,760
Xiaoling.
You know,

1455
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,560
Xiaoling.
How do you know?

1456
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,080
Tata.
Because she loves me.

1457
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,680
I said you.
Tata.

1458
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,400
Tata.
He said,

1459
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,560
Did he ask you why you love me?
Tata.

1460
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,440
Xiaoling.
It startled me.

1461
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,600
She said it so naturally.
Tutu.

1462
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,560
Tata.
Don't be so sensitive.

1463
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,240
Tata.
Why are you leaning on me?

1464
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,200
Huahua.
This filter is terrifying.

1465
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,200
It doesn't look like me at all.
Huahua.

1466
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,400
Huahua.
You need to press that.

1467
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,640
Pangpang.
Why is my face so big?

1468
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,160
Pangpang.
Bro, you stepped on my foot.

1469
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:35,720
Terry.
I'm sorry.

1470
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,440
Terry.
I want to take a picture of the Ferris wheel.

1471
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,800
Pangpang.
Grabbed a spot and stepped on my foot.

1472
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,160
Huahua.
Terry, there's no need, Terry.

1473
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,400
Here, take it back.
Pangpang.

1474
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,640
Huahua.
Terry, there's no need.

1475
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,840
Terry.
I'll take a picture of the Ferris wheel.

1476
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,400
Tata.
Terry.

1477
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,000
Terry, take a picture of us two.
Tata.

1478
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,920
Terry.
I'm expensive, I take photos.

1479
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,840
I'll give you 50 cents.
Tata.

1480
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,200
Pangpang.
That's too much.

1481
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,680
Terry.
It has a great atmosphere.

1482
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,440
Terry.
That's amazing. I can't handle it.

1483
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,240
Tata.
What?

1484
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,920
This photo is so sweet.
Terry.

1485
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,040
Huahua.
It really looks great.

1486
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,720
Tutu.
Which one? I want to see.

1487
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,160
Huahua.
That's incredible, Terry.

1488
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,160
I want to take a photo too.
Tutu.

1489
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,720
Terry.
Tangtang, come closer to me.

1490
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,400
Terry.
It's fine, it feels good.

1491
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,600
Terry.
Good, it feels right.

1492
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,760
Terry.
How about it, Tang?

1493
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,320
Do you want to?
Terry.

1494
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,520
Tangtang.
Take one.

1495
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,200
Susu.
Use my phone.

1496
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,320
Come closer.
Terry.

1497
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,040
Terry.
Can you look sweeter?

1498
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,480
Tangtang.
Terry.

1499
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,800
Terry.
Handsome.

1500
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,240
Terry.
Good, let's do another one. Good.

1501
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:52,920
The one just now was good.
Terry.

1502
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,560
Terry.
They're setting off fireworks.

1503
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,120
Susu.
I saw it.

1504
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,600
I'm so happy.
Tutu.

1505
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,040
I think Pangpang is very proactive today.
Tata.

1506
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,880
Tata.
Super proactive.

1507
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,160
Unknown love.
Tata.

1508
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,160
Xiaoling.
I'm confused.

1509
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,480
Pangpang.
I've decided to pursue it.

1510
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,680
You've decided to pursue it with only a few days left?
Susu.

1511
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,480
Pangpang.
It's precisely because there are only a few days left.

1512
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,200
I think I should make a move.
Pangpang.

1513
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,400
Then why don't you make a move tonight?
Tangtang.

1514
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,320
Pangpang.
I'm the type who really cares about face.

1515
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,480
When someone asked me out on a date,
Pangpang.

1516
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,760
Pangpang.
I directly said no.

1517
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,320
Indeed.
Tangtang.

1518
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,880
Pangpang.
Someone with my personality,

1519
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,200
I'll pay for my own impulsiveness.
Pangpang.

1520
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,000
Pangpang.
I always say,

1521
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,640
Tang Tang.
Pangpang is the guiding type of player.

1522
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,520
Pangpang is quite good at guiding me.
Tang Tang.

1523
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,520
Pangpang.
then he scratches his head over there.

1524
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,680
Pangpang.
What should I do?

1525
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,920
Su Su.
To the cabin members.

1526
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,240
Tomorrow, the group trip will begin.
Su Su.

1527
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,920
Su Su.
The two routes are respectively,

1528
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,160
Together.
'Jie Si Ma' and 'Dou Ni Wan'.

1529
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,040
Please choose a representative from each room.
Together.

1530
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,840
Harry.
Go to the location to collect the task card.

1531
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,440
Draw a blind box to decide the route.
Harry.

1532
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,520
Pangpang.
Okay, I'll go.

1533
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,240
I'm going.
Tu Tu.

1534
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,760
Hua Hua.
I'm going.

1535
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,440
Xiao Ling.
Alright.

1536
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:30,720
went.
Xiao Ling.
Alright.

1537
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,360
Tu Tu.
Don't fight with me for it.

1538
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,200
Pangpang.
How is it?

1539
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,880
Just take it.
Pangpang.

1540
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,560
Xiao Ling.
I actually want to be with Tu Tu.

1541
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,040
in the same group.
Xiao Ling.

1542
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,280
Xiao Ling.
want to continue playing with him.

1543
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,320
Tu Tu.
Bag, show your magic.

1544
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,960
Pangpang.
What are you?

1545
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,600
Pangpang.
Are you 'Jie Si Ma'?

1546
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,120
Hua Hua.
I'm 'Dou Ni Wan'.

1547
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,040
I'm 'Jie Si Ma'.
Tu Tu.

1548
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,120
Pangpang.
The two of us together.

1549
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,640
I don't want to, I'm really 'crazy'.
Tu Tu.

1550
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,400
Then we'll see each other again.
Tu Tu.

1551
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:14,920
Xiao Ling.
Goodbye.

1552
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,640
Good night.
Tu Tu.

1553
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,000
What's this for?
Tu Tu.

1554
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,640
Hua Hua.
What's this for?

1555
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,040
Xiao Ling.
I want to eat some Tianjin specialties.

1556
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,080
Let's go.
Xiao Ling.

1557
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,640
Xiao Ling.
Sit with me.

1558
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,400
Terry.
Today, our group should have participated, right?

1559
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,400
We're not that, whatever.
Terry.

1560
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,240
Terry.
Sorry.

1561
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,360
Can someone help me?
Su Su.

1562
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,320
Tang Tang.
I'll hold it for you, you go up.

1563
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,000
Hello everyone.
Tutu.

1564
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,640
Did you expect it to be me?
Tutu.

1565
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,160
Tutu.
Now I...

1566
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,040
Didn't I win first place in the photography contest?
Tutu.

1567
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,280
Tutu.
And now I have the right...

1568
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,320
...to exchange with someone...
Tutu.

1569
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,120
Tutu.
...of the opposite sex from the other group.

1570
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,160
Then bring Huahua over here.
Pangpang.

1571
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,000
Huahua.
You're crazy.

1572
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Huahua, if I go over there, I'll definitely interact with Terry.
Huahua.

1573
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,120
Pangpang.
Terry isn't here.

1574
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,960
Huahua.
Terry is in his group.

1575
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,560
Right.
Huahua.

1576
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,560
Pangpang.
Bring him over, he can't compete with me.

1577
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,200
Tutu.
Actually, I think...

1578
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,160
...it's best if you and I switch.
Tutu.

1579
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,560
Tutu.
Okay.

1580
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,040
Let's switch then.
Tutu.

1581
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,600
Xinxin.
Would you mind if I sit here?

1582
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,920
Of course not.
Tutu.

1583
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,520
Xinxin.
Will you get angry and curse me in your heart?

1584
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,200
Xinxin.
You came for sure.

1585
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,080
Wherever Xiaoling is, you'll definitely come.
Xinxin.

1586
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:08,720
Tutu.
Actually...

1587
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,080
Xinxin.
We knew it had to be you.

1588
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,040
I'm telling you, you worked so hard yesterday.
Xinxin.

1589
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,120
Really.
Xinxin.

1590
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:13,640
Tutu.
No.

1591
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,120
Actually, if I had known this was the reward...
Tutu.

1592
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,320
I wouldn't have wanted to win.
Tutu.

1593
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,080
Terry.
I saw Huahua come over.

1594
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,960
I still feel happy inside.
Terry.

1595
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,600
Pangpang.

1596
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,880
Susu.
Are you coming with us?

1597
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,720
Huahua.
Yes.

1598
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:38,840
Huahua.
Surprised?

1599
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,720
Unexpected?
Huahua.

1600
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,720
Hua, sit in the middle.
Pangpang.

1601
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,480
Pangpang.
Hurry up.

1602
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,400
Huahua.
I'll sit in the middle.

1603
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,360
Tutu.
Sent a message.

1604
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,400
Did you see it?
Tutu.

1605
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,360
Yes, I saw it.
Harry.

1606
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,520
Tutu.
We need to learn the local Tianjin dialect.

1607
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,080
We've arrived in Tianjin.
Tutu.

1608
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,000
Tu Tu
haven't learned anything.

1609
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,960
that's two sentences done.
Tu Tu

1610
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,840
Ha Li
isn't this one sentence?

1611
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,240
Tai Rui
what is this?

1612
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,760
Pang Pang
what is this?

1613
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,240
isn't this it?
Tang Tang

1614
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,240
Hua Hua
what is this?

1615
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,080
Pang Pang
you said what is this?

1616
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,960
they might take you to ride the bus.
Pang Pang

1617
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,800
send you off.
Pang Pang

1618
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,120
Tu Tu
what do you think we'll do?

1619
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,520
I can't see it at all now.
Tu Tu

1620
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,080
Xiao Ling
what does the 'tease you' route mean?

1621
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:31,720
where to?
Xiao Ling

1622
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,160
Tu Tu
do you think they'll tease me?

1623
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,760
I'm actually already in Beijing now.
Tu Tu

1624
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,560
Xin Xin
could it be that kind?

1625
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,880
it's about solving problems.
Xin Xin

1626
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,560
Xin Xin
will it be that difficult?

1627
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,720
Xiao Ling
it shouldn't be too difficult, right?

1628
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,240
Xiao Ling
I feel it should be.

1629
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,040
things related to Tianjin's culture.
Xiao Ling

1630
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,280
Xin Xin
are you sleepy?

1631
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,720
Xiao Ling
I'm about to fall asleep.

1632
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,440
Xin Xin
okay.

1633
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,000
Ha Li
I'll apply for it.

1634
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,280
let's go alone.
Ha Li

1635
01:02:59,160 --> 01:02:59,680
it's okay.
Ha Li

1636
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,080
Hua Hua
to the cabin members,

1637
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,320
from this moment on,
Hua Hua

1638
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,400
Hua Hua
you can ask the cabin members you're interested in

1639
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,920
about age-related information.
Hua Hua

1640
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,080
Hua Hua
can't ask directly, right?

1641
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,160
Pang Pang
information, age.

1642
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,280
is there any other related information?
Pang Pang

1643
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,320
Pang Pang
what is your zodiac sign?

1644
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,400
Hua Hua
what is my zodiac sign?

1645
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,880
Su Su
what year did you become an adult?

1646
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,200
Tai Rui
I think I'm a horse.

1647
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,560
Hua Hua
horse.

1648
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,320
really.
Terry.

1649
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,160
Pangpang.
Do you believe it?

1650
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,040
Huahua.
I definitely don't believe it.

1651
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,120
He doesn't even look like it.
Huahua.

1652
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,360
Pangpang.
but he definitely looks younger than you.

1653
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,000
Huahua.
If he's younger than me, he gets off the car.

1654
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,240
Pangpang.
Why?

1655
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,280
Terry.
Let me tell you why.

1656
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,720
Because she doesn't like anyone younger than herself.
Terry.

1657
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:12,760
Pangpang.
Is that so?

1658
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,240
Terry.
Even if it's just a month or a day younger, it's not okay.

1659
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,840
You know me so well.
Huahua.

1660
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,400
Pangpang.
That's it, buddy.

1661
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,000
Sorry about that.
Pangpang.

1662
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,320
Pangpang.
Winning in this aspect.

1663
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,280
I didn't expect it either.
Pangpang.

1664
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,360
I didn't expect Pangpang to win in this aspect.
Pangpang.

1665
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,480
Pangpang.
So, just being a day younger than you.

1666
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,080
You can't accept it.
Pangpang.

1667
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:33,520
Huahua.
Yes.

1668
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,920
I've already talked to Brother Bo.
Huahua.

1669
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,200
Pangpang.
Did you guys talk?

1670
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,040
Did you guys understand each other?
Pangpang.

1671
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,800
Huahua.
No talking, not allowed to talk about age before.

1672
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,080
Pangpang.
Now we can talk.

1673
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,800
Not with so many people around.
Terry.

1674
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,160
Huahua.
Wait, I'll secretly ask you later.

1675
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,440
Terry.
Later you'll find out I'm actually a whole cycle older than you.

1676
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,360
Huahua.
That's great then.

1677
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,600
Let's just hold hands.
Huahua.

1678
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,960
Pangpang.
I must get Brother Bo.

1679
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,800
Force her age out.
Pangpang.

1680
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,040
Pangpang.
Otherwise.

1681
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,080
Tangtang.
I feel this is more fun than 'Jiesima'.

1682
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:06,800
A bit more fun.
Tangtang.

1683
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,160
Pangpang.
Yes.

1684
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,880
Pangpang, it's hard to win this track now if I don't win.

1685
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:13,680
Pangpang.
Not Brother Bo, you.

1686
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,480
Can you accept dating a girl older than you?
Pangpang.

1687
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,280
Pangpang.
Like, dating?

1688
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,000
Honestly.
Pangpang.

1689
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,080
Terry.
I've dated before.

1690
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,400
Pang Pang.
No.

1691
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,720
Let's not talk about the past.
Pang Pang.

1692
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,520
Terry.
A difference of about five years should be okay.

1693
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,280
Su Su.
A difference of five years either way is fine.

1694
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,520
Hua Hua.
Can you accept a five-year difference?

1695
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,280
Terry.
About five years difference is about right.

1696
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,240
Su Su.
I can accept someone five years older.

1697
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,760
But I can't accept someone five years younger.
Su Su.

1698
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:30,600
Terry.
I can.

1699
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,360
Hua Hua.
Guess about us?

1700
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,280
Pang Pang.
As for you,

1701
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,560
I have a pretty accurate prediction.
Pang Pang.

1702
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,640
Pang Pang.
From 1990 to 1995.

1703
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,240
Terry.
From 1990 to 1995.

1704
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,320
Hua Hua.
You get off the car.

1705
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,120
This range is a bit wide too.
Terry.

1706
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,680
Hua Hua.
Su Su, do you like someone older than you,

1707
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,640
or someone younger?
Hua Hua.

1708
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,040
Su Su.
Either way,

1709
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,480
Su Su.
A little difference is okay, but not too much.

1710
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,200
Hua Hua.
Tang Tang, do you like,

1711
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,200
someone a bit older than you,
Hua Hua.

1712
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,600
or a bit younger?
Hua Hua.

1713
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,480
Tang Tang.
I mainly look at which person I like.

1714
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,600
Su Su.
So fake.

1715
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,480
Tang Tang.
Are you going to say it or not?

1716
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,520
Tang Tang.
'Little Dragon Girl.'

1717
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,200
Tang Tang.
Why?

1718
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,240
Su Su.
I'm not, I'm not a dragon.

1719
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,040
Tang Tang.
Okay.

1720
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,360
Alright.
Tang Tang.

1721
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,680
My sister was born in 2000.
Harry.

1722
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,400
Harry.
How old are you?

1723
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,680
Harry.
Don't sleep, how old are you?

1724
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,480
It's okay, go to sleep, you sleep.
Harry.

1725
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,960
Tu Tu.
What year were you born?

1726
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,040
Harry.
This year, I'm twenty.

1727
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,720
Xin Xin.
But I really want to know, Tu Tu.

1728
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,680
Who's older, you or Xiao Ling?
Xin Xin.

1729
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,640
I think Xiao Ling should be older than me.
Tu Tu.

1730
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,640
Xiao Ling.
I should be older.

1731
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,280
I was born in 2004.
Tu Tu.

1732
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,560
Tutu.
What about you?

1733
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,080
Xiaoling.
You know, right?

1734
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,160
You should be able to guess, right?
Xiaoling.

1735
01:06:59,160 --> 01:06:59,760
She was born in 2002.
Harry.

1736
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:00,960
Xiaoling.
How do you know?

1737
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,000
Xiaoling.
Actually, I've always guessed.

1738
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,440
Tutu is younger than me.
Xiaoling.

1739
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,000
Xiaoling.
but when I actually heard him say

1740
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,680
that he was born in 2004,
Xiaoling.

1741
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,480
Xiaoling.
my heart still skipped a beat.

1742
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,000
I would say, 'No,'
Xiaoling.

1743
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,400
Xiaoling.
I would have that feeling.

1744
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,720
Tutu.
Xiaoling was born in 2002.

1745
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,360
And I was born in 2004.
Tutu.

1746
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,760
Tutu.
Because I heard Xiaoling say

1747
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,880
that she had never interacted with someone younger.
Tutu.

1748
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,440
Tutu.
So at that time, I still felt

1749
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,960
a bit of a gap.
Tutu.

1750
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,520
Then Tangtang was also born in 2004?
Xinxin.

1751
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,440
Tangtang is a little younger than me.
Xiaoling.

1752
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,960
Tangtang should be born in 2003.
Tutu.

1753
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,800
Tangtang was born in 2003.
Harry.

1754
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,560
Right, so you were born in 2002?
Tutu.

1755
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,360
Harry.
What about you?

1756
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,120
Xinxin.
I was born in 1996.

1757
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,520
Really?
Harry.

1758
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,880
I can't tell at all.
Tutu.

1759
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,560
Xiaoling.
Sister,

1760
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:48,960
Harry.
28 years old.

1761
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:49,400
Xinxin.
Yes.

1762
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,120
What about Pangpang?
Harry.

1763
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,160
Xinxin.
30 years old.

1764
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,880
Xiaoling.
You said it very straightforwardly.

1765
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,320
Xinxin.
Yes.

1766
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,000
It's not even asking for information anymore.
Xiaoling.

1767
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,200
What about Tata?
Tutu.

1768
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,800
Tata.
2001.

1769
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,600
Tutu.
2001 is actually about what I expected.

1770
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,880
I'm curious how old Terry is.
Tutu.

1771
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,360
Terry was born in 1997.
Harry.

1772
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,080
Tutu.
27 years old.

1773
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,320
Then your guess is quite close.
Xiaoling.

1774
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:08,920
Right?
Tutu.

1775
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,040
Tata.
How old did you guess?

1776
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,080
I guessed 28 years old.
Tutu.

1777
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,440
Xinxin.
I also guessed around 27 or 28.

1778
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,640
Tutu.
Yes, that's about right.

1779
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,920
Then who else was in that car?
Tutu.

1780
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,600
What about Huahua?
Xiaoling.

1781
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,359
Tutu.
Guess Huahua's age.

1782
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,319
Xinxin.
Born in 1998, I guess?

1783
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,040
Xiaoling.
1997.

1784
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:19,920
She's also born in 1997.
Tutu.

1785
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,240
Xinxin.
She's about right for 1997.

1786
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,880
What place is this?
Susu.

1787
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,840
Terry.
A park.

1788
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,600
Susu.
Is there really that kind of thing up there?

1789
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,560
What's that thing pasted up there?
Susu.

1790
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:38,279
Let's go take a look.
Susu.

1791
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,240
Huahua.
I'll take you to the park corner.

1792
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,800
Pangpang.
Put my photo up there.

1793
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,640
Terry.
Sure.

1794
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:49,760
Huahua.
Where is it? The matchmaking corner?

1795
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,800
Terry.
You really want to go?

1796
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,720
Let's see if there are any quality men.
Terry.

1797
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,319
It really is a matchmaking corner.
Tangtang.

1798
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,000
Susu.
182 cm, born in 1981.

1799
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,880
Tangtang.
Quick, Brother Bo.

1800
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,080
Terry.
I'm 182 cm tall.

1801
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:00,840
Come here, young man.

1802
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,120
Register here. Come on, 100 yuan.

1803
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:03,880
Huahua.
Register.

1804
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,880
Let's go.
Huahua.

1805
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,040
Why are they all so handsome?

1806
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:10,399
Thank you.
Susu.

1807
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:11,160
Why are you so handsome?

1808
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:11,560
So handsome.
Susu.

1809
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:12,359
This one too.

1810
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:14,040
Why are you all so handsome?

1811
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,040
Hey, young man, how tall are you?

1812
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,319
Terry.
About the same height as us.

1813
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,359
All so handsome.

1814
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:19,439
Pangpang.
No.

1815
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,359
Have you taken a liking to someone?
Terry.

1816
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,399
Tangtang.
Which one do you like?

1817
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,240
Which one?
Tangtang.

1818
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:29,960
Susu
1983

1819
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:31,479
Susu
The guy

1820
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:32,960
This one is quite impressive, to be honest.
Tangtang

1821
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,359
Susu
I know him.

1822
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,520
Above 1.59 meters is acceptable.
Susu

1823
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,880
Susu
I'm above 1.59 meters.

1824
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,200
Tangtang
Go away, you're not qualified.

1825
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,160
1.9 meters.

1826
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,359
Tangtang
Almost, maybe not quite.

1827
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:51,160
The young man is so handsome.

1828
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,560
He's handsome enough.

1829
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,120
He has a bit of a Fei Xiang vibe.

1830
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,680
This young man looks like a perfect match at first glance.

1831
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,480
So handsome.

1832
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,280
so handsome.

1833
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,040
How can you be so good-looking?

1834
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:01,440
How beautiful.

1835
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,400
Absolutely a beauty.

1836
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,440
The young man is really so handsome.

1837
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,160
A beautiful sight to behold.

1838
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,240
Thank you, uncle.
Tangtang

1839
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,680
Handsome guys look for beautiful girls, beautiful girls look for handsome guys.

1840
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,560
Tangtang
A bit shy.

1841
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,200
That young man at first glance
Susu

1842
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,560
Susu
No, this young man

1843
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,560
Huahua
Learn some Tianjin dialect.

1844
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,520
Terry
Tianjin dialect

1845
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,040
These two look quite familiar to me.
Huahua

1846
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,840
Terry
Sister or auntie?

1847
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:20,760
Huahua
Sister.

1848
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,800
Sister, can you teach us a few phrases in Tianjin dialect?
Huahua

1849
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,640
Terry
Are you from Tianjin?

1850
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,120
Are you a local?
Terry

1851
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,400
Terry
Okay.

1852
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,720
Then can you speak Tianjin dialect?
Terry

1853
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,040
Terry
Alright.

1854
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:29,600
Huahua
Thank you.

1855
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,240
Sorry to bother you.
Huahua

1856
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,360
It's okay.

1857
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,080
Huahua
Grandpa, can you speak Tianjin dialect?

1858
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,000
Can speak Tianjin dialect.

1859
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,520
Then can you teach us a few phrases?
Huahua

1860
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:37,680
Do you want to learn?

1861
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,560
Want to learn.
Together

1862
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,880
Have you eaten?

1863
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,080
Where are you going?

1864
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,480
Susu
Can you remember this tone?

1865
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,400
Tangtang
Have you eaten?

1866
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,720
Where are you going?
Tangtang

1867
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,640
Pangpang
I want to learn how to say when I see a girl I like.

1868
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,760
How do you say 'I like you'?
Pangpang

1869
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,600
I really like you.

1870
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,400
Pang Pang
I really like you.

1871
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,840
Tang Tang
I've already learned it.

1872
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,200
Su Su
What?

1873
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,600
Then tell me.
Pang Pang

1874
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,680
Tang Tang
You look like Wang Jiaer.

1875
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,720
I've already learned it.
Tang Tang

1876
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,720
Su Su
You sound like a foreigner.

1877
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,840
Pang Pang
You are a foreigner.

1878
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,360
Hua Hua
How do you say 'I miss you'?

1879
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,800
Pang Pang
You've made the old man shy.

1880
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,360
Pang Pang
Old man

1881
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,560
Terry
The old man hasn't said such things for a long time.

1882
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,840
Hua Hua
How do you say 'I miss you'?

1883
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,920
I really miss you.

1884
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,120
Hua Hua
How do you say 'It's cold, wear more clothes'?

1885
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:20,640
Old man, I still want to learn.
Hua Hua

1886
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,560
It's getting cold, wear more clothes.

1887
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,200
Terry
I've learned it all from you.

1888
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:26,920
Hua Hua
Wear more clothes.

1889
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,320
Are you two a couple?

1890
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:32,680
Pang Pang
Yes.

1891
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,280
Hua Hua
No.

1892
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:34,840
You look like it.

1893
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,000
Hua Hua
Terry, you're not even trying.

1894
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,840
Terry
I'm taking notes.

1895
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,920
There's a saying about appearances, okay?
Pang Pang

1896
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,680
Hua Hua
He's already focused on his language.

1897
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,320
Terry
Don't.

1898
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,280
Hua Hua
You don't care about my 'life or death' anymore.

1899
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,040
Terry
No.

1900
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,000
Hua Hua
No, just kidding.

1901
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,160
Pang Pang
Old man, she doesn't fancy me.

1902
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,160
She thinks I'm not enough.
Pang Pang

1903
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,200
Pang Pang
Old man, let's take another look.

1904
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,480
Hua Hua
Thank you, old man.

1905
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:53,960
Bye-bye.
Hua Hua

1906
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,160
Pang Pang
I really like you.

1907
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,080
Hua Hua
It's getting cold, wear more clothes.

1908
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,400
Huahua.
Brother Bo.

1909
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,600
How old are you?
Huahua.

1910
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,440
Huahua.
Let's write down your information.

1911
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,280
Terry.
Okay.

1912
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,520
Height?
Huahua.

1913
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,440
Terry.
One meter and eighty-eight centimeters.

1914
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,120
height?
Huahua.

1915
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:07,680
Pangpang.
One meter and eighty-five centimeters.

1916
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,280
Huahua.
Weight?

1917
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,920
Pangpang.
There's no need for weight.

1918
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:11,440
Huahua.
Weight?

1919
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,200
Pangpang.
Are you being polite?

1920
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,720
You say that with your girlfriend here?

1921
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,480
Terry.
She's not my girlfriend.

1922
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,760
This is my girlfriend.
Pangpang.

1923
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:19,920
Terry.

1924
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,640
Huahua.
Alright, goodbye then.

1925
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,200
Tangtang.
Uncle, can you teach me some Tianjin dialect?

1926
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,160
We're already speaking Tianjin dialect.

1927
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,480
Susu.
How do you say 'Goubuli Baozi'?

1928
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,400
Goubuli Baozi.

1929
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,320
Susu.
Dog.

1930
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:39,320
Goubuli Baozi.

1931
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,280
How beautiful.

1932
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,640
Are you from Tianjin?

1933
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,480
Tangtang.
She's from Beijing.

1934
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,640
In Beijing, they call girls 'xiaonio', right?

1935
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,240
Susu.
Xiaonio.

1936
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,480
Tangtang.
I've learned it too.

1937
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,560
Susu.
Xiaonio.

1938
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,200
Thank you.
Susu.

1939
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:53,760
Thank you, uncle and auntie.
Tangtang.

1940
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,840
Thank you.
Susu.

1941
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,160
Tangtang.
Okay.

1942
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,000
Thank you, uncle and auntie.
Tangtang.

1943
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,680
Susu.
I'm embarrassed.

1944
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:01,960
I'm feeling a bit socially anxious.
Susu.

1945
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,480
Tangtang.
Let's go upstairs.

1946
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:08,800
Susu.
My legs are weak.

1947
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,200
Susu.
Stand back a bit.

1948
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,680
You won't fall from this height, right?
Tangtang.

1949
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,800
Susu.
No, I have severe acrophobia.

1950
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:16,720
Then how about those few?
Tangtang.

1951
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,360
Su Su
They ended up secretly learning it.

1952
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,920
Tang Tang
I feel like we've learned quite a bit too.

1953
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:24,680
Su Su
Goubuli baozi

1954
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:25,760
Tang Tang
Hello.

1955
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,200
Tang Tang
What's this?

1956
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:30,920
What else?
Su Su

1957
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,920
Tang Tang
This guy is really...

1958
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,320
awesome.
Tang Tang

1959
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,080
Tang Tang
Are you 1.9 meters tall?

1960
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,960
Tang Tang
Five sentences.

1961
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,160
Already five sentences.
Tang Tang

1962
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,800
Tang Tang
Are you 1.9 meters tall?

1963
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,400
Alright, we've learned enough.
Tang Tang

1964
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,240
Let's go, let's head down.
Tang Tang

1965
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,080
Tang Tang
Are you still cold now?

1966
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:02,560
Su Su
Not cold.

1967
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,760
It's not cold once there's sunlight.
Su Su

1968
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,760
Where did they go?

1969
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,320
Hua Hua
Tell me secretly.

1970
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,640
Pang Pang
1994.

1971
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,440
Hua Hua
Which year in the 90s were you born?

1972
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,520
Terry
1997.

1973
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,400
Pang Pang
She's 1996.

1974
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,040
Really?
Terry

1975
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,920
Really 1996?
Terry

1976
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,040
Hua Hua
I'm 1996, what are you talking about?

1977
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:22,560
Terry
No.

1978
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,800
Tell me, which year in the 90s were you born?
Terry

1979
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,600
Terry
I don't know anymore.

1980
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,200
Hua Hua
I'm 1997.

1981
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,000
Pang Pang
You're 1997?

1982
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,320
Pang Pang
Later months?

1983
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,440
Terry
You're 1997, I must be the oldest.

1984
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,920
Terry
I'm already January 9th.

1985
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,200
I'm still January...
Terry

1986
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,720
Hua Hua
Just a few months older than me.

1987
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,320
Pang Pang
Right.

1988
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,400
Hua Hua
I understand now.

1989
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,280
Terry is five months older than me.
Hua Hua

1990
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,160
Hua Hua
So for some future developments, it might...

1991
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,520
not have much impact.
Hua Hua

1992
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,760
Terry
Huahua mentioned before

1993
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,360
that she doesn't like those younger than her,
Terry

1994
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,280
Terry
but today when we talked about age, she's younger than me.

1995
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,680
And I was quite happy
Terry

1996
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,400
Terry
to hear that.

1997
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,440
Pangpang
How do you say it? Have you finished learning?

1998
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,120
Susu
Who's this?

1999
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,160
Huahua
What's this?

2000
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:02,840
Who is it?
Susu

2001
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,520
Tangtang
Are you 1.9 meters tall?

2002
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,880
Pangpang
Why does that sentence sound

2003
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,120
Terry
like a foreigner?

2004
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,040
Pangpang
Are you 1.9 meters tall?

2005
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:09,680
I can do it too.
Pangpang

2006
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,640
Tangtang
No, you can't. Your pronunciation isn't standard.

2007
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,400
Susu
Handsome guy

2008
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:15,840
Handsome,
Susu
Handsome guy

2009
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,280
Susu
so handsome.

2010
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,240
You're all so handsome.

2011
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,760
Tangtang

2012
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,080
Terry
Are you happy?

2013
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,720
Huahua
Yes, happy.

2014
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,040
Let's take a stroll.
Terry

2015
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,000
Didn't we pass by that square yesterday?
Tangtang

2016
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Is this the place from yesterday?
Pangpang

2017
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:45,800
Tangtang
Is it cold?

2018
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,560
Why don't we walk in the sunlight?
Tangtang

2019
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,440
Terry
I think we should walk in the light too.

2020
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,720
Tangtang
Let's go, let's walk inside.

2021
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,640
Pangpang
Where are you going so fast?

2022
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,360
Tangtang
She's cold.

2023
01:15:59,360 --> 01:15:59,960
Who's cold?
Pangpang

2024
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,400
Beautiful lady
Tangtang

2025
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,400
Susu
Is it pretty?

2026
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,960
Tangtang
But why hasn't it started recording?

2027
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:13,480
It has started recording.
Tangtang

2028
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:15,960
Tangtang
Where are we?

2029
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,400
Susu
At Minyuan Square.

2030
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,600
Tangtang
I just found out.

2031
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,640
Susu
Minyuan Square.

2032
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,200
Okay.
Tangtang

2033
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,560
Susu
Take a look, turn around.

2034
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,320
Tangtang
Why are you turning with us two?

2035
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:29,960
Tang Tang
Alright, let's leave it at that for now.

2036
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,840
Su Su
You hold on, do you have another transition?

2037
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,920
Tang Tang
I don't know what to say.

2038
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,480
Su Su
when recording videos, it's always just the two of us.

2039
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,280
Su Su
like this.

2040
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,200
quite like a couple.
Su Su

2041
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,880
Su Su
I will also keep recording.

2042
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,520
Su Su
the focus is on me.

2043
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,240
Tang Tang
no, this face is too big.

2044
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,600
Su Su
no, my face is wider than yours.

2045
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,280
Tang Tang
no.

2046
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,280
pull your hair back.
Tang Tang

2047
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,360
Su Su
no.

2048
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,160
give me a smile.
Tang Tang

2049
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,320
Pang Pang
don't steal someone else's ball.

2050
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,640
Terry
are you cold?

2051
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,520
not really.
Hua Hua

2052
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:28,760
let me take a picture of you.
Terry

2053
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,640
Hua Hua
will it turn out well?

2054
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,520
Terry
it will.

2055
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,840
Hua Hua
will it be beautiful?

2056
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,520
Terry
it's a bit hard to see.

2057
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,840
Hua Hua
yes, because yours might be reflecting light.

2058
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,360
okay.
Hua Hua

2059
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:50,840
sunshine.
Terry

2060
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,440
Hua Hua
I believe in you.

2061
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,320
Pang Pang
let's go over there.

2062
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,360
Pang Pang
let's buy a ball.

2063
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,440
let's go.
Tang Tang

2064
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,440
Su Su
the child is starting to cry too.

2065
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,160
Tang Tang
why isn't Pang Pang joining the 'war'?

2066
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,280
let's forget it.
Pang Pang

2067
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,200
Terry
it's a bit hard to see.

2068
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,200
the sunlight is too bright.
Terry

2069
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:13,880
Hua Hua
I trust you.

2070
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,600
Hua Hua
looks good.

2071
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,160
Hua Hua
beautiful.

2072
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,400
can't see clearly.
Terry

2073
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,120
Hua Hua
beautiful.

2074
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,280
Huahua.
Bo Ge.

2075
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,520
Terry.
Okay.

2076
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,640
Huahua.
You're really something.

2077
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,800
Terry.
Like a puppy.

2078
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,840
Huahua.
Happy puppy.

2079
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,200
Hello, that...
Huahua.

2080
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,040
Huahua.
So speechless.

2081
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,560
Huahua.
Let's take a video.

2082
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,080
Terry.
The lighting is pretty good.

2083
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,560
Huahua.
We need frontal lighting to look beautiful.

2084
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,600
Terry.
Right, frontal lighting.

2085
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:01,720
Then you can take a photo for me.
Pangpang.

2086
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,280
Pangpang.
take a photo for me.

2087
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,560
Pangpang.
Use my phone to take it.

2088
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,040
Huahua.
Let Terry take it.

2089
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,640
Pangpang.
Bo Ge, teach me the pose.

2090
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,840
How should I pose with the ball?
Pangpang.

2091
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,360
Terry.
hold up the ball.

2092
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,800
Can this float?
Pangpang.

2093
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,800
Terry.
It will float.

2094
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:24,960
Terry.
It's possible.

2095
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:25,880
Not bad.
Pangpang.

2096
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,320
Huahua.
Come on, I'll take one for you.

2097
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,000
Huahua.
Do you know about a model's professional quality?

2098
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,760
Huahua.
Looks good.

2099
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,520
Huahua.
Terry, you'll thank me later.

2100
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,320
Huahua.
Looks good.

2101
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,600
Tangtang.
Let's go.

2102
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,000
There's a horse carriage over there, let's take a ride.
Tangtang.

2103
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:51,400
Terry.
Okay.

2104
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,240
Let's go.
Susu.

2105
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,120
Pangpang.
I'll sit with Bo Ge.

2106
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,320
Huahua.
They got on first at that time.

2107
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,000
They sat in the back.
Huahua.

2108
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:23,640
Huahua.
but I thought to myself,

2109
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,000
Huahua.
if I get on now,

2110
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:25,800
wouldn't I be
Huahua.

2111
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,000
Huahua.
squeezed between the two of them?

2112
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
It would be quite awkward.
Huahua.

2113
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:29,720
Huahua.
So I just

2114
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:30,840
sat alone in the corner.
Huahua.

2115
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,000
Susu.
It's too cold.

2116
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,280
Pangpang.
Tang Tang, can you take off more?

2117
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:44,960
Tang Tang.
What?

2118
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,760
Pangpang.
can you take off more?

2119
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,640
Tang Tang.
Don't I have an undershirt?

2120
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,560
Terry.
He wants to give it to Susu to wear.

2121
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,160
Tang Tang.
No, she...

2122
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,600
Her skirt is short. I feel she's too cold.
Tang Tang.

2123
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,600
Pangpang.
Okay.

2124
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,080
Thank you.
Susu.

2125
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,440
Now we're riding a horse-drawn carriage on Wudadao.
Tang Tang.

2126
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,520
Terry.
We're all squeezed together.

2127
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,800
Snuggle snuggle.
Terry.

2128
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:19,840
Susu.
We're...

2129
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,240
Huahua.
Yes, we're three third wheels.

2130
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,320
Third wheel.
Tang Tang.

2131
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:25,960
Tang Tang.
Okay.

2132
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,600
Susu.
Hello.

2133
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:48,880
Tang Tang.
Hello.

2134
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,400
This is even a cultural relic.
Susu.

2135
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,000
Look.
Tang Tang.

2136
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:55,200
Tang Tang.
Sudden wealth.

2137
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,240
Susu.
Fortune comes.

2138
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:16,960
Tang Tang.
That's nice.

2139
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,000
Finally able to...
Tang Tang.

2140
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,600
Tang Tang.
In this fast-paced world...

2141
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,960
take a rest.
Tang Tang.

2142
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,960
Tang Tang.
to have a place like this to stop.

2143
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,320
Pangpang.
Let's go watch a crosstalk show.

2144
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,080
Huahua.
Really?

2145
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:49,840
Susu.
Is it true?

2146
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,320
Terry.
Let's go, let's go!

2147
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,200
Xiaoling.
Tianjin Ancient Culture Street.

2148
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,320
Come and take a look.
Xiaoling.

2149
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,680
Xiaoling.
So many people.

2150
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,480
so many people today.
Tutu.

2151
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,240
Xinxin.
It's so lively.

2152
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,240
Harry.
We can buy something as a souvenir.

2153
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:06,760
Tutu.
What's there?

2154
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,360
Let's take a look.
Tutu.

2155
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,120
Xinxin.
There are so many people queuing.

2156
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,400
Is it delicious?
Xinxin.

2157
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,560
There's also shadow puppetry.
Tutu.

2158
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,720
Arrived in Tianjin.
Tutu.

2159
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,760
Xiaoling.
Didn't learn anything.

2160
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,880
Xiaoling.
Osmanthus cake.

2161
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,360
Auntie, one osmanthus cake, please.
Xiaoling.

2162
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,680
Xiaoling.
It's so sticky.

2163
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:30,440
Take a photo.
Tata.

2164
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,440
Delicious.
Tata.

2165
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,960
Not bad.
Tata.

2166
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,400
Tata.
Didn't you want to eat jianbing guozi?

2167
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,120
Let's get one.
Harry.

2168
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:49,240
Do you want green onions and spicy sauce?

2169
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:49,840
Harry.

2170
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,880
How do you say jianbing guozi in Tianjin dialect?
Tata.

2171
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:52,880
Jianbing guozi.

2172
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,200
One set of jianbing guozi, please.

2173
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,240
Did you learn it?
Tata.

2174
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,240
Jianbing guozi.
Xiaoling.

2175
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,840
Old Tianjin jianbing guozi.
Harry.

2176
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,920
The handsome guy is super handsome.

2177
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,360
The two beautiful ladies are super pretty.

2178
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,000

Xiaoling.
So handsome.

2181
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,480
I've learned it.
Xiaoling.

2182
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,280
We've learned about jianbing guozi.
Tata.

2183
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:15,960
Fried crispy meat.
Tutu.

2184
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,840
Xiaoling.
I'm going to buy some fried crispy meat.

2185
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:19,720
This way.
Tutu.

2186
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,720
We'll have one of each.
Tutu.

2187
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,960

2190
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,520
Tata.
What's wrong?

2191
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,320
I bit myself.
Tata.

2192
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,200
Xiaoling.
What happened?

2193
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,600
Xinxin.
He's faking it.

2194
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,600
Tutu.
He bit his mouth.

2195
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,320
Xinxin.
He wants to get your attention every day.

2196
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,200
He wants comfort from Mizi.
Tata.

2197
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,160
Xinxin.
Right.

2198
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,280
He wants Mizi every day.

Tutu,
all allow you to feel

2368
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,310
that it's very meaningful.
Tutu,

2369
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,760
Xinxin,
Can you invite that God of Wealth to my home?

2370
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,800
I really need it.
Xinxin,

2371
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,360
I need it too.
Tutu,

2372
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,160
Tata,
Go back and change it to wallpaper.

2373
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:15,840
Xinxin,
Okay.

2374
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,630
I've already changed it.
Xinxin,

2375
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:18,520
Xinxin,
Right.

2376
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,280
Tata,
So proactive.

2377
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,080
The God of Wealth will surely see your sincerity.
Tata,

2378
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,960
Xinxin,

2379
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,120
Fragrant sachets.

2380
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:25,600
Take a look.

2381
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,640
go in and take a look.
Tutu,

2382
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:27,360
take a look.
Tata,

2383
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,240
Is it fragrant?
Tutu,

2384
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,000
Salesperson,
Smell it.

2385
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,200
Fragrant body cream.
Salesperson,

2386
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:32,920
Salesperson,
Apply this here.

2387
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,270
It stays fragrant for twelve hours.
Salesperson,

2388
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:35,440
Thank you.
Xiaoling,

2389
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,470
Xiaoling,
It's quite fragrant.

2390
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:40,190
Xiaoling,
smell this one of mine.

2391
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,840
Tutu,
What's this new method?

2392
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:46,360
I don't know.
Tutu,

2393
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:46,910
Xiaoling,
You don't know?

2394
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,320
It's like this, and then you hit someone.
Xiaoling,

2395
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,790
I was poked for the first time.
Tutu,

2396
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:50,680
Xiaoling,
Smell it.

2397
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,200
Xinxin,
It's toxic.

2398
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,920
I'm really impressed.
Xinxin,

2399
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,470
Xinxin,
I thought you were going to tell me something.

2400
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,430
Xinxin,
Let's go.

2401
01:30:58,430 --> 01:30:59,040
let's go.
Hali,

2402
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,640
I miss you a lot in Tianjin.
Tutu,

2403
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:03,440
Tata,
How about a roasted pear?

2404
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,440
small pear soup.
Tata,

2405
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:04,960
Xinxin,
I want to drink it.

2406
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,000
learn this sentence.
Tata,

2407
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,160
How do you say this in Tianjin dialect?
Xiaoling,

2408
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,710
I miss you a lot in Tianjin.
Hali,

2409
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,200
Really?
Tata,

2410
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,070
Tutu,
I miss you a lot in Tianjin.

2411
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:16,350
miss you a lot.
Tutu,

2412
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:18,080
Xiaoling,
I miss you a lot in Tianjin.

2413
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,030
Tata,
What's wrong with the scarf?

2414
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:23,600
Tutu.

2415
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:25,920
Tata.
What's wrong with the scarf?

2416
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:26,680
Harry.
I don't know.

2417
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:27,920
it's a bit tight around my neck.
Harry.

2418
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:33,920
Tata.
Is it choking you?

2419
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:34,640
Harry.
Yes.

2420
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:35,320
a little bit.
Harry.

2421
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,640
Xiaoling.
Let's go.

2422
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:37,920
Let's take a look over there.
Xiaoling.

2423
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,960
How thoughtful.
Tutu.

2424
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:51,550
Xiaoling.
Yes.

2425
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:53,720
Tutu.
The 2002 sister is so considerate.

2426
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,280
I'm really impressed.
Xinxin.

2427
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,560
Xiaoling.
Don't talk to kids born in 2004.

2428
01:31:59,040 --> 01:31:59,800
This way.
Tutu.

2429
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,440
Let's take a look over here.
Tutu.

2430
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,430
This one.
Harry.

2431
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:05,520
Tata.
Sandalwood.

2432
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,520
I want sandalwood.
Tata.

2433
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,320
Sandalwood.
Harry.

2434
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,080
Tata.
Is it the kind that, after smelling it,

2435
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,430
makes you feel calm and peaceful?
Tata.

2436
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:11,920
Then I need this kind of calmness.
Harry.

2437
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,040
I need it too.
Tata.

2438
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,520
Tata.
It smells so good.

2439
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,350
Okay.
Tata.

2440
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,080
Harry.

2441
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:21,790
Tata.
Alright.

2442
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:25,520
Harry.
Which one do you want?

2443
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,720
This reminds me of when I was in school.
Tata.

2444
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:32,920
Tata.
Do you have rhinitis?

2445
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:33,240
I do.
Harry.

2446
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,070
Tata.
Is this good for relieving rhinitis?

2447
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:35,760
That's hilarious.
Tata.

2448
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,520
It's making my rhinitis act up a bit.
Harry.

2449
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,240
Tata.
How do we do this?

2450
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,760
Sis, let's get two.
Tata.

2451
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,400
Salesperson.
You choose first.

2452
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,630
Which medicine pack do you want?
Salesperson.

2453
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:44,120
We choose from here, right?
Tata.

2454
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,240
What color do you want?
Harry.

2455
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:47,600
Tata.
It's going to be green, right?

2456
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:48,080
Green is good.
Tata.

2457
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,150
Then I'll take this.
Harry.

2458
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:49,310
Clerk,
Okay.

2459
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:50,480
Which one do you want, beautiful?
Clerk,

2460
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,710
Tata.
You just let me smell that sandalwood.

2461
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:52,920
Sandalwood is fine.
Harry.

2462
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:54,520
I want this too.
Harry.

2463
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,400
Xiaoling,
If you had to choose,

2464
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,720
What color are you interested in?
Xiaoling,

2465
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:59,160
Xinxin,
Actually, I really want to see you

2466
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:00,670
with a heavier makeup look.
Xinxin,

2467
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:01,880
on the last day, I'll do a heavy makeup for you.
Xiaoling,

2468
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:02,360
Xinxin,
Yes.

2469
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:02,880
Good.
Xinxin,

2470
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,510
Xinxin,
It's that kind of red lips.

2471
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:05,560
Okay, let's do one.
Xiaoling,

2472
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:05,880
Xinxin,
Good.

2473
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,360
Tutu,
That kind of 'scary' feeling.

2474
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,400
Xiaoling,
Scary.

2475
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,240
Tutu,
just like that stepmother.

2476
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,320
That 'Stepmother Tea Party'.
Tutu,

2477
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,120
Xiaoling,
I don't want to talk to you.

2478
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,000
Xinxin,
He doesn't understand.

2479
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,160
because he just can't reach that high.
Xinxin,

2480
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,310
Xinxin,
He's more afraid.

2481
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,960
Tutu,
So scary.

2482
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,040
Xinxin,
Tutu,

2483
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,120
Xinxin, can I buy you a suit?

2484
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:23,960
Tutu,
Okay.

2485
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,360
I'll pad it with a ten-centimeter one.
Tutu,

2486
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,560
Xinxin,
I'll buy you height-increasing insoles.

2487
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,160
Okay.
Tutu,

2488
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:27,800
Xinxin,
Can I?

2489
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,400
Okay.
Tutu,

2490
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,960
Tutu,
How are they doing?

2491
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:34,880
Tutu,
They're making that sachet.

2492
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:35,840
Take a look.
Tutu,

2493
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,360
Tutu,
Don't disturb their peaceful time.

2494
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,360
We'll come back later.
Tutu,

2495
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:40,510
Xinxin,
Yes.

2496
01:33:40,510 --> 01:33:42,360
Let's go find our own fun.
Xinxin,

2497
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:42,590
Is that okay?
Xinxin,

2498
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:44,320
Xiaoling,
Let's find something fun ourselves.

2499
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:47,520
Tom's Family Story.
Xinxin,

2500
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,160
Official authorization.
Xinxin.

2501
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,800
Tutu.
He is present in every aspect of your life.

2502
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,630
Xiaoling.
Tutu.

2503
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:55,760
Tom is everywhere.
Xinxin.

2504
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,520
Do you love him, Xiaoling?
Tutu.

2505
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,430
Xiaoling.
I love him so much.

2506
01:33:58,430 --> 01:33:59,280
Tutu.
You haven't seen Tom for so long.

2507
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,000
Do you miss him?
Tutu.

2508
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,150
Xiaoling.
I don't miss him at all.

2509
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:02,080
Tutu.
Do you love him?

2510
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,840
Love him to pieces.
Xinxin.

2511
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,030
Freshly steamed buns.

2512
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:09,310
Hot 'Tang Tang'.
Xinxin.

2513
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:11,960
Xiaoling.
You love it so much.

2514
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,400
Then they will say,
Xinxin.

2515
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,430
Crazy in love.
Tutu.

2516
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:15,120
Xinxin.
Oh no, this girl loves him so much.

2517
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,310
Crazy in love.
Xiaoling.

2518
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:18,320
Let's eat a little.
Tutu.

2519
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:19,120
Tutu.
Buy a basket.

2520
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:19,800
Xiaoling.

2521
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:21,080
They're all meat buns, right?
Tutu.

2522
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,240
Goubuli buns.
Shop assistant.

2523
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:23,640
Then let's have a basket.
Tutu.

2524
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,510
Have a basket.
Shop assistant.

2525
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:26,560
Tianjin Goubuli buns.
Tutu.

2526
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:32,280
Tianjin Goubuli buns.
Tutu.

2527
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:33,440
Xinxin.
Tutu, are you happy?

2528
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,750
The two of us are sitting around you.
Xinxin.

2529
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:35,360
So happy.
Tutu.

2530
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:35,960
Xinxin.
Always fighting over you.

2531
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,200
Tutu.
Aren't you eating?

2532
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,430
Xiaoling.
I am eating.

2533
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,510
Xinxin.
Today Xiaoling is getting a little closer to you.

2534
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:41,880
I will squeeze between the two of you.
Xinxin.

2535
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:42,430
Okay.
Tutu.

2536
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,760
Just a little closer.
Tutu.

2537
01:34:45,470 --> 01:34:47,520
Tutu.
They can take so long to make a sachet.

2538
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,790
Surely they want to make it as long as possible.
Xiaoling.

2539
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:52,640
Xinxin.
They want to exchange sachets.

2540
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:55,840
Xiaoling.
Token of love.

2541
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:58,000
Does it have a scent already?
Tata.

2542
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,230
Is there a scent?
Harry.

2543
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,430
Harry.
I smell perfume.

2544
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,360
I can smell your perfume.
Harry.

2545
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,440
I didn't spray any.
Tata.

2546
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,040
Take care.
Salesperson.

2547
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:05,440
Thank you.
Tata.

2548
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:06,000
Thank you.
Harry.

2549
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,520
Thank you.
Tata.

2550
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,240
Can we make this ourselves?
Tata.

2551
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,360
Definitely.
Harry.

2552
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,800
Whose fingers are this big?
Tata.

2553
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:13,680
Mine.
Harry.

2554
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:15,000
Tata.
Really?

2555
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,600
Look how big it is yourself.
Tata.

2556
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,600
It's scary.
Tata.

2557
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:21,720
Is this garlic?
Tata.

2558
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,000
Yes.
Harry.

2559
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:22,430
Tata.
It's so cute.

2560
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:23,040
Let me buy it for you.
Tata.

2561
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,280
Harry.
You're buying it for me?

2562
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:26,200
Never mind, forget it.
Harry.

2563
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:26,680
Tata.
It's so cute.

2564
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,520
A turtle would be nice too.
Tata.

2565
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,670
Harry.
I'll give it to you.

2566
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:29,400
I'll give you a turtle.
Harry.

2567
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,480
Harry.
You give me the garlic.

2568
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,160
I'll buy you a turtle.
Tata.

2569
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:32,990
Then I'll buy the garlic.
Harry.

2570
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:33,760

01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:34,880
Let's go.
Harry.

2572
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,600
Tata.
Where's Tutu?

2573
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,840
Where are Tutu and the others?
Tata.

2574
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,030
Tata.
They're over there.

2575
01:35:40,030 --> 01:35:40,600
Let's go find them.
Tata.

2576
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:41,600
Harry.
They're eating.

2577
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,960
Come quickly.
Tutu.

2578
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,280
Xiaoling.
So you two finally decided to come back.

2579
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,320
We were looking for you.
Tata.

2580
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,070
Let's go.
Tutu.

2581
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,630
Tutu.
Let's head to the next stop.

2582
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,560
There's a Tianjin Folk Custom Museum here.
Tutu.

2583
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:54,720
Let's take a look.
Tutu.

2584
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,470
Bian Shaobo
Welcome to the Tianjin Folk Custom Museum.

2585
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:59,040
Next, we have a script game.
Bian Shaobo

2586
01:35:59,040 --> 01:35:59,800
Bian Shaobo
I'll hand it over to you all.

2587
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,120
there's also a script game.
Tutu

2588
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,320
Bian Shaobo
Experience a different Tianjin Wei.

2589
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,560
Come on, friends in the back.
Bian Shaobo

2590
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,600
Tutu
Ancient artifacts, modern reflections.

2591
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,000
Bian Shaobo
That's right.

2592
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,920
As of this year, the city of Tianjin
Bian Shaobo

2593
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,760
Bian Shaobo
has been established for 620 years.

2594
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:10,880
It's the only city with
Bian Shaobo

2595
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,400
Bian Shaobo
a specific birth date.

2596
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,720
Why does it have such
Bian Shaobo

2597
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:14,720
Bian Shaobo
an interesting characteristic?

2598
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:15,840
It's all related to the historical
Bian Shaobo

2599
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,560
Bian Shaobo
integrity of Tianjin Wei.

2600
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,200
Watch your step.
Bian Shaobo

2601
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,360
Bian Shaobo
Please, everyone, come inside.

2602
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,750
Bian Shaobo
Look at these blue background walls,

2603
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:24,190
they all contain many
Bian Shaobo

2604
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:25,360
Bian Shaobo
ships

2605
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:26,360
and bridges.
Bian Shaobo

2606
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,480
Bian Shaobo
It represents that our Tianjin

2607
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,040
was born because of the canal transportation.
Bian Shaobo

2608
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:31,440
Bian Shaobo
Let's look over here.

2609
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,470
This is actually our
Bian Shaobo

2610
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:34,750
Bian Shaobo
'Luhe Canal Transportation Map.'

2611
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:36,120
The 'Luhe Canal Transportation Map' is over a meter longer

2612
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,280
Bian Shaobo
than the 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival.'

2613
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,000
It was painted by
Bian Shaobo

2614
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Bian Shaobo
Jiang Xuan, a painter from the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty.

2615
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,040
He went to paint it.
Bian Shaobo

2616
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,430
Bian Shaobo
Now, let's scan with our phones

2617
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:43,640
this mini-program behind
Bian Shaobo

2618
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,040
Bian Shaobo
to play a puzzle game.

2619
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,120
Aren't there many lanterns here?
Bian Shaobo.

2620
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:49,040
Bian Shaobo, let's first look at the 'Illustrated Guide to Tianjin's Baojia System'.

2621
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,640
Bian Shaobo.
Bian Shaobo, then let's turn back and look at this side.

2622
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:51,360
we were just holding
Bian Shaobo.

2623
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,440
in the puzzle-solving handbook
Bian Shaobo.

2624
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,360
Bian Shaobo.
there is a map.

2625
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,200
Let's look for
Bian Shaobo.

2626
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,550
Bian Shaobo.
the corresponding text in this map.

2627
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:56,600
The content it hints at,
Bian Shaobo.

2628
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,110
Bian Shaobo.
then write the answer on your phone.

2629
01:36:58,110 --> 01:36:58,840
That's all you need to do.
Bian Shaobo.

2630
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,030
Bian Shaobo.
This way, through reading,

2631
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:01,600
we learn about the ancient city of Tianjin,
Bian Shaobo.

2632
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,590
Bian Shaobo.
what it was really like.

2633
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:03,520
There are two people here.
Bian Shaobo.

2634
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:04,350
Bian Shaobo.
One is called Ms. Li,

2635
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:05,760
and the other is Mr. Ge.
Bian Shaobo.

2636
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:07,520
Bian Shaobo.
The question is, where did they go?

2637
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,600
Tata
Where my ancestors lived

2638
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,590
is very close to the rice drying factory.
Tata

2639
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:12,120
Xiaoling
Guan Di Temple

2640
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:13,720
And then?
Harry

2641
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:15,640
That's all.
Harry

2642
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:17,840
Bian Shaobo.
From Ms. Li's description,

2643
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,240
we can see that
Bian Shaobo.
From Ms. Li's description,

2644
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,040
Bian Shaobo.
it's actually

2645
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,440
We lived near the rice drying factory,
Bian Shaobo.

2646
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:21,470
Bian Shaobo.
and the Guan Di Temple was right outside.

2647
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:22,560
Passing through Stone Bridge Alley,
Bian Shaobo.

2648
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,960
Bian Shaobo.
walking west along East Street,

2649
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,950
you would hear 108 bell tolls.
Bian Shaobo.

2650
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:27,840
Bian Shaobo.
Walking west on East Street,

2651
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,640
that would be the Drum Tower.
Bian Shaobo.

2652
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,240
Bian Shaobo.
The Drum Tower is at the center of Tianjin.

2653
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:32,080
The other one is Mr. Ge.
Bian Shaobo.

2654
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,560
Bian Shaobo.
If they pass through Dashilan,

2655
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,070
walking east along West Street,
Bian Shaobo.

2656
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:36,240
Bian Shaobo.
passing through Planked Bridge Alley,

2657
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:37,920
they would reach a place for praying for blessings,
Bian Shaobo.

2658
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,320
Bian Shaobo.
the Fire God Temple.

2659
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,120
So the answer is the Drum Tower and the Fire God Temple.
Bian Shaobo.

2660
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,040
Bian Shaobo.
In the early years in Tianjin,

2661
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:44,160
the Drum Tower only had bells, no drums.
Bian Shaobo.

2662
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,560
Bian Shaobo.
It rang 108 times every day,

2663
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,230
representing the morning and evening bell tolls,
Bian Shaobo.

2664
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:49,080
Bian Shaobo.
signaling the opening and closing of the city gates.

2665
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,080
What's displayed here are
Bian Shaobo.

2667
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:52,800
Lanterns, old objects.
Bian Shaobo.

2668
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,710
Bian Shaobo
Additionally, in Tianjin city,

2669
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:56,440
there's another characteristic.
Bian Shaobo

2670
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:58,080
Bian Shaobo
In Tianjin, because we need to work in the morning,

2671
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,230
for agricultural labor,
Bian Shaobo

2672
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:00,400
Bian Shaobo
so we hold weddings in the afternoon.

2673
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,720
it means everyone is only free in the afternoon.
Tata

2674
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:02,480
Bian Shaobo
Yes, only free in the afternoon.

2675
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,440
Right, that's correct.
Bian Shaobo

2676
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,280
Bian Shaobo
There's no time in the morning.

2677
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:05,200
What about the evening?

01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,360
I can't memorize them.
Tutu.

2873
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,560
Extinguish the wolf smoke and deliver the victory report.

2874
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,160
Return triumphantly to Bianjing.

2875
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:20,560
The young phoenix soars without failing its mission.

2876
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:23,600
The heroine leaves a good name.

2877
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,950
Thank you all for your applause.

2878
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:30,430
Yes.

2879
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:32,160
That was a piece of fast-talking.

2880
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,880
The performers on stage put in a lot of effort.

2881
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:34,480
Indeed.

2882
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,040
It's very tiring.

2883
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:36,720
Let him go down and 'rest in peace.'

2884
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:37,630
For him.

2885
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:38,520
This scene has us,

2886
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,640
Don't worry about this scene yet,

2887
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,040
that's called resting.

2888
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,160
Go down and rest.

2889
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:44,560
This scene has us replaced on stage.

2890
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,720
Continue performing for everyone.

2891
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:46,430
Say a bit more,

2892
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:48,510
introduce the teacher next to you.

2893
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:51,230
This teacher's surname is Shi.

2894
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:53,630
His name is Shi Zhenxiang.

2895
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,120
This is indeed our teacher Shi.

2896
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,400
He looks about thirty, quite young.

2897
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,800
There's a word to describe him,

2898
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,150
a specific word,

2899
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:02,160
baby face.

2900
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:07,550
Raise your hand if you know the four skills of crosstalk.

2901
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:08,600
Speaking, learning, teasing, and singing.
Tang Tang.

2902
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:09,520
Look at that,

2903
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:10,000
that's correct.

2904
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Take off your shoes and get on the kang.

2905
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:12,990
Come on, stand up.

2906
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:14,840
You'll receive a reward shortly.

2907
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,640
It's okay, don't be afraid.

2908
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,150
Come on, brother,

2909
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:18,240
go bow to someone.

2910
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:23,710
My old father.

2911
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:24,960
Good.

2912
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,960
The crosstalk was well done, very interesting.

2913
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,720
Xinxin,
I used to be offline,

2914
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,320
I've watched some crosstalk performances.
Xinxin,

2915
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:36,800
Xinxin,
I feel this performance style,

2916
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,720
is something I really like.
Xinxin,

2917
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:39,840
Xinxin,
Similar to crosstalk and stand-up comedy,

2918
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:40,830
I love watching them all.
Xinxin,

2919
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:44,320
Tutu,
I think crosstalk,

2920
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,480
is overwhelming with its fast pace.
Tutu,

2921
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,350
Tutu,
His exaggerated performances,

2922
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:50,560
or the classic jokes he tells,
Tutu,

2923
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:52,320
Tutu,
make us feel,

2924
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:53,840
their skills are impressive.
Tutu,

2925
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,480
There are many things worth learning from them.
Tutu,

2926
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,120
announcer,
Once again, thank you,

2927
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:58,880
for the wonderful performance by the two teachers.
announcer,

2928
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,640
announcer,
Let's add a little impromptu show.

2929
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:01,790
Is there anyone,
announcer,

2930
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:03,480
announcer,
who wants to come on stage and perform?

2931
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:04,640
here.
Tang Tang,

2932
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:08,880
here.
Tang Tang,

2933
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,280
Come on, let's welcome this handsome guy.
announcer,

2934
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:14,640
Tata,
Why,

2935
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:16,080
Why does he suddenly want to perform?
Tata,

2936
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:23,800
Su Su,
I said, what's going on?

2937
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:25,760
Su Su,
I said, what's the situation?

2938
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,600
What's happening?
Su Su,

2939
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,280
Su Su,
What's he going to do?

2940
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,120
My mind was filled with,
Su Su,

2941
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:31,040
Su Su,
a hundred thousand thoughts at that moment.

2942
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,840
They just came flooding out.
Su Su,

2943
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,480
Tang Tang,
As for me,

2944
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,840
I wrote a little story on the spot.
Tang Tang,

2945
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:47,800
Let me tell you all about it.
Tang Tang,

2946
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,200
Tang Tang,
It might not be very funny,

2947
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,880
so please bear with me.
Tang Tang,

2948
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:51,640
Okay.
Tutu,

2949
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:52,240
Alright.
Tang Tang,

2950
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:54,430
Su Su,
If it were me, I'd definitely 'die' up there.

2951
01:45:54,430 --> 01:45:55,710
Standing up there.
Su Su,

2952
01:45:55,710 --> 01:45:57,080
Tang Tang,
One day,

2953
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:58,800
my door was knocked on.
Tang Tang,

2954
01:45:59,550 --> 01:46:00,920
Tang Tang,
I hurried over in confusion.

2955
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:01,680
thinking to myself,
Tang Tang,

2956
01:46:02,110 --> 01:46:03,550
what's going on here?
Tang Tang,

2957
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,680
Tang Tang
I don't have any friends coming over today either.

2958
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:08,240
as soon as the door opened,
Tang Tang

2959
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:10,200
Tang Tang
a pair of sparkling big eyes

2960
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,280
blinked at me a few times.
Tang Tang

2961
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,990
Tang Tang
At that moment, I thought to myself,

2962
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:13,840
oh no,
Tang Tang

2963
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,040
Tang Tang
I've fallen in love.

2964
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:22,840
Xiaoling
What?

2965
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:26,240
Huahua
How romantic!

2966
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:28,920
Tang Tang
But strangely enough,

2967
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:31,000
neither of us was very talkative.
Tang Tang

2968
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,600
Tang Tang
I wondered what to do.

2969
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,920
Two quiet types, staring at each other,
Tang Tang

2970
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,440
Tang Tang
unable to say a word for ages.

2971
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,440
Tang Tang
I kept staring at her,

2972
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:45,360
looking and looking.
Tang Tang

2973
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,840
Tang Tang
I helped her with water and bowls,

2974
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:49,150
wondering if I was being too forward.
Tang Tang

2975
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:51,360
Tang Tang
There's some up there.

2976
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:53,150
Tang Tang
I'm not very thirsty.

2977
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:53,790
Thank you.
Susu

2978
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:57,920
Tang Tang
Perhaps this is as proactive as an earth sign can be.

2979
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,760
Tang Tang
After a few days together, there were just too many misunderstandings.

2980
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,430
I felt like we had hit it off,
Tang Tang

2981
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:07,520
Tang Tang
so why was it so difficult?

2982
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,110
Even Zhu Bajie didn't have this much trouble finding a wife.
Tang Tang

2983
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,990
Tang Tang
I decided to seek some advice.

2984
01:47:20,990 --> 01:47:22,000
Ninety-nine trials and tribulations,
Tang Tang

2985
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,230
Tang Tang
Bajie got through them all.

2986
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:24,600
Tang Tang
How many have I faced so far?

2987
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:25,920
I talked and talked with Pangpang,
Tang Tang

2988
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:26,800
Tang Tang
over and over again.

2989
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,670
Teacher Zhuang's advice was,
Tang Tang

2990
01:47:28,670 --> 01:47:29,790
Tang Tang
don't be so nervous.

2991
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,120
Tang Tang
You need to relax when interacting with girls,

2992
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,720
otherwise, they'll feel pressured too.
Tang Tang

2993
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,990
Tang Tang
I said, 'Master, I understand now.'

2994
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:39,360
Tang Tang
And so,

2995
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,830
I thought I had taken quite a lot of initiative.
Tang Tang

2996
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:44,240
Tang Tang
I wrote a letter.

2997
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:45,760
Tang Tang
I dreamed of a flower seller

2998
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,230
who, empty-handed, told me,
Tang Tang

2999
01:47:47,230 --> 01:47:49,790
Tang Tang
'One must feel happy first to see the roses.'

3000
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:51,760
We gradually started talking more,
Tang Tang

3001
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,280
Tang Tang
and you began to smile a lot more too.

3002
01:47:57,630 --> 01:47:59,120
Tang Tang
I think this might be

3003
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,310
the process of going from acquaintances to truly knowing each other.
Tang Tang

3004
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:05,440
Tang Tang.
The flower seller asked me what I wanted.

3005
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,200
It was a dazzling array of choices.
Tang Tang.

3006
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,560
Tang Tang.
I walked around and chose white roses.

3007
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:11,440
The flowers are like you.
Tang Tang.

3008
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,320
Tang Tang.
Pure and elegant, untouched by the world.

3009
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,720
I hid my sincerity in the flowers and gave them to you.
Tang Tang.

3010
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,520
Tang Tang.
We've made great progress these past two days.

3011
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,120
Thanks to Muscle Master for the help.
Tang Tang.

3012
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:29,560
Tang Tang.
'Bajie' is about to succeed.

3013
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,040
Wait for my success, everyone.
Tang Tang.

3014
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,190
Then we'll meet again in the martial world.
Tang Tang.

3015
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,830
Su Su.
Scoring a hundred is very brave.

3016
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:41,470
I really don't feel it.
Su Su.

3017
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:43,360
Su Su.
This is something he would do.

3018
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,670
Although it makes me very shy,
Su Su.

3019
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:46,750
Su Su.
very embarrassed,

3020
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:48,080
but actually, I'm very touched.
Su Su.

3021
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,160
Su Su.
It feels like he mustered a lot of courage.

3022
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,280
Because if it were me,
Su Su.

3023
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,080
Su Su.
I might not,

3024
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,430
dare to go on stage and do this.
Su Su.

3025
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:57,360
Tang Tang.
At that time,

3026
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,230
I wasn't that scared or nervous,
Tang Tang.

3027
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:02,110
Tang Tang.
because we had already held hands the day before.

3028
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:03,320
I just felt,
Tang Tang.

3029
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:05,630
Tang Tang.
I could openly express my affection,

3030
01:49:05,630 --> 01:49:07,160
and there wouldn't be any bad consequences.
Tang Tang.

3031
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,030
Announcer.
Thank you to this handsome guy for the wonderful performance.

3032
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:12,670
Let's give him another round of applause.
Announcer.

3033
01:49:12,670 --> 01:49:16,720
Su Su.
When did you write it?

3034
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,240
Tang Tang.
Just now in the car.

3035
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:27,710
Hua Hua.
Tang Tang raised his hand.

3036
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:29,600
I thought he would sing a song,
Hua Hua.

3037
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,040
Hua Hua.
to warm up the crowd or something.

3038
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,120
I didn't expect he would,
Hua Hua.

3039
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,880
Hua Hua.
recite such a heartfelt monologue.

3040
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,510
It really,
Hua Hua.

3041
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:37,880
Hua Hua.
was quite impressive.

3042
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,350
Xiao Ling.
He pulled off something so big,

3043
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:41,280
I didn't expect it,
Xiao Ling.

3044
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,440
Xiao Ling.
because Tang Tang is someone who,

3045
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,960
wouldn't dare to perform on stage,
Xiao Ling.

3046
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,880
Xiao Ling.
he gets very nervous in front of the camera.

3047
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,920
So I think,
Xiao Ling.

3048
01:49:48,510 --> 01:49:50,430
Xiao Ling.
he really cares about this.

3049
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:51,960
He's so serious, so proactive,
Xiao Ling.

3050
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,720
Xiao Ling.
and it showed me a whole new Tom.

3051
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,190
I've never seen before.
Xiao Ling.

3052
01:49:56,190 --> 01:49:57,840
Xiao Ling.
He must have grown a lot.

3053
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,480
Hua Hua.
Tang Tang, how long did you memorize that script?

3054
01:50:00,990 --> 01:50:03,070
Tang Tang
I started writing it when I got in the car.

3055
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,830
Hua Hua
You just wrote it?

3056
01:50:04,830 --> 01:50:07,230
Tang Tang
Wasn't I reading and speaking at the same time up there?

3057
01:50:07,550 --> 01:50:08,600
So last-minute?
Pang Pang

3058
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:08,920
Tang Tang
Yes.

3059
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:09,760
so last-minute.
Hua Hua

3060
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,870
Hua Hua
I was already getting emotional in the audience.

3061
01:50:11,870 --> 01:50:13,720
Xiao Ling
I recorded it all for you.

3062
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,040
Xin Xin, from those big sparkling eyes,

3063
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:18,800
Xin Xin
I was already starting to feel moved.

3064
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,720
Hua Hua
Yes, I think it was really touching.

3065
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,440
At that moment,
Hua Hua

3066
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,560
Pang Pang
I thought you were going to go up and sing at first.

3067
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,550
Passionate Aries.
Pang Pang

3068
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:27,960
Tang Tang
Really?

3069
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:28,830
Xin Xin
I also thought you were going to sing.

3070
01:50:28,830 --> 01:50:29,560
Tang Tang
It was really too passionate.

3071
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,230
I'm always passionate.
Tang Tang

3072
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:32,920
Tang Tang
What did you do this morning?

3073
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,840
We went shopping in the morning.
Tu Tu

3074
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:36,920
Xin Xin
We visited a museum.

3075
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:40,160
Hua Hua
Museum.

3076
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,080
The clay figurine museum was so much fun.
Tu Tu

3077
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:43,600
Hua Hua
Do you know where we went?

3078
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,160
Tu Tu
Where?

3079
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,560
Guess.
Terry

3080
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:47,680
Hua Hua
Actually, I think this place

3081
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:49,440
should be quite famous in Beijing.
Hua Hua

3082
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,320
Tu Tu
quite famous in Beijing.

3083
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:52,670
Terry
Actually, every city has one.

3084
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,560
Tang Tang
You'll be judged by the elderly.

3085
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:57,840
judged by the elderly.
Hua Hua

3086
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:01,520
Tu Tu
Did you go square dancing?

3087
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:02,200
Similar.
Terry

3088
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:03,760
Harry
Did you go to a matchmaking corner?

3089
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:05,520
Terry,
By the way,

3090
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:06,590
matchmaking corner.
Tutu,

3091
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:07,070
Huahua,
Yes.

3092
01:51:07,070 --> 01:51:08,000
Tutu,
you went to the matchmaking corner.

3093
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,520
Huahua,
those three guys were really popular.

3094
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,270
they kept pulling them aside
Huahua,

3095
01:51:10,270 --> 01:51:10,840
Susu,
and complimenting them.

3096
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:11,870
they wanted to register them.
Huahua,

3097
01:51:11,870 --> 01:51:12,880
like, seriously register them.
Xinxin,

3098
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:13,440
Seriously.
Huahua,

3099
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:14,520
Pangpang, did you leave your contact?
Xinxin,

3100
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:14,960
Pangpang,
I did.

3101
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:15,390
Xinxin,
good.

3102
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,680
Pangpang,
I needed it the most, so I left mine first.

3103
01:51:19,070 --> 01:51:20,880
Xinxin,
I was so worried, I was really worried.

3104
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:21,440
alright.
Xinxin,

3105
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,760
Pangpang,
What about you guys?

3106
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,600
Xinxin,
we went to the Ancient Culture Street.

3107
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,230
Huahua,
Ancient Culture Street? Did you go shopping?

3108
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:29,080
and then we bought a lot of snacks.
Xiaoling,

3109
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:31,230
Huahua,
Wait a minute,

3110
01:51:31,230 --> 01:51:32,880
you just had snacks for lunch?
Huahua,

3111
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:33,400
yes.
Tutu,

3112
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:35,070
Xinxin,
Tutu ordered a basket of Goubuli baozi.

3113
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:37,040
Xinxin,
He ate four by himself.

3114
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,390
you got it wrong. They're called Goubuli baozi.
Tangtang,

3115
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:40,320
Goubuli baozi.

3116
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,520
Huahua,
Goubuli baozi.

3117
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:43,960
then we learned some Tianjin dialect.
Huahua,

3118
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:46,040
Xinxin,
We learned quite a lot.

3119
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:47,920
Xiaoling,
I learned how to say 'I miss you a lot in Tianjin.'

3120
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:50,270
'I miss you a lot in Tianjin.'
Together,

3121
01:51:50,270 --> 01:51:52,830
Xinxin,
'I really miss you.'

3122
01:51:52,830 --> 01:51:54,750
Susu,
I learned one that goes...

3123
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,640
What?
Susu,

3124
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,150
'Beautiful girls with handsome guys.'
Tangtang,

3125
01:51:57,150 --> 01:51:58,320
Susu,
We were just standing there,

3126
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,600
and then an old man said to us,
Susu,

3127
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,400
Susu,
'Beautiful girls with handsome guys.'

3128
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,600
'Handsome guys with beautiful girls.'
Susu,

3129
01:52:03,230 --> 01:52:05,920
Hua Hua.

3130
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:06,880
Xiao Ling.

3131
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:07,920
Terry.
Let's meet back at the cabin.

3132
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:08,720
Tu Tu.
Goodbye, go ahead.

3133
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,080
Xiao Ling.
Goodbye.

3134
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:11,680
Let's go, we should leave too.
Tata.

3135
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:12,510
Xiao Ling.
We should leave too.

3136
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:14,080
Let's go.
Tu Tu.

3137
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,680
Xiao Ling.
Let me tell you,

3138
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:21,080
don't tell anyone else.
Xiao Ling.

3139
01:52:22,430 --> 01:52:23,710
I'll see what that is.
Tu Tu.

3140
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:27,230
Xiao Ling.
I'm not telling you.

3141
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:31,640
Xiao Ling.
What do you think?

3142
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,640
Xin Xin.
You have to rate it from one to ten.

3143
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:35,710
You're asking me how many points?
Xin Xin.

3144
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,360
Xin Xin.
I think,

3145
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:38,880
six points.
Xin Xin.

3146
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:40,400
Xin Xin.
Is there?

3147
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,720
There still is.
Xin Xin.

3148
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,200
Xin Xin.
Six points is a pass for me.

3149
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:46,560
Xiao Ling.
I'm thinking,

3150
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,550
and I'm also feeling it,
Xiao Ling.

3151
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:50,400
Xiao Ling.
but I really don't know.

3152
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,280
Xin Xin.
I think there still is.

3153
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:53,150
Really?
Xiao Ling.

3154
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,550
Then I'll try to feel it more.
Xiao Ling.

3155
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,670
Xin Xin.
It's because of your comparison,

3156
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:02,590
Xin Xin.
you can't compare with a ten.

3157
01:53:02,590 --> 01:53:03,360
Indeed.
Xiao Ling.

3158
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,600
Xin Xin.
There are many people with different personalities.

3159
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:05,310
Indeed.
Xiao Ling.

3160
01:53:08,350 --> 01:53:08,990
Tu Tu.
Mimi.

3161
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:11,960
Xiao Ling.
It's so sudden, I'm not used to it.

3162
01:53:14,110 --> 01:53:15,120
Is it 'Donkey Roll'?
Xiao Ling.

3163
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:15,520
Yes.
Tu Tu.

3164
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:26,240
Xiao Ling.
We've arrived.

3165
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:27,870
Harry.
Isn't it?

3166
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:28,990
Sister Zhu is doing her hair.
Harry.

3167
01:53:28,990 --> 01:53:30,040
Sister Zhu is doing her hair.
Tata.

3168
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:33,840
Xin Xin.
Sister Zhu is doing her hair.

3169
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:44,350
Harry.
Hello.

3170
01:53:45,150 --> 01:53:45,790
Sister Zhu.
Hello.

3171
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:58,560
Sister Zhu.
Hello.

3172
01:53:58,560 --> 01:53:59,710
Beautiful ladies and handsome gentlemen.
Sister Zhu.

3173
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:02,720
Sister Zhu.
Hello.

3174
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:05,760
Let's try a hairstyle.
Harry.

3175
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,120
Sister Zhu.
Let's try the Tianjin auntie's hairstyle.

3176
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:08,350
Right, just teasing us.
Harry.

3177
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,950
Sister Zhu.
Three girls and two boys.

3178
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:10,720
Xinxin.
Yes.

3179
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:11,680
Let's choose a girl.
Xinxin.

3180
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:12,720
then choose one.
Xinxin.

3181
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,680
Choose a boy.
Sister Zhu.

3182
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,560
Count me out.
Harry.

3183
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:19,710
Sister Zhu.
You're out.

3184
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:21,120
I think you look good.
Sister Zhu.

3185
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:22,360
Harry.
Don't look at me.

3186
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:23,480
I don't need it.
Harry.

3187
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:26,680
Xinxin.
It's already fluffy without styling.

3188
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:27,070
Yes.
Tutu.

3189
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:30,110
Xiaoling.
Let's vote.

3190
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:37,680
Let's vote for the girls first.
Harry.

3191
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:39,070
Xiaoling.
starting with Xinxin.

3192
01:54:39,070 --> 01:54:40,160
Raise your hand if you vote for Xinxin.
Xiaoling.

3193
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,200
No one.
Xinxin.

3194
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:45,840
Xinxin.
Raise your hand if you vote for Mizi.

3195
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:49,280
Xiaoling.
Raise your hand if you vote for Tata.

3196
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:52,510
Tutu.
Then you choose.

3197
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:53,240
You choose one.
Tutu.

3198
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:54,910
Xinxin.
I choose.

3199
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,350
Xinxin.
Do you want to do it?

3200
01:54:57,150 --> 01:54:58,640
I don't think I can do it.
Tata.

3201
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,600
Xinxin.
Then Mizi, you give it a try.

3202
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:01,600
mainly because I think.
Xinxin.

3203
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:03,920
Xinxin.
you have a very stylish effect.

3204
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:05,310
Xiaoling.
I'm fine, okay, no problem.

3205
01:55:05,310 --> 01:55:06,520
Xinxin.
This team has sent out one.

3206
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:07,360
I think your team.
Xinxin.

3207
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,480
Xinxin.
should also send one out.

3208
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:09,360
Okay, we'll send out Tata.
Harry.

3209
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:13,400
Xinxin.
Did you see it at the crucial moment?

3210
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,270
Harry.
Okay.

3211
01:55:14,270 --> 01:55:15,120
How do we do this?
Harry.

3212
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:16,240
Let's do it.
Harry.

3213
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:19,600
Looking forward to it.
Tata.

3214
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:21,790
Xiaoling.
You're so excited, Tata.

3215
01:55:23,710 --> 01:55:25,240
Xinxin.
To be honest, I'm more looking forward to Harry's.

3216
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:28,440
Harry.
Which one is wearing a wig?

3217
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,000
Which one isn't wearing a wig?
Harry.

3218
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:30,880
Sister Zhu.
There's no wig here.

3219
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:31,800
This is all their own hair.
Sister Zhu.

3220
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,280
Isn't this a sea urchin hairstyle?
Sister Zhu.

3221
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,110
What about this one?
Harry.

3222
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:35,920
This is a flying dragon.
Sister Zhu.

3223
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:38,880
Sister Zhu.
You can't do this dragon.

3224
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,760
Let's do a snake.
Sister Zhu.

3225
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,470
Xinxin.
It's auspicious this year.

3226
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:42,400
We must do a snake.
Xinxin.

3227
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,160
Harry.
Really?

3228
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,440
What style?
Harry.

3229
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:45,200
Snake.
Sister Zhu.

3230
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:47,320
Sister Zhu.
Small snake.

3231
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:48,400
Year of the Snake.
Sister Zhu.

3232
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:49,360
How do we do this?
Tata.

3233
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:50,200
Sister Zhu.
We'll coil it up later.

3234
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,390
Wrap it around his head.
Sister Zhu.

3235
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:51,960
Okay, let's do this one.
Harry.

3236
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:52,800
Alright, that works.
Tata.

3237
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:56,560
Xinxin.
I think this hairstyle

3238
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,080
can shut Harry's mouth.
Xinxin.

3239
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,870
Xinxin, I finally know what can control him.
Xinxin.

3240
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:05,440
Sister Zhu.
Your hair is really quite stiff.

3241
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:06,160
Is there a lot of hair?
Harry.

3242
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:07,320
Sister Zhu.
Plenty.

3243
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:07,760
It's okay, I guess.
Harry.

3244
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:09,680
This time I'll curl your hair.
Sister Zhu.

3245
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:12,560
Harry.
Why are you smiling so happily?

3246
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:13,560
Honestly, don't smile so happily.
Harry.

3247
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:14,720
I feel pressured when you smile so happily.
Harry.

3248
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:20,760
Smiling so happily.
Harry.

3249
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:26,240
This time I'll choose this hairstyle for you.
Sister Zhu.

3250
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:28,320
Xiaoling.
Harry.

3251
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,430
To be honest, I'm a bit overwhelmed.
Harry.

3252
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:36,400
Tata.
You finally achieved this little ponytail.

3253
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:40,080
Sister Zhu.
Do you understand my hair styling?

3254
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:40,880
I understand now.
Harry.

3255
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:43,360
We're learning, right?
Xinxin.

3256
01:56:48,190 --> 01:56:48,960
Xiaoling
What is this?

3257
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:49,520
Covering one eye.
Xiaoling

3258
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,000
To be honest, I'm about to transform.
Harry

3259
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:51,760
Tata
No, Harry.

3260
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:53,310
Tata, can you go eat by yourself later?
Tata

3261
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:55,710
Harry
Let me tell you,

3262
01:56:55,710 --> 01:56:57,150
when my hair is done,
Harry

3263
01:56:57,150 --> 01:56:58,200
I'll be taller than Terry.
Harry

3264
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,040
Terry
Tata

3265
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:07,230
Xiaoling looks so peaceful over there.
Tata

3266
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:08,760
Xiaoling should have this style.
Harry

3267
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:09,310
Xiaoling

3268
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,880
I dare not look.
Tata

3269
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,280
Sister Zhu
The handsome guy you can't shake off.

3270
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:19,840
Don't think
Sister Zhu

3271
01:57:20,510 --> 01:57:21,470
Sister Zhu
you can shake it off so easily.

3272
01:57:21,470 --> 01:57:22,270
You can't get rid of it.
Sister Zhu

3273
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:26,480
Better keep it covered.
Harry

3274
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:30,270
Sister Zhu
You all seem pleased.

3275
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:32,350
It's not hard on you, right?
Sister Zhu

3276
01:57:32,350 --> 01:57:34,160
No.
Tutu

3277
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:34,480
Looking forward to it.
Tata

3278
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:34,910
We're really looking forward to it.
Tutu

3279
01:57:34,910 --> 01:57:37,150
It really suits you, mainly because
Xinxin

3280
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:38,520
Tutu
I suddenly regret not being chosen.

3281
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,200
It looks so good.
Tutu

3282
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,920
Tata
It's like Jay Chou himself is sitting here.

3283
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:42,640
Don't you think so? This hairstyle
Tata

3284
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:44,350
The left eye is to remember you.
Tutu

3285
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:53,360
Xinxin
Tata, don't laugh at him.

3286
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,680
You should give him some loving encouragement.
Xinxin

3287
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:56,960
I don't want to.
Tata

3288
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:10,480
Harry
Do you think I need to use

3289
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:11,840
a whole bottle of hair gel for this style?
Harry

3290
01:58:13,310 --> 01:58:14,400
I'm at a loss, I'm at a loss.
Sister Zhu

3291
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:15,390
Harry
How are you at a loss?

3292
01:58:15,870 --> 01:58:17,360
Sister Zhu
It's also a cost.

3293
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:17,760
Tutu
Let me tell you,

3294
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,520
you can use this to top Susu later.
Tutu

3295
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:21,080
Harry.
I'll fan her with this.

3296
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:21,600
I'll fan her.
Harry.

3297
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:22,480
I said I'd come to fan you.
Harry.

3298
01:58:22,910 --> 01:58:23,480
Xinxin.
I think this,

3299
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:24,720
we're getting to our theme.
Xinxin.

3300
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:25,520
Xinxin.
'Just teasing you.'

3301
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:27,360
Yes, it's really 'Just teasing you.'
Tutu.

3302
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:28,960
Xiaoling.
I don't think I've been teased much yet.

3303
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,640
He was teased.
Xiaoling.

3304
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:31,870
Harry.
I'm almost done.

3305
01:58:31,870 --> 01:58:33,520
Laughing so happily.
Harry.

3306
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,360
Xinxin.
Really.

3307
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,160
I can't even imagine.
Xinxin.

3308
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:36,990
Xinxin.
What if it's Pangpang?

3309
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:40,600
Xiaoling.
If it's Pangpang,

3310
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:42,360
Tutu.
Why wasn't it Pangpang who drew 'Just teasing you'?

3311
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:43,120
Tata.
If it's Pangpang,

3312
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,830
then Pangpang must be sitting here.
Tata.

3313
01:58:44,830 --> 01:58:46,880
Tata.
Definitely, Pangpang must be sitting here.

3314
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:50,640
Sister Zhu.
Okay.

3315
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:52,720
Tata.
The snake is on.

3316
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,040
Are you nervous, Harry?
Tata.

3317
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:57,950
I seem a bit nervous.
Harry.

3318
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:02,360
Harry.
You look so happy laughing.

3319
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:07,520
When the snake coils up, it's a bit,
Tutu.

3320
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:08,670
like adding the finishing touch.
Tutu.

3321
01:59:08,670 --> 01:59:10,840
Prince, you become a prince.
Tata.

3322
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:12,480
An Egyptian prince appears.
Tutu.

3323
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:13,360
Yes.
Tata.

3324
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:16,600
So handsome.
Tutu.

3325
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:18,480
Xiaoling.
Harry now seems like that,

3326
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:20,000
half-hidden behind a pipa.
Xiaoling.

3327
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,630
Xiaoling.
You're holding that thing in your hand.

3328
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:28,480
Xinxin.
Really.

3329
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,840
Absolutely, so many girls love you, Harry.
Xinxin.

3330
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:31,710
To be honest,
Xinxin.

3331
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:33,630
To be honest,
Harry.

3332
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:35,680
there's something there.
Harry.

3333
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:38,590
Tata.
Have you already fallen in love with yourself?

3334
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,360
Xinxin
Did you vote today?

3335
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:41,760
I must vote.
Xinxin
Did you vote today?

3336
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:42,910
Tata
Definitely voting for Harry.

3337
01:59:42,910 --> 01:59:44,320
Xinxin
Is there any privilege?

3338
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,520
I must vote for you.
Xinxin

3339
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:46,640
Tata
Best of the day.

3340
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:49,840
Bull Demon King
Tata

3341
01:59:51,070 --> 01:59:53,280
Tata
You really are the Bull Demon King.

3342
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:54,080
Go away.
Harry

3343
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:56,160
Mom, there's a monster.
Tata

3344
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:57,720
Speak.
Xinxin

3345
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,800
Xinxin
Monster, what's your name?

3346
02:00:00,830 --> 02:00:02,000
Xinxin
Monster

3347
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:04,990
Xiaoling
I'm starting to get a little scared.

3348
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:08,440
So tall, I feel like
Harry

3349
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,080
Tutu
Anna, you really turned into Anna.

3350
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:13,950
Like that kind of foreign royalty.
Tutu

3351
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:16,030
She turned into Angelina Jolie.
Tata

3352
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:19,960
Xiaoling
That's a high compliment, Tata.

3353
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:22,040
Looking forward to Xiaoling.
Tata

3354
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:23,870
Xinxin
You are simply beautiful.

3355
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:24,480
I think
Xinxin

3356
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:24,760
Tata
Indeed.

3357
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,270
Xiaoling looks beautiful no matter what.
Tata

3358
02:00:26,910 --> 02:00:27,600
Tata
Feeling Xiaoling

3359
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,720
Even the Bull Demon King's head looks good.
Tata

3360
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:36,670
Sister Zhu
Looks good, right?

3361
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:38,400
Xiaoling
Looks good, too good.

3362
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:40,240
Tutu
You really look like a 'spy' now.

3363
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:41,120
Do you know?
Tutu

3364
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:43,230
Xiaoling
I'm going to act in 'The Eternal Wave'.

3365
02:00:44,670 --> 02:00:45,760
Tutu
You have this too?

3366
02:00:46,270 --> 02:00:46,750
Yes.
Xiaoling

3367
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:56,560
Tutu
You are simply like a beauty from the Republic era.

3368
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,480
Really stunning.
Xinxin

3369
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:00,000
Indeed, looks beautiful no matter what.
Tata

3370
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,480
Sister Zhu
Good.

3371
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:12,640
Thank you.
Xiaoling

3372
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:13,790
Sister Zhu
You're welcome.

3373
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:17,280
Beauty and the Beast.
Tata

3374
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:17,720
Xinxin
Alright, let's go.

3375
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:18,480
Come on, come out.
Tata

3376
02:01:28,670 --> 02:01:30,960
Tutu.
So beautiful.

3377
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:31,520
A stunning beauty.
Tutu.

3378
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:32,640
Really.
Tata.

3379
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:51,760
Harry.
Three, two, one.

3380
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:54,240
Really quite handsome.
Xinxin.

3381
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:55,870
So cool, 'Zhou Dong.'
Tutu.

3382
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:56,600
So stylish.
Xinxin.

3383
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:57,680
Tutu.
'Zhou Dong' is so cool.

3384
02:01:57,680 --> 02:01:58,880
Tata.
'Zhou Dong.'

3385
02:01:58,880 --> 02:01:59,480
Tutu.
'Zhou Dong' is coming.

3386
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:01,240
Xinxin.
It's support, right?

3387
02:02:03,070 --> 02:02:04,920
Tata.
Tutu feels very scared.

3388
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:06,080
Tutu is scared.
Tata.

3389
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,230
Harry.
Next one.

3390
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,080
Xinxin.
Just like that.

3391
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:10,200
Xinxin, just keep it funny like that.

3392
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:13,440
Xiaoling.
Three, two, one.

3393
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:27,070
Dad.
Harry.

3394
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,360
Dad, do you want to see my hair, Dad?
Harry.

3395
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:31,000
Susu Harry Dad.
Okay, open it and let me see.

3396
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:34,400
Is it handsome?
Harry.

3397
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:37,200
Susu Harry Dad.
I didn't see clearly, let me open it and check.

3398
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:38,840
Harry.
Look, is it handsome?

3399
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:40,190
Susu Harry Dad.
What head?

3400
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,480
Snake Year Lucky Hair.
Harry.

3401
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:44,350
Susu Harry Dad.
Let me check again.

3402
02:02:44,350 --> 02:02:45,240
Harry.
You take a look.

3403
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,070
Zhu Jie.
Look again.

3404
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:49,880
Dad is really scared, Dad.
Xinxin.

3405
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:51,040
Susu Harry Dad.
Move away, I didn't see clearly.

3406
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:53,470
Zhu Jie.
Look again.

3407
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:55,040
Harry.
You're screenshotting me now.

3408
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:05,680
Speechless.
Harry.

3409
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,110
Pangpang.
The 'Jie Si Ma' route.

3410
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:11,390
There's one last stop.
Pangpang.

3411
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:13,440
Pangpang.
Go feel it.

3412
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:16,320
Pangpang.
The Tianjin Eye under the sunset in Gendu.

3413
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:17,630
Let romance freeze.
Pangpang.

3414
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:19,680
Huahua.
Romance freezes.

3415
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,920
This one dares to sit.
Pangpang.

3416
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,230
Who's going to sit here?
Tang Tang.

3417
02:03:23,230 --> 02:03:23,920
Then you two sit.
Pang Pang.

3418
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:24,960
Tang Tang.
We two won't sit.

3419
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:25,680
Not sitting.
Tang Tang.

3420
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:26,480
Pang Pang.
Why?

3421
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:27,200
Su Su.
Because I'm afraid of heights.

3422
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:30,360
Then you two sit.
Pang Pang.

3423
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:31,640
We're all afraid.
Hua Hua.

3424
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,160
Pang Pang.
Yes, those two.

3425
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:32,800
Terry.
Then us two.

3426
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,480
I'll sit with Hua Hua.
Terry.

3427
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:35,600
Alright, you two then.
Pang Pang.

3428
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:36,670
Hua Hua.
Aren't you afraid?

3429
02:03:36,670 --> 02:03:37,470
Pang Pang.
I'm afraid of you.

3430
02:03:37,470 --> 02:03:38,000
You go ahead.
Pang Pang.

3431
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:39,280
Hua Hua.
Afraid of me?

3432
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:40,760
Hua Hua.
That's funny.

3433
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:41,600
Pang Pang.
You go ahead.

3434
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:42,750
Su Su.
Aren't you going to sit, Pang Pang?

3435
02:03:43,230 --> 02:03:44,080
Pang Pang.
I'm not sitting.

3436
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:44,960
It's a bit cramped for three of us to sit.
Pang Pang.

3437
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:45,950
Pang Pang.
I'll let those two sit.

3438
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:47,920
Tang Tang.
Three sitting.

3439
02:03:48,510 --> 02:03:49,790
Pang Pang.
Go ahead.

3440
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:51,000
Hua Hua.
How do we get on?

3441
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:59,120
Pang Pang.
From my perspective,

3442
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:00,440
my initiative from yesterday,
Pang Pang.

3443
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,240
Pang Pang.
plus your avoidance today,

3444
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:02,910
I personally think
Pang Pang.

3445
02:04:02,910 --> 02:04:03,870
Pang Pang.
this is a form of rejection.

3446
02:04:03,870 --> 02:04:05,360
Maybe she's a bit uncomfortable rejecting directly.
Pang Pang.

3447
02:04:07,230 --> 02:04:08,350
Hua Hua.
Bro, are you excited?

3448
02:04:08,350 --> 02:04:10,040
We're about to get on the Ferris wheel.
Hua Hua.

3449
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:11,360
Hua Hua.
Because I've never been on one before.

3450
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,670
I really want to ride it.
Hua Hua.

3451
02:04:12,670 --> 02:04:13,310
Really?
Terry.

3452
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:13,560
Hua Hua.
Yes.

3453
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:15,040
I appreciate you accompanying me.
Hua Hua.

3454
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:23,680
Hua Hua.
I'm not afraid. Are you?

3455
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:25,560
Terry.
I'm okay, I guess.

3456
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:26,680
Hua Hua.
I'm a bit scared.

3457
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:27,760
Terry.
I'll hold onto this.

3458
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:29,560
Huahua.
It's okay.

3459
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:30,960
you can lean on my shoulder.
Huahua.

3460
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,190
Terry.
I'm trembling right now.

3461
02:04:32,190 --> 02:04:33,600
Huahua.
Will this be transparent later?

3462
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:34,430
Terry.
No.

3463
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:35,760
This is killing me.
Terry.

3464
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:36,880
If this is transparent,
Terry.

3465
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,440
Terry.
No, this must not be transparent.

3466
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:40,560
If this is transparent, I will really 'die'.
Terry.

3467
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,430
Huahua, I think if you overcome this today,
Huahua.

3468
02:04:42,430 --> 02:04:43,680
Terry.
No.

3469
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:46,590
Terry.
my legs are shaking a bit right now.

3470
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:47,440
Huahua.
Don't be afraid.

3471
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:48,560
Bo Ge, I'm here.
Huahua.

3472
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:57,950
This is okay.
Huahua.

3473
02:04:57,950 --> 02:05:00,320
Terry.
looking at it like this, I feel a bit uneasy.

3474
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,160
I feel a bit uneasy inside.
Terry.

3475
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:03,920
Huahua.
How can you be so handsome even when you're scared?

3476
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:05,150
Huahua.
Okay, I'm happy now.

3477
02:05:05,150 --> 02:05:06,590
once you're happy,
Huahua.

3478
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:09,950
Terry.
switch to normal.

3479
02:05:09,950 --> 02:05:11,320
I definitely wouldn't ride this Ferris wheel.
Terry.

3480
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:12,990
Terry.
Because I'm a bit afraid of heights.

3481
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:14,520
As long as Huahua wants to ride,
Terry.

3482
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:15,800
Terry.
I think I will overcome it.

3483
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:18,110
my own fear.
Terry.

3484
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,120
Pangpang.
We hug back to back.

3485
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:27,320
Pangpang.
You guys come closer to me.

3486
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:28,720
Otherwise, I seem a bit bored.
Pangpang.

3487
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:30,800
Susu.
You walk between us.

3488
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,920
Pangpang.
Really.

3489
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:34,430
Tangtang.
It's okay.

3490
02:05:34,430 --> 02:05:36,480
One hand brothers, one hand happiness.
Tangtang.

3491
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:38,400
Pangpang.
Grasping with both hands.

3492
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:39,640
Susu.
You get everything.

3493
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:40,400
Pangpang.
Yes.

3494
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,000
Susu.
Want both.

3495
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:58,160
Take a picture of them, shall we?
Tangtang.

3496
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:58,750
Pangpang.
Take it.

3497
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:04,400
Pangpang.
Really impressive.

3498
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:05,680
Tangtang.
Alright.

3499
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:06,520
Susu.
Zoom in.

3500
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:07,710
Can't see the faces, although,
Tangtang.

3501
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:10,110
Tangtang.
but it's quite special.

3502
02:06:14,750 --> 02:06:16,320
Tangtang.
So happy, they are.

3503
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:33,920
Pangpang.
I captured their happiness.

3504
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:41,040
Pangpang.
I see them approaching the 12 o'clock position.

3505
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:33,520
Let's go.
Pangpang.

3506
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:54,040
Huahua.
Are you feeling better now?

3507
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:55,920
Huahua.
Just look at the sunset outside.

3508
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:57,360
You can't see anything else.
Huahua.

3509
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,560
Huahua.
Yes, look outside.

3510
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:00,320
Huahua.
Right?

3511
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:00,920
Just look outside.
Huahua.

3512
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:01,680
Huahua.
You have no idea.

3513
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:02,750
what we're doing right now.
Huahua.

3514
02:08:02,750 --> 02:08:03,640
Huahua.
It's really beautiful.

3515
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:05,790
Then let me take a photo for you.
Terry.

3516
02:08:07,070 --> 02:08:08,190
Huahua.
Is that okay?

3517
02:08:08,990 --> 02:08:10,000
Let me try.
Terry.

3518
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:11,640
Terry.
Don't turn too much to the side.

3519
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:13,080
You're too sideways, come back a bit. That's it.
Terry.

3520
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:15,440
It's blocked by this.
Terry.

3521
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:23,200
Terry.
Turn your face back a little.

3522
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:24,350
Yes.
Terry.

3523
02:08:32,350 --> 02:08:34,080
Huahua.
Bo, I'll be grateful to you for life.

3524
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:35,230
Always here when you call.
Huahua.

3525
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:38,160
Terry.
It's nothing.

3526
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:42,480
Huahua.
It's good, Bo.

3527
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:43,550
Thank you.
Huahua.

3528
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:08,160
Huahua.
I can't imagine.

3529
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:09,950
We're at such a high altitude.
Huahua.

3530
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:11,440
Huahua.
taking this photo.

3531
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:12,280
Terry.
Help!

3532
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:13,240
Huahua.
Next time when someone asks.

3533
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:14,240
Look at this.
Huahua.

3534
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,150
Huahua.
You say I'm not afraid.

3535
02:09:17,150 --> 02:09:18,040
Terry.
I'm not afraid.

3536
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:21,280
Huahua.
Terry has always given me the impression.

3537
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:22,840
that he's not a proactive person.
Huahua.

3538
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:25,920
Huahua.
But I've really seen him take initiative.

3539
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:39,800
Huahua.
Willing to become butterflies with you.

3540
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:41,950
Huahua.
'Rain Butterfly.'

3541
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:42,880
There are fireworks over there.
Terry.

3542
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:44,800
Huahua.
Where?

3543
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:45,790
Huahua.
Yes.

3544
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:47,920
Terry.
Let's buy some fireworks to play with.

3545
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:48,560
Huahua.
Sure.

3546
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,200
That's probably their own, right?
Huahua.

3547
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:52,440
Terry.
I'll ask if we can buy some.

3548
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:53,790
Can you sell us some?
Terry.

3549
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,760
Terry.
Can we buy a bundle?

3550
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:57,280
Terry.
Is that okay?

3551
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:57,880
Huahua.
Is that enough?

3552
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:58,640
Thank you.
Huahua.

3553
02:09:58,640 --> 02:09:59,120
Terry.
Alright, I'll scan your code.

3554
02:09:59,120 --> 02:09:59,800
I'll light it for you.
Terry.

3555
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:00,600
Huahua.
I'm afraid it might spark on you.

3556
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:01,630
Terry.
I'll light it for you.

3557
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:06,110
Huahua.
You'd better follow me.

3558
02:10:06,110 --> 02:10:07,520
Can we do it together?
Huahua.

3559
02:10:07,870 --> 02:10:08,560
Huahua.
Sure.

3560
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:09,400
Come quickly.
Huahua.

3561
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:14,840
Huahua.
Why weren't we at the top just now?

3562
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:15,870
Say Happy New Year.
Huahua.

3563
02:10:15,870 --> 02:10:16,640
Terry.
Right.

3564
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:18,270
Huahua.
Wait for yours to light up, then we'll do it together.

3565
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:21,520
Huahua.
You should say Happy New Year.

3566
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,400
Ready, begin.
Huahua.

3567
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:24,760
Happy New Year!
Together.

3568
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:36,920
Terry.
Today, I'm setting off fireworks with Huahua.

3569
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:37,680
Actually,
Terry.

3570
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:39,760
Terry.
Terry wasn't originally in our itinerary.

3571
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:41,280
It's quite a pleasant surprise.
Terry.

3572
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,750
It feels quite blissful.
Terry.

3573
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,880
Thank you, Brother Bo.
Huahua.

3574
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:50,480
Huahua.
I'm so happy.

3575
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:52,400
Every time I see
Huahua.

3576
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,310
Huahua.
fireworks blooming in the sky,

3577
02:10:53,310 --> 02:10:54,480
I always feel very happy.
Huahua.

3578
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,120
Huahua.
Now it's my turn,

3579
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:57,680
I feel even happier.
Huahua.

3580
02:10:57,680 --> 02:10:58,360
Huahua.
Moreover,

3581
02:10:58,360 --> 02:11:01,040
this firework display is created for me.
Huahua.

3582
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:02,240
Huahua.
Even if it's small,

3583
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:04,190
that moment of light
Huahua.

3584
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:05,080
Huahua.
is radiating for me.

3585
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:06,360
It belongs to me.
Huahua.

3586
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:08,990
Huahua.
It's not just a lighter igniting a sparkler,

3587
02:11:08,990 --> 02:11:10,200
he ignited me.
Huahua.

3588
02:11:24,670 --> 02:11:26,560
It's over.
Terry.

3589
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:30,590
Let's go.
Pangpang.

3590
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:34,400
Susu.
Time to go home.

3591
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,440
Su Ziyi, where are you?
Tangtang.

3592
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:52,350
Su Su
Just put it here.

3593
02:11:52,350 --> 02:11:53,150
Okay.
Tang Tang

3594
02:11:58,720 --> 02:11:59,800
Thanks, bro.
Su Su

3595
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:03,390
Tang Tang
Where's the original video?

3596
02:12:03,390 --> 02:12:04,440
Can I take a look?
Tang Tang

3597
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:05,080
Su Su
No way.

3598
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,680
Tang Tang
Let me see.

3599
02:12:09,790 --> 02:12:11,480
Tang Tang
I should have used my own phone to film it.

3600
02:12:13,150 --> 02:12:14,640
then I could watch it myself.
Tang Tang

3601
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:17,360
Tang Tang
Come on, let me see it.

3602
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:19,360
Su Su
No.

3603
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:21,080
Tang Tang
Just a quick look.

3604
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:22,430
You're not going to send it to me anyway.
Tang Tang

3605
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,440
Su Su
No, I'm busy right now.

3606
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:26,080
You go ahead and take care of your own business first.
Su Su

3607
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,190
Su Su
Don't bother me for now.

3608
02:12:28,190 --> 02:12:28,800
Tang Tang
Alright.

3609
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:38,080
Haven't finished drinking yet.
Tang Tang

3610
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:41,360
Su Su
Can't drink anymore, it's too heavy.

3611
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,790
Tu Tu
Actually, I think today that

3612
02:13:37,790 --> 02:13:40,030
the osmanthus cake was quite delicious.
Tu Tu

3613
02:13:40,030 --> 02:13:40,760
It was sweet.
Tu Tu

3614
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,920
Tu Tu
You like your crispy pork the most, right?

3615
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:45,630
Xiaoling
Yes.

3616
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:47,710
Xiaoling
How did you know?

3617
02:13:47,710 --> 02:13:48,880
Tu Tu
I hope one day Xiaoling

3618
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,160
will be able to
Tu Tu

3619
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:51,120
Tu Tu
buy those clay figurines

3620
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:52,670
with her eyes closed.
Tu Tu

3621
02:13:52,670 --> 02:13:53,600
Xiaoling

3622
02:13:53,600 --> 02:13:54,520
Xinxin
I thought you were going to say

3623
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:55,520
I hope one day Xiaoling
Xinxin

3624
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:57,600
Xinxin
will like me as much as she likes crispy pork.

3625
02:13:57,600 --> 02:13:58,750
I was waiting for those words.
Xinxin

3626
02:13:58,750 --> 02:13:59,760
Xinxin
But you didn't say them.

3627
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:01,200
I'm wide awake now.
Xinxin

3628
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:03,360
Xinxin
Tu Tu, I've been following you all day, really.

3629
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:06,240
Xinxin is very disappointed in your performance.
Xiaoling

3630
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:07,800
Tu Tu
No, it's a very nice wish.

3631
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:10,910
We need to be more realistic, right, Xiaoling?
Tu Tu

3632
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:16,030
Xiaoling
At that time, I could actually understand

3633
02:14:16,030 --> 02:14:18,270
that he probably didn't want to pick up on this.
Xiaoling

3634
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:20,320
Xiaoling
I could feel that he was interested in me,

3635
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:21,680
but if I were to continue taking the initiative,
Xiaoling

3636
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:23,070
Xiaoling
I would feel

3637
02:14:23,070 --> 02:14:24,920
whether it's really worth it.
Xiaoling

3638
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:25,840
Xiaoling
Because I feel Tutu

3639
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:26,840
doesn't seem to be very proactive.
Xiaoling

3640
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:40,920
Tutu
The cat is back.

3641
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:42,480
Mimi is back.
Tutu

3642
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:43,920
It feels like it's been a long time since they've been back.
Tutu

3643
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:47,230
Xiaoling
My room,

3644
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:49,080
loves to stay in.
Xinxin,

3645
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:56,240
let's go. Those with smaller suitcases go first.
Terry,

3646
02:15:05,150 --> 02:15:07,160
Pangpang,
It feels like coming back to the cabin for the first time.

3647
02:15:07,160 --> 02:15:07,840
buddy,
Pangpang,

3648
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:09,880
let's go.
Huahua,

3649
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:14,080
Huahua
We're home.

3650
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:17,200
Huahua
Xiaoling

3651
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,080
Tangtang
buddy

3652
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:27,070
is a bit startled.
Tangtang

3653
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:29,600
Tutu
He indeed has that expression.

3654
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:30,800
Xiaoling,
Yes.

3655
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:31,840
you should see Harry.
Xiaoling,

3656
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:33,440
Xiaoling
But he's already taken it off now.

3657
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:34,680
He still had it (the hairstyle) this afternoon.
Xiaoling

3658
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:37,280
it's too stunning, to be honest.
Harry,

3659
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:38,840
Xinxin,
I dare not open my eyes.

3660
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:40,560
I hope it's just my imagination.
Xinxin,

3661
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:41,680
Tata,
What I sang was that

3662
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:43,680
so for now,
Tata,

3663
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:47,840
Xinxin,
I've closed my eyes temporarily.

3664
02:15:49,790 --> 02:15:51,600
Pangpang,
why didn't you let me join your group?

3665
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:52,030
Xinxin,
it's not like that.

3666
02:15:52,030 --> 02:15:53,150
if you had done that hairstyle,
Xinxin,

3667
02:15:53,150 --> 02:15:54,270
Xinxin,
I might laugh for a year.

3668
02:15:54,270 --> 02:15:55,040
you know what?
Xinxin,

3669
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:57,280
Xinxin,
I would immediately change my profile picture.

3670
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:01,440
Huahua
why is Tata sitting there today?

3671
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:02,590
what's wrong?
Tata,

3672
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:04,480
Huahua,
You've taken my seat.

3673
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:07,230
Tata,
come on,

3674
02:16:07,230 --> 02:16:07,960
let's switch.
Tata,

3675
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:09,400
Terry,
Switch.

3676
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:17,400
Xiaoling
let's quickly see Harry's hairstyle.

3677
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:19,320
Really.
Harry.

3678
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:21,150
I'm really laughing out loud.
Tata.

3679
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:24,440
Tata.
When you say it, I can't help but laugh again.

3680
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:28,080
Susu.
What is it?

3681
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:31,440
Tata.
He's keeping it for when he returns.

3682
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:32,990
Tata, I might not ride back in the same car with him.

3683
02:16:35,639 --> 02:16:36,920
Xiaoling.
I think if he has that hairstyle,

3684
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:38,270
he should be about the same height as Terry.
Xiaoling.

3685
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:41,559
I'm even a bit taller than him.
Harry.

3686
02:16:41,559 --> 02:16:42,200
Really?
Terry.

3687
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:42,879
Really.
Harry.

3688
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:30,240
Pangpang.
Why do your eyes look so dull?

3689
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:30,840
Tangtang.
They are bright.

3690
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:32,190
I call them bright and lively.
Tangtang.

3691
02:17:32,190 --> 02:17:33,040
Pangpang.
Bright and lively.

3692
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:33,920
Pangpang.

3693
02:17:50,719 --> 02:17:52,990
Susu, I was really happy to receive Tangtang's message.

3694
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:58,719
Susu.
It feels like it's because we really,

3695
02:17:58,719 --> 02:18:01,360
Susu, the second day in Tianjin, we became much closer.
Susu.

3696
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:02,590
Susu.
The feelings are heating up.

3697
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:05,120
And there were people who started dating back in 1999.
Susu.

3698
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,080
Susu.
What he wrote was very sincere.

3699
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:13,240
And he also remembered to say,
Susu.

3700
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:14,639
Susu.
that I like watching the sea.

3701
02:18:14,639 --> 02:18:16,400
Susu, I hope we can watch the sea together next time.

3702
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:22,000
Tangtang.
What I want to express is,

3703
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,719
Tangtang, I might have considered face and other factors before,

3704
02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:26,430
Tangtang.
but now I'm lowering my stance.

3705
02:18:26,430 --> 02:18:28,000
I'm like 'Bajie,' I'm going to pursue you.
Tangtang.

3706
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:32,639
Tangtang, what I want to tell her is just that.

3707
02:18:45,879 --> 02:18:48,670
Tangtang.
My feeling at that time was really good.

3708
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:51,760
And I'm also happy to be liked so much.
Tangtang.

3709
02:18:54,320 --> 02:18:56,000
Susu.
My message was given to Tangtang.

3710
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,120
Why did I send it like that?
Susu.

3711
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,000
Susu.
It's because of him.

3712
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,240
When he took pictures of me by the sea on the first day,
Susu.

3713
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:01,790
Susu.
and then he had a photo,

3714
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:03,389
Susu, it's also among those three photos of his.

3715
02:19:03,389 --> 02:19:04,920
Susu.
He said I look like a bun.

3716
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,080
He said my face is very round.
Susu.

3717
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,760
Susu.
Because I like round faces.

3718
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:09,200
It's round and quite cute.
Susu.

3719
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,520
Susu.
My dream is to be a,

3720
02:19:15,709 --> 02:19:17,760
Susu,
Susu, I also came across a saying before.

3721
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:18,639
which goes,
Susu,

3722
02:19:18,639 --> 02:19:21,719
Happiness is like a juicy little soup dumpling.
Susu,

3723
02:19:21,719 --> 02:19:22,680
Susu,
The feeling is

3724
02:19:22,680 --> 02:19:25,360
it also applies to how we feel now.
Susu,

3725
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:27,070
Susu,
It's a feeling of happiness.

3726
02:19:27,070 --> 02:19:28,600
there's also praise for him.
Susu,

3727
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:30,080
Susu,
He went on stage to perform that crosstalk,

3728
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:31,160
and then wrote lyrics for me.
Susu,

3729
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:32,799
Susu,
I'm also very grateful for his courage,

3730
02:19:32,799 --> 02:19:34,040
yes, his initiative.
Susu,

3731
02:19:46,110 --> 02:19:48,320
Harry,
The moment I received her text message,

3732
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:49,080
I was very happy.
Harry,

3733
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:50,800
Harry,
Because whether it's going to the museum,

3734
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:51,480
going to the folk museum,
Harry,

3735
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:52,720
Harry,
or seeing those little clay figurines,

3736
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:54,480
I feel that where we go isn't that important.
Harry,

3737
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:56,880
Harry,
But it's about who you go with.

3738
02:19:58,320 --> 02:19:59,720
Harry,
Including riding in the same car with Tata,

3739
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:00,520
or being in the same group,
Harry,

3740
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:01,840
everything is the best arrangement.
Harry,

3741
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:06,840
Tata,
The text message was still sent to Harry.

3742
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:08,080
Because actually,
Tata,

3743
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:09,560
Tata,
traveling really shows

3744
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:10,960
whether two people are compatible.
Tata,

3745
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:12,680
Tata,
And during this trip,

3746
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:14,480
I also felt that Harry
Tata,

3747
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:16,280
Tata,
was very caring towards me in many ways.

3748
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:18,000
And then for two days,
Tata,

3749
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,840
Tata,
our travel itinerary

3750
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,760
was also together.
Tata,

3751
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:21,920
Tata,
So basically for two days,

3752
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:23,080
it felt like 48 hours
Tata,

3753
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:24,680
Tata,
we were really together all the time.

3754
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:26,480
we really became closer.
Tata,

3755
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:28,280
And we also got to know each other better.
Tata,

3756
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:52,120
what's wrong?
Harry,

3757
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:53,280
Tata,
I don't know, it's nothing.

3758
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:55,640
Harry,
I know Tata today

3759
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:56,640
was especially happy to receive the text message.
Harry,

3760
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:58,120
Harry,
The first thing I said was,

3761
02:20:58,120 --> 02:20:59,720
Our relationship is warming up,
Harry,

3762
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:01,560
Harry,
and it's warming up very noticeably.

3763
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:04,080
Whether she's becoming more dependent on me,
Harry,

3764
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,560
Harry,
or needing me more,

3765
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:06,480
or coming to find me,
Harry,

3766
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:08,520
Harry,
anyway, we'll need each other more.

3767
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:09,280
So I think
Harry,

3768
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:11,880
Harry,
the extent and degree of this warming up

3769
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:13,760
is also very stable.
Harry,

3770
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:17,160
Tata.
He also mentioned it in the text message tonight.

3771
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:19,320
He said he feels needed.
Tata.

3772
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:21,080
Tata.
Actually, he complained about this today.

3773
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:23,480
He said I dump all my trash on him.
Tata.

3774
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:24,800
Are you holding it?
Harry.

3775
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:25,520
Put it over there.
Tata.

3776
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:28,320
Am I your 'slave'?
Harry.

3777
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:31,400
Tata.
You're so annoying.

3778
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:32,960
I.
Harry.

3779
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:34,120
Harry.
Why?

3780
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:34,800
Tata.
I asked you to take something.

3781
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,040
You said you're my 'slave'.
Tata.

3782
02:21:36,040 --> 02:21:37,320
Harry.
I said from today on,

3783
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:38,400
you give me everything.
Harry.

3784
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:39,640
Harry.
Whether it's useful or not,

3785
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:40,240
you give it all to me.
Harry.

3786
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:41,200
Tata.
I won't give it to you anymore.

3787
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:41,720
Harry.

3788
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:42,560
Tata.
Not giving it.

3789
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:42,840
Harry.

3790
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:43,480
I'll give it to Terry.
Tata.

3791
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:44,720
Harry.
You go give it.

3792
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:45,840
Give it.
Harry.

3793
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:47,640
Give it.
Harry.

3794
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:51,320
Tata.
I was really upset at the time.

3795
02:21:51,320 --> 02:21:52,520
What's wrong?
Tata.

3796
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:54,680
Tata.
Can't he help me throw it away after I give it to him?

3797
02:21:54,680 --> 02:21:57,280
I was a little angry at the time.
Tata.

3798
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:58,920
Tata.
But he mentioned it again in the text message tonight.

3799
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,600
Feeling needed like this.
Tata.

3800
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:01,240
Tata.
He really is a

3801
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:02,800
very contradictory man.
Tata.

3802
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:05,040
Tata.
These very detailed things,

3803
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:06,320
I feel very happy.
Tata.

3804
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:09,240
Tata.
It feels like he really cares about my feelings.

3805
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:11,080
When chatting with me offline,
Tata.

3806
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:12,840
Tata.
I find him quite mature and steady.

3807
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:14,000
Then in the text message,
Tata.

3808
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,200
Tata.
he shared some of his inner thoughts.

3809
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:17,960
Some things he doesn't dare to express.
Tata.

3810
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:18,760
Tata.
I then feel that he,

3811
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:20,800
is still a child at heart.
Tata.

3812
02:22:21,360 --> 02:22:22,560
Harry.
Do you think I wrote a lot?

3813
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:23,480
Actually, it's not long.
Harry.

3814
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:25,520
Tata.
It's well-written.

3815
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:26,880
It's written with care.
Tata.

3816
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:28,080
Tata.
Reading it makes me happy.

3817
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:05,080
Tutu.
When sending the heartfelt message tonight,

3818
02:23:05,080 --> 02:23:07,360
I wrote a sentence in Tianjin dialect,
Tutu.

3819
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:08,760
Tutu.
complimenting her as 'zhen nai yin' (really charming).

3820
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:10,920
Then I kept waiting for her reaction,
Tutu.

3821
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:12,600
Tutu.
just waiting for that message to pop up.

3822
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:14,240
Sure enough, she saw that message,
Tutu.

3823
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:16,200
Tutu.
and we exchanged a smile.

3824
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:17,440
We even laughed out loud at that moment.
Tutu.

3825
02:23:21,640 --> 02:23:23,640
It's a very good way of interacting.
Tutu.

3826
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,480
Xiaoling.
Today I received a heartfelt message,

3827
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:27,400
It was from Tutu.
Xiaoling.

3828
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:28,960
Xiaoling.
The content he sent me was,

3829
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:30,360
'Had a great time together today.'
Xiaoling.

3830
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:33,480
Xiaoling.
Xiaoling, maybe because when I was interacting with him,

3831
02:23:33,480 --> 02:23:34,400
there might have been some new things,
Xiaoling.

3832
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:35,840
so I also brought out
Xiaoling.

3833
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:36,600
Xiaoling.
more of my own personality.

3834
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:37,160
He would say,
Xiaoling.

3835
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:39,000
Xiaoling.
'Today, our interaction was especially like'

3836
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,240
'elementary and middle school students,'
Xiaoling.

3837
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:41,280
Xiaoling.
'that kind of atmosphere from before.'

3838
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:42,760
It was playful and very happy,
Xiaoling.

3839
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:44,520
Xiaoling.
very relaxed and enjoyable.

3840
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:45,920
Actually, I have the same feeling.
Xiaoling.

3841
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:47,400
Xiaoling.
Because normally I probably wouldn't say,

3842
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:48,080
pointing to a place and saying,
Xiaoling.

3843
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:49,320
Xiaoling.
'Go imitate his actions.'

3844
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:50,840
This kind of behavior wouldn't happen.
Xiaoling.

3845
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:53,840
Then he said this trip felt especially good.
Xiaoling.

3846
02:24:14,480 --> 02:24:15,280
Xiaoling.
After returning to the cabin,

3847
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:17,400
the first thing we did was play ball,
Xiaoling.

3848
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:19,440
Xiaoling.
but he lost to me.

3849
02:24:24,680 --> 02:24:26,160
I can't believe I lost.
Tutu.

3850
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:28,280
Xiaoling.
I had never been able to beat him before,

3851
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:29,400
but this time I won against him.
Xiaoling.

3852
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:54,360
Huahua.
It's Terry.

3853
02:24:58,600 --> 02:25:00,200
Huahua.
asked smugly,

3854
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:00,880
'How was it?'
Huahua.

3855
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:03,160
Huahua.
'The Ferris wheel and fireworks were romantic, right?'

3856
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:03,960
Indeed, they were.
Huahua.

3857
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:15,360
Terry.
Terry, today I sent my heartfelt message to Huahua,

3858
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:17,480
and it was to express
Terry.

3859
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:19,880
this two-day, one-night trip to Tianjin.
Terry.

3860
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:21,880
Terry.
The Ferris wheel and fireworks,

3861
02:25:21,880 --> 02:25:22,760
I really feel
Terry.

3862
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:25,240
Terry.
setting them off together, riding together,

3863
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:26,040
was very enjoyable.
Terry.

3864
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:27,880
Terry.
I feel our relationship

3865
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:29,760
is just getting better and better.
Terry.

3866
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:47,480
Huahua.
There's another one from Pangpang.

3867
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:48,680
He was very sincere.
Huahua.

3868
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:50,960
Huahua.
He said he wanted me to see more clearly.

3869
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:52,200
to understand the relationship between us.
Huahua.

3870
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:53,600
Huahua.
I think he should

3871
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,600
have realized that we might
Huahua.

3872
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:56,920
Huahua.
both be

3873
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:59,000
better off being just friends.
Huahua.

3874
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:05,400
Pangpang,
I said,

3875
02:26:05,400 --> 02:26:07,040
after our communication and understanding these two days,
Pangpang,

3876
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:08,320
Pangpang.
I have confirmed our relationship.

3877
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:10,040
Because I took them to the Ferris wheel today.
Pangpang.

3878
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:12,040
Pangpang.
Including when they came back from the Ferris wheel,

3879
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:13,160
I didn't even talk to her.
Pangpang.

3880
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:17,200
Pangpang.
She and Terry have already

3881
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:18,320
had an increase in temperature.
Pangpang.

3882
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:19,240
Pangpang.
She knows

3883
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:21,720
I'm talking about our friendship.
Pangpang.

3884
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:45,040
Huahua, today's heartfelt message is undoubtedly

3885
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:45,760
Huahua.
definitely from Terry.

3886
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:47,160
Terry has been by my side all day.
Huahua.

3887
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:50,040
Huahua.
Including the fireworks I mentioned,

3888
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:51,760
and the Ferris wheel mentioned in the letter.
Huahua.

3889
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:53,160
He was there for all of it.
Huahua.

3890
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,760
Huahua.
Before, I might have felt about Terry

3891
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:58,040
that I would think he
Huahua.

3892
02:26:58,040 --> 02:26:59,240
Huahua.
in an equal relationship,

3893
02:26:59,240 --> 02:27:00,760
might have a little bit of affection,
Huahua.

3894
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:03,040
Huahua.
but not enough to make my heart flutter.

3895
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,400
But these two days, I feel that maybe
Huahua.

3896
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:05,600
Huahua.
Terry's initiative

3897
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:09,120
Huahua, makes me feel like I can have that heart-fluttering feeling.

3898
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:10,520
Huahua.
Because I've never ridden it,

3899
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:12,000
I really wanted to ride it.
Huahua.

3900
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:12,520
Really?
Terry.

3901
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:14,160
Huahua.
Yes, I'm grateful for your company.

3902
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:17,600
Huahua.
Bro, I'll be grateful to you for life.

3903
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:18,920
Always there when called.
Huahua.

3904
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:21,720
Happy New Year.
Together.

3905
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:24,480
Huahua.
The moment the fireworks were lit,

3906
02:27:24,480 --> 02:27:26,200
must have ignited my
Huahua.

3907
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:28,120
Huahua.
I really saw his initiative.

3908
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:29,400
Overturning my previous statements.
Huahua.

3909
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:31,400
Huahua, I think he actually has a good sense of ceremony.

3910
02:27:56,680 --> 02:27:58,160
Tutu,
I think currently my sibling,

3911
02:27:58,160 --> 02:27:59,880
should be more interested in Terry.
Tutu,

3912
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:02,880
Tutu.
Because from her daily words and actions,

3913
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:05,480
She just cares more about Terry.
Tutu.

3914
02:28:18,760 --> 02:28:20,720
Xinxin
My siblings didn't receive the heartfelt message.

3915
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:22,080
But for Pangpang,
Xinxin

3916
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:23,280
Xinxin
I think his breakthrough is quite significant.

3917
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:24,960
because he is working hard to
Xinxin

3918
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:26,560
Xinxin
fight for his own feelings.

3919
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:27,400
In my eyes,
Xinxin

3920
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:29,360
Xinxin
he is quite rational about emotions.

3921
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:31,520
There aren't many moments of entanglement.
Xinxin

3922
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:32,800
Xinxin
And I think he has always

3923
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:34,240
been able to handle things well.
Xinxin

3924
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:41,280
Pangpang, I think Xinxin might have let go today.

3925
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:42,240
Pangpang,
Feeling great.

3926
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,360
So Xinxin won't put herself
Pangpang,

3927
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:46,640
Pangpang,
in the shadow of zero votes.

3928
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:52,280
Pangpang,
You can go up and speak today.

3929
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:53,760
I think it has already surpassed my expectations of you.
Pangpang,

3930
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:54,400
Huahua,
Really.

3931
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:55,840
You were shining at that moment.
Huahua,

3932
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:59,520
Xiaoling,
The shy little boy went on stage.

3933
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:01,520
Who did you go on stage for?
Xiaoling,

3934
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:09,640
What task?

3935
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:10,600
The confession is coming.

3936
02:29:10,600 --> 02:29:11,760
For boys and girls,

3937
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:13,480
prepared different heartfelt parties.

3938
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:17,200
Let's go swimming.

3939
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:18,160
Soak in this.

3940
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:23,320
Do you accept siblings

3941
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:24,760
who are interacting with the opposite sex?

3942
02:29:24,760 --> 02:29:25,480
I don't accept it.

3943
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:27,640
I even feel a bit unworthy.

3944
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:28,880
Does Xiaoling know

3945
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:31,280
she is your second choice for a date?

3946
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:32,360
So,

3947
02:29:32,360 --> 02:29:32,960
is he

3948
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:33,800
eliminated from your side

3949
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:34,680
and came to me?

3950
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:35,560
Okay, stop talking.

3951
02:29:35,960 --> 02:29:37,080
The opposite sex you are interacting with,

3952
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:37,840
did they break

3953
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:38,800
your previous ideal type?

3954
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:40,160
Who in the cabin was once

3955
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:41,160
your competitor?

3956
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:43,560
The person you are interacting with,

3957
02:29:43,560 --> 02:29:44,720
is it because you genuinely like them

3958
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:45,960
or just want to find a partner?

3959
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:47,320
So scary.

3960
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:48,320
How come

3961
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:50,000
you're not satisfied with this result now?

3962
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,840
I think I said something wrong.

3963
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:56,640
So sharp.
