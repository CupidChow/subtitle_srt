1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,120
Say it.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,960
I don't know. I feel stressed after talking to you.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,120
Should I pressure you or myself?

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,040
You pressure me?

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,080
What pressure?

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,240
A lot.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,760
I can be serious with you

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,640
to talk about this.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,280
Why do you think I put pressure on you?

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
I'm scared.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,800
Don't be afraid.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,480
Go ahead.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,280
About Susu's question,

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,840
about the long-distance question.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,440
She said whether I want to see her or not,

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,680
How to balance

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,880
how to make you feel safe.

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,680
Is it you or her?

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,120
I really want to ask this question.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,560
I don't want to ask you these questions

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,360
in front of so many people.

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,720
I think many questions

23
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,120
Because I'm a girl.

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,000
I think this question is very cold.

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,560
Very cold.

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,440
I didn't expect Susu to ask me that.

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,640
I think

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,760
there's no warmth

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,800
and emotions.

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,120
I don't know Susu.

31
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,080
or you.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,640
What did you say before?

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,720
Love comes first

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,600
and 10,000 percent.

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,120
and your answers today

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,120
I think it doesn't match.

37
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Then you said I can't focus on my career.

38
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,920
But your answer is...

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,720
You said

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,000
you would come to me without my sister and family knowing.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,920
and not affect your study.

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,240
Actually,

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,600
your study and family

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,759
and family.

45
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,080
Actually, the question my sister asked...

46
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,200
listen to her tone.

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,759
is under the premise

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,160
to have this relationship

49
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,280
to have this relationship.

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,440
But

51
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,039
I'm a person who will affect my study.

52
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,640
Dating?

53
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,440
Of course, I didn't mean

54
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,400
to affect your study.

55
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm just saying my own doubts.

56
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,280
I think you would

57
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
too full.

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,680
I'm quite full.

59
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:09,960
I think

60
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,400
you're too confident.

61
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,120
Because I think

62
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,200
I will only

63
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,600
what I can do

64
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,720
I can do.

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,880
I can't do it. I won't mention it at all.

66
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
Tonight, when you answer those questions

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
in front of everyone,

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
I thought you didn't like me.

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,240
You're just answering questions.

70
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,720
There's no emotion or emotion.

71
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,400
I didn't expect this segment to be so big.

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,840
This is normal love.

73
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,480
Not every time.

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,000
The next day.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,960
The last day.

76
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,840
(Confession Day)

77
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,280
The Forest of Fantasy Meeting

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
Starry Sky Ball.

79
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
Colorful Space.

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
Rose Room.

81
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,160
To happiness

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,400
The sun

83
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,040
It's so eye-catching.

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,560
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

85
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,159
Do you want to take a look?

86
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,720
I wrote for you.

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,280
I want...

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,080
The brothers' diary.

89
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,960
I got zero votes.

90
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,480
No one chose your sister.

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,360
I miss your sister. I'm so sad.

92
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,200
Okay, stop reading.

93
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,080
Okay, stop reading.

94
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,040
She chose someone else today.

95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
I don't know what to say.

96
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,960
I wish I could talk to you.

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,560
I just printed the score.

98
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,800
I haven't had time to learn.

99
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,320
My Tears Smashed.

100
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,520
The name of this song

101
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,080
suits me well.

102
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,040
Okay.

103
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,200
What's wrong?

104
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,800
Look.

105
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,040
The soup will

106
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,400
Come and hug her

107
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,200
It's okay.

108
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,200
Don't cry.

109
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,280
Am I right?

110
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm not crying because of the map.

111
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,240
Then what is it?

112
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,960
Because of what you said.

113
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,680
What?

114
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
Tell me.

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
I said you've started to talk to me.

116
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
Isn't that good?

117
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,240
In the past,

118
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,480
You didn't tell me.

119
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,840
Yes, so I...

120
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,040
I think Xiaoling and soup

121
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,080
are taking a big step

122
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,640
a big step towards the show.

123
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,080
and made a lot of progress.

124
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,360
So, between Tom and me

125
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,520
Tom and I

126
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,440
between Tom and me.

127
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,560
It has indeed changed.

128
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,760
Our relationship

129
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,960
better than before.

130
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,640
You're under too much pressure.

131
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,080
Time for the brothers' diary.

132
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,560
The brothers' diary exchange time.

133
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:58,960
I really think

134
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,840
you don't understand my brother diary.

135
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,680
My notes are too...

136
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,120
It's okay.

137
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,560
I was rash.

138
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
You can understand me.

139
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,440
I'm nervous.

140
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,960
What?

141
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,040
All in English.

142
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,960
I don't care about you.

143
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,320
What is this?

144
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,720
I'm speechless.

145
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,240
What do these two circles mean?

146
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,040
My autograph.

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,560
He even signed.

148
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,360
What is this?

149
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,240
You have to figure it out now.

150
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,280
Let me see.

151
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,840
Whatever.

152
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,320
Next page.

153
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,640
There are more.

154
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,560
I want to tear it off.

155
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,560
Today

156
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,360
the surname.

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,520
Girls.

158
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,840
surname

159
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,720
Girls.

160
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,520
My last name is...

161
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,120
Can you please let me go?

162
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,280
When we were talking,

163
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,560
I think Tata is also

164
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
Confirm you.

165
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,159
It's really not me.

166
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,320
Just take a look.

167
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,080
Horn stone.

168
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,640
Seriously.

169
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,360
A stone corner.

170
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,600
Look at this.

171
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Horn stone.

172
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,400
I think your handwriting is what I wrote

173
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
after ten years.

174
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
or I'll be separated.

175
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,160
Or we'll be close.

176
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,000
Your handwriting is...

177
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,720
an artist.

178
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,440
I believe I'm a very good girl.

179
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,480
And

180
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,080
I know

181
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,360
no one can compare with you.

182
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,200
What about the tower?

183
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,000
She didn't come at that time.

184
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
What happened after she came?

185
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,720
What about after that?

186
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,040
are not on the same level.

187
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
love and friendship.

188
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,520
No.

189
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,760
Who is your friend?

190
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,160
You can tell love from family.

191
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,640
Who is prettier?

192
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,400
Why don't you tell me?

193
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,760
Tell me.

194
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,200
who is prettier?

195
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,960
Both of you are pretty.

196
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,880
No, you have to choose one.

197
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,840
If it's about my aesthetics

198
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,960
or my previous aesthetics,

199
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,320
It's not the present.

200
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
Who is prettier?

201
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,560
Only Chaoy and Tata.

202
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,360
No or

203
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,320
Wait.

204
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
If she accepts it today,

205
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,960
No.

206
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,600
Don't talk.

207
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,440
She'll look better if she accepts my confession.

208
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,680
You're better if she doesn't.

209
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,240
You're the prettiest.

210
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,160
She accepted the confession

211
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,800
It means she will be prettier than me in the future.

212
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,120
You think I'm not as pretty as her?

213
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,960
Only today.

214
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,040
She's prettier than me today.

215
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,760
Today is her shining point.

216
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,480
What about tomorrow?

217
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,960
You'll look better tomorrow.

218
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,720
Okay, okay.

219
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,960
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

220
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
It's okay.

221
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,640
Take a look.

222
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,960
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

223
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,600
You didn't even talk to me.

224
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Isn't it a brother diary?

225
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,560
You didn't even tell me.

226
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,280
Central AC, you...

227
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,920
I have the lifeline of food.

228
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,560
Yes.

229
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,600
I don't know why.

230
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,160
I hope I have some connection with the soup.

231
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,200
Since the first day

232
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,080
you two did the dishes together.

233
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,280
I think you two look good together.

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,120
You scared me.

235
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,320
Coming.

236
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
The most dramatic scene.

237
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,160
I cried a lot today.

238
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,800
Because with you

239
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,400
This is the first time

240
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
since I was a kid.

241
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,760
Yes.

242
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,920
Because it's not important,

243
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,360
So you don't care, right?

244
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,080
I don't care about you.

245
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,720
That's why you think it doesn't matter.

246
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,600
Time exchange for brothers' diaries.

247
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,400
I'm sorry.

248
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm sorry.

249
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,560
I don't mean to blame you.

250
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,400
I'll give you another chance.

251
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Will you speak for me?

252
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,840
Of course.

253
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,160
I was a little homesick and cried.

254
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,240
That day,

255
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,920
I cried because of the videotape.

256
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,480
My dad's face

257
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,920
That voice

258
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,000
unfamiliar and familiar.

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,840
I didn't expect

260
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,120
to see my dad so lively.

261
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,320
I was really upset that day.

262
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,240
In the video,

263
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
in the video.

264
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,520
I thought

265
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,080
Why didn't you call me daughter?

266
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,520
It's more painful at this hour.

267
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,240
Did you all see him for the last time?

268
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,000
I didn't.

269
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,480
I was there too.

270
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,640
When I was going in,

271
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
he said he would stop me outside.

272
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,200
He doesn't want me to see

273
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
to see him like that.

274
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,160
I think I'm small.

275
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,320
Maybe this is mine too.

276
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,280
One.

277
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,080
regret.

278
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:54,920
No.

279
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,560
It's okay.

280
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,960
Hold it.

281
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,440
Okay.

282
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
He will be happy

283
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,560
he'll be happy.

284
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,080
Yes.

285
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,400
Time for the brothers' diary.

286
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,800
The brothers' diary exchange time.

287
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,400
Let's do it.

288
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,040
Let's switch.

289
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,960
I'm nervous.

290
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm afraid I'll cry when I open the first page.

291
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
I saw my sister cooking.

292
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,600
Really surprised

293
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,640
Surprised?

294
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,720
Fatty mustered up the courage to choose Xiaoling.

295
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,920
You asked me to give Hua a glass tonight.

296
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,280
I think you're struggling.

297
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,080
Do I know you well?

298
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,600
Yes.

299
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,720
A few words include my day.

300
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,160
Your day starts from

301
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,040
I feel sorry for Hua.

302
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
Take it.

303
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,720
You're really eating my gossip every day.

304
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,320
Yes.

305
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,840
I haven't seen you so happy for a long time.

306
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,280
Maybe today's girls' party

307
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,600
without boys’ interference.

308
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,680
I know you, right?

309
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,440
Yes.

310
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,480
I was really happy that day.

311
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,240
I saw flowers with my sister today.

312
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,880
Looking at her

313
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
I had a date, but I didn't want to be hurt.

314
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,000
At that moment, I really thought

315
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,360
my sister was very considerate of me.

316
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,640
Okay.

317
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,680
You like a girl.

318
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,560
I also hope that

319
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,920
can really like you.

320
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,720
Don't make me cry too.

321
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,000
Reading sister's letter

322
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,360
made me cry.

323
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,080
You said, "Hold hands with big hands."

324
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,960
and walk together.

325
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,480
You know how hard it is to be an elder brother.

326
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,360
I'm at the final stage.

327
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,720
I have a lot to say.

328
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,360
and I'm afraid to break it.

329
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,640
I thought I was a person with high tears.

330
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,960
I'm just strong on the outside.

331
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,880
I love everyone.

332
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,360
and I don't want to leave you.

333
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,960
I'm afraid I can't see the picture when I get up.

334
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,000
The loneliness of eating alone at home.

335
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,680
Sometimes I feel

336
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,560
it's not impossible

337
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,800
It's not impossible.

338
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,160
For this encounter

339
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,400
I can only describe myself

340
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,440
I can understand myself better.

341
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,200
and my sister.

342
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,960
We're going to be apart.

343
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,040
It's so warm to see them like this.

344
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,520
Although they don't love each other now,

345
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,320
but they are very affectionate.

346
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,640
Is Yuan Bo still alone?

347
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
Is she really not coming?

348
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,480
I like his sister.

349
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,200
Why are you here?

350
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,320
Come here.

351
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,120
Sister.

352
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
Hello, I'm the financial man of Lu Jiazhai.

353
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,440
"Lu Jiazhai financial man".

354
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,080
Long time no see.

355
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,480
How have you been?

356
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,360
I'm doing well.

357
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,880
Why are you so sad?

358
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,000
Why? Did you get rejected?

359
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,680
I like his sister so much.

360
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,000
I knew it.

361
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,760
Why don't you read my Diary first?

362
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,400
How have you been?

363
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,240
You caught a cold when you came.

364
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm fine.

365
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,560
It's done later.

366
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,480
Did you meet any buddies that you get along with?

367
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,080
Which one does Xiaoling flower like the most?

368
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,120
What about her?

369
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,440
There's nothing between you two.

370
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,560
I think these are all worth learning.

371
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,600
So what did you learn

372
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,360
from them?

373
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,720
I don't think

374
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,600
are not as good

375
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,960
to express their love to each other.

376
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,440
You can't be too cheesy usually.

377
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,480
Usually

378
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,200
he wants to say something to you.

379
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,080
I think it's good.

380
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,360
Everyone has their own way.

381
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,200
Will they cry again, Yuan Bo?

382
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,880
You're ridiculous.

383
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,800
I didn't cry.

384
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm a water constellation. I didn't cry.

385
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,720
What's wrong with you?

386
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,280
I don't know.

387
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,280
I didn't bring tissues.

388
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,920
I cried when talking about other siblings in the house.

389
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,480
Because I feel my sister

390
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,640
jealous of the way other brothers get along.

391
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,320
Maybe she wants to express her love for me

392
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,680
she still wants to care about me.

393
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,360
But she's stubborn.

394
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,800
I couldn't say it.

395
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,480
I felt so bad for her.

396
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:57,480
(Diaries for Siblings)

397
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,840
To the soup.

398
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,800
Coming, To Su Zihao.

399
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,720
I have news.

400
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,560
To Yuan Bo

401
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,200
To He Wenjie.

402
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,760
Your confession time has begun.

403
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,360
Please choose the girl you want to confess to

404
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,480
and run towards her.

405
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,000
I know you will succeed.

406
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Okay.

407
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,360
Let's go.

408
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,720
Come on.

409
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Okay, wait for me.

410
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,160
Come on.

411
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Come on.

412
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,440
Fatty.

413
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,000
Wait for me.

414
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,640
Run to see her.

415
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,120
Cool.

416
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,800
The confession day is coming.

417
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,200
In each episode,

418
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,680
we will decide the content

419
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,040
based on the content of the show.

420
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
What we want to speculate in this episode is

421
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,760
which boys can confess their love successfully.

422
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,800
For this individual battle,

423
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,320
To make the guess more exciting,

424
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
to give a chance to turn the tide

425
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,440
to turn the tide.

426
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,839
So if you get all right this time,

427
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,960
you will get

428
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,880
the number of Wild Crest of Guoli.

429
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,400
is not one, but four.

430
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,520
It's because

431
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,680
The Wild Crest of Guoli.

432
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,079
The maximum difference

433
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,160
is exactly four.

434
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,880
So the last place has a chance to turn the table.

435
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,119
Are you confident?

436
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,640
No.

437
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:27,440
I made it.

438
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,160
Finally got the Wild Crest of Guoli.

439
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,240
the most guests

440
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,880
will receive a mysterious award

441
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,040
by Guoli.

442
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,480
Now we're going to

443
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,560
of "Love Sisters".

444
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,680
You only write boys' names?

445
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,080
Because only boys confess their love.

446
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,480
Yes.

447
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
One more or less is not right, right?

448
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,600
One more or one less is wrong.

449
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,840
This is so hard.

450
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,600
Let's show our answers together.

451
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,760
It's really different.

452
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,480
Our answers are different.

453
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,200
Both are different.

454
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,960
There are four of them.

455
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,080
All except chubby.

456
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,680
It feels so cruel.

457
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,040
Excited hands trembling

458
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,400
Dear family members of love

459
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,600
Are you confident?

460
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Signation.
Yes.

461
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,120
Now let's go to

462
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,800
a party with wild wine.

463
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,640
It's a moment to reveal the truth.

464
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,960
Will you support me

465
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,040
will you support me?

466
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,640
One more time.

467
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,960
So you're going to confess your love.

468
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,760
What do you think?

469
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,720
I came here

470
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,040
do you think I should finish this?

471
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,520
to make a good ending?

472
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,000
Does Fatty have any confession?

473
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,280
I'm fine with anything.

474
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,080
Because I think

475
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,360
is also an end for yourself.

476
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,960
Have you decided what to say?

477
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,120
Don't break your tongue later.

478
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
I've made up my mind.

479
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,200
No.

480
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,680
Sit there and don't shake.

481
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,280
Let's say

482
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,360
lose decently.

483
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,480
I won't lose.

484
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,080
I'll win.

485
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,760
What?

486
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,320
Really?

487
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,040
Yes.

488
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,400
Congratulations, Wen Jie.

489
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,040
Your confession time has begun.

490
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,600
Please choose the girl you like

491
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,080
and run towards her.

492
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,440
Have you decided where to go?

493
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,080
I have.

494
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,680
I'll go then.

495
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,720
Come on.

496
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,360
Fatty.

497
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,440
Wait for me.

498
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,680
Bye.

499
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,200
Without your confirmation,

500
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,320
you would confess to a girl.

501
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,120
Come here.

502
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,240
Not in the past

503
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,560
I came here.

504
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,400
You'll definitely confess to a girl.

505
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,840
Not here.

506
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,680
I think

507
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,520
I don't want to have regrets in my life.

508
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,680
Don't care about the result.

509
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,200
And he looks much thinner.

510
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,400
Don't leave any regrets in life.

511
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:13,800
Go.

512
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,280
Charge!

513
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,320
Do whatever you want.

514
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes.

515
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,840
Coming.

516
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,640
Hello.

517
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,440
You're here.

518
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,120
It's better to come early.

519
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,680
You're here.

520
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,200
To Yuan Bo,

521
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,720
It's time for you to confess.

522
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,360
Please choose the girl you want to confess to

523
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,400
and run towards her.

524
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,400
So you're going to confess now?

525
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,040
Yes, I'm going to confess now.

526
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,920
I'm leaving.

527
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,880
Good luck.

528
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,680
I hope you succeed.

529
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,800
Okay.

530
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,680
Go ahead. Bye.

531
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,880
I thought a lot last night.

532
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,440
I want to say

533
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,600
confess to Hua.

534
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,720
Go with Hua.

535
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,120
with Hua.

536
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,560
and express

537
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,880
my feelings.

538
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,720
The long legs run faster.

539
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,560
Hello.

540
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,000
You're here.

541
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,480
Come on.

542
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,640
Why did you give way to me?

543
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,080
Here you are. Please.

544
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,400
Here are your flowers.

545
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,120
Thank you.

546
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,400
You prepared so well.

547
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
So handsome today.

548
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,280
Are you surprised that I came?

549
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,560
It's expected.

550
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,080
They are still there.

551
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,240
(The girls witnessed their love)

552
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,440
with their siblings.

553
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,320
So the brothers will witness

554
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,600
this romantic confession moment.

555
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,320
This is a gift for you.

556
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,080
You didn't even ask what I bought for you.

557
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,160
Do I want to see it?

558
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,600
No.

559
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
I bought you the incense.

560
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,640
You know?

561
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,960
Yes.

562
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,840
And

563
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
I'm nervous even when I'm confessed.

564
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,960
Yes.

565
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,280
Why are you so nervous?

566
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,120
Today I feel

567
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,920
I'm a little nervous and anxious.

568
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,320
Don't be nervous. Come on.

569
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,000
Don't talk.

570
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,040
You're a stranger.

571
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,320
You're transparent.

572
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,160
Nervous. Help.

573
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
I think so too.

574
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm nervous.

575
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
I thought about a lot of things.

576
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,120
I wanted to tell her.

577
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,680
But the moment I saw her,

578
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,120
my mind went blank.

579
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,240
I really don't know what to say.

580
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
I wrote you a letter. Do you want to read it?

581
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,880
Really?

582
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Of course.

583
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,680
You slept last night.

584
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,880
I wrote it there.

585
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:50,760
Really?

586
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,960
I write until 5 a.m.

587
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,280
Girls can also confess their love.

588
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,120
This is great.

589
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
When you confess to me,

590
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
I'll also confess to you.

591
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,000
I'll go both ways.

592
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,040
This morning I found

593
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,760
I need to add something.

594
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,880
I added a lot

595
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,600
in the memo.

596
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
It was written in the car on the way here.

597
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
So many.

598
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,440
It's been a long time since you received a handwritten letter.

599
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,720
To make up for the regret last time

600
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,480
From the first date

601
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,440
Nervous and rushing

602
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,160
We have nothing to talk about.

603
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,560
I had so much fun.

604
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,480
with you.

605
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
Again?

606
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,120
Nervous and urgency.

607
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,160
I'm a little nervous now.

608
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm actually a little...

609
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,760
Today is a special day.

610
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,080
Right?

611
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,640
Which line is smiling?

612
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,560
Take a guess.

613
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,640
He said you were arrogant.

614
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,600
You said you took ugly photos of me.

615
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,320
I was really excited.

616
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,480
I think Hua has received

617
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,920
my thoughts.

618
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,640
Very tacit.

619
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,200
I think our relationship

620
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,120
is getting better.

621
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,440
I'm walking towards love.

622
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
I think I'll cry

623
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm going to cry too.

624
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,720
What should I do?

625
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,360
You'd better

626
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,680
I suddenly want to say three words.

627
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,000
I want to say three words.

628
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,920
Guess which three words?

629
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,840
When reading the letter,

630
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,200
Tae-seo was very touched.

631
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,480
I'm choking.

632
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,040
I think my sister

633
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,680
is also very touched.

634
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,760
and happy.

635
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,480
I hope Tae-seo can protect you.

636
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,680
When you see the person you love happy,

637
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,640
I'll be touched too

638
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,840
Why are you crying?

639
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,760
I don't know.

640
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,280
It's okay.

641
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,840
I'll go to Changsha to find her later.

642
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,840
Beautiful flowers.

643
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,720
Are you touched?

644
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,760
She's crying.

645
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,560
I'm not crying

646
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,120
Really.

647
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,840
I cried right away.

648
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,680
What's the score after reading this letter?

649
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,600
Almost nine points.

650
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,800
It's nine now.

651
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,560
Really?

652
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,640
Nine points.

653
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,080
He gave me 78 points before.

654
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,000
I was still unhappy.

655
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,520
Indeed.

656
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,560
Maybe my impression

657
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,120
is...

658
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,400
Yes.

659
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,040
Normally, I might be

660
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,720
I might...

661
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,600
I can't speak.

662
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,160
Please organize it.

663
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,480
I may need 200 or 300.

664
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,000
So I'm 90 now.

665
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,440
You need to reach 200 or 300.

666
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,920
No, 90 to 100.

667
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,040
Okay.

668
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,720
I brought you a gift too.

669
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,640
Really?

670
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,280
Did you take my ugly photo last time?

671
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,200
No.

672
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,080
Right?

673
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,560
When we were in the room,

674
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,080
in the room.

675
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,120
How did you lock your hand?

676
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,240
Am I like this?

677
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,360
Lock it like this.

678
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,280
Don't move like this.

679
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,600
Don't move.

680
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,840
I'll show you my gift.

681
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,240
Open this hand.

682
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,800
I know what you're doing.

683
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Hurry up?

684
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,920
The bracelet.

685
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,680
I don't think I can do this.

686
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,560
My hands are a little big.

687
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,800
Let go.

688
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,320
Let go.

689
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,840
A beautiful beginning.

690
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,760
Didn't you say you like crystals?

691
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,320
On the first day you came, you told me

692
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,640
I wanted to open a crystal shop.

693
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,720
What kind of crystal is it?

694
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,080
Yes.

695
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,960
I bought yellow crystal a while ago.

696
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,400
Guess

697
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,160
why I gave you this colour flower.

698
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Blue.

699
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,720
Does it have any meaning?

700
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,520
Let me give you a hint.

701
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,560
The previous date...

702
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,720
Blue.

703
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,280
Let me think.

704
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
I know blue.

705
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,320
The flower we made together

706
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,600
right?

707
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,240
You stick it here and I stick it here.

708
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,160
Okay.

709
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,000
Great.

710
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,640
OK?

711
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,160
So it's that one.

712
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,600
Yes.

713
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,280
The craftsmanship is blue and white.

714
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,440
It's pretty

715
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,240
I don't know

716
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,480
I don't know what flavor you like.

717
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,240
I bought a lot anyway.

718
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,280
I bought all the flavors.

719
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,040
I hope some people

720
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,960
think of me when you order.

721
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,120
Do I look good?

722
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,640
Yes

723
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,360
When I told Wang Jiyu in the car,

724
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,520
I said I bought a crystal for Bobo.

725
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:45,960
He said

726
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,040
Where is it?

727
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,720
I said I have it.

728
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,560
He said, "How do you give it to him?"

729
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,040
I said I was going to do this later.

730
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Then he said,

731
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,800
"You're so greasy."

732
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,600
He said

733
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,000
How could he say that about your sister?

734
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,120
You don't understand.

735
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,320
I don't understand

736
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,840
I don't understand.

737
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,760
That's too much.

738
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,640
Do you know what I thought

739
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,200
What are you doing?

740
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,880
What are you doing? I'm putting a ring on you.

741
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,400
Right?

742
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,600
I was scared to death.

743
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,920
I was also surprised just now.

744
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,720
In your dreams.

745
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,400
Wear a ring.

746
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,480
My hands are empty.

747
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,920
I'm a little disappointed.

748
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,520
No.

749
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,840
Which one do you want to wear?

750
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,800
No.

751
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,120
He was a little disappointed.

752
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,000
No.

753
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,240
My hands are a little empty.

754
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,560
No.

755
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,160
Since Tianjin,

756
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,120
I thought...

757
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,440
What?

758
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,720
I think Bobo is good.

759
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,840
Right?

760
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,160
I think each date

761
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,120
each date.

762
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,800
Because I thought a lot before.

763
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,360
I thought

764
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,840
if you really want to know me

765
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,600
or you're just playing hard to get.

766
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,880
Maybe

767
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,200
after Tianjin.

768
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,080
I'll open my heart to you.

769
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,600
Didn't you notice

770
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,320
I used to talk to you

771
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,680
when I talked to you.

772
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,240
Well...

773
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,920
Hello, Terri.

774
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,000
Now I'm Bobo.

775
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,560
So do you prefer to call you Terri

776
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,600
or Bo?

777
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,920
The latter.

778
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,400
Okay.

779
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,160
But in fact,

780
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,120
are mutual.

781
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,760
I think it's the same for me later.

782
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,560
Yes.

783
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,000
Right?

784
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,920
You're getting more and more impolite.

785
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,240
Yeah.

786
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,240
Good.

787
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,160
I don't like this either.

788
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,040
I think we should show the real you.

789
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,240
I just said in the letter that

790
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,400
more people will like it.

791
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,040
Why do you want more people to like you?

792
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,880
We don't include the opposite sex.

793
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,560
What are you thinking?

794
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,080
Okay.

795
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,400
I want to go.

796
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,040
Say something sweet.

797
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,360
Is this enough?

798
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,080
Do you have anything else to say to Hua?

799
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,840
It's been a long time since today.

800
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,280
since today.

801
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,480
This is a little different from

802
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,400
from the confession we expected.

803
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,440
I feel

804
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,720
in his heart.

805
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,120
Are you holding a big trick?

806
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,720
Are you done?

807
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,160
You can leave now.

808
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,160
Where should I go?

809
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,400
I'll give you one last minute.

810
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,480
to express your feelings.

811
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,080
He doesn't want to express.

812
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,720
Maybe.

813
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,240
What I want to say the most

814
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,320
is that

815
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,520
the life in the small house is over,

816
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,880
I think

817
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,400
just started.

818
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,240
What do you think?

819
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,280
I...

820
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,080
in the letter.

821
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,880
I think we are quite in sync.

822
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
I think so too.

823
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,440
your observation period

824
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,640
to be responsible for your relationship.

825
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,560
When are you coming to Changsha?

826
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,760
Anytime.

827
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,160
Okay.

828
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,800
Just leave.

829
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,360
Really.

830
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,640
No.

831
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,320
Let's celebrate the New Year.

832
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,440
Anytime after New Year.

833
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,080
Okay.

834
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,400
We may meet soon after Chinese New Year.

835
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,120
Maybe I'm coming to Shanghai.

836
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,200
I'll pick you up at the airport.

837
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,160
Okay.

838
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,320
After you come to Changsha,

839
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
let's go to Shanghai.

840
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,440
Sure.

841
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,800
I thought your sister would come today.

842
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,560
She's here

843
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Coming

844
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,280
Really?

845
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,680
I'm at a place ahead.

846
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,640
Wait over there.

847
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,200
Did you cry?

848
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,560
I thought you were coming.

849
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,640
You were waiting for me to confess.

850
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,000
No.

851
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,160
Don't you want to see my sister?

852
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,160
We can meet.

853
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
and see how good I am.

854
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,480
Put the letter away.

855
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,880
Come on.

856
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,480
Come on.

857
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,760
Give me a hug.

858
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,320
I want to see you kiss.

859
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,200
Or it doesn't count.

860
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,280
Can I hug you?

861
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,960
I'm generous.

862
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,560
I want to stand up and hug.

863
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,840
No, this kind of hug.

864
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,800
It seems to be a farewell.

865
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,720
A hug for everyone, right?

866
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,760
This is a farewell, not a confession.

867
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
I'll keep in touch with Hwa.

868
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,320
When the time is ripe,

869
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,680
I'll be with her.

870
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,400
I hope I can get closer to her.

871
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,320
Today's confession is

872
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,640
Follow your heart.

873
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,320
I think it's good.

874
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,000
He's very responsible for love.

875
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,960
After I met Tae-seo,

876
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,440
I found that

877
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,160
he is

878
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
a considerate man.

879
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,040
He really cares about my sister.

880
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,240
So I support him.

881
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,840
My sister is with Tae-seo.

882
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Hello, I'm Tae-seo.

883
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,000
Hwa.

884
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,800
Let's do it together.

885
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,520
Sure.

886
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,880
Thank you.

887
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,720
Don't slip.

888
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,240
Okay.

889
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,040
Which boy are you most interested in?

890
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,920
She smiles a lot when taking photos.

891
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,520
She looks really cute

892
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,000
She's really cute.

893
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,160
I had a great time with Tae-seo.

894
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,520
This is what I want.

895
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,320
Yinbo, I’m grateful to you all my life.

896
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,640
You’re always there.

897
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,800
The fireworks that someone created for me

898
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,120
is small,

899
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,080
the light at that moment

900
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,960
emitted to me.

901
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,440
It belongs to me.

902
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,800
I already like it.

903
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,080
Will he observe for that long?

904
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,720
Yes, I will.

905
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,080
Is this a talk?

906
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,040
Of course not.

907
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,160
No.

908
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,320
They want to get to know each other after the show.

909
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,360
Yeah, I think so too.

910
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,560
Actually, I think

911
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,600
a little like

912
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,120
a unsolved attitude.

913
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,240
So Hua and Terri

914
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,600
have reached a tacit understanding.

915
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,640
They decided to give each other

916
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,520
give each other

917
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,520
to each other.

918
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,800
Because they might fall in love with each other

919
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,920
and have gone through a lot.

920
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,200
Agreed.

921
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,920
Yes.

922
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,800
This might last longer.

923
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,720
We wish Hwa and Tae-seo

924
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,080
I hope one day

925
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,800
in love.

926
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,520
Take Love Sisters

927
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
as the starting point of their relationship.

928
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,800
Come on.

929
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,679
To the soup.

930
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,239
(It's time for you to confess.)

931
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,800
Please choose the girl you want to confess to

932
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,719
and run towards her.

933
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,960
A Su Ziyi is waiting for happiness.

934
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,719
OK.

935
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,000
You don't have to read the rest.

936
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,400
Go ahead.

937
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,159
Go.

938
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,360
Okay.

939
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,159
Let me finish watching the drama.

940
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,440
Trust the soup.

941
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,400
Believe in sugar.

942
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,320
I don't believe it won't succeed.

943
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,400
This will definitely succeed.

944
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,679
And he will have a sense of formality.

945
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,639
Yes.

946
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,520
I believe he will succeed.

947
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,760
Run when you meet him.

948
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,159
I like this girl very much.

949
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,840
I just want to fight for her.

950
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,560
regardless of the consequences.

951
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,719
Isn't this love?

952
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,840
Yes.

953
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,880
I just want to see her now.

954
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,440
I've learned how to express love.

955
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,280
I've been imagining

956
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,200
when they got married,

957
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,920
when they get married.

958
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,680
Give me a romantic ending.

959
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,880
Actually, Susu will be nervous.

960
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,000
Everyone is waiting.

961
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,160
Here he comes.

962
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,360
My prince is here

963
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,280
Hello.

964
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,880
What? An interviewer?

965
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,800
Sit here.

966
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,920
So formal.

967
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,520
Look, he will sit next to her.

968
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,240
Is he handsome?

969
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,800
Not bad.

970
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,320
Better than Su Zihao.

971
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,440
OK.

972
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,320
I've prepared a few things for you.

973
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,360
Let's start with the first one.

974
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,880
Okay.

975
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,040
Well,

976
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,040
is a video.

977
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,880
Put it here.

978
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,800
OK?

979
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,400
Sure.

980
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,240
Okay.

981
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,680
You're so nervous.

982
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,480
Don't be nervous.

983
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,080
Don't talk.

984
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,720
I won't talk. I'll shut up.

985
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,600
On the first snowfall,

986
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,160
It's so dramatic.

987
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,160
This is the right face.

988
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,720
The right face is pretty too.

989
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,800
These fragments...

990
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,680
these fragments.

991
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,400
To be honest,

992
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,600
every time you lean on me,

993
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm happy.

994
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,680
Where did you get the video?

995
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,280
What?

996
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,560
I have a lot of help.

997
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,600
The video was quite touching.

998
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,680
Because many of them are his

999
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,520
recorded my photos and videos.

1000
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,320
I feel sincerity and sincerity.

1001
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,360
In the ledger,

1002
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,920
Let's use photos to refine our memories.

1003
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,320
Come on. I'm looking forward to it.

1004
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,960
You're looking forward to it.

1005
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,360
I'll look for it.

1006
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,160
I'm looking forward to it.

1007
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,200
Don't be nervous.

1008
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,200
This one.

1009
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
You do it.

1010
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,800
Okay.

1011
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,520
So you weren't upstairs yesterday.

1012
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,600
Are you doing this?

1013
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,400
I don't know.

1014
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,640
It was snowing that day.

1015
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,920
Actually, I went to get the camera.

1016
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,440
but I don't usually take pictures of others.

1017
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,320
Because I don't know

1018
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,480
if others were willing to be photographed.

1019
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,200
I didn't care.

1020
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,120
I went to take photos of you.

1021
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,320
I took it from you.

1022
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,360
We didn't take a photo together.

1023
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,480
But I think the scene is similar.

1024
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
I think it's a group photo.

1025
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,720
The first photo of you on a snowy day.

1026
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,560
It's so ritual.

1027
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,000
Xiao Ling was helping me yesterday.

1028
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,360
She drew it.

1029
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,960
Yes.

1030
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,840
Kitten.

1031
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,120
Xiao Ling is good at drawing.

1032
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,920
And you sent me this.

1033
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,360
I hope I can become

1034
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,080
I can become

1035
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,800
a stone.

1036
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,000
Stupid stone.

1037
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,160
Luckily, I made a breakthrough.

1038
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,920
I took the initiative to communicate with you.

1039
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,960
You're willing to communicate too?

1040
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,960
I had a successful experience.

1041
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,720
I think it'll be easier to get along in the future.

1042
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,480
Actually, this is what you sent me.

1043
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,680
Happiness is like a overflowing soup bun.

1044
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,520
I think it looks like you.

1045
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,040
You sent me

1046
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,960
We sat on the rocks to watch the sea.

1047
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,040
Then I searched.

1048
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,800
we might fall in love with each other.

1049
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,720
Did you search it yourself?

1050
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,920
or did I explain it to you?

1051
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,720
I searched

1052
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,800
and gave you

1053
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,520
to show you your knowledge.

1054
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,720
That's how I feel.

1055
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,040
You held my hand by the sea.

1056
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,120
You've been in my world since then.

1057
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,360
You gave me the scarf on the bus.

1058
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,200
I'm happy to be cared about.

1059
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,120
I know.

1060
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,040
I also exist in your world.

1061
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,960
After the first night of Tientsin,

1062
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,760
I appeared in your album.

1063
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,840
You always take pictures of me.

1064
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,120
There's a harbor

1065
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,040
a harbor where you can stop whenever you're tired.

1066
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,960
The last one is...

1067
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,640
Hello, Susu.

1068
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,240
Let me introduce myself again.

1069
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,920
I'm Soup.

1070
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,560
Welcome to my world.

1071
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,600
We'll record the next story together.

1072
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,400
Nice.

1073
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,200
Do you want to write it down?

1074
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,560
Okay, give me this.

1075
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,440
That hand ledger.

1076
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,400
is a very thoughtful gift.

1077
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,600
Hand ledger.

1078
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,320
I want to express that

1079
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,880
from the first day,

1080
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,720
my eyes were full of her.

1081
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,040
I always care about her.

1082
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,400
And yesterday,

1083
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,160
I made yesterday.

1084
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,040
Actually, I'm not good at it.

1085
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,160
I made two earstuds for you.

1086
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,000
This is May.

1087
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,960
Oh-wol looks like this too.

1088
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,440
Really?

1089
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,440
Because I went there.

1090
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,000
Then I told the shop

1091
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,120
girls like German very much.

1092
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,800
And she also has a German.

1093
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,880
I might have done a general shape.

1094
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,240
And the sculpture was helped by the owner.

1095
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,760
That's it

1096
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,640
It's fluid.

1097
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,920
Then I turned off the fire.

1098
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,040
Almost.

1099
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,240
The first German is ready.

1100
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,040
I thought you might like it.

1101
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,880
Thank you.

1102
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,920
Oh-wol, come and take a look.

1103
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:01,960
May.

1104
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:02,880
Where?

1105
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,360
It's similar.

1106
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,920
Kind of.

1107
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,320
a pair of German cats.

1108
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,240
I hope I can be with her.

1109
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,240
The things I give

1110
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,520
may be something with time factors.

1111
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,240
Hope we can rely on each other.

1112
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,440
Come with me to get something.

1113
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,880
You want something?

1114
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,400
Yes.

1115
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,800
This

1116
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,280
Take this over

1117
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,880
Bring it here.

1118
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,920
Is there a cat inside?

1119
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,400
Yes.

1120
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,480
Here's a kitten.

1121
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,440
Okay, I believe it.

1122
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,080
Each represents a story.

1123
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,920
Please guess

1124
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,120
This one.

1125
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,200
Fried egg.

1126
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,760
Their memories

1127
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,560
That's not fried eggs.

1128
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,880
You should

1129
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,520
your thoughts carefully.

1130
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,360
Sandwich.

1131
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:58,840
Yes.

1132
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,480
Yes.

1133
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,160
I made you a sandwich that morning.

1134
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,560
Yes.

1135
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,880
The sandwich incident.

1136
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,920
The cause, the process, and the result.

1137
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,880
Okay.

1138
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,400
I went down to look for it.

1139
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,360
Where's my sandwich?

1140
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,520
I ate your sandwich.

1141
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,480
I'm hungry too.

1142
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,320
I'll try it when I get back.

1143
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,880
Okay.

1144
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,240
It's because

1145
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,840
you think I'm happy

1146
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,560
because of you?

1147
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,080
Yes.

1148
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,800
So cute.

1149
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,160
This should be

1150
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,640
the first time I took you on a date.

1151
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,000
Yes.

1152
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,440
I was quite happy that day.

1153
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,120
Because

1154
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,960
if you weren't interested in ping-pong,

1155
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,600
what you did that day

1156
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,560
you respect my interest.

1157
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,520
and you're willing to

1158
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,880
And

1159
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,280
this bouquet

1160
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
The one I gave you?

1161
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,560
Yes.

1162
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,600
What is this?

1163
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,520
These are for you.

1164
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,360
I think a date should be more formal.

1165
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,320
But it's not white.

1166
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,680
It only has red.

1167
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,120
But it's similar.

1168
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,360
Red roses.

1169
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:14,880
Yes.

1170
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,840
They're all roses.

1171
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,040
And

1172
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,120
These two.

1173
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,120
These two are

1174
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,960
One encore for each person.

1175
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,920
A couple pendant.

1176
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,040
I don't know if you're carrying your bag or not.

1177
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,120
So

1178
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,640
Smell the pigs.

1179
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,080
Okay, carry it.

1180
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,920
Hang it on the bag.

1181
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,000
And...

1182
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,880
Susu, can you stand up?

1183
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,440
Yes, that's right.

1184
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,760
Action.

1185
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,440
What are you doing?

1186
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,400
Nothing.

1187
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,160
Panic.

1188
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,640
I...

1189
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,680
Think about it.

1190
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,560
Say something.

1191
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,600
Don't be nervous.

1192
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:03,800
Yeah.

1193
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,520
Susu's reaction is the best.

1194
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,800
Just focus on him.

1195
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,080
I think we have a lot of difficulties

1196
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,840
and uncertainty.

1197
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,960
But I learned to take the initiative

1198
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,760
I learned to express love.

1199
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,480
Every time you feel I get close to you,

1200
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,160
you'll give positive response.

1201
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,720
Thank you for caring about my feelings.

1202
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,640
Susu.

1203
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,160
I want to be with you.

1204
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,640
I want to be with you.

1205
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,240
Will you be my girlfriend?

1206
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,760
My sweetie is finally coming together.

1207
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,880
Thank you.

1208
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,040
Will you?

1209
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,840
Be together.

1210
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,040
Yes.

1211
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,640
officially together.

1212
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,680
Congratulations.

1213
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,440
The lovers are finally together.

1214
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,920
I kissed her hair.

1215
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,560
But I still have something for you.

1216
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,160
It's okay. Give me a hug. I haven't hugged you yet.

1217
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,360
Give me a hug

1218
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,440
I haven't hugged you yet.

1219
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,360
The beauty of love

1220
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,160
is really beautiful.

1221
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,240
I'm so happy for them.

1222
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,120
Look at this side.

1223
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,800
Side.

1224
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,600
A letter?

1225
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,320
Susu also wrote to him.

1226
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,760
Did the soup ask me

1227
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,840
if I'll receive your handwritten letter again.

1228
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,840
When will you write me another letter?

1229
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,880
I've never written to anyone.

1230
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,600
It's an honor.

1231
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,760
I think on the last day,

1232
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,640
I should prepare a handwritten letter

1233
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,080
to meet his expectations.

1234
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,880
and express my feelings.

1235
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,120
She really remembers

1236
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,840
You will remember

1237
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,520
you will remember.

1238
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:10,840
Yes.

1239
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,360
Hello. Hello.

1240
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,160
Hello.

1241
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,840
A Tom Cat who is teased by fate.

1242
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,560
You mentioned

1243
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,960
if I would write or write to you again.

1244
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,840
That's it.

1245
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,480
Susu is really good at love.

1246
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,920
I've been planning for a long time.

1247
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,920
This letter...

1248
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,560
I'm embarrassed.

1249
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,640
This letter should be reserved and mean.

1250
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,480
or passionate, bold, straightforward and simple?

1251
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,800
I often wonder

1252
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,720
when I started liking you.

1253
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,200
I have many answers.

1254
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,120
So cheesy.

1255
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,040
But I think

1256
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,240
not real enough.

1257
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,160
You're cold.

1258
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,920
I'm nervous.

1259
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,400
Don't be nervous.

1260
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,240
Maybe the moment you opened the door for me,

1261
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,760
I think

1262
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,840
he is so handsome.

1263
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,440
Maybe it's the first time

1264
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,720
on our way back from shopping,

1265
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,120
I shared my earphones with you for the first time.

1266
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,960
Let's listen to music together.

1267
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,120
Maybe when we were looking through the life album,

1268
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,320
there are too many shining points.

1269
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,280
For example, ping pong players

1270
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,640
or students from Tsinghua.

1271
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,600
I have no choice but to admire Qiang.

1272
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Why are you praising me?

1273
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,640
Praise you?

1274
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,000
Yes, very good.

1275
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,080
Great.

1276
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,720
Maybe you've been choosing me every day.

1277
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,280
and sent me a message about your feelings.

1278
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,360
I sent it to Susu.

1279
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,440
a little sensitive after the sandwich.

1280
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,560
It's soup.

1281
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,880
I'll send it to her today.

1282
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,080
The soup was sent to me today

1283
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,640
Did you send it to me today?

1284
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,960
I sent it to Susu.

1285
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,800
I think it's good to take it slow.

1286
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,040
I got a text from the soup.

1287
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,000
I sent a lot.

1288
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,800
The stage costume is amazing.

1289
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,320
Give her a good response.

1290
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,680
Try again and send it to Susu.

1291
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,760
I feel Susu's love.

1292
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,920
I'm happy to receive the text from the soup.

1293
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,680
Always determined

1294
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,680
The soup took so many steps.

1295
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,160
That feeling makes me feel at ease.

1296
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,000
Maybe from the first time

1297
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,400
our first date,

1298
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,360
I saw a lot of clothes.

1299
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,720
and took the initiative to carry my bag.

1300
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,040
A little girl who cares about details.

1301
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,280
You don't have to read the bracket.

1302
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,760
Maybe on the night of siblings.

1303
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,560
Look into my eyes

1304
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,960
and sang I Want to Say.

1305
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,120
Maybe in Tianjin,

1306
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,480
in Tianjin.

1307
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,560
Maybe when we were watching crosstalk,

1308
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,240
When I didn't know,

1309
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,400
when I didn't know.

1310
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,840
He expressed his love to me openly.

1311
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,480
The book says

1312
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,000
Good meetings are about lighting up each other.

1313
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,760
So I was thinking

1314
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,920
what it means to light up each other.

1315
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,520
Actually, I've been thinking

1316
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,160
I've been thinking

1317
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,240
why I need

1318
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
someone's firm towards me

1319
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:43,880
and take the initiative.

1320
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,920
It's because you're scared.

1321
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,880
I'm afraid my expectations will fail.

1322
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,880
I'm afraid the people and things I cherish

1323
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,040
will die without any disease.

1324
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,880
So the beginning

1325
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,160
So cautious and cautious.

1326
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,880
and confused.

1327
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,200
They have no answer.

1328
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,920
Or

1329
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,880
we need to find the answer together.

1330
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,000
The moon is beautiful tonight.

1331
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,440
It's taking time

1332
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,320
Su Ziyi.

1333
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:11,880
Okay.

1334
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,520
The night is beautiful.

1335
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,760
Yes.

1336
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,320
I like you.

1337
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,320
I finally understand.

1338
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,880
You understood me once.

1339
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,200
I understand it every time.

1340
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,440
Then pretend you don't understand.

1341
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,240
Mr Su, tell me.

1342
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,600
Well...

1343
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,800
I'm sorry.

1344
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,400
Well...

1345
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,520
I like you.

1346
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,640
Me too.

1347
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,080
I never thought a song was so good.

1348
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,720
I sang it myself.

1349
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,360
Put it away.

1350
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,360
Keep it well.

1351
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,040
Life.

1352
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
The third handwritten letter.

1353
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,280
The first time is for Su Zihao.

1354
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,640
I said,

1355
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,840
I said there's another danger.

1356
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,840
A sincere confession.

1357
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,520
I feel very happy.

1358
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,480
It's very touching.

1359
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,920
Harry.

1360
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,920
Take a photo for me.

1361
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:07,920
Three.

1362
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,040
Two.

1363
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,920
Are you going to throw me over the shoulder?

1364
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,080
They look great together.

1365
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,640
Help!

1366
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,880
You look great together.

1367
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,040
When I run towards you,

1368
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,320
you also came to me.

1369
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,880
It feels so good to look at people.

1370
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,480
That's how you watch a romance show.

1371
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:33,960
Yes.

1372
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,080
Perfect confession.

1373
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,840
Congratulations, Susu.

1374
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,680
In fact,

1375
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,960
when you see Susu and soup,

1376
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,320
were both passive.

1377
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,480
They chose to run towards each other bravely.

1378
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,240
and finally got firm love.

1379
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,560
Do you think

1380
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,400
someone will come later?

1381
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,200
Don't ask that.

1382
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,840
I have a strange feeling.

1383
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,760
He's coming.

1384
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,520
Coming.
