1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,520
Her life is like an idol drama.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,520
Yes.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,120
Tell him before you get in.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,840
I like you.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,920
Then I got on the car and left.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,760
Luckily there was no traffic jam.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,040
Otherwise, it would be awkward.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,240
I like you.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,640
Your own hair.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,360
Yes, I will.

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,600
Once you say that,

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,160
you have to wake up an hour early every day.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll punish you to get up one hour early.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Next.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,880
I'll be quick. 20 minutes.

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,080
You scared me.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,040
Praise me. Did I look good?

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,680
Say it.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,960
It's pretty. Okay.

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,200
When I received

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,080
the "Cupid Invitation Card",

22
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,920
Xiaoling got rid of it quickly.

23
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,120
Because we didn't communicate.

24
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,040
But on the first day,

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,680
we didn't communicate at all.

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,720
Do you think it's the next date

27
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,240
or next time?

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,880
Okay.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,160
Love and Sisters.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,080
Let love double.

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,360
(Welcome to "Love Siblings")

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,240
"Love Sisters".

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,680
We're a loving family member group.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,400
We're going to

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,000
the update of this episode.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,720
We're almost done.

37
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,960
Okay, let's go.

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,960
You look good on camera.

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,680
Of course.

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,760
What did you learn after all?

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
Your head is so small. You do it.

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,600
Let me do it. Tell us.

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,000
How do you feel about our date today?

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,240
I'm very happy.

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,160
It's over.

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,480
Very happy.

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,360
It's over.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,079
We really...

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,840
We can definitely play together.

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,079
Because in the crowd,

51
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,200
in the crowd

52
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,120
who can talk to me.

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
Absolutely feel

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm looking forward to the snow.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,440
I thought you were looking forward to the next date.

56
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,920
You pissed me off.

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,560
Are you looking forward to the next date

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000
or next time?

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,360
Okay.

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,920
Don't be good. What do you expect?

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,200
I think you're looking forward to the next date.

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,920
You'll be happy for your next date.

63
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,840
No.

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,040
No.

65
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,079
Hello

66
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,880
Hello.

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
I didn't do it at first.

68
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,720
When I received

69
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,280
when I received

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
I pushed it too.

71
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,480
But I did the exclusion method.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,520
I did.

73
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,320
What did he say?

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,440
That letter.

75
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,240
I excluded it.

76
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,520
I think it's probably you.

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,480
Why?

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,560
Let's get rid of Xiaoling's first.

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,840
Because we didn't communicate,

80
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,240
and there was nothing

81
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,360
But on the first day,

82
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,880
on the first day.

83
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,600
And you sit opposite me.

84
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,079
Yes, opposite you.

85
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
But you didn't say anything on the first day.

86
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,440
I think we had the most contact

87
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,399
I went to the supermarket yesterday.

88
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,079
I said I wanted to eat this.

89
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,520
You said you wanted to buy it.

90
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,200
Didn't you buy it at the supermarket?

91
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,160
You said you would buy whatever you wanted.

92
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,800
Yes.

93
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,240
Yes, one more question.

94
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,800
Do I have too many questions?

95
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,760
No, go ahead.

96
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,720
Well...

97
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,200
the first day

98
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,760
when you brought sausage here,

99
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,080
I guessed the location.

100
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,200
Do you know where I guess?

101
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,159
I want to guess.

102
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,120
Sausage.

103
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,920
Sichuan.

104
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,040
Really?

105
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
Yes, because

106
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,560
There's one more thing.

107
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,680
The drawing doesn't have an accent, you know?

108
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,960
Me neither.

109
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,480
I'm very authentic.

110
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,520
I'll pack it authentic.

111
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,880
It's your first day.

112
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,120
I'm fine now.

113
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,120
Very plastic.

114
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,000
Plastic when I read letters?

115
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,200
When I read letters,

116
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,320
you read it in Hunan dialect.

117
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,560
I'm not from Hunan.

118
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,800
Who told you I'm from Hunan?

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,520
You are?

120
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,400
I didn't tell you I'm from Hunan.

121
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,280
right?

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,760
You got the wrong person.

123
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,640
Did I tell you I'm from Hunan?

124
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,160
No?

125
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
I think your Mandarin is plastic.

126
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,480
It's Hunan.

127
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,000
Where are you from?

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,320
I'm close to you.

129
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,560
Hubei, Yongzhou.

130
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,159
Sichuan.

131
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,960
Yongzhou? Why Hubei?

132
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,280
Yes, Yongzhou, Hunan.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,480
Guangdong, right?

134
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,200
Yes.

135
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,200
But I think you speak like Fujian.

136
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,760
I've been in Changsha for four years.

137
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,200
Really?

138
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,720
Yes.

139
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,080
When did you go there?

140
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,920
2019.

141
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,320
In Changsha, 2019.

142
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,360
2016 2017.

143
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,480
I was there too.

144
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,000
I was in 2014.

145
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,040
When I saw the fried pork with chili,

146
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,560
I thought

147
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
you were from Hunan.

148
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,920
you've gained a lot of popularity.

149
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,040
You gave me extra points in Hunan.

150
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,120
Yes.

151
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,760
Because I really like Changsha.

152
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,320
Do you still go to Changsha often now?

153
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,720
Maybe you didn't make me happy.

154
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,480
I think a place

155
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,920
makes you like me.

156
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,720
I think it's easy for you to have feelings for me.

157
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,600
When we go back,

158
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
Let's have dinner together.

159
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,840
We can eat more tonight.

160
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,680
Why can we eat more tonight

161
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,320
Because the chef is good at cooking, right?

162
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,360
It's their turn to cook tonight

163
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,920
Yes.

164
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,960
Who did the dishes today?

165
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,480
I washed it with soup first.

166
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,440
Yesterday it was Xinxin and Harry.

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,680
Maybe it's you or the drawing today.

168
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,840
Your folding paper is...

169
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,080
No.

170
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,920
I just wiped my hands.

171
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,600
You're a little nervous, right?

172
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,960
No.

173
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,960
She has many moves.

174
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,880
She's quite stubborn.

175
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,800
But she's not nervous.

176
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,240
She folded one after another.

177
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,280
She's still cute.

178
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,840
Let's go back for dinner.

179
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,320
Okay.

180
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,520
Save some stomach.

181
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,720
Harry will say we don't give him face.

182
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,960
He's eating so much outside.

183
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,120
Let's go.

184
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,840
Did you drive?

185
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,680
I drove. You can take my car.

186
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,400
Okay.

187
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,880
It's snowing.

188
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,000
The first snow.

189
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,680
So romantic.

190
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,200
Really.

191
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,840
At this time,

192
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
to see the first snow

193
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
and meet love.

194
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,280
It's snowing.

195
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,440
Really?

196
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,520
Let's go! Let's go!

197
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,200
It's snowing outside

198
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,680
It's really snowing

199
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,600
It's huge.

200
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,920
My camera!

201
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,400
Camera

202
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Where is it? I'll take it for you.

203
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
You have it.

204
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,480
I gave it to you.

205
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,760
Really?

206
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,320
Yes.

207
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,320
You don't have it in your jacket?

208
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,600
When did you give it to me?

209
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,320
After the tea.

210
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,400
Do you want to take a photo?

211
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,720
Yes.

212
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,040
Let me see my camera.

213
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,360
I saw snow in Beijing.

214
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,360
I've been thinking about the first snow this year.

215
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,360
The snow is so romantic.

216
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,000
I found the camera

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,840
Okay.

218
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,160
I'm not looking forward to snow.

219
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
but the winter with you.

220
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,280
We're really...

221
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
Stand here and I'll take a photo for you.

222
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,920
Try it.

223
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,480
So pretty.

224
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,720
You take photos here.

225
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
Go away.

226
00:08:59,480 --> 00:08:59,560
Three, two, one.

227
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,720
Should I light it?

228
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,400
No, I won't see the snow if I light it.

229
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,520
But the snow is very small now.

230
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,760
Come on. Let me help you.

231
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,480
Take one vertically.

232
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,320
Nice.

233
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,640
Yes.

234
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,040
This atmosphere is amazing.

235
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,560
Your phone is so good at buying.

236
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,760
"God of atmosphere."

237
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,440
When you're in a relationship,

238
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,200
when you're in a relationship?

239
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,840
or record each other?

240
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,960
Yes, because I

241
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,040
I also like to record myself.

242
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,520
I record everyone.

243
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,040
But I'm more willing to

244
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,480
to record many beautiful moments.

245
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,760
every moment.

246
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
For example,

247
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,160
on a notebook today.

248
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,280
There's a little pendant here.

249
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,680
It's about you too.

250
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,480
Like that.

251
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,800
It's been so many years.

252
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,360
It must have recorded a lot.

253
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
Of course some important moments

254
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,760
I'm sure they're willing to share with us.

255
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,240
Record.

256
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,560
Do you often

257
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,960
like filming?

258
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,920
I rarely take photos of myself.

259
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
But I think

260
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,680
I think it's more ceremonial.

261
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,800
Like snowing

262
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,640
or eat

263
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,480
delicious dessert,

264
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,720
will take photos of each other.

265
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,720
I think Susu did a good job.

266
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,680
Sometimes his partner looks ugly when taking photos.

267
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,160
You hope he doesn't record it.

268
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,720
Let me tell you.

269
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,200
My husband takes ugly photos of me.

270
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,120
One meter, right?

271
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,920
Yes, it's really ugly.

272
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,160
When we were filming

273
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
on the show,

274
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
In the end,

275
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,640
he made a photo album.

276
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
but it's all my ugly pictures.

277
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,600
But I'm so touched.

278
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,640
It's like you'll find that

279
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,520
not your beauty,

280
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,600
or your makeup.

281
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,440
but the most real moment.

282
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,560
When you're down,

283
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,640
you were so focused.

284
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,600
When you do something,

285
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,520
you'll find that the way your lover looks at you

286
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,480
is like this.

287
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,000
I couldn't help crying that day.

288
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,480
Then I felt

289
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,040
when your lover is willing to take pictures of you

290
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,760
your real state,

291
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,400
It's a different expression of love.

292
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,640
Yes, you've seen by your lover.

293
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,840
Actually, no one else has seen you.

294
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,040
the ugliest version of you.

295
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,560
Yes, but he's willing

296
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,960
to record you.

297
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
How do you understand love

298
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,720
I also had

299
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,520
For example,

300
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm also a guy

301
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,280
I got along with him first.

302
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,680
I knew I liked him at first.

303
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
But I wasn't sure if he liked me.

304
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,400
Then we had a date

305
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,920
at a cafe.

306
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,520
Then I felt that I started to be certain.

307
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,160
I think...

308
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,840
I think this guy

309
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,000
is interested in me.

310
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,680
That day, we said

311
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,800
we were going to go home.

312
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,880
We'll go home separately.

313
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,360
Before I got in the car,

314
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,680
I immediately told him I like you.

315
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,840
Then I'll go upstairs and leave.

316
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,080
I didn't even answer.

317
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,000
I just left.

318
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,240
And then?

319
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,160
Then he texted me on WeChat.

320
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
He said, "Why are you leaving?"

321
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,680
I said I didn't want to hear your answer.

322
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,880
He said, "But I like you too."

323
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,120
Her life is like an idol drama.

324
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Yes.

325
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,400
Luckily there's no traffic jam.

326
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,720
Otherwise, it would be awkward.

327
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,760
I like you.

328
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,520
The red light is ahead

329
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,000
Life is full of jokes

330
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,680
Yes.

331
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
I'm going to write my diary.

332
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,120
Go down and write your diary.

333
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm leaving, Hua.

334
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,600
Okay, bye.

335
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,560
Bye.

336
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,320
I'm leaving.

337
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,520
Bye. Come back early.

338
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,720
When I saw him,

339
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,840
I think it's the person from yesterday.

340
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,440
sent it to me.

341
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,040
I was subconsciously happy.

342
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,280
After we got to know each other yesterday,

343
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,000
After yesterday,

344
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,360
I think this afternoon tea is right.

345
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,280
Not at all.

346
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,200
Not at all.

347
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,000
Hello.

348
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Turn around.

349
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,720
But my left face is pretty.

350
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,400
Sorry.

351
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,040
It's okay.

352
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,200
Great.

353
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,040
Who can play the piano so well?

354
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,560
Who is so talented?

355
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,880
Actually, I think this is mutual.

356
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,960
If I can feel

357
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,240
I can also accept

358
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,640
I can accept it.

359
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,440
Do you feel it?

360
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,120
No.

361
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,520
Love can't be forced.

362
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,080
Because we came here

363
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,240
to explore something better.

364
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,760
I'm 100% the kind of love that grows over time.

365
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,840
I said the same thing yesterday.

366
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,160
Yes.

367
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
So when I heard you say,

368
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,080
I said he looks like me.

369
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
Gosh.

370
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,760
Do you want pumpkin juice?

371
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,520
Yes.

372
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,040
It's not good.

373
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
How much more do you want for reducing swelling?

374
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
I wasted a day to reduce swelling.

375
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,360
How many packets do you bring?

376
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,640
20 packets.

377
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,560
I'll buy it now.

378
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,760
I'll buy it now.

379
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,320
Where's my phone?

380
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,040
You'll definitely...

381
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,960
Susu will definitely want it.

382
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,120
It's okay. I'll just buy two people's quantity.

383
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,960
I won't give it to others.

384
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
I'll mail it here. Buy 40 bags.

385
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,720
Enough.

386
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,960
Is 40 bags enough?

387
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,640
Yes.

388
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,120
20 bags.

389
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,200
I drink two bags every day.

390
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,000
I want three bags.

391
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,840
You drink three bags.

392
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,040
You have double eyelids.

393
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,280
Really?

394
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
No, don't be shy.

395
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,080
Who told you I have single eyelids?

396
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
You have single eyelids.

397
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,680
I have double eyelids.

398
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,720
Yes, I am.

399
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,680
It's really awkward.

400
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,800
I thought you had single eyelids.

401
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,680
I have single eyelids.

402
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,800
If I don't open my eyes, I have single eyelids.

403
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,880
I open my eyes with double eyelids.

404
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Do you want to play badminton later?

405
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,200
Yes.

406
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,440
Go outside.

407
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,880
No.

408
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,680
No, the wind...

409
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,520
Out.

410
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,400
No, the wind is blowing this way.

411
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
I have to hit over there.

412
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,280
This is...

413
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,440
How can I play badminton?

414
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
I can't. I really can't.

415
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,760
You can throw that.

416
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,160
Let's throw the ball.

417
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,560
I'll play this.

418
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,360
Come on.

419
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,200
Is it far?

420
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Can you throw it here?

421
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
Nice.

422
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,480
This is okay.

423
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,280
Do you want to play?

424
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,680
Take one.

425
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,600
Come on.

426
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,320
Let me show you.

427
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
You can do it.

428
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,760
Take it easy.

429
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,960
Come on, you do it.

430
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,160
We did a good job.

431
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,200
We did a good job.

432
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,360
Right?

433
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,240
It's mainly because the pitch is good.

434
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,040
I threw it higher.

435
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,560
Okay.

436
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,360
Not far.

437
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,520
Flying disk, right?

438
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,200
You've gone too far.

439
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,760
Hurry, shoot two shots.

440
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,320
Let's have a shooting game.

441
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,240
We don't play that.

442
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,520
Let's start.

443
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,640
I'm starting to use my strength.

444
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,920
It's a bit far.

445
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,160
There's wind.

446
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,360
The wind is blowing over there.

447
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,560
A little to the left.

448
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,160
The bullet is right.

449
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,120
So accurate.

450
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,320
The last one to vote in the sand pit.

451
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,560
I'll show you

452
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,800
360 degrees shot.

453
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,520
No, three points here.

454
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,800
I have to run.

455
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,839
Let me take a photo for you.

456
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,119
Take a photo.

457
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,599
You have to raise the ball like this.

458
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,680
Raise it. Yes.

459
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,640
So stupid.

460
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,079
Three, two, one. Look at the camera.

461
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,520
You two ruined the scene.

462
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,040
What do you mean?

463
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,440
Sorry.

464
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,920
Three, two, one. Cheese.

465
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,040
Cheese.

466
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,800
The soup is so cool.

467
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
It's cold. Let's go.

468
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,360
Let's go.

469
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,880
You wear three dresses every day.

470
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,480
Bring it here

471
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,960
I won't get stuck and awkward anymore.

472
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,640
You're awkward.

473
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,120
Don't get stuck and awkward anymore

474
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,200
Do I have to smoke it myself?

475
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,120
This is for you. This is for you.

476
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,200
This is for you.

477
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,560
Thank you.

478
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,360
Praise me. Did I look good?

479
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,920
Say it's nice.

480
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,160
It's good. It's good. It's good.

481
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,760
Let me ask you this.

482
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,120
Which movie star do you want to

483
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,080
to have dinner with?

484
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,200
Why?

485
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,960
I want to know too.

486
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,560
She's here.

487
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,840
Jin Yeon-hee.

488
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,960
It's sweet.

489
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,640
I just like her face.

490
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
I watched

491
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,480
the drama "The Condor Hero".

492
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,240
The little dragon girl

493
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,760
Too many.

494
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,120
Choose one.

495
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,880
I want to see Hu recently.

496
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,120
Who is Hu?

497
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,920
Hu Xianxian.

498
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
He's funny. I think he's so cute.

499
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,040
He's humorous.

500
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
He has a good sense of humor.

501
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,000
He's relaxed.

502
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,280
describe the perfect day you think.

503
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,160
You go first.

504
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,600
Have some fruit.

505
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,240
Eat this melon. So sweet.

506
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,960
Eat and drink.

507
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,040
Nothing is rushing you.

508
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,160
You can

509
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,680
at home.

510
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,680
What about you?

511
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,280
I think a perfect day

512
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,760
Practice in the morning.

513
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,480
In the afternoon.

514
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,200
in the afternoon.

515
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
Do you train every day?

516
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,200
Five times a week.

517
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,680
What do you think is a perfect day?

518
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,040
I want to take a small bite, right?

519
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,960
Did I raise your voice?

520
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,160
I'm waiting for your answer.

521
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,400
I'll join later. It doesn't count.

522
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,280
It's your turn.

523
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,800
Who should I ask?

524
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,040
Everyone

525
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,360
doesn't care about money.

526
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,920
What do you want to do the most?

527
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,480
eating broadcasting.

528
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
Why did you steal my job?

529
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,240
What about you?

530
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,040
I...

531
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,920
I like music.

532
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,840
But I don’t think I’m gifted.

533
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,880
I'm off.

534
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,760
Harry.

535
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,640
Be the captain of the police team.

536
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
Do you have a strong will?

537
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,160
No.

538
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,400
But I like watching those cases.

539
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,440
detectives,

540
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,240
including forensic doctors.

541
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,880
Back then, when I was little,

542
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
I always wanted to be a forensic doctor.

543
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,360
Why did you quit?

544
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,000
Because he went to philosophy.

545
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,600
Yes.

546
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,280
Psychologist?

547
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,520
Yes.

548
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Susu, come here.

549
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,520
You don't care about money.

550
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,120
What do you want to do the most?

551
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,800
a stylist.

552
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,440
You draw.

553
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,240
Another one.

554
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,600
The one who broke the rules has appeared.

555
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,240
It's so natural.

556
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,360
I forgot to bring money on my date.

557
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,160
What will you do?

558
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,960
Then I'll tell my date

559
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,800
I didn't bring money.

560
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,520
Let her pay for me this time.

561
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,360
You can say it out loud.

562
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,040
I'll take care of it myself.

563
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,240
If you haven't finished

564
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,120
before the last meal,

565
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
I can only say

566
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,760
I won't hide it.

567
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,280
Then the girl blocked you.

568
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,560
I have no choice.

569
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,040
I hope she can understand me.

570
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,720
I'll tell her too.

571
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,160
I think

572
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,800
since she's willing to accept your date,

573
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,840
she must

574
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,560
to understand you.

575
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,920
I think you can

576
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,560
show some

577
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,080
You should show us.

578
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,000
If she stays away from you right away,

579
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,840
I think

580
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,240
she doesn't like you enough.

581
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,880
It won't last long.

582
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,640
What was your best subject in school?

583
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,840
Geography.

584
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,040
Geography.

585
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,560
I must ask a geography.

586
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,760
a great question.

587
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,880
No, no.

588
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,840
What is the north city in China?

589
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,960
Mohe.

590
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,720
We played together yesterday.

591
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,960
What are you afraid of the most?

592
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,560
Why?

593
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,840
I'm afraid of balloons.

594
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,680
and firecrackers.

595
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,040
These things will ring.

596
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,600
I'm afraid of ghosts.

597
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,720
I'm afraid of jumping machines. I'm afraid of heights.

598
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,200
I thought you were going to say you were afraid that you were too handsome.

599
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,280
I didn't say it.

600
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,760
I know you didn't.

601
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,440
Fear of heights.

602
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,240
Afraid of heights?

603
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm afraid the air suddenly becomes quiet.

604
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,800
It's kind of funny.

605
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,200
What's the most precious memory of your childhood?

606
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,480
Childish.

607
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,640
The most precious memory of childhood should be

608
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,800
the time I spent with my parents.

609
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,200
when I was little.

610
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,040
And I had grandma with me.

611
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,080
Childish.

612
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,880
Did grandma bring her up Confucius

613
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,120
Grandma brought her up.

614
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,480
The same answer as you

615
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Really.

616
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm not.

617
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
No one asked you

618
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,520
My parents love massages.

619
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
They went out for a massage.

620
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,040
They were riding a bike.

621
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,640
But my parents

622
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,920
don't know how to ride a bike.

623
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,400
Then he asked me to choose the back seat

624
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,920
to sit up there.

625
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,000
Then we

626
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
fall into the bushes together.

627
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,240
Doesn't it hurt?

628
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,840
It hurts. It hurts.

629
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,000
All that's left is anger.

630
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,280
It's your turn, Harry.

631
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,280
The most precious memory

632
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,360
The most impressive guess is

633
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,800
I wore my grandma's clothes when I was a kid.

634
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,560
jumping from the sofa

635
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,200
Step on the sleeve when jumping to the bottom

636
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,440
The first bone fracture

637
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,600
He broke my left arm.

638
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,240
How old were you?

639
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,000
I was very young. Two or three years old.

640
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,320
Who's back?

641
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,360
Someone is coming.

642
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,000
Hurry!

643
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,320
The fifth boy.

644
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,280
My name is Tae-seo.

645
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,920
I'm a model.

646
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,360
What game were you playing?

647
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,000
The awkward question.

648
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,560
Pick one. You can ask everyone.

649
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,240
Really?

650
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,280
It has two sides. Which side?

651
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,640
You can choose one of them.

652
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,360
I want this side.

653
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,480
This side.

654
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:53,920
Yes.

655
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,560
What do you want to do

656
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,480
what do you want to do the most?

657
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,080
I want to start a business.

658
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
I don't know. Answer me first.

659
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,400
You first.

660
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,920
What's wrong with ping-pong centre?

661
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,040
Table Tennis Club doesn't make money anymore.

662
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,880
Are you good at ping pong?

663
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,680
Just so so. Just a little.

664
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,760
Me too.

665
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,160
I only know a little.

666
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,840
Do you want to see his life album?

667
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,640
and you'll know.

668
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,680
You can show him this.

669
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,840
You are...

670
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
badminton player.

671
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,280
I can see it.

672
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,960
The American professional basket.

673
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,640
What about Hwa?

674
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,440
I want to open a crystal shop.

675
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,040
I'm most interested now.

676
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,240
I bought yellow crystal a while ago.

677
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,000
Me too.

678
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,960
I've recently bought it on some platform.

679
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,200
Harry.

680
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,160
I...

681
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,400
A pet shop.

682
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,680
I want to take in a stray pet.

683
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,680
That's the pet rescue station.

684
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,840
A pet rescue station?

685
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,400
Yes.

686
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,080
I'll keep taking him in.

687
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm like Harry.

688
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,240
Really?

689
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,320
I have something about pets too.

690
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,240
I want to...

691
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,040
I want everything.

692
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,560
adopt stray cats and dogs.

693
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,200
and find them an adoptive family.

694
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,000
and visit them regularly.

695
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,720
I'm making clothes for them.

696
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,320
You can try it.

697
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,560
Put on your clothes

698
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,960
for our seven cats. Thank you.

699
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,240
You have seven cats.

700
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Will you take them to take photos every year?

701
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,240
Yes, I haven't.

702
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,080
Let's go together.

703
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,200
I want to go.

704
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,240
Why are you so excited?

705
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
I guess it's a mission.

706
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,360
Mission?

707
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,040
The boy from the cottage.

708
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,080
Welcome new members to the cottage.

709
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,040
We prepared a

710
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,200
for boys.

711
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,440
Please go to the designated location.

712
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,000
Let's go.

713
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,440
Did it snow yesterday?

714
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,800
It rained for ten minutes.

715
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,040
I've never seen snow in the south.

716
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,280
You exposed yourself so quickly, right?

717
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,920
There are many in the south.

718
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,960
Take a guess.

719
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,840
Zhejiang.

720
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,880
Guess it yourself.

721
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,200
It's from Zhejiang.

722
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,920
Because I guessed it right,

723
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,320
So he said, "Come on, guess it yourself."

724
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,600
It must be because he guessed right.

725
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,200
Guess.

726
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Zhejiang is also big.

727
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,640
Do you want something sweet

728
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,680
Yes.

729
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,160
But I can't eat spicy food.

730
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't eat spicy food.

731
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,880
It doesn't make sense that you're not from Guangdong.

732
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,760
It doesn't make sense.

733
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,800
I guessed you were from Hangzhou.

734
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,560
I answered this question before.

735
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,240
Yes, he said he lives in Hangzhou.

736
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,000
No.

737
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,800
I said I don't live in Hangzhou.

738
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,000
You don't live in Hangzhou?

739
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,600
I don't live in Hangzhou.

740
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,640
I think you're in Shanghai.

741
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,360
Take a guess.

742
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,600
That's right.

743
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,880
Zhejiang people are in Shanghai.

744
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,960
I think his work

745
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,400
may be in Hangzhou.

746
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,400
in Hangzhou.

747
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,480
in the world.

748
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,120
Did you make your hair?

749
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,920
Yes, I will.

750
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,280
Once you say that,

751
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,800
you have to wake up an hour early every day.

752
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,680
I'll punish you to get up one hour early.

753
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,720
Next.

754
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,760
One hour. One hour is too much.

755
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,960
I'll be quick. 20 minutes.

756
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,840
A few days ago,

757
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,200
Yes, from the next day.

758
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,440
I texted yesterday and the day before yesterday.

759
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,680
Did you go on a date yesterday?

760
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,280
Yes.

761
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,840
Everyone went on a date yesterday.

762
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
I think

763
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,920
I think they have a girls' chatting party.

764
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,680
After we leave,

765
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,160
after we leave.

766
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,120
Do you understand?

767
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,360
You look familiar.

768
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,160
Really?

769
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,480
I also think he looks familiar.

770
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,040
He looks like Yu Shi.

771
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,520
May I ask if your brother

772
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,840
or you?

773
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,880
I'm curious about that.

774
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,320
We're all interested in it.

775
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,160
Which one is more interested?

776
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,960
Almost.

777
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,240
50 50

778
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,920
Half and half.

779
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,760
Which country are you from?

780
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,840
America.

781
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,320
I used to work in New York.

782
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,160
Work?

783
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,000
for a long time.

784
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,400
For many years?

785
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,000
Yes.

786
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,120
Three years

787
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,120
Three years

788
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,680
It's like

789
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,480
Almost.

790
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,320
In 2018,

791
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,480
I stayed for a year longer.

792
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,080
Just for ten months.

793
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,640
How did you train your eyes so well?

794
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,080
You can do special training.

795
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,600
We can only say that we might watch

796
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,960
supermodel movies

797
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,880
Imitate their expressions.

798
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,320
And their expressions.

799
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,720
And eyes.

800
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,560
Why are you so skinny?

801
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,280
Eat less.

802
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,320
I don't eat much.

803
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,840
Really?

804
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,520
Ask them. I don't eat much.

805
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,840
I can't see the effect these days.

806
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,000
Eat less for two years.

807
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,800
I also think we should eat less for two years.

808
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,120
What's the effect of two days?

809
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm 126 kilograms now.

810
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,280
Have you noticed

811
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,320
I don't feel hungry every day?

812
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,360
We had a lot of free time the other day.

813
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
and everyone kept eating.

814
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,040
I can eat the best.

815
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:26,880
I always

816
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,520
get fat.

817
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,200
You'll see me eating over there.

818
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,280
My mouth never stops.

819
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,240
Do you have muscle?

820
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,640
Is there any effective way?

821
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,720
Muscle-boosting powder.

822
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,120
Does it work?

823
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,960
Muscle acid is useful.

824
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,280
But you have to keep working out.

825
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,000
I held on for three months.

826
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,120
to 150 kilograms.

827
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,880
I don't think you can increase muscle in soup.

828
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,640
Your sports direction can't increase muscle.

829
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,040
But I'm too thin.

830
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Power is not good.

831
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,680
Can't you do the traditional exercise?

832
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,000
You should practice that.

833
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,840
I'll train for power transformation.

834
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,120
There will be special training.

835
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,440
But he has to do it.

836
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,120
What he wants to do is different

837
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
from our gym.

838
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,960
Yes, we are

839
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,800
Just...

840
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,960
just to look good.

841
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,800
Yes.

842
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,160
You said you wanted to eat pizza. We have all.

843
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,520
Yes.

844
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,640
Let's eat.

845
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,920
I need to use the bathroom.

846
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,480
Are you the proactive type?

847
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,080
Fatty said he was the initiative.

848
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,360
If he likes girls, he'll take the initiative.

849
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,400
Do you think

850
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
I do look like E.

851
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,200
But in love,

852
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,720
in love.

853
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,280
For example,

854
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,880
if we like someone together,

855
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,040
If the girl...

856
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,640
I'll take the initiative.

857
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,800
Yes, just like you.

858
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,480
As long as that girl gives me a little signal,

859
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,000
I'll take the initiative.

860
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,880
You will take the initiative.

861
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,560
Okay.

862
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,840
I don't need to be 100% sure.

863
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,600
As long as I have a chance,

864
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,800
I like him too, so I take the initiative.

865
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,640
He is proactive.

866
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,840
If I were a girl, I wouldn't take the initiative.

867
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,800
If I were a boy,

868
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,760
I would be like this.

869
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,960
I think

870
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,040
it would be better for girls.

871
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,280
That's why I chose this.

872
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,040
I agree.

873
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,560
Although I'm usually passive,

874
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,800
But if the girl gives the signal,

875
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,120
I will take the initiative.

876
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,680
If you don't have any thoughts,

877
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,960
I'll still be passive.

878
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,360
Yes.

879
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,680
You can try to hint.

880
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,800
If you really like someone,

881
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,880
or like someone,

882
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,560
look at her and talk to her.

883
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,520
You can try it.

884
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,520
In this environment,

885
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,200
in this environment.

886
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,880
Yes.

887
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,200
Is breakfast a hint?

888
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,720
Breakfast must be a hint.

889
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
Tata and Terri's joining

890
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,240
also makes our "catfish Effect"

891
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,280
is happening.

892
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,080
As for the details,

893
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,680
See you next week.

894
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,040
Love Siblings.

895
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,640
Let love double

896
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,160
Gather!

897
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
Coming.

898
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,440
Here are five invitations for partners.

899
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,600
Finished forming.

900
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,560
First come first served.

901
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,840
First come first served.

902
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,880
It's like a love letter.

903
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,720
Seriously.

904
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,240
Did you give it to me?

905
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,200
Of course.

906
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,640
Harry gave it to Xinxin.

907
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,880
Why are you giving it to me?

908
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,680
I'm inviting you.

909
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,640
Tata gave Harry

910
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,560
Here's your invitation card.

911
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,120
Thank you.

912
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Can you come over?

913
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,840
I gave it to her.

00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,600
