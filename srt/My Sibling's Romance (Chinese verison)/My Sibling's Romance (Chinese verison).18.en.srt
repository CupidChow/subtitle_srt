1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Have you ever helped your buddies?

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,600
A lot.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,640
I'm a “wingman”.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,960
Can you help him?

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,280
Come on, Tu.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,280
Tu.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
Come on, Tu.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,320
Come on, Tu. Come on.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,840
I'm going to faint.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,920
Did the map give you money?

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,040
Go!

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,720
Are you really going to make me breakfast tomorrow?

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,320
I almost had the wrong breakfast today.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,480
I was going to eat.

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,440
They said this soup is for Susu.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,080
You spoil your sister, okay?

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,480
Okay.

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,200
Seriously.

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,040
I'm a little nervous, to be honest.

20
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,920
Why?

21
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,320
Is it because you're too close to me?

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,400
No.

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,480
Love Siblings

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,720
Double love.

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,880
intervention.

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,720
Love and healing variety show.

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,400
Let's welcome

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,240
Next,

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,320
let's move on to the update of this episode.

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,320
Someone is knocking.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,039
Hurry up.

32
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,160
Don't keep us waiting.

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
Hello.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Hello.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,160
Why don't we move the box up first?

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,880
Sure.

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,960
Let me see if it's heavy.

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
A little heavy.

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,240
So active.

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,040
How much do I eat every day?

41
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,840
Thank you.

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,600
It's a bit heavy.

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,520
We didn't know

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,400
what's on our attic.

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,480
It turns out to be your bed.

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,680
I'll go upstairs and take a look.

47
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,840
You need to move left and right on the floor.

48
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,040
The first thing I saw

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,440
Hua and Susu.

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,000
I was roommates with them.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,840
They took me to my bedroom first.

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
They're very warm-hearted.

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,480
Then my box too.

54
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,920
Should I put it down?

55
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,240
Is it convenient to put the box down

56
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,160
or above?

57
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,600
I think I can only put it down.

58
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,800
Okay, put it down.

59
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,920
Are students of Tsinghua so torn?

60
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,320
Are you writing your composition?

61
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,960
Should I reply this message?

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,120
No.

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
You received it?

64
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,480
Yes.

65
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,480
I guess it's Hua.

66
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,440
She said welcome.

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,680
I sent her message to Tae-seo.

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,600
I didn't tell anyone

69
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,320
I didn't go out to play.

70
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,960
Or we did something together.

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,760
We didn't even talk much.

72
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,880
I don't know how to send it.

73
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,280
The only thing I can send is

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,040
if someone is coming,

75
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,880
I think what I can do is

76
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,240
to welcome him.

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,480
Secondly, you may talk too much.

78
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,839
Xinxin should say welcome.

79
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,200
Let's get along.

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,920
I do talk to her

81
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,079
with her.

82
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,160
They're getting along well.

83
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,560
Today's message was from Tae-seo.

84
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,680
I thought no one knew him,

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,400
maybe

86
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,120
send this message.

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,440
I hope he can receive a message

88
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,560
when he comes in.

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,080
In the following journey,

90
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,600
in the next journey.

91
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
I think Tae-seo sent it to me.

92
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,600
Because my brother

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,760
told me

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,280
Terri's first impression

95
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,000
The best girl is me.

96
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,800
Because I think Susu

97
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
on my aesthetic point.

98
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
I was impressed by her.

99
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
But we didn't communicate much.

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,480
When I have feelings for someone,

101
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,760
I will avoid it.

102
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,360
I might pretend not to care.

103
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,840
When the second text came,

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,800
I felt it was soup.

105
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,080
We didn't

106
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,400
we didn't contact or communicate much today.

107
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,360
He also asked me how I was today.

108
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
I was fine.

109
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
Because he sent it to me.

110
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,560
so it's good.

111
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,159
The reason I sent her

112
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,960
Actually,

113
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,480
I feel that you will be happy

114
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,280
with the person you like.

115
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,120
I guess it's Su's.

116
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm quite happy.

117
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,600
Today's message

118
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,640
I still sent him soup.

119
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,880
and praised his sandwich.

120
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,680
Why did I send this text?

121
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,720
I received it as soon as I woke up.

122
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,400
the sandwich he promised to make for me.

123
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,320
So I must write it to him.

124
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,560
To be honest, I can't guess it.

125
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,520
But today,

126
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,800
someone has been repeating this.

127
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,520
It's soup.

128
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,560
The soup

129
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,720
When we talked today,

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,280
whether he sat down

131
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,640
or when he left,

132
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,440
he kept saying he was happy to meet me.

133
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,440
But no one else said that.

134
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,280
But I'm not sure

135
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,400
this text was sent by soup.

136
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,159
Because I didn't feel

137
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,840
what the soup meant to me.

138
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,360
I sent the message to Tata today.

139
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,040
I think you have good taste.

140
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,800
He chose me from the photo of me half a year old.

141
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,360
So I sent a message.

142
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,160
to welcome our new friends.

143
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,560
I think Xinxin

144
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,360
Because I'll talk more to her today.

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,920
When he said he had single eyelids today,

146
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,760
I already thought about what to send him.

147
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,480
I have a little new understanding of Esther.

148
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,840
I think

149
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,240
Compared to my sister,

150
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,880
than my sister.

151
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,280
I didn't say she would be passive.

152
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,159
Tata.

153
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,520
I just think

154
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,400
it's not that awkward to talk to me.

155
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,520
So you chose me

156
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,760
you didn't know me well.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,760
I didn't mean anything else.

158
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,240
I sent it to Harry.

159
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,920
Because I didn't

160
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,040
with him today.

161
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,920
But after the conversation,

162
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,760
we got along well.

163
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,080
I think we can get closer.

164
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,240
I don't think

165
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
to 20 minutes

166
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
How much can you be interested in someone?

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,080
Just to avoid embarrassment.

168
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,760
I think it might be a map.

169
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
I took a photo with him

170
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,040
I took a photo with him.

171
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,120
And he's not here today.

172
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,600
He didn't contact any new girls.

173
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
with other girls.

174
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,640
So he probably gave me

175
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,240
to me.

176
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm very happy.

177
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
It's over.

178
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,240
Very happy. It's over.

179
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,080
Okay.

180
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,640
Before I came,

181
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,400
before I came.

182
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,120
When I think about it,

183
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,240
I thought I had a lot of contact with her.

184
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,360
So I sent her my message.

185
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,880
Harry.

186
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,760
It must be him.

187
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,840
It's long.

188
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
Because only he

189
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
has such language organization ability.

190
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,280
That's his style.

191
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,440
He explained to me

192
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
the day before yesterday.

193
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,920
He's a nerd.

194
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,840
He was still stuck the day before.

195
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,240
He thought I might mind

196
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,080
After all,

197
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,120
for so many days with Xinxin.

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,240
We finally get to know each other.

199
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,040
Can you get to know more about her?

200
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,360
When I saw Xin received two texts,

201
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,480
I knew who it was.

202
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
Harry will definitely send it.

203
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,600
The new Terri won't send it to Xinxin.

204
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,200
This is what I know.

205
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,760
The soup can't be sent to Xinxin suddenly.

206
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,160
I can't send it to Xinxin.

207
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,200
Only the map is left.

208
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,760
Not bad.

209
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,480
Really

210
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,120
Is he really that charming?

211
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,960
The next one.

212
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,040
Your brothers have received

213
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,160
from two men.

214
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,520
I really want to laugh.

215
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,120
I said,

216
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,760
My roommate has a rival.

217
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,640
What should I do?

218
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,120
Both of them are my roommates.

219
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,600
It's kind of like a battlefield.

220
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,120
A man chose Tata.

221
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,440
I think it should be Harry.

222
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,360
Tata also sent the message to Harry.

223
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,600
Maybe Tata will think

224
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
Harry is more interesting.

225
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,000
I haven't received anything for two days.

226
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,120
So I think it's understandable

227
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
it's understandable.

228
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Because in just a few days,

229
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,360
in just a few days.

230
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,240
I didn't receive your message.

231
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
I was

232
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,880
I feel a little disappointed.

233
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,920
Today,

234
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,720
when I didn't communicate

235
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,920
with everyone,

236
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,520
I thought

237
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
I might not be able to receive your message today.

238
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,920
I knew it.

239
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,520
He has zero today.

240
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,480
as I expected.

241
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,800
Because I think

242
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,760
he has been shaken since yesterday.

243
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,560
He'll definitely send it to someone else today.

244
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,400
And he'll probably send it to a new girl.

245
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,480
But when I got along with Hua today,

246
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,440
I think Hua wants to know more about

247
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,680
other boys.

248
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,120
I think

249
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,840
they won't choose each other today.

250
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,280
Good.

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,240
It's fun.

252
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,400
RIC I MJR

253
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,800
RICMJR

254
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,760
RICMJRYI

255
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Don't cry

256
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,280
What's wrong?

257
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,520
What?

258
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,680
This is so funny.

259
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,520
When I didn't receive your message,

260
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,960
I was a little sad.

261
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,880
But when I think back,

262
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,400
I didn't send it to anyone.

263
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,840
So there's nothing to say.

264
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,480
It's normal.

265
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,120
No, he's going to cry.

266
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,880
As expected,

267
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,960
I guess Susu sent it to him.

268
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,080
I saw them getting along well.

269
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,480
Of course, I wasn't there this afternoon.

270
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,280
I don't know

271
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,320
happened.

272
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,400
It's only at night anyway.

273
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,720
for one or two hours.

274
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,760
I think

275
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,600
nothing bad happened.

276
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,760
I'm actually quite surprised.

277
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,800
Xiao Ling

278
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,640
received zero messages before.

279
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,440
I think

280
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,160
you'll be very disappointed

281
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,520
when you receive it for the first time.

282
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,720
We didn't have a chance to communicate today.

283
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,680
And they were all together this afternoon.

284
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,960
I was alone.

285
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,680
I think it's quite normal.

286
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,720
Someone wants to

287
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,400
to the house of siblings.

288
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,600
Are you going to rob me?

289
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,480
You don't want to go?

290
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,520
I want to go.

291
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:53,880
Wait.

292
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
I have to keep my text.

293
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,880
Me too.

294
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
No.

295
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,040
I have to go.

296
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
to discuss.

297
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,480
I'll cook for you tomorrow.

298
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,120
I can make it.

299
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,960
It's been a long time

300
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,360
Me too.

301
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,040
We talked.

302
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,200
I want to go too.

303
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,680
I want to go too.

304
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,360
Me too!

305
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,040
I want to use the house of siblings.

306
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,960
because I haven't seen the map for two days.

307
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
I talked to him.

308
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,080
And I want to tell him

309
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,800
the current situation,

310
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,000
Including the newcomers

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,360
when he came in.

312
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,120
Because he wasn't involved.

313
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,160
I need to eat something.

314
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,640
Should I make noodles?

315
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
What are you talking about?

316
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,560
Make noodles.

317
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,640
Do you want me to cook for you?

318
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,160
Sure.

319
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,880
Okay.

320
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,080
Thank you, Hua.

321
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,360
You're welcome.

322
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,560
I'm so happy.

323
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,920
Do you want noodles?

324
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,640
No.

325
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,240
Sue and Tata seem hungry.

326
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,080
Okay.

327
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll give it to them.

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Let's eat together.

329
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,600
Even cooking.

330
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:04,960
No.

331
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,800
This is the cupboard.

332
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll cook noodles later.

333
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,120
He's hungry too.

334
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:09,880
No.

335
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,120
The map is hungry too.

336
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,440
Amazing.

337
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,560
Add me.

338
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,240
Okay.

339
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,080
There's a cook.

340
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,760
No.

341
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
Tae-seo can do it too.

342
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
No, I can't.

343
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,800
Is your taste heavy or light?

344
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,400
Yes.

345
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,120
Great!

346
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,080
They are so light.

347
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,760
Really.

348
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,760
Why didn't you cook it?

349
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,160
Not you.

350
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,040
Why do you want to eat my cooking so much?

351
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,560
Yes.

352
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,440
Please.

353
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,520
What?

354
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,560
What?

355
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,120
Nothing.

356
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,240
Please.

357
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,080
It's okay.

358
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,800
Do you want noodles for soup?

359
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,760
Master Hua.

360
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,040
Do you want noodles?

361
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,320
No.

362
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,280
Mr. Hua is online again.

363
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,520
Eat.

364
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,760
I even cooked fried pork with chili.

365
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
I want to learn.

366
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,120
So virtuous.

367
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Smells good.

368
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,880
Eat less at night.

369
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,440
Or you will swell tomorrow.

370
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,000
Yes.

371
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
I want some too.

372
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,200
Aren't you eating?

373
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,400
I'm not hungry.

374
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,880
Tu.

375
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,280
Have you eaten the juice wine?

376
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,640
I'm ready to eat.

377
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,080
Chef Hua.

378
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,880
Do you want some?

379
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,720
No.

380
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,960
Fried meat with chili.

381
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,000
Who said that?

382
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,760
It's quite similar.

383
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,120
So standard.

384
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,480
Fried meat with chili.

385
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,120
Don't tell me...

386
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,280
Stop stirring it up.

387
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,600
When you cook noodles

388
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,240
Three kids waiting to feed

389
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,400
Delicious

390
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,880
Eat more meat.

391
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,120
Yes, these are all yours.

392
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,240
I'm afraid of spicy food.

393
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,080
Not spicy.

394
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:47,880
Really not spicy

395
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,280
It's not spicy at all.

396
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,640
Try one.

397
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,440
Is it good?

398
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,560
Yes.

399
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,360
You know what?

400
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,400
Harry bought a ping pong table.

401
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,040
He should arrive the day after tomorrow.

402
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,480
He really bought a ping pong table.

403
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,600
It's funny.

404
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,720
He loves you very much.

405
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,720
Great.

406
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,000
Awesome.

407
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,720
Kids, is it good?

408
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,560
Yes.

409
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,240
Mom.

410
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Thank you, mom.

411
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,680
Thank you.

412
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,160
No, you...

413
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,280
We're not mothers.

414
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,200
We are...

415
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,319
We're here to date.

416
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,040
Are you really going to make me breakfast tomorrow?

417
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,640
I almost had the wrong breakfast today.

418
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,800
I was going to eat.

419
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,760
They said the soup was made for Susu.

420
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,800
I have no food.

421
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,280
I made it myself today.

422
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,240
You spoil your sister, okay?

423
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,640
Okay.

424
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,400
Seriously.

425
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,440
Don't stay up tomorrow.

426
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,840
Okay, get up early.

427
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,360
I wanted to talk to you a lot,

428
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,680
but I'm not in the mood now.

429
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,440
Actually I want to ask Fatty

430
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,320
Why not?

431
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,280
I guess

432
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,840
Because I didn't.

433
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,680
For now,

434
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,440
Soup and Harry

435
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,680
with Soup and Harry.

436
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,080
I think we need two people

437
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,480
to face each other alone

438
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,160
to know who you feel for.

439
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,120
Actually, I support you and soup.

440
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,880
You know what?

441
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,720
I think

442
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,720
I don't deserve it.

443
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,640
I feel

444
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,760
I think the soup is so good.

445
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,320
tall and handsome.

446
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,360
and excellent.

447
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,960
I don't dare to approach him.

448
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,480
When you see us washing the dishes,

449
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,120
you'll think we're...

450
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,320
But we didn't say anything when we were washing the dishes.

451
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,120
So tired.

452
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,920
I want to lie here for a while.

453
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,720
I have a question.

454
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,800
Have you ever cooperated with your brother?

455
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,320
Never.

456
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,400
care.

457
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,880
We don't disturb each other.

458
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,720
If you know

459
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,840
there's something wrong with the girl he likes.

460
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,800
What kind of question?

461
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,520
For example, she's not very

462
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,000
a little bit.

463
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,960
Did you notice

464
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,680
moral bottom line

465
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,720
I didn't find it either.

466
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
But have you heard

467
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,560
this girl likes to play a little.

468
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,000
But I think since it's already spread to me,

469
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,120
my brother should know it too.

470
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,880
Not necessarily.

471
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,800
The one who sees it clearly will be confused.

472
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm fine with anything.

473
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,520
Feel it yourself.

474
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,400
Anyway, we don't have to fight against each other.

475
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,240
We are all like this.

476
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,480
Well,

477
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,400
I think life experiences

478
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,840
experience in life.

479
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,040
Because it's between two people.

480
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,480
I think we should never

481
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,880
into other people's marriage.

482
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,720
In karma.

483
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,400
That's right.

484
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:41,720
is actually

485
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,200
in individual psychology.

486
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,520
Although we are family,

487
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,240
we have our own assignments.

488
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,720
Let's try not to interfere too much.

489
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,520
each other's assignment.

490
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,400
If you interfere too much,

491
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,360
it may cause

492
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,880
the other person's experience

493
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,800
may be affected by you

494
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,040
due to your influence.

495
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,120
Huang Zihong, if you have a brother,

496
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,000
would you help her?

497
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think I will.

498
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,760
Have you ever helped your friends?

499
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,600
A lot.

500
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm a “wingman”.

501
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,960
Can you help him?

502
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,400
Yes.

503
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,600
Because I'm an ENFP.

504
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,240
So I communicate with people.

505
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm

506
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,400
very active.

507
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,680
In the whole process,

508
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,840
I found the happiness of helping others

509
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,160
But I did have

510
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,280
For example, when they are not good,

511
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,960
the result is not good.

512
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,720
and asked me

513
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,400
if I could help them in this situation.

514
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,720
In this situation,

515
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,960
help each other.

516
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,720
I can't help you at the end.

517
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,600
You're so tired.

518
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,640
So tired.

519
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
It's really tiring.

520
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
"Bag after-sales".

521
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,560
Do your best in other people's love.

522
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,800
What about you?

523
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,880
If you have a sister,

524
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,920
would you help me?

525
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,600
I am

526
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,320
in a group,

527
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,360
I'm willing to be a bystander.

528
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,200
and observe everyone.

529
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,560
Eating melon.

530
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,560
If

531
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,760
the bottom line,

532
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,040
I usually don't stop them

533
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,760
or affect

534
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,120
their development.

535
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,320
But when it comes to principles,

536
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,120
you will do it.

537
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,320
and stand up.

538
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,120
OK.

539
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,560
Let's continue.

540
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,080
It's too hard.

541
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,120
It's too hard.

542
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,520
I wanted to talk before I went in.

543
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,960
I couldn't hold it in.

544
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,600
I just want to talk about what to do.

545
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,480
I don't know what to do.

546
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,760
I'm nervous too.

547
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,280
What worries me is

548
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,920
a little unhappy.

549
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,840
I didn't get the text.

550
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,720
The second one is...

551
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,360
I don't know if I should send it to Hua

552
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,520
or my new friend.

553
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,160
Tata.

554
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,880
Say it.

555
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,680
It's too hard.

556
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,440
Are you sad today?

557
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:45,880
Yes.

558
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,280
It's really hard.

559
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,240
Today is the worst day.

560
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,120
How did you know?

561
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,880
I can guess it.

562
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,200
Because I think

563
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,280
your chat with me yesterday

564
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,800
I think you want to get to know each other more.

565
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,800
Today at home,

566
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,080
you didn't interact with Hua.

567
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,200
So I didn't receive any text today.

568
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,120
I'm not worried.

569
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,040
You received zero today.

570
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,120
Because I think you received zero today.

571
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,840
It's a bag.

572
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,200
Why?

573
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,360
Actually, I'm not happy

574
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,040
I'm not very happy.

575
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,640
So you're sure about your feelings now.

576
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,440
Do you want to know more about Xiaoling?

577
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,360
or Tata?

578
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,480
I think we need to get in touch.

579
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,280
So just follow your heart.

580
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,760
Actually, I sent Tata an official message today.

581
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,200
Welcome.

582
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,440
I texted "Nice to meet you".

583
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,440
I think Tata wants to

584
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,600
understand Harry.

585
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,720
Harry.

586
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,840
She said she wanted to

587
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,680
a nice date.

588
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,360
Harry is...

589
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
He said he was awkward.

590
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
So he said he kept talking.

591
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,920
So I had no choice.

592
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
When I sat there and texted,

593
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,440
I was actually...

594
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,320
I feel like you're going to cry.

595
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,640
I really don't know how to send it.

596
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,840
If I keep giving flowers,

597
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,560
I think after two more days,

598
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,440
it's hard for me to say

599
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,040
I need to know more about others.

600
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,680
I don't think it's necessary.

601
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,600
Because I think Hua

602
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,200
in you.

603
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,880
I was at the house of siblings.

604
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,800
I said if you have feelings for her,

605
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,600
you should try

606
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,080
follow your heart.

607
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,800
But you can't say it.

608
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,920
If you choose someone else,

609
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,960
and others don't choose you,

610
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,120
If you go back to find Hua,

611
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,840
Hua won't take you.

612
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,640
Because I know Hua well.

613
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,120
If I don't make a choice today,

614
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,600
and get to know others,

615
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,240
After two more days,

616
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
it will be more unfair.

617
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,680
So I have to make this choice today.

618
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,440
Fine.

619
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,480
Don't you care about me?

620
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,000
Harry and the map?

621
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,200
But if you give me the map today,

622
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,440
I would be surprised.

623
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,720
Because I didn't give him

624
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,600
That map might...

625
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,080
Maybe he didn't come back today.

626
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,560
No.

627
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,880
I've been in contact with Harry for two days.

628
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,360
I think he's quite determined.

629
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,920
If he doesn't,

630
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,880
do you think I can accept that?

631
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,320
If Harry didn't send it to you today,

632
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,560
will you send it to him?

633
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,440
I will.

634
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
Who else should I send it to?

635
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
The new Tarri.

636
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,840
I think he's tall and handsome.

637
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,720
Do you want to know?

638
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,000
No way.

639
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,040
He's tall. He's tall. He's tall.

640
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,240
He's tall, but he's tall.

641
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,960
because he thinks

642
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,160
Tae-ri is more mature

643
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,080
mature and steady.

644
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,120
and older than me.

645
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,680
and taller.

646
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,000
But for now,

647
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,920
I have no feelings for him.

648
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,040
He doesn't have

649
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,080
as your brother.

650
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,280
I think this is more suitable.

651
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,000
If Tae-seo is interested in me,

652
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,680
and we had a little bit of spark

653
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,600
We had a little spark.

654
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,920
I might try.

655
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,240
But if he's not interested,

656
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,160
I won't want to know him.

657
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,800
That's all.

658
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,880
Let's go.

659
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,480
I'm going to write my diary.

660
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Actually I want to ask Fatty

661
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,400
Why not?

662
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,360
Probably.

663
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,720
Because I didn't.

664
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,640
For now,

665
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,400
Soup and Harry

666
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,600
with Soup and Harry.

667
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
I think we need two people

668
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,440
face each other alone.

669
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,600
Like this.

670
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,240
Yes.

671
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,120
Help yourself.

672
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,320
What's wrong?

673
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,440
It's not my fault.

674
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,920
You and your brother have different taste.

675
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,920
How do you know who my brother is?

676
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,960
I can infer

677
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,640
based on these information.

678
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,960
Because I like to guess.

679
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,920
I won't tell you.

680
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,320
Okay.

681
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,120
Then I gradually realize

682
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,400
students in Tsinghua University are so torn.

683
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,480
If you think

684
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,640
you want to go on a date

685
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,360
with the person you like.

686
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,280
Think about it.

687
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,680
If you make a mistake,

688
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,160
it might be a little awkward.

689
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
I'll trust you this time.

690
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,320
Will you choose?

691
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,760
Go ahead.

692
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,360
It's too hard.

693
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,280
Are you sad today?

694
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,040
Yes, really.

695
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,080
Today is the worst day.

696
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,800
How did you know?

697
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,800
I can guess it.

698
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,280
Actually, I support you and soup.

699
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,120
I have a feeling that "An Xiao Niao" doesn't deserve it.

700
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,880
Why not?

701
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,960
I think the soup is so good.

702
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,360
tall, handsome and excellent.

703
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,160
I don't dare to approach him.

704
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,160
Do you want to do something?

705
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,040
Egg soup

706
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,160
Hello chef

707
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,240
I'm here to help you

708
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,280
Help me.

709
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,360
Can you cook this for me?

710
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,840
No wonton

711
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,040
I can only use this.

712
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,840
Give me a shock.

713
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
You're the "lightning man", right?

714
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,960
Crazy.

715
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,000
How can the chef help you?

716
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,160
You didn't cook well yesterday

717
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,320
How dare you cook today?

718
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,240
You have to try if you fail.

719
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,960
Trust me, okay?

720
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,360
You know, yesterday...

721
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,240
Didn't you give me the melatonin?

722
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,720
Don't you let me take two pills?

723
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,200
I did.

724
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,360
Yes, I didn't sleep.

725
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,920
Forget it. Give it back to me.

726
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,320
No, but I didn't dare to eat

727
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,440
I dare not eat it.

728
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,200
Why?

729
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,960
Because there's no water, I swallowed it raw.

730
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,400
Take it down and get water.

731
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,680
You're so lazy.

732
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,360
It's not that lazy.

733
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,120
It's too late. It's tiring.

734
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,280
Because we were whispering.

735
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,960
Who were we whispering to?

736
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,920
Do you have scissors?

737
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,400
Follow.

738
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,320
Yes, over there.

739
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,840
With that.

740
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,600
and soup.

741
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,880
And Tarri.

742
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,480
So the three of you slept together.

743
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,360
How many gossips did you share?

744
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,920
Nothing. How to talk?

745
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,000
Share it with us.

746
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,320
Me too.

747
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,400
What are you?

748
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,720
The gossip about soup.

749
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,640
Hurry up.

750
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,920
Or I'm going out.

751
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,880
Where are you going?

752
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,360
We're going out.

753
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,000
Who?

754
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,960
Us.

755
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,680
Where are you going?

756
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,280
I'm going out.

757
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,400
With whom?

758
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,600
Is this

759
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,440
too long?

760
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,520
I think it's a bit long too.

761
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,600
A bit up.

762
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,600
Yes.

763
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,800
The stylist didn't cut it.

764
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,920
You don't usually cut it yourself.

765
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,240
No.

766
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,560
I don't know how to cut it.

767
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,840
A fixed hairstylist?

768
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,400
Yes.

769
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,440
What are you two doing?

770
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
We're whispering.

771
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,720
Harry won't play with you.

772
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,080
No.

773
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,120
They have so many whispers.

774
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,360
What are you whispering about?

775
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,800
Forget it. I'll help Harry.

776
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,400
Do you need help?

777
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,320
No, very soon.

778
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,400
Soon?

779
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,840
Yes.

780
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,080
Learn from me.

781
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,600
You don't need to learn.

782
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,560
I just learned it.

783
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,600
Let's go.

784
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,120
This is our first group trip.

785
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,840
Everyone.

786
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,520
Yes.

787
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,280
Yes.

788
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,320
I should wear gloves.

789
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,120
What should I do?

790
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,520
It's okay. Don't touch the snow later.

791
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,040
Because the back is crowded.

792
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,080
My short legs.

793
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,560
Your short legs can squeeze.

794
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,960
The longest legs here are us.

795
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,200
It's okay to squeeze me, you know?

796
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,920
I don't agree if it's too crowded in Harry.

797
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,240
Okay.

798
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,720
It's a little shaky.

799
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,840
Do you all have gloves and sunglasses?

800
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,640
Don't you have them?

801
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,240
I took it.

802
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,040
Don't catch a cold.

803
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,000
Where should I throw it?

804
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,880
Let me hold it for you.

805
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,520
Thank you.

806
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,120
Do you want hand cream?

807
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,480
I'll give you some.

808
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,640
Let's go.

809
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,400
Let's film a departure video.

810
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,800
Hua.

811
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
What group are we?

812
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,880
Three, two, one.

813
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,520
The Avengers.

814
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,040
Go!

815
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,200
We must win today.

816
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,640
You win.

817
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,800
We'll win.

818
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,120
We have three E people now.

819
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,080
Add an I (introvert)?

820
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:01,760
Yes.

821
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,440
Are you an I (introverted)?

822
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,680
The three of us are the same, right?

823
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,200
I am.

824
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,080
Are you a happy puppy?

825
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,520
Yes.

826
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,080
We three "Happy Puppies".

827
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,680
Just the three of us.

828
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,800
Yes, the three of us are "puppies".

829
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,560
Just the three of us.

830
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,360
I'm happy now.

831
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,760
Are you really happy?

832
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
I'm happy.

833
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,240
I brought you into a happy puppy today.

834
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,240
Actually, I think

835
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,400
Tata is happy every day.

836
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,880
What time did you get up?

837
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,920
I didn't sleep last night.

838
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,960
Why? Nervous?

839
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,760
No, I don't sleep well.

840
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,960
And I know bed.

841
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,640
I have great sleep quality.

842
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,920
That's great. I really envy you.

843
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,840
But when I sleep,

844
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,920
I still remember leaving half for you.

845
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,560
Did you find anything?

846
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Yes, I know.

847
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,800
You left me a big piece.

848
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,720
When I went to bed,

849
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,760
you were already asleep.

850
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,520
Are you listening?

851
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,200
Yes.

852
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,080
This is my right ear.

853
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,480
I want you to hear my new song.

854
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,880
Have you heard this song?

855
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,800
Trust me. Trust me.

856
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,400
Yes.

857
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,680
I like it.

858
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,400
This is my song from last year.

859
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,160
Really?

860
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,200
I think you're all R&B.

861
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,760
Yes.

862
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
I like it.

863
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,720
They're here to listen to music.

864
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,280
I didn't bring my earphones.

865
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,000
Did you bring your earphones?

866
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,800
No.

867
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,320
They are so romantic.

868
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,400
They even listen to songs.

869
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,080
I'm like playing

870
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,480
Will you sing for me?

871
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,400
Ugly.

872
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,800
For whom?

873
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,440
Let me ask you.

874
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,560
I'm a little nervous, to be honest.

875
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,440
Why?

876
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,120
I don't know.

877
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,360
Is it because you're too close to me?

878
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,440
No.

879
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,000
Is my face big?

880
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,400
I'm wearing these sunglasses too tight.

881
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,800
Maybe my sunglasses shrunk.

882
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,840
Is it hot and cold?

883
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,320
Physics is good.

884
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,560
What do you usually do at work?

885
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,240
Do you take care of cars?

886
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,480
Actually, my main job is sales.

887
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,239
Sales? You're eloquent.

888
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,719
Because I changed a lot.

889
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,600
more clients may want to talk to me.

890
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,120
The adaption is mainly

891
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,560
according to

892
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,719
according to the law.

893
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,199
For example, change the color.

894
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,120
Yes, color is the most basic.

895
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,480
Add some encirclement

896
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,639
What does it mean?

897
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,480
Add a surround.

898
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,400
What do you mean?

899
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,679
Surround, like front shovel, side skirt and tail skirt.

900
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,120
Make it look different from other cars.

901
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,320
Different?

902
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,560
Look, you can understand it this way.

903
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,040
This is when we didn't change it.

904
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,040
This is when we finished.

905
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,800
when we finished.

906
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,760
I changed it too.

907
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,120
Great, Mr. Fatty.

908
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,960
No, I just coordinated.

909
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,040
It's already amazing.

910
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,960
Actually, these things

911
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,920
are produced by others.

912
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,360
I just need to install it.

913
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,840
Yes. Awesome.

914
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,440
Really?

915
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,880
Isn't it?

916
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,920
Why is your name Fatty?

917
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,160
Why did you call me that?

918
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,600
Because... One, this is my nickname.

919
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,080
I saw your first photo.

920
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,840
It was taken at home. Yes.

921
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,320
The first second to open the album

922
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,520
The second one.

923
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The second is...

924
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,560
Go ahead.

925
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,440
I'm going to the car across the street.

926
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,800
I'm going out.

927
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,480
No.

928
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,440
Say it.

929
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,600
The second one is

930
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,960
I came here

931
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,200
I should be the fattest one.

932
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,960
So I think as long as I

933
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,440
I'm fat,

934
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,520
no one would call me fat.

935
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,720
No one will say I'm fat.

936
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,560
That's strange.

937
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,680
If I have another name,

938
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,640
others may say

939
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,240
who is really fat.

940
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,280
If...

941
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,440
The problem is you're not fat.

942
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,520
Of course I am.

943
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Compared to them,

944
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,160
I sometimes mind.

945
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,040
A sensitive little boy.

946
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,080
Not sensitive.

947
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,360
But everyone likes to be praised.

948
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,400
Yeah.

949
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,240
One is “bara la”.

950
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,520
One is...

951
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,520
So tacit.

952
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,160
Do you know what team that is?

953
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,680
The Avengers.

954
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,000
The other car you mentioned?

955
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,640
Yes, the four of them want to defeat us.

956
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,760
Because they failed.

957
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,400
It's okay. We have soup.

958
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,560
We have Xiaoling.

959
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,800
What are you afraid of?

960
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,600
Are we confident?

961
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,680
We're on that team.

962
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,840
Yes, we are traitors.

963
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,120
No, we are spies.

964
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,680
This word

965
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,200
The lyrics make me angry too.

966
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,000
Here we are.

967
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,680
Let's go.

968
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,920
The Avengers attack.

969
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,640
Go!

970
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,760
I'll show you

971
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,600
the fighting Araska.

972
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Come on.

973
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,440
Three, two, one.

974
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,640
You have to run.

975
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
With...

976
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,760
Okay, play like this.

977
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,280
Okay.

978
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,400
Let's compete with the soup again.

979
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,920
Here, Harry.

980
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,440
Let's stand here.

981
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,640
Okay. Come on.

982
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,720
Look at Harry. I really want to hit him.

983
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,880
He's really...

984
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,520
by the swimming pool?

985
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,240
My destination line.

986
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,400
The finish line.

987
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,520
You're so elegant here.

988
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Listen to the command. Three, two, one.

989
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,320
Come on, Tu.

990
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,440
Come on, Tu.

991
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,920
Come on, Tu.

992
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
Tu.

993
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,080
Go for the soup!

994
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,520
Come on, Tu.

995
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,560
Come on, Tu. Come on.

996
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,600
Almost.

997
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,560
Soup first.

998
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,240
My eyes are feet.

999
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,360
It's okay. It's amazing.

1000
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,120
Almost.

1001
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,680
Soup, your backend is very fast.

1002
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,960
Maybe the step of ping pong.

1003
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,240
Next game.

1004
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,680
This is the four of us pedaling together.

1005
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,560
Let's see who rides faster.

1006
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,680
How many laps can you turn in 30 seconds?

1007
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,560
Sure.

1008
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,120
How many turns can you turn in 30 seconds?

1009
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,480
Sure.

1010
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,960
We boys will help.

1011
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,280
Two boys.

1012
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,720
I'll go easy on you.

1013
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,040
I'll do the same.

1014
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,560
Let's see if you're helping or not.

1015
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,480
Step back.

1016
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,720
All of you.

1017
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,080
Listen to my command.

1018
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,840
Three, two, one, go.

1019
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:52,680
Circle.

1020
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,160
One circle.

1021
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,400
Xiao Ling.

1022
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,000
Among the three boys,

1023
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,320
Four masters.

1024
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,440
Don't make me laugh.

1025
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,760
Three laps.

1026
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,640
How many seconds?

1027
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,040
21 22

1028
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,640
Why is it stuck?

1029
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,280
It's stuck.

1030
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,520
Is this how you help?

1031
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,600
Come down and adjust.

1032
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,040
Go.

1033
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,760
Okay, it's over.

1034
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,480
Three laps.

1035
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,600
I think we won too.

1036
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,200
I'll brake when you step on it.

1037
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,400
Let's do it.

1038
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,040
Let's do it.

1039
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,680
Come on.

1040
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,600
Okay, do you need my help, Tu?

1041
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,640
I need their help.

1042
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,440
Just remember the number.

1043
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,520
Wait.

1044
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,640
Three, two, one, go.

1045
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,640
They are so fast.

1046
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,800
Look at the map.

1047
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,560
You're taking off.

1048
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,440
Four laps.

1049
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,160
You are like a top.

1050
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,400
The map is working hard.

1051
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,920
Seven laps.

1052
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,560
I'm going to faint.

1053
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,480
Nine circles.

1054
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,160
Did the map give you money?

1055
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,600
We ride like this.

1056
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,960
We're a team.

1057
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,480
This is my team.

1058
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,680
Go!

1059
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,400
So the map is fake?

1060
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,200
The map is in the fake gang.

1061
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,200
I'll just...

1062
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,480
Next group.

1063
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,760
Harry.

1064
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,160
Let's go.

1065
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,640
Who should we choose?

1066
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,880
I choose the drawing.

1067
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,440
Okay.

1068
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,640
Here.

1069
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,720
What are you doing? Come back!

1070
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,040
If you don't go up, I'll...

1071
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,040
You know.

1072
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,960
Xinxin, come on.

1073
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,160
Two, one, go.

1074
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,640
The map is totally different.

1075
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,400
Come on, Harry!

1076
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,440
Wait. Stop.

1077
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,960
Stop. My phone is frozen.

1078
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,880
I didn't record it.

1079
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,200
White Ride.

1080
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,240
It doesn't count.

1081
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,520
I'm tired.

1082
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,560
Tired.

1083
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,920
Ready, go.

1084
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,880
Come on, Harry.

1085
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,600
Can you do it, bro?

1086
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,760
I'm pedaling. I'm pedaling.

1087
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,600
Don't bully Tu.

1088
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,320
Good luck.

1089
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,560
I'm a little tired.

1090
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,560
Me too.

1091
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,840
My legs are sore, you know?

1092
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,120
The four of you feel sad.

1093
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,200
Five seconds left.

1094
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,760
You can kick twice.

1095
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:04,920
Stop.

1096
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,640
The map is crazy.

1097
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,680
Map.

1098
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,640
Six.

1099
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,200
Map.

1100
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,120
Finally, I got a big move.

1101
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,640
A big trick.

1102
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,880
How many rounds did the first place take?

1103
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,920
Nine circles.

1104
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,160
I can't surpass it.

1105
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,640
See if you can surpass nine laps.

1106
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,240
If you do, you'll be the first.

1107
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:20,920
Who do you want?

1108
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,600
Harry.

1109
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,560
I'll do my best.

1110
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,640
You have to.

1111
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,720
Help me.

1112
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,960
Come on, Harry!

1113
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,760
You must be number one.

1114
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,400
I can't ride it. I can't ride it.

1115
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,440
I can't.

1116
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,920
OK. No.2, one lap. OK. OK.

1117
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,560
I can't ride it.

1118
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,840
We're here.

1119
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,840
Go. The map needs you.

1120
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,800
I worked so hard.

1121
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,680
Map

1122
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,320
I'm sorry. Try harder.

1123
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,480
I'll give you eight laps, okay?

1124
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,400
Tata.

1125
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
You want me?

1126
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,440
Come on.

1127
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,760
Three, two, one.

1128
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,720
Three, two, one. The Avengers.

1129
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,240
Go!

1130
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,080
We'll win today.

1131
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,640
Hurry up.

1132
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,080
Four cows and horses.

1133
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,640
It's stuck.

1134
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,440
Push it.

1135
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,120
I'm falling for it.

1136
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,800
It's stuck. Push it.

1137
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,880
Push it.

1138
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,400
Okay, three laps.

1139
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,440
I'm stuck.

1140
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,960
It's my first time playing this kind of ice project.

1141
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,640
I feel very fresh.

1142
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,840
And with the drawing,

1143
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,680
He worked so hard

1144
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,240
to win the first place.

1145
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,440
The whole process was very fun.

1146
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:37,880
Let's go.

1147
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,760
I had fun today.

1148
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,280
I can feel Tata.

1149
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,480
It's because she's been a group pet since she was a kid.

1150
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:43,920
Right?

1151
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,000
When a family grows up,

1152
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,960
she has a strong sense of dependence.

1153
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,560
The education of parents

1154
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,080
are totally different

1155
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,800
He dotes on his daughter very much.

1156
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,120
Yes.

1157
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,760
I'm curious.

1158
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,480
Zun, Dan,

1159
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,960
What's the difference

1160
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,040
the way you educate your children?

1161
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,320
When I was young,

1162
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,800
in childhood.

1163
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,760
But my daughter has grown up.

1164
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,760
I'm 14 years old.

1165
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,640
She may be more sensible and mature.

1166
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,240
That girl is more sensitive.

1167
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,600
Yes.

1168
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,400
Right?

1169
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,000
So when you talk to a girl,

1170
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,240
think about something first.

1171
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,800
Right.

1172
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,520
I didn't want her to think too much.

1173
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,960
But my son won't think too much.

1174
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,960
He's straightforward.

1175
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,000
Just say whatever you want.

1176
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,360
Yes.

1177
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,240
They fight at home

1178
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,760
or grab things.

1179
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,400
Two or three years ago.

1180
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,080
At that time, I thought

1181
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,360
why my brother likes teasing me so much.

1182
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,720
You know? He's naughty.

1183
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,960
I like to see her angry.

1184
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
Yes, my sister is very interested

1185
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,000
I can see

1186
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:42,800
I can see it.

1187
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,880
she just wants to tease her brother.

1188
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,440
Yes.

1189
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,760
But they are not evil.

1190
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,840
They just want to play with her and tease her.

1191
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,720
Now you're numb

1192
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,120
Yes

1193
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,080
Because you used to

1194
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,800
fight with him.

1195
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,600
now.

1196
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,720
I accept it now.

1197
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,680
Finally.

1198
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,080
Yes.

1199
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,200
So it will get better.

1200
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,440
Let's turn it around.

1201
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,400
The elder sister teases the younger brother.

1202
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,840
The younger brother is under sister's control.

1203
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,920
Yes, you can control your brother if you like.

1204
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,280
Your sister is a tough girl.

1205
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,200
She may look delicate,

1206
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,240
but she's really serious.

1207
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,160
and taught him

1208
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,880
The younger one always takes the bait.

1209
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,000
He gave full response.

1210
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,760
So you're happy.

1211
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,960
Just like me and my brother.

1212
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,400
Yes.

1213
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,480
Hold it.

1214
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,480
In the next episode,

1215
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,840
(We'll have a protective date for boys.)

1216
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,240
They will accept

1217
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,080
in the secret mirror room.

1218
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,440
the girl's brother.

1219
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,520
Let's look forward to it together.

1220
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,640
That's all for this episode.

1221
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,640
Love Siblings.

1222
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,160
Let love double.

1223
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,600
Boys' guardian date

1224
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,880
have been invited.

1225
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,560
The siblings invited by many boys

1226
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,600
to the Mirror House.

1227
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,880
Is she your first choice?

1228
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,800
Why didn't she receive

1229
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,560
her feelings?

1230
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,760
Can you feel

1231
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,680
her happy moments?

1232
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,680
If this date

1233
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,320
this date successfully,

1234
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,640
