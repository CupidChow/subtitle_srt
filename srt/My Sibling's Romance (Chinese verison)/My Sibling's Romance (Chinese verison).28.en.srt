It feels like we'll have some wild wine.

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It's like drinking wild wine

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

Dating Tata is really fun.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,759
I think

11
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,600
if I value one thing,

12
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,840
I would have prepared a lot in advance.

13
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,560
Their food

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,000
are good.

15
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,400
I think it's a local specialty in Beijing.

16
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,240
It can also express my feelings.

17
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,520
I'm a little nervous.

18
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,840
Because I'm afraid this date will be ruined.

19
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,000
or make her hate it.

20
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,040
She won't bite me, will she? She won't bite me.

21
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,120
Hey.

22
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,400
I almost thought it was...

23
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Let's go.

24
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,400
Did you wait long?

25
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,920
Did you wait long here?

26
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
Yes, here.

27
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,280
for a while.

28
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,880
Okay.

29
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,360
It's finally your turn to wait for me.

30
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,880
I waited for you many times.

31
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,920
You waited for me many times.

32
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,520
Yes.

33
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,680
Just once.

34
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,840
Twice.

35
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
The first time counts.

36
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,960
Let's sit inside.

37
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,520
Have you eaten?

38
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,480
Did you

39
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,640
Did you cook noodles?

40
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,440
Yes.

41
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,040
Let's start.

42
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,320
Are you nervous?

43
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,600
Yes.

44
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,080
I'm not asking you.

45
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,560
Are you nervous?

46
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,080
At first,

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm fine.

48
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,640
You know? I'm starving.

49
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,840
I haven't eaten all day.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,519
I'm fine.

51
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,760
I ordered a lot.

52
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,360
Did you choose the place?

53
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,360
Of course.

54
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,320
Choose carefully.

55
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,080
Wait.

56
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
Take a look.

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,640
I have a small note.

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,080
A small note?

59
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,200
Why are you taking notes?

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
I don't know what to do.

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
You know?

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,960
I don't have any notes.

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,200
Did your brother choose this date?

64
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,120
Or will he communicate with you

65
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,720
with you.

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,320
So you heard what I said.

67
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,800
He told me.

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,840
I don't think he knows.

69
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,280
Do you know how fast I speak?

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,520
I speak faster

71
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,080
faster.

72
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,880
He said

73
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,040
more serious than usual.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,880
I'm too serious.

75
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,240
I don't think I've been so serious in my life.

76
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,200
I was so embarrassed

77
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,720
with the mirror.

78
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,320
I kept touching here.

79
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,640
I didn't know it was a one-sided mirror.

80
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,680
I can't see him at all.

81
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,400
So you don't know who's opposite.

82
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,360
I thought it was you.

83
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
and him.

84
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,040
I feel like I'm being interviewed.

85
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,760
I'm very upright.

86
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,440
I've never been so upright in my life.

87
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,160
Why?

88
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,800
Why are you nervous about him?

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,120
I'm nervous about you two.

90
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,400
I thought you two

91
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,920
you won't be nervous when I'm not around.

92
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,120
I feel better without you.

93
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
Yes.

94
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,720
Why?

95
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,640
Because I'm telling the truth.

96
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,400
I meant it.

97
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,120
Brother.

98
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,920
I got some information.

99
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,280
What information?

100
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,520
First, when you're in a relationship,

101
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,320
you're very clingy.

102
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,960
He said that.

103
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,360
He said in a relationship,

104
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,400
when you're in love?

105
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,240
So I said,

106
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,200
I'll think about it.

107
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,280
I see.

108
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,400
You're so clingy.

109
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,360
You're definitely clingy.

110
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,480
So your answer is based on

111
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,040
based on his question?

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,520
Or are you the real answer?

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
My real answer

114
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,920
You're also very clingy.

115
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,440
You know that?

116
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,040
He told me.

117
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,360
I just

118
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,840
to answer my true thoughts.

119
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,080
I'm so real.

120
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,240
I know.

121
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,960
How clingy.

122
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,880
I don't know.

123
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,840
You don't know either.

124
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,240
I'm actually the kind of person

125
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
everything I do.

126
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,440
Why did you choose me?

127
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,800
What do you think?

128
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,440
Don't ask me

129
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Why?

130
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,240
Guess who else we interviewed.

131
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,240
Map.

132
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,000
What else?

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,520
No.

134
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,600
Do you think

135
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,280
from the drawing?

136
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:52,880
No.

137
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,840
Answer my question first.

138
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
before I answer your question.

139
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,760
Whatever.

140
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,200
Answer me first.

141
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,240
Whether it's love

142
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,000
or my family,

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,840
I seldom express my true thoughts.

144
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,040
Because it's not necessary.

145
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,760
When we have feelings,

146
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,680
we're already together.

147
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
I'll be more secretive.

148
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,240
and consuming.

149
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,320
Even if

150
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,120
it's really

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,600
You're actually quite exhausted.

152
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:18,880
Yes.

153
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,640
In that room,

154
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,240
in the room

155
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,280
everything.

156
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,320
I think

157
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,760
I can do.

158
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,120
I can do

159
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
in words.

160
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,560
For now.

161
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,800
So maybe

162
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,360
I really touched Tae-seo.

163
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,960
In fact, your answer

164
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,120
is more sincere than the map.

165
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
And I think

166
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,840
want this chance more.

167
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,520
Just this once?

168
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,440
That means...

169
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,560
Who knows if you'll do it again?

170
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,520
You have an interview next time, right?

171
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,160
Where's my meal?

172
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,880
Did you order?

173
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes.

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,760
Four or five hours ago.

175
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
I've ordered everything.

176
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,440
I prepared everything in advance.

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Before our date.

178
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,120
I fell asleep at four last night.

179
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,600
I've been doing a lot of strategies.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,560
Really.

181
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,200
So tired.

182
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,000
Thank you.

183
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,240
Wait.

184
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,840
Pinky swear.

185
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
Let me see.

186
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,960
Let me show you.

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,039
Is it too much?

188
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,159
I'm not asking questions.

189
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,000
Just a little.

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,360
I know.

191
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,640
This is your little task.

192
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,360
I gave it to myself.

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,039
I'm afraid I'll say I forgot it.

194
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,640
I forgot it.

195
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,480
including order.

196
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,880
I wrote it down too.

197
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,840
In case I forget.

198
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,280
This one too.

199
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,120
Don't be shy.

200
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,720
You're not hot.

201
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm fine.

202
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,600
I just came in.

203
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,360
I'm sweating.

204
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,120
Really.

205
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
Are you nervous?

206
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
Which time are you the most nervous?

207
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,480
I'm the most nervous this time.

208
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,800
This time,

209
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,680
You said yesterday

210
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,480
I was most nervous yesterday.

211
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,800
No.

212
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,280
I'm the most nervous this time.

213
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,920
Do you know why?

214
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,880
Why?

215
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,280
Today is your birthday.

216
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,080
From my point of view,

217
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,360
the ceremony may be very important.

218
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,160
And I'm afraid you'll choose me.

219
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,880
and I couldn't arrange it well.

220
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,840
I feel pressured.

221
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,560
It's okay.

222
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,800
Whether it's a date or a birthday,

223
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,320
I feel pressured.

224
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,400
I'm so stressed.

225
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,560
He'll put pressure on himself.

226
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,280
It's internal consumption.

227
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,240
I'm struggling.

228
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,960
You know what?

229
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,840
Birthday.

230
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,320
Every day is my birthday.

231
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I spend my 18th birthday every day.

232
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm so nervous.

233
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't be nervous.

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,040
Really, no water.

235
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,880
Should I add some water?

236
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,680
You can drink it strategically.

237
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
Why is the window open?

238
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
Because I want to see that.

239
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,520
I've been here before.

240
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,120
A few times.

241
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,760
I always came here when I was young.

242
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,960
Who did you come with

243
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,880
Mom and Dad.

244
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,360
I don't believe it.

245
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,040
I swear.

246
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,520
It's a bit noisy, to be honest.

247
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,320
Can you let her go down?

248
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,560
I want to talk.

249
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,480
But she's a bit noisy.

250
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,960
This is our second date.

251
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,360
Do you think

252
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,520
pick me?

253
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,400
In other words, it depends on the answer

254
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,640
or the answer?

255
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,600
It depends.

256
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,520
The latter.

257
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,400
It depends on your performance.

258
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,120
Look.

259
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,000
If

260
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,160
Go ahead.

261
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,760
I'll close the window first.

262
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,120
No one can disturb my date.

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Is there anyone else

264
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,240
Is there anyone else you want to know?

265
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
No.

266
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,440
In a relationship,

267
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,840
in love

268
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,680
or

269
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,280
a receptive personality.

270
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,720
I may accept more than you.

271
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
But I will also

272
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,400
more votes.

273
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,960
For example,

274
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,000
70 percent.

275
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,600
60.

276
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,280
I don't know.

277
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,920
Do you know what I said?

278
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,080
You said you're devoted.

279
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,480
I mean 100 percent.

280
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,200
Sometimes it's not.

281
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,040
I said I was...

282
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,360
Come in.

283
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,880
But you can't get it like this.

284
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,080
Why can't you get it for me?

285
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,040
I can get it for you.

286
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,280
Isn't it 30 or 40 percent

287
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,560
a dedicated personality?

288
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,440
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,760
I'll clip it.

290
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,680
Are you in love?

291
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,880
What do you think?

292
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,600
I don't know.

293
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
But I think

294
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,920
are usually lovers.

295
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,320
Right?

296
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,360
I'm obviously a romantic person.

297
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,920
including my mom and dad would say

298
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,120
that I'm special.

299
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
As long as I get stuck in the whirlpool of love,

300
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,160
I...

301
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,480
I can't help myself.

302
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,840
Really.

303
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,000
Eat.

304
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,400
Can you eat when I watch you eat?

305
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,640
No.

306
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,360
Why?

307
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,160
I'm nervous.

308
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,200
You said you weren't nervous.

309
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,720
Look at me.

310
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,280
Why am I not nervous?

311
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,880
I'll watch you eat while eating.

312
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,840
Your birthday

313
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,280
your birthday.

314
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,440
Too much.

315
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,920
We have to eat Peking Duck in Beijing.

316
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,240
You're shy.

317
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,400
You're shy.

318
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,880
What's wrong?

319
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,720
You're shy.

320
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm not shy.

321
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,720
and not nervous.

322
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
After the interview,

323
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,080
do you think I will choose you?

324
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,760
How many percent do you have?

325
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,440
Why?

326
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm the kind of person

327
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,320
and tell me something,

328
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,120
I would take the initiative.

329
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,520
But I didn't receive any signal.

330
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,840
I still

331
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
I won't pretend to be fat

332
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,080
Not confident.

333
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,880
So,

334
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,960
some people need to

335
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,000
give a hint.

336
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,840
Didn't I ask you about the bracelet yesterday?

337
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,360
I went to buy you bracelets today.

338
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,480
So I got up so early.

339
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,360
There was a traffic jam.

340
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,760
You don't know how traffic is.

341
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,200
I haven't seen so many people in a long time.

342
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,120
And...

343
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,160
where did you buy it?

344
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,400
I bought it at Yonghe Palace.

345
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,760
Really

346
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,560
It takes a long queue.

347
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,320
It's just a queue.

348
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,840
Thank you.

349
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,680
Green.

350
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,560
Thank you.

351
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,840
Tired.

352
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,760
So tired.

353
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,880
Thank you.

354
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,920
Just so so

355
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,760
It must be hard.

356
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,960
I think many things

357
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,920
surprised me.

358
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,560
This kind of surprise

359
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,000
So cute?

360
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,240
Three.

361
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,360
Wait.

362
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,320
Great.

363
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,840
Eat the noodles.

364
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,960
Longevity noodles.

365
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,400
It's not as good as your cooking.

366
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,320
Really?

367
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,560
You're so good at comforting me.

368
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,880
Do you know what peony is?

369
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,920
This is peony.

370
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,560
It's pretty.

371
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,440
Three.

372
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,600
Let's go.

373
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,240
Can it do it?

374
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,000
Should I hug it?

375
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,880
It can...

376
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,040
Stay here, Bai.

377
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,800
Is it enough? (Surprise)

378
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,079
I thought about it for a long time yesterday.

379
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,640
It reminds me of four in the morning, you know?

380
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,680
It's stressful.

381
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,880
You make me a little embarrassed.

382
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,160
Let's go.

383
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,120
Stop laughing.

384
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,880
Welcome.

385
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,520
Hello.

386
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,040
Welcome to

387
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,920
the Natural Education Theme Hall at the Startle.

388
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,240
We can show you around.

389
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,800
Can we do something now?

390
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,680
Yes.

391
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,120
We can make some specimens here.

392
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,440
Let's take a look

393
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,560
and then decide.

394
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,640
Our main move is to go upstairs first.

395
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,160
Next floor.

396
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,400
I smell insects.

397
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:08,640
You look like RK.

398
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,800
Like this.

399
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,080
The biggest feature of our centre.

400
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,560
These three pots are...

401
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,000
Chameleons.

402
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:14,800
Yes.

403
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,440
This is a Colorful Chameleon.

404
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,520
It's also the best color

405
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,760
in the world.

406
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,920
This is a national second-level protective animal.

407
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,920
This year is not the Snake Year, right?

408
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,640
It's the Snake year.

409
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,880
It's a representative species.

410
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,360
The snakes here

411
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
This experience

412
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,680
I think we can all have a try.

413
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,440
The tennis python is good.

414
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,560
The tennis python

415
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,360
in China.

416
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,920
It's a protective animal.

417
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,040
Really?

418
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,200
Then why is it called the tennis python?

419
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Because it was frightened

420
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,040
or in danger.

421
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,920
It reacts like a turtle shell.

422
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,520
It shrinks into a ball shape.

423
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,600
That's why I call it a tennis python.

424
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,880
He's quite cute.

425
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,520
Here.

426
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,440
No.

427
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,040
Put it back.

428
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,640
Here.

429
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,720
Really?

430
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,800
I can't.

431
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,560
I think the eyelashes guard the palace is the cutest.

432
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,400
But I didn't raise it.

433
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,520
I'll show you something more interesting

434
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,040
Interesting.

435
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,920
Fat tail guard the palace.

436
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,760
No, Titan Guard.

437
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,960
It's too ugly.

438
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,480
But it feels good.

439
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,760
It's definitely better than eyelashes guarding the palace.

440
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,960
I don't want to touch it.

441
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,000
It may not look good.

442
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,280
But the texture is the texture of silk.

443
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,920
Yes.

444
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
I knew it would want to dance.

445
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,240
It's okay.

446
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,720
Why do they have this skill?

447
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,360
Because their origin

448
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,760
jumped from this tree to another tree.

449
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,120
Yes, they're just sitting on a tree.

450
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,920
Here.

451
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,680
I don't want it.

452
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,640
You don't want it?

453
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,880
I don't know what to say.

454
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,840
He's a bit ugly.

455
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
You scared me.

456
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Let's go this way.

457
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,640
There are some

458
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,040
in this area.

459
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,520
Maybe girls like it.

460
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,600
Let me show you one.

461
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,000
At present,

462
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,160
in the market.

463
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,920
Dragon Cat.

464
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,880
My scientific name is Mouse.

465
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
It's also called South America Chestnut Mouse.

466
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,400
It's so active.

467
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,280
Three, two, one.

468
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,240
Just like you, Iron Head.

469
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,200
It feels weird.

470
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,680
The first reaction is

471
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,040
I was a little against and scared.

472
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,280
We seldom

473
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,800
in life.

474
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,560
But I think he basically

475
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,640
know everything.

476
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,160
And many of them have been raised by themselves.

477
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,880
The experience is quite interesting.

478
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,640
Let's go.

479
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,320
After the overall talk,

480
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,560
quite good.

481
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,720
It's not as awkward and nervous as before.

482
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,400
He really wants to give me

483
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,960
a memorable birthday.

484
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,880
He wants to make me happy.

485
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,200
And he will put what he wants

486
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,880
to his actions.

487
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,640
Dating Tata

488
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,000
I was very happy.

489
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,120
I can't tell you about this date.

490
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,280
100% satisfied.

491
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,680
But it's a very good approach.

492
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,320
It's a date that keeps going up.

493
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,920
I like it.

494
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,000
She's already so happy.

495
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,320
It's worth it.

496
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,600
It's worth doing everything.

497
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,200
Yes.

498
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,200
Good evening.

499
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,120
It's too cold.

500
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,760
Thank you.

501
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,440
Did you miss me?

502
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:56,920
What?

503
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,640
Did you miss me?

504
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,360
Yes.

505
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,160
Linlin!

506
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,320
I've been waiting for you.

507
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,640
What's wrong?

508
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,320
Waiting for you.

509
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,520
because you were waiting for us?

510
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,920
Do you know what we were doing today?

511
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,440
What did we do?

512
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
Let me show you.

513
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,280
What did I do today?

514
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,640
Show.

515
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,800
Wait.

516
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,520
I have a gift for you. Wait.

517
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,040
It's not me.

518
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,160
I just took off my clothes.

519
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,680
Not me.

520
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,920
I'm going to put something down.

521
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,640
Fatty.

522
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,560
Good evening.

523
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,680
What is this?

524
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,280
I made this.

525
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,680
You didn't even look at it.

526
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,240
Let me see what it is.

527
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,080
ecological tank.

528
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,080
Ling'er.

529
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,560
Did you see it?

530
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,160
Did you see the gift I brought you?

531
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,600
The ecosystem box.

532
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,120
Are you kidding me?

533
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,560
You two are awesome.

534
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,600
Do you have any male friends?

535
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,040
You said it was good?

536
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,400
A very good man.

537
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,120
a very good male friend.

538
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,000
How good are you?

539
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,200
So good that

540
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,720
She asked me to think about it.

541
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,600
How?

542
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,680
you and your male friends

543
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,280
are friends.

544
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,640
What are they talking about?

545
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,520
About what?

546
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,240
you think we can't talk anymore?

547
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,280
I never talk to her.

548
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,080
I only talk when I'm out.

549
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,440
Where are you?

550
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,240
Are we there?

551
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,760
Or if there's any problem,

552
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,080
I won't look for her.

553
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,240
I don't look for anyone when I encounter problems.

554
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,160
I will digest it myself.

555
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,400
I won't find anyone else.

556
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,960
So you will...

557
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,360
It's impossible to be alone.

558
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,280
How do you know what I'm asking?

559
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,120
It's impossible to be alone.

560
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,080
What is it?

561
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,560
I want to tell you something.

562
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,400
But I can't tell you.

563
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Tell me.

564
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,320
What is it?

565
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,760
What is it?

566
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,080
Nothing.

567
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,520
I didn't ask you to tell me what it is.

568
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,360
About what?

569
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,120
About what?

570
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,920
It's about the house.

571
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,440
Thank you.

572
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Tell me something about the model next time.

573
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:13,840
What?

574
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,360
Tell me next time.

575
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,680
about your model.

576
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,880
I'm fine.

577
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,640
Thank you.

578
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,160
It's the weekend.

579
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,960
Let's have fun together.

580
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,680
It's like a "bomb".

581
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,960
A is one.

582
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,760
Wang is fourteen.

583
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,800
The king is 15.

584
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,480
For example, I got 4.

585
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,280
So I started to say one.

586
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,880
You can tell a number or two numbers.

587
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,680
Whoever calls "Lei" will lose.

588
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,160
Got it.

589
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,520
If anyone loses,

590
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,880
we have to follow this

591
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,920
on this.

592
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,640
OK. Come on.

593
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,520
The first round.

594
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Two, three.

595
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,840
Awesome.

596
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,600
I choose grapefruit juice and grape juice.

597
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,280
Two three

598
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,240
Four.

599
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,360
Five, six.

600
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:58,840
Seven.

601
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,640
It exploded.

602
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,160
You're blown up.

603
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,280
I got fruit cubes and soda.

604
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,920
OK. Come on.

605
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,360
This number is a little difficult.

606
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,120
Three.

607
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,680
Four.

608
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,080
Five.

609
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,520
Six.

610
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,240
Seven.

611
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,120
Nine.

612
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,840
Ten.

613
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,080
12

614
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,720
Thirteen.

615
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,960
Fourteen.

616
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,040
That's me.

617
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,960
15.

618
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,120
Yes.

619
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,800
You exploded.

620
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,720
The king is 15.

621
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,600
This is...

622
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,680
Fried wine.

623
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,640
You know what?

624
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,560
It's so easy to come here.

625
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,440
Yes.

626
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,280
Not bad.

627
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,160
Sure enough, everything tastes good.

628
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,200
Amazing.

629
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,640
I'm "blown".

630
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,600
Let's go.

631
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,160
A big bag.

632
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,680
What?

633
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,720
I mean big bags

634
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,040
It's really shopping.

635
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,440
It's okay.

636
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,640
We brought you some gifts.

637
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
No one cares

638
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
No one cares

639
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,120
I brought you food.

640
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,800
Okay.

641
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,400
Where have you been?

642
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,360
What took you so long?

643
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,160
Yes.

644
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,720
Far.

645
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,240
Very far.

646
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,120
Traffic jam.

647
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,040
There's a doorbell.

648
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,640
No mission.

649
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,440
There are flowers.

650
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,240
There are flowers.

651
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,800
Yes.

652
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,760
Tata.

653
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:44,720
What?

654
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,800
There's a card.

655
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,520
Really

656
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,160
I'm so jealous.

657
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,880
Why isn't Terri here?

658
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,160
Tata, happy birthday.

659
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,480
Brother.

660
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,880
I'm so jealous.

661
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,160
Tata's Life album.

662
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,600
Come on.

663
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,680
We need to continue.

664
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,480
What's wrong?

665
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,080
This is hers.

666
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,120
Liberation.

667
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,760
Tell us.

668
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,560
Don't read it yourself.

669
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,080
Take a look.

670
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,480
I don't remember this photo.

671
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,040
So cute.

672
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,040
This is the photo they took for me

673
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,240
they took for me.

674
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,480
I still remember I choked on water when I went down the sea.

675
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,240
This is a photo taken

676
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,120
when I was a kid.

677
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,360
I learned it for six or seven years when I was young.

678
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,280
folk dance.

679
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,360
This was before.

680
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,680
I didn't see it.

681
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,840
So ugly.

682
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,120
Stop looking.

683
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,240
I didn't see it.

684
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,840
Let me see it again.

685
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,280
So ugly.

686
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,080
Stop looking, please.

687
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,360
Take a look.

688
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,080
Pretty.

689
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
When you have long hair

690
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,600
She's always so thin.

691
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,440
This is the photo

692
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,520
This is the photo on the press conference.

693
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,880
No wonder it looks so familiar.

694
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,760
Have you seen it?

695
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,680
Really?

696
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,400
This is my mom and dad.

697
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
and my brother.

698
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,600
Let me see what your brother looks like.

699
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Your brother?

700
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,680
Let me see.

701
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,240
Okay.

702
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,040
My brother and I are next.

703
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,200
I should be three years old.

704
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,320
When I was a kid,

705
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,080
I liked to be three

706
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,800
Because you were three years old

707
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,600
You had the same hairstyle back then.

708
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,400
The bangs were welded.

709
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,960
Welding.

710
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,480
Yes, iron bangs.

711
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,440
Okay. And...

712
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,400
What is this?

713
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,480
This is

714
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,120
my brothers and I.

715
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,680
We've been eating since childhood.

716
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,760
We won't be modest to each other.

717
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,280
We just want this piece of cake.

718
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,400
What is this?

719
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,240
He's not Tae-ri.

720
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,880
My brother.

721
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,880
I fooled you all.

722
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,600
So this flower

723
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,040
is my real brother.

724
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,920
I was fooled.

725
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,920
Really?

726
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,680
Yes.

727
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,840
Tae-seo isn't her brother.

728
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,320
I was quite shocked.

729
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,320
My first reaction was that I didn't believe it.

730
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,400
But the more they said it,

731
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,040
the evidence was in front of you.

732
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,200
I have to believe it.

733
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,400
I think

734
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,040
Think about the past few days.

735
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,560
It was really fun.

736
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,400
I was surprised.

737
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,200
But because

738
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,120
Tata told me two days ago

739
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,120
I have something to tell you in two days.

740
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,760
A little bit of 20 percent

741
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,880
to 30 percent.

742
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,840
But I'm sure

743
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,880
Surprise is more than my guess.

744
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,400
Yes.

745
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,320
Is that what you want to tell me?

746
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,560
Really.

747
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,520
You made me speechless.

748
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,880
What are you talking about?

749
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,000
Next.

750
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,920
Look at her brother now.

751
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,760
This is a photo

752
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,080
outside the show.

753
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,520
Let me see.

754
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:39,960
Let me see.

755
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,160
So handsome.

756
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,320
Really

757
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,840
This is so cool.

758
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,880
Tae-ri or my brother?

759
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,400
Why are my ears blocked?

760
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,560
So handsome.

761
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,400
My brother and I

762
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,200
He's a model too.

763
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,880
He doesn't have time.

764
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,280
It looks great.

765
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,920
So pretty.

766
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,760
Get off work, bro.

767
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,880
I've been pretending these days.

768
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,520
No, I know her brother very well.

769
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,200
I...

770
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,480
But we didn't know

771
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,120
we would meet here.

772
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,080
Yes.

773
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,760
Her brother took her

774
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,080
had a few meals with me.

775
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,440
Only a lot of us.

776
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,760
Look me in the eyes and say.

777
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
You didn't lie to us, did you?

778
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,080
Does it look like it?

779
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,840
No.

780
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,320
No.

781
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,160
Indeed not.

782
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,840
This is similar.

783
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,440
So will the post-production come?

784
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,280
Guess.

785
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,320
Yes.

786
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,080
Do you want him to come?

787
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
Yes.

788
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,400
Just kidding.

789
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,280
I hope

790
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,920
we want one more person to take care of Tata.

791
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,760
I'm good at talking.

792
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,480
Okay.

793
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,920
In my eyes,

794
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,440
you've always been kind

795
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,200
and considerate.

796
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,840
and considerate.

797
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,400
Sometimes, you'd rather suffer losses

798
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,480
than let others suffer losses.

799
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,880
But I want to say I'm one year older today.

800
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,480
Happy birthday.

801
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,360
Think more about yourself.

802
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,520
Maybe in your memory,

803
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,240
I liked teasing you since childhood.

804
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,720
I only know how to grab your ice cream.

805
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,640
and never shed tears for you.

806
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,400
But actually,

807
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,640
the day we sent you to college.

808
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,480
When we parted,

809
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,160
I quietly wiped my tears.

810
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,240
This is the first time you left home.

811
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,760
Go to a strange city

812
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,480
to face life alone.

813
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,200
Because of my work,

814
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,720
because of my work.

815
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,680
I'm still worried about you

816
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,360
I was worried about you.

817
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,840
But I thought my sister was so good.

818
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,800
and excellent,

819
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,280
I'm sure I can get along with everyone.

820
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,040
So I don't want to

821
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,040
I didn't have to care too much about the result.

822
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,760
and neglect the happiness in the journey.

823
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,120
and experience every day in the house.

824
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,760
I believe in the end

825
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,160
in the end.

826
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,720
Happy birthday, sister.

827
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,600
Are you touched?

828
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,880
I feel a little touched.

829
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,560
It's sour.

830
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:29,960
It's okay.

831
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,000
We're fine.

832
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,080
Good.

833
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,200
It's so pretty.

834
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,880
Thank you.

835
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,040
It's so pretty.

836
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,640
To be honest, it's a little short.

837
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,040
Not as short as mine.

838
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,440
Yes, his three lines.

839
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,440
Really?

840
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,120
I think it's simple.

841
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,400
But it's good enough.

842
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,360
He is

843
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,560
who can't express his emotions.

844
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,800
When reading this letter,

845
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,480
I was still touched.

846
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,160
I still miss him.

847
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,240
Okay, my turn.

848
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,320
My turn.

849
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,440
Guess if I'm a sister or a sister.

850
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,639
Sister.

851
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,639
Sister.

852
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,520
Sister

853
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,040
Definitely.

854
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,440
Okay.

855
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,320
You win.

856
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,040
I told you.

857
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,280
So will your sister come?

858
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,639
She asked me. Let me introduce her first.

859
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,320
This is a photo of me when I was about one year old.

860
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,679
So cute.

861
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,760
Next one.

862
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,159
Let me take a look.

863
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,239
Let's not look at this.

864
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,920
Take a look.

865
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Look.

866
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,760
I'm really ugly.

867
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,400
I can't stand it.

868
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,520
It's okay.

869
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,560
A flash.

870
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,960
This is not like you.

871
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,040
This is my high school.

872
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,360
I went on a trip with my sister.

873
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
She took it for me.

874
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,600
It doesn't look like her.

875
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,920
It's so different.

876
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,160
He looks like a good student.

877
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,360
Yes, he looks like a straight-A student.

878
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,040
Yes.

879
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,840
I went on a business trip with you before

880
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,920
It's a bit similar now

881
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,280
Yes, my sister took it for me.

882
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,920
This one.

883
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,800
This is so cool.

884
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,480
Work photos.

885
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,640
The New York Fashion Week.

886
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,520
It was the first show.

887
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,440
Alexander.

888
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,040
Everyone on the stage

889
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,600
They're all here.

890
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,280
There are many supermodels.

891
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,160
This is the magazine I took before.

892
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,760
The photo is for Elle Mon.

893
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,400
Cool.

894
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,200
This is the scene of my shoot.

895
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,080
during the shoot.

896
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,120
It's nice.

897
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,080
They are all formal clothes.

898
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,040
Because this is my style.

899
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,840
Actually he and my brother

900
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,920
are the same model.

901
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,280
They often compete for a client.

902
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,160
Like this.

903
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,640
competitors.

904
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,280
They are competing.

905
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,800
Project?

906
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,240
This time, I came in his place again.

907
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,640
This is my cat.

908
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,720
German.

909
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,680
I have two Germans.

910
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,600
I took a picture with my cat.

911
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,680
So cute.

912
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,280
This is my sister.

913
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,920
And me.

914
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,800
So cool.

915
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,600
So cool.

916
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Susu, do you remember

917
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,200
when I had dinner with you,

918
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,880
Didn't you want to be a match?

919
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,440
My sister is a partner.

920
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,520
She was the editor-in-chief of the magazine.

921
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,480
No wonder.

922
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,040
If you really want to do this,

923
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,160
she may give you some good advice.

924
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,120
Yes.

925
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,920
And this is

926
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,880
and my parents

927
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,160
with my parents.

928
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,600
Because my family doesn't like taking photos.

929
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,320
So I didn't have many photos when I was young.

930
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,040
Yes.

931
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,520
That's all.

932
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,080
How do you feel

933
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,480
How do you feel now?

934
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,440
When you left for Beijing,

935
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,480
I was teasing you

936
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,120
Don't go there. The crew found you're not special.

937
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,080
and get rejected.

938
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,640
and came back in a daze.

939
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,440
You were very dissatisfied.

940
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,200
and sent me

941
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,000
the screenshots of others praising you.

942
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,200
and say,

943
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,320
Who are you looking down on?

944
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,920
So arrogant.

945
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,480
My sister and I always argue.

946
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,720
To be honest,

947
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,280
when you told me the process of the recording,

948
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,400
I was nervous

949
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,160
I was nervous.

950
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,080
As a staff behind the scenes,

951
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,680
I always feel that

952
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,280
with me.

953
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,920
But I believe

954
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,040
you're used to being in front of the camera.

955
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,120
You'll get used to it soon.

956
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,960
Both my parents and I

957
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,520
we've been restraining

958
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,600
the emotions.

959
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,920
Your mouth is pouting.

960
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,040
All you say is mocking.

961
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,360
But the real thoughts are hidden in our hearts.

962
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,480
We love each other with actions.

963
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,800
I don't know

964
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,960
is a little cheesy.

965
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,320
In my eyes,

966
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,600
what kind of brother are you?

967
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,880
Maybe in normal times,

968
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,000
we have never talked about this

969
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,680
we never talked about this together.

970
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,000
When I was young,

971
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,640
I always thought all the elders in the family

972
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,480
is biased.

973
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,160
Mom said

974
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,840
"Your brother is younger than you, so you have to give in to him."

975
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,600
It keeps lingering in my head.

976
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,200
I felt very uneasy.

977
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
But that experience

978
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,840
made me completely forget about it.

979
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,320
The boss always gets criticized.

980
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,120
I forgot how old I was.

981
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,120
Maybe we were both in primary school.

982
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,520
Grandma scolded me for something.

983
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,200
I started crying because I felt wronged.

984
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,400
I thought

985
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,880
you couldn't escape a beating,

986
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,800
you stood in front of me.

987
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,920
Then you cried with me.

988
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
and told Grandma not to beat me.

989
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,360
You may not remember this,

990
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,160
But...

991
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,960
But I remember

992
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,520
they said

993
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,680
Wait.

994
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,040
It's okay.

995
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,520
It's okay.

996
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,000
But I remember it’s said that

997
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,080
will fade away as time goes by.

998
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,680
What you can remember

999
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,720
must have strong feelings.

1000
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,480
That touched me so much

1001
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,520
A little man will protect you

1002
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,640
It's good to have a younger brother.

1003
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,440
So in my eyes,

1004
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,680
besides being handsome,

1005
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,160
but also sincere, hard-working.

1006
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,840
diligent, wisdom and responsible.

1007
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,640
Although I brought you into the model industry,

1008
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,000
you made the achievements

1009
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,840
step by step.

1010
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,920
I'm proud of you as my brother.

1011
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,280
Now you can take care of yourself

1012
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,080
and take good care of yourself.

1013
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,760
It's really great.

1014
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,440
Let me tell you secretly.

1015
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,360
Every time

1016
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,480
when I mention you in front of my friends,

1017
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,760
in front of my friends.

1018
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,880
They even recommend you

1019
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,640
recommend you

1020
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,200
a pro model who is positive.

1021
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,120
Hold on.

1022
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,520
I'm about to cry. What should I do?

1023
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,120
Let me take a break.

1024
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,920
It's okay. I'll be fine.

1025
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,320
I believe that's what my parents think.

1026
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,640
Although they communicate with us

1027
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,880
are all denial.

1028
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,760
criticizing education.

1029
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,880
But in front of relatives, they always say

1030
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,680
we were good.

1031
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,480
My sister and I think

1032
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,040
my parents have been taking care of us.

1033
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,080
They didn't give us any sense of love.

1034
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
But maybe

1035
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,720
grow up without encouragement.

1036
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,800
They don't know how to express love.

1037
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,440
So after a long time, I've let it go.

1038
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,120
I'm happy to have you

1039
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,120
I'm glad to have you as my brother.

1040
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,280
We all rely on ourselves

1041
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,120
a satisfactory life.

1042
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,880
You can't change others.

1043
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,040
Even the closest person,

1044
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,760
I can only digest it myself.

1045
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,040
This thing

1046
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,640
It's not bad now, right?

1047
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,720
As time makes us mature,

1048
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,160
I don't think we're siblings.

1049
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,400
We are more like

1050
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,880
who have known each other for years.

1051
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,840
can have a trip

1052
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,680
and go on a trip.

1053
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,840
I also think about buying gifts for my parents

1054
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,960
when I buy gifts for my parents.

1055
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,040
But in love,

1056
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,280
we are still like siblings.

1057
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,600
(We're still looking for)

1058
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,880
in the sea of people.

1059
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,240
I often tell my friends

1060
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,280
the standard of finding a boyfriend

1061
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,120
should be based on my younger brother.

1062
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,360
There will be a crush male guest.

1063
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,040
It's my first time to look at my brother.

1064
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,960
But the funny thing is

1065
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,360
the standard line is a bit high.

1066
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,120
This is also a compliment for the change

1067
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,680
Haha

1068
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,040
What do you think?

1069
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,520
In my heart, you have an extraordinary position, right?

1070
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
That's enough.

1071
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
It's been a month.

1072
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,080
I've been filming for weeks,

1073
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,520
I'm really impressed

1074
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,240
It's really amazing.

1075
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,760
Please give me a round of applause.

1076
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,440
Finally, my silly little brother,

1077
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,560
My parents and I will always support you.

1078
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,760
I really can't control myself.

1079
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,720
It's okay.

1080
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,920
My letter is also my brother.

1081
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,360
He would stand in front of me and protect me.

1082
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,640
This letter my sister wrote to me

1083
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,680
has a huge gap

1084
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,160
a huge gap.

1085
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,680
My family is not good at expressing it.

1086
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,680
We may not even type

1087
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,720
say this.

1088
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,680
For the first time,

1089
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,080
I couldn't hold myself back.

1090
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,200
I think

1091
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,760
I have to take that step.

1092
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,720
I think we still need to

1093
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,680
to express our love.

1094
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,040
If you have something in your mind

1095
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,480
Like before,

1096
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,960
I might keep it to myself.

1097
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,760
But I may not

1098
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,720
express my feelings in the future.

1099
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,360
Girls' words are really delicate.

1100
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,200
Because my sister

1101
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,760
never said this to me.

1102
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
My family wouldn't say that.

1103
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,920
So I can't hold it.

1104
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,240
Almost.

1105
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,040
My brother never said that to me.

1106
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,400
I cried a lot that day.

1107
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,720
Yes.

1108
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,160
It's raining heavily.

1109
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,920
Who cried so loudly that day?

1110
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,520
That's true.

1111
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,680
Because my brother is good at writing.

1112
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,560
we'll lose a lot.

1113
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,080
Neither Tata nor I saw it.

1114
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,520
Yes, you missed eight.

1115
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,840
Why don't you read it again?

1116
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,480
After reading the letter,

1117
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,240
I never opened it again.

1118
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,720
Me too.

1119
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,800
I won't open it either.

1120
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
I was going to take a photo.

1121
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,840
but I didn't have the courage to open it.

1122
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,240
When Tarri was young,

1123
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,800
Maybe my family values men more than women.

1124
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,840
like me.

1125
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,160
The younger brother may be favored.

1126
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,360
And when she gets scolded,

1127
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,960
the younger brother will stand up to protect her.

1128
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,000
I think he's talking about my story.

1129
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,640
I resonated with him.

1130
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,840
So when he said that,

1131
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,680
I looked at my brothers.

1132
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,360
Then we looked at each other.

1133
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,880
Because I look at my brothers.

1134
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,560
Actually, both of us are so good now.

1135
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,960
I have something to tell you.

1136
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,840
Tell me.

1137
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,280
It wasn't Tae-seo who interviewed you.

1138
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,040
It's your brother.

1139
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,560
I knew it.

1140
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,480
I guessed it just now.

1141
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,360
What are you doing?

1142
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,000
Didn't you guess it during the interview?

1143
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,480
No.

1144
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,840
I really didn't.

1145
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,360
Harry, did you guess it?

1146
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,800
Actually, I think

1147
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,160
during the process.

1148
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,720
Did you?

1149
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,560
Because every time I asked him about Tae-seo,

1150
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,200
about you,

1151
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,880
he said

1152
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,040
he didn't know, right?

1153
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,720
It's not that he doesn't know.

1154
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,880
Let him ask you.

1155
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,280
He said you should ask him yourself.

1156
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:10,520
Yes.

1157
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,480
Actually, he knows nothing about me.

1158
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,560
Yes.

1159
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,120
How interesting.

1160
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,320
I told you my little secret.

1161
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
What secret?

1162
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,960
That's it.

1163
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
I told you.

1164
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,080
No.

1165
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,480
I added some for you.

1166
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,640
You?

1167
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,360
Didn't I add the interview for you?

1168
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,360
You don't know.

1169
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,920
I think someone with a brain

1170
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,280
You should know.

1171
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,280
I'm leaving.

1172
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,560
I'm coming down.

1173
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,320
Get some water.

1174
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,720
The soup doesn't feel good.

1175
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,400
It's good.

1176
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,120
I'm so happy.

1177
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,000
Can't you tell?

1178
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,480
I can't.

1179
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
Are you nervous tomorrow?

1180
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,760
Whatever.

1181
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,160
What happened?

1182
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,960
I can't tell you.

1183
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,880
I'm going to sleep.

1184
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:21,920
I'm so angry.

1185
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,880
I'm really angry.

1186
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,800
I can see.

1187
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,800
But for what?

1188
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,600
It's different

1189
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,160
When I was sitting,

1190
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:28,920
he was different

1191
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,760
he's different.

1192
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,080
Maybe

1193
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,160
because of Susu.

1194
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,920
Is it the photo album of Tata?

1195
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,440
What?

1196
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,440
Don't you have

1197
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,960
Tata's brother?

1198
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,360
Who said he wanted her brother to come?

1199
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,640
And Susu said yes.

1200
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,840
But I think

1201
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,600
I think it's okay.

1202
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,400
But I can remember

1203
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,160
That's all.

1204
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,520
So cool.

1205
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,840
Do you want him to come?

1206
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,720
Yes.

1207
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,160
I know a lot

1208
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,760
I know a lot of things.

1209
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,400
But maybe I just

1210
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,560
because things have been so tense these days.

1211
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,320
and I didn't get the correct feedback I thought.

1212
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,640
So I will be very tense.

1213
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,120
I have a question.

1214
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,160
What is it?

1215
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,000
You should know something.

1216
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,360
What question?

1217
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,880
XX.

1218
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,560
What?

1219
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,040
What happened between you two?

1220
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,560
Nothing happened.

1221
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,720
Then why did you change after the date?

1222
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,640
I chose another one.

1223
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,360
No.

1224
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,160
Why?

1225
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:54,600
What?

1226
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,760
Why?

1227
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,760
There are many reasons.

1228
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,360
Simply,

1229
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,000
If you want to say something shallow,

1230
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,560
your face is on my point.

1231
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,720
And if you look deeper,

1232
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,200
I had a date before.

1233
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,240
a Cupid date.

1234
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,840
The day we talked a lot.

1235
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,160
I liked it in the end.

1236
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,680
I think it's suitable.

1237
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,960
Interested?

1238
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,840
It depends on your feelings.

1239
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,360
So I can understand you no matter what you do.

1240
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,280
I'm sincere.

1241
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,440
There's nothing else.

1242
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,520
You've done your best.

1243
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,000
I won't change anymore.

1244
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,280
Will you change?

1245
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,120
I...

1246
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,760
I, Sakura,

1247
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,720
I'll change Son Goku 981.

1248
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,880
Will you change your mind if there's a new one?

1249
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,400
No.

1250
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,040
Never

1251
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,360
give everything.

1252
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,160
I told you

1253
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,480
whether it's Tata

1254
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,160
or Xinxin,

1255
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,640
I think action will represent me.

1256
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,360
my words.

1257
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,960
Because now I know

1258
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,080
I want to be with Tata.

1259
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,600
So I won't think about anything else.

1260
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,720
I just think

1261
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,160
how to make her happy.

1262
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,800
Can I have a word with you?

1263
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,040
Tell me now.

1264
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,640
The soup is very angry.

1265
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,400
Very angry

1266
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,160
Why?

1267
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,040
Because of you.

1268
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,240
Why?

1269
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,320
Because I said Tata's brother is handsome?

1270
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:26,880
I don't know.

1271
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,240
I think so. I don't know either.

1272
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,640
He's angry anyway.

1273
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,920
I thought about it.

1274
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,520
But...

1275
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,320
he was very angry.

1276
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:32,760
I don't know.

1277
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,000
He looks younger than me.

1278
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,160
I'm really supportive.

1279
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,800
I complimented Tae-seo too.

1280
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,720
I said the same thing.

1281
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,520
I said you were

1282
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,440
That's who I am.

1283
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,800
I said maybe

1284
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,960
I said it's just a support.

1285
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,680
There are too many misunderstandings every day.

1286
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,960
Lower your voice.

1287
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,520
Okay.

1288
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,400
I think I caused trouble again.

1289
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,320
I'm speechless.

1290
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:57,720
Why?

1291
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,040
I think the soup is angry.

1292
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,600
Why?

1293
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,200
Because I think Brother Tata is handsome.

1294
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,160
I don't know.

1295
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,600
Maybe things have happened these days.

1296
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,680
I'll try to

1297
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,080
the way we used to get along.

1298
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,800
I want to show her about my growth experience,

1299
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,240
including things I care about.

1300
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,400
Hello.

1301
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,240
Hello

1302
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,640
This is the clothes I prepared for you.

1303
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,520
A set.

1304
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,600
Why don't you change it first?

1305
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,240
Okay, thank you.

1306
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,720
Here.

1307
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,000
Get some water.

1308
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,800
Hello.

1309
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,680
I think Susu

1310
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,560
is cute.

1311
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,920
I want water. Thank you.

1312
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:41,840
Okay.

1313
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,080
Are you nervous?

1314
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,640
No.

1315
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,880
Let me introduce to you.

1316
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,680
Actually this place

1317
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,880
is where I train every day.

1318
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,640
I want to bring you here

1319
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,280
to know more about me.

1320
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,000
Then I'll treat you

1321
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,040
as a kid with zero foundation.

1322
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,960
Okay, Mr Tang.

1323
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,160
Okay.

1324
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,080
Can you hold the paddle?

1325
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,760
Take this.

1326
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:10,800
Hold the paddle.

1327
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,640
No.

1328
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,240
Like this.

1329
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,360
You put the beat at the mouth of the tiger.

1330
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,400
Yes, put these three fingers down.

1331
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,480
Put your fingers here.

1332
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,480
Yes.

1333
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,240
It's familiar at the beginning.

1334
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,160
Start from the spinning ball.

1335
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,200
Did you turn?

1336
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,640
Like when I was young, 20 years ago.

1337
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,760
Twenty years ago

1338
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,760
How many?

1339
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,160
I'll make one first.

1340
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,240
You spin five first.

1341
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,880
Five at once.

1342
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,120
Harry said you would bark.

1343
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,080
I knew it.

1344
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,560
I'm already awesome.

1345
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:47,960
Yes.

1346
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,920
Awesome.

1347
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,400
I usually bumped the first time.

1348
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,080
Ten.

1349
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:56,880
Okay.

1350
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,160
You're better than I thought.

1351
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,160
Thank you.

1352
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,200
I'll call my friend.

1353
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,520
What are you doing?

1354
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,640
Let me teach you.

1355
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,880
He'll be our training partner.

1356
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,160
This is Xu Tang.

1357
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,160
This is Susu.

1358
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,240
Hello.

1359
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,320
Can you play?

1360
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,200
No.

1361
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:14,640
Okay.

1362
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,080
You can watch me play first.

1363
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:17,960
Look.

1364
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,200
For example...

1365
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,160
Don't move.

1366
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,040
To be precise,

1367
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,960
For example, I was slow at first.

1368
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,920
But if

1369
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,280
If I'm faster,

1370
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,320
then so do I.

1371
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,360
You just need to lift your body a little.

1372
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,920
I feel dizzy now.

1373
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,080
Really? Try it.

1374
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,800
I'm going to play first.

1375
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,760
I don't know how to serve.

1376
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,440
Let him serve.

1377
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,560
Why are you laughing?

1378
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,240
Nothing.

1379
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,120
Come on, serve the ball.

1380
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,160
You think I'm a genius?

1381
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,400
I'll hold your paddle and teach you how to hit it.

1382
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,720
Okay?

1383
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,200
Okay.

1384
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,400
Slow down.

1385
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,240
Look.

1386
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,240
Don't use your strength.

1387
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,760
Relax.

1388
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,160
Seven. Try it.

1389
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,680
Don't push. Relax.

1390
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,280
Relax.

1391
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:19,880
Okay.

1392
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,560
Relax.

1393
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,720
Listen to me now.

1394
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,480
Okay.

1395
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,560
When doing this,

1396
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,280
I was quite surprised.

1397
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,680
I think

1398
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,480
this is not something he would do.

1399
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,400
This is unexpected.

1400
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:40,920
Don't laugh.

1401
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,760
Let you feel it.

1402
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,080
Look.

1403
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,000
Yeah, put it over.

1404
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,400
You used your strength again.

1405
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,520
I have to control you so you can't use your strength.

1406
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,600
Three, four, five, six.

1407
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,680
Don't use your strength.

1408
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,360
You like to use your strength so much.

1409
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,480
I'm better than you.

1410
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,200
You're worse than me. That's bad.

1411
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,480
Can you stop crossing it?

1412
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,040
Good job.

1413
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,840
It's her first time.

1414
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,960
Is she pretty good?

1415
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,160
Yes.

1416
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,320
Thank you.

1417
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,600
Try backhand.

1418
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,280
Like this. Stand up a little.

1419
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,200
A little more. A little more.

1420
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,440
Should I hit it vertically?

1421
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,560
You hit it like this.

1422
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,160
You should hit it like this.

1423
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:38,560
Yes.

1424
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,560
Point it.

1425
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,280
Try it.

1426
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,880
Yes.

1427
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,880
So talented.

1428
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,640
I'll send you two.

1429
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,560
Got it.

1430
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,800
Why don't you applaud me?

1431
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,480
Amazing.

1432
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,160
I've never seen such a good player.

1433
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,760
Play this.

1434
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,600
What is this?

1435
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,960
Just knock it down.

1436
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,840
How?

1437
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,120
I...

1438
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,600
For example, when I hit this cup,

1439
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,000
Do you want a cup or a photo frame?

1440
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,160
I'll get a cup.

1441
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,800
Then you can open the box.

1442
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,400
Let's throw this.

1443
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,600
For example, when you throw it, like if you're three,

1444
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,480
you have three balls.

1445
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,480
If you can defeat them and connect them together,

1446
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,080
you'll win.

1447
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,240
If you win, there will be a prize.

1448
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,440
What if you win?

1449
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,200
If I win, do you have a prize?

1450
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,480
No.

1451
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,120
Let's start.

1452
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:40,960
Okay, I'll go first.

1453
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,400
You first.

1454
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,040
Go forward. Don't hit up.

1455
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,120
It's dangerous.

1456
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,760
It's not moving.

1457
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:58,840
What is this?

1458
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,720
Six.

1459
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,680
What does this mean?

1460
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,520
This is six.

1461
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,000
I can see it's six.

1462
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,080
No problem.

1463
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,240
Six.

1464
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:19,920
Three.

1465
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,840
You can do this.

1466
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,520
I'll do that.

1467
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,040
Then three is fine.

1468
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,360
I don't believe it.

1469
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:30,960
Four.

1470
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,160
I'm speechless.

1471
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,280
Four.

1472
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:39,960
What's wrong?

1473
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,760
You...

1474
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,960
It's so unfair.

1475
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,120
I saw two.

1476
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,720
Bye.

1477
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,160
Nine.

1478
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,520
This is six, right?

1479
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,480
This is...

1480
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,000
There are no nine dices.

1481
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Two out of three.

1482
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,120
Harder.

1483
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,840
Three more balls.

1484
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,400
You didn't know how to play just now.

1485
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:12,840
Soup.

1486
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,880
I don't know how to play.

1487
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,520
What are you doing?

1488
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,480
Sir, let me introduce.

1489
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,600
This is Susu.

1490
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,560
Hello, Susu.

1491
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,360
Date.

1492
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,120
And this is Gook-jung.

1493
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,560
Hello teacher

1494
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,600
My favorite teacher in my life.

1495
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,520
Mr. Liu Guozheng.

1496
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,920
I think I'm very lucky

1497
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,000
to receive his guidance.

1498
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,520
This is the first time

1499
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,440
to win the championship of Beijing High School Competition.

1500
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,360
I'm very happy

1501
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,720
He's also my teacher now.

1502
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,520
Hello.

1503
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,040
Hello.

1504
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,840
What are you playing?

1505
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,400
We're playing the character well.

1506
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,640
If she wins, I'll give her a prize.

1507
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,960
Can you win her?

1508
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,800
I don't think

1509
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,520
to win.

1510
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,960
It'll be hard.

1511
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,760
If you can't beat her,

1512
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,840
I'll serve you more.

1513
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,480
You haven't been training well lately.

1514
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,080
I'm just

1515
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,600
busy recently.

1516
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,120
Maybe they're on a date.

1517
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,160
I see.

1518
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,920
Yes.

1519
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,800
Did you get anything?

1520
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,680
I'm pursuing it.

1521
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,960
What do you think of our soup?

1522
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,400
Very good.

1523
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,760
Except for being handsome.

1524
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,400
What about the ball?

1525
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,320
I've never seen it.

1526
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,520
His unique skill is hidden.

1527
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,200
Let him hit you later.

1528
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,800
Okay.

1529
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,800
Except the one you know,

1530
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,600
and the other side.

1531
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,680
his sports skills

1532
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,440
in sports.

1533
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,000
Good.

1534
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,760
He's the leading actor of Qing Hua ping-pong.

1535
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,000
Okay.

1536
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,920
I'll find you when I lose.

1537
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,320
Okay, you guys start first.

1538
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:55,840
15.

1539
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,520
Thank you.

1540
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,320
This doesn't count.

1541
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,560
Yes.

1542
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,000
This is more difficult than that.

1543
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,400
Indeed, she helped me.

1544
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,120
Why is she a rookie?

1545
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,240
After I came here,

1546
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,320
you were nervous.

1547
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,120
You really seem a little tight.

1548
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:11,960
Relax.

1549
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,840
It's okay if you don't come.

1550
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,400
I'm here to give you some pressure.

1551
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,600
I missed.

1552
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,800
You can come closer.

1553
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,240
No.

1554
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,040
I'll take it away. Don't block it.

1555
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:28,800
No.

1556
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,400
These two don't count.

1557
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:32,960
Okay, thank you.

1558
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,880
From top to down.

1559
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,200
Okay.

1560
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,200
There aren't many prizes.

1561
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,880
Win.

1562
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,920
I'm speechless.

1563
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,000
I wanted to say

1564
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,240
if she couldn't defeat me,

1565
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,120
I'll defeat her.

1566
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,360
Let's play multi-ball.

1567
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,160
Okay, I'll give you the prize later.

1568
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:54,760
Okay.

1569
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,000
It's time to practice.

1570
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,760
Let me practice.

1571
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,520
How about this one?

1572
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,080
Sure.

1573
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,760
Reverse loop.

1574
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,000
So cool.

1575
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,120
Too slow.

1576
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,320
Forehand hand.

1577
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,200
Yes.

1578
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,240
Just practice.

1579
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,720
He always wants to show you his handsome side.

1580
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:35,960
Look.

1581
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,600
I'm so tired.

1582
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,120
He likes backhand.

1583
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:56,840
Do you know why?

1584
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,000
Easy.

1585
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
He looks handsome with backhand.

1586
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,000
Handsome.

1587
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,400
I always want to show you his handsome side.

1588
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,880
He's really dating recently.

1589
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:06,840
No.

1590
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,200
I'm in a relationship.

1591
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:09,600
No.

1592
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,120
She always thinks my hands and feet are not harmonious.

1593
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,040
No, sir.

1594
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,240
There's someone in our room

1595
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,000
bought a case and arrived today.

1596
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,480
You should train every day.

1597
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,280
Who will serve you more?

1598
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,040
You serve.

1599
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,160
I don't know how.

1600
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,920
It's okay. I'll teach you.

1601
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,160
Sure.

1602
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,240
Go downstairs at seven tomorrow morning.

1603
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,800
I'm getting off. Can you come down?

1604
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,560
You don't need me anymore, right?

1605
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,360
Sir, let's take a photo.

1606
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:34,920
Come on.

1607
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,160
Thank you.

1608
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:40,720
OK.

1609
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:41,640
Thank you.

1610
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,280
Okay.

1611
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,680
It feels good

1612
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,480
it's good.

1613
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,000
Susu may also like ping-pong.

1614
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,520
I'm quite happy.

1615
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,080
I really enjoyed

1616
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,520
playing ping-pong.

1617
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,080
I had fun

1618
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,360
(the ping-pong game.)

1619
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:11,720
Let's go eat.

1620
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:12,680
Let's go.

1621
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,360
Are you still cold?

1622
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,280
Cover it up.

1623
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,920
This may not work,

1624
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,840
It's as thin as garlic.

1625
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,800
Sir, can you turn up the heat?

1626
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,400
Thank you.

1627
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:34,720
Harry.

1628
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,880
You're Tom.

1629
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,680
What?

1630
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,480
You're Tom.

1631
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,120
I'm not.

1632
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:40,480
You are...

1633
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,320
I'm Soup.

1634
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,840
Stop talking nonsense.

1635
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,960
Tom Lee?

1636
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,560
Who's Tom Lee?

1637
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,040
I'm not talking to you.

1638
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,240
Don't talk to me today.

1639
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,360
What do you think of Ms Liu? Is she easy-going?

1640
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,680
I won't talk to you if you talk to me.

1641
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,160
Because you told me not to talk to you.

1642
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,480
I won't talk to you.

1643
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,640
I want water.

1644
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,120
You can drink so much.

1645
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,440
You can drink too much.

1646
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,320
Don't choke.

1647
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,800
I'm replenishing water.

1648
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,080
Drink 30 seconds.

1649
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,720
So I cry a lot.

1650
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,560
My body is full of water.

1651
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,560
My tears are low.

1652
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,160
You cried twice yesterday.

1653
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,840
Twice. Two letters. Twice.

1654
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,120
I guess they look

1655
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,440
they don't look alike.

1656
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,480
But I didn't know

1657
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,040
We're not related by blood.

1658
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,360
Do you think my brother and I

1659
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,520
look alike?

1660
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,320
I think the face shape is like

1661
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,440
Your eyes are different.

1662
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,160
You mean my brothers and I

1663
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,680
are the same size.

1664
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,120
Of course you are.

1665
01:04:59,360 --> 01:04:59,960
Thank you.

1666
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,120
Tata, do you still have shampoo?

1667
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:12,680
I'm out of mine.

1668
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,560
Can I borrow it?

1669
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:14,080
Okay.

1670
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:14,800
I'll get it for you.

1671
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,280
Thank you.

1672
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,080
Here you are.

1673
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,520
Why do you use

1674
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,840
Olia hydrochloric acid shampoo?

1675
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:22,760
I use this too.

1676
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,680
It's really good

1677
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,080
It has fluffy hair after washing it.

1678
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,520
And it smells nice.

1679
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:28,880
But

1680
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,120
It feels different

1681
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,120
from my previous one.

1682
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,120
Mine is the second generation

1683
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,040
And when you wash your hair, your scalp will be comfortable.

1684
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,240
The hair won't be dry

1685
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,280
Like this.

1686
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,520
I'll try it now.

1687
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,960
The model is right.

1688
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,560
A walking grass plant.

1689
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,680
Today is my guardian date.

1690
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,680
So I got up early this morning.

1691
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,840
And for today's date,

1692
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,720
for today's date.

1693
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,280
I'm going to bring flowers.

1694
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,320
Let's have lunch together

1695
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,400
and take her to the ancient city.

1696
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,480
Hello.

1697
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:22,880
Of course I'm looking forward to it.

1698
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,400
Didn't you see

1699
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,400
pretty today?

1700
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,120
It'll be a bit grand today.

1701
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,480
I know

1702
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,640
who I'm going on a date with.

1703
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,440
Is there anyone competing with me?

1704
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:41,920
Yes

1705
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,120
Comedian has spring

1706
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,720
Who is the date

1707
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,640
Where is it?

1708
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,440
The day after tomorrow.

1709
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,200
Is this the place you're looking for?

1710
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,960
You're good at finding private dishes.

1711
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,280
I found it here.

1712
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:56,640
Yes.

1713
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,440
I saw your life album yesterday.

1714
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,280
Are you running abroad?

1715
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,800
It should be more in China now.

1716
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,920
I used to live a little more abroad.

1717
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,720
Where do you live now?

1718
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:07,800
Shanghai.

1719
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,280
What about you?

1720
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,880
Changsha.

1721
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,200
That day, we first met in the cabin.

1722
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,440
You told me to guess your occupation.

1723
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,160
I haven't figured it out yet.

1724
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:18,960
what you do.

1725
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:20,680
You can guess.

1726
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,760
I can give you three chances.

1727
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,400
You can go to the other side.

1728
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,280
You're right.

1729
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,600
in the self-media industry.

1730
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,640
Almost.

1731
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,200
Because I'm getting closer to her.

1732
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,760
A beauty blogger?

1733
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:33,880
Yes.

1734
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,240
What do you think of this makeup?

1735
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,040
I did it myself.

1736
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,320
You can do it.

1737
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,600
It's beautiful.

1738
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,320
Because my previous company was in Changsha.

1739
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,280
But now it's the workplace.

1740
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,200
It may change a little.

1741
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,840
Where are you going?

1742
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,520
Beijing.

1743
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:50,600
Okay.

1744
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,480
Beijing is good.

1745
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,240
Can't you eat spicy food?

1746
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,520
I can wash water.

1747
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,320
Okay.

1748
01:07:59,320 --> 01:07:59,760
Excuse me.

1749
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,800
You don't have to order spicy food.

1750
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,160
I don't have to eat spicy food.

1751
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,240
Order a little.

1752
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,840
But I don't think it's very spicy.

1753
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,680
Not necessarily.

1754
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:11,800
The noodles I made.

1755
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,320
You can't eat any chili.

1756
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,320
I ate them all.

1757
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,000
But I picked out

1758
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,120
all your chilies.

1759
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,040
Just scoop it with this.

1760
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,800
You can scoop it.

1761
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,600
Call Tae-ri.

1762
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,279
Go get him.

1763
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:31,040
It's soggy.

1764
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:33,040
No wonder.

1765
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,279
You're so thoughtful.

1766
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,399
Very attentive.

1767
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:39,279
I was very touched.

1768
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:45,960
So did you

1769
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,240
last night?

1770
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:47,840
Yes.

1771
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,920
The one who cried the longest is Susu.

1772
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,640
I was the one who cried.

1773
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,479
Because I think

1774
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,920
I heard your letter yesterday.

1775
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,680
You went to protect your sister, right?

1776
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,640
That scene was just like my siblings.

1777
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,080
When my family scolded me,

1778
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:06,760
my brothers were standing in front of me.

1779
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,640
He was much shorter than me then.

1780
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:08,960
That's it.

1781
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,399
I was a kid too.

1782
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:10,920
Yes.

1783
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,439
Why did you...

1784
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,520
Do you remember how I felt?

1785
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,359
Because our family was kind of like boys.

1786
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,319
men are more important.

1787
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,120
Yes.

1788
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,000
You didn't listen to my letter, otherwise...

1789
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,479
Really? Is it the same?

1790
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,960
I always think my sister

1791
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,920
is

1792
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:27,600
an independent person.

1793
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,080
Work

1794
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,439
and when she's studying,

1795
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,960
she may read while working.

1796
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,479
After she graduated,

1797
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:36,520
she went to Shanghai alone.

1798
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,080
She doesn't know anyone in Shanghai.

1799
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:38,960
so she went to work on her own.

1800
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:41,319
I'm doing this job

1801
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:42,359
because of my sister.

1802
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,720
You happen to be so tall.

1803
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,200
Just right.

1804
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,080
Yes.

1805
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,520
But I never thought about it.

1806
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,160
Because I used to be short.

1807
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,279
You should think

1808
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,600
I don't have anything special about height.

1809
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,520
If I'm going to date someone...

1810
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,120
Really?

1811
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:58,640
No.

1812
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,240
I knew it.

1813
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,360
The more you lack, the more you need.

1814
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,000
You don't need anything.

1815
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,000
Yes, no requirements.

1816
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,520
How tall must you be?

1817
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,200
Most importantly, it depends on whether they get along.

1818
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,920
How do you think we get along?

1819
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,720
Do you get along well with each other?

1820
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,920
Yes, chatting, life, hobbies.

1821
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,120
Three views.

1822
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,200
I think these are quite important.

1823
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,040
Maybe we get along.

1824
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,960
It'll be easier to get along.

1825
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,160
Do you prefer

1826
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,760
love at first sight or love grows over time?

1827
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,960
Love grows gradually

1828
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,760
For me,

1829
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,640
I used to date

1830
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,240
It takes a long time

1831
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,040
for observation.

1832
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,760
So it's hard for me to get into a relationship.

1833
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,320
I understand.

1834
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,520
I might observe

1835
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,200
for a long time.

1836
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,800
You are more passive.

1837
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,800
Very passive.

1838
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:53,840
Yes.

1839
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:54,680
But I think

1840
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,320
you should be the opposite, right?

1841
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,840
I'll be more passive at the beginning.

1842
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,960
I'll take the initiative later.

1843
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,040
Your passive attitude at the beginning

1844
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,240
to confirm the other person's feelings.

1845
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,600
If he doesn't

1846
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,960
to you,

1847
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,520
Respond.

1848
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,120
Yes.

1849
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:10,720
I won't continue.

1850
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,480
I know.

1851
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,120
Yes.

1852
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,600
Almost. Me too.

1853
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,560
Under the passive condition,

1854
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,640
maybe they gave me some signals

1855
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,600
so I...

1856
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,440
You'll be passive if she gives you the signal.

1857
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,840
But I will respond accordingly.

1858
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,640
Whether it's the early or later,

1859
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,520
you still need

1860
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,720
to guide you.

1861
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,200
Yes.

1862
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,160
We may need their guidance in the beginning.

1863
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,360
I'll be better later.

1864
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,720
Maybe I can understand

1865
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,280
how they feel.

1866
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,560
What kind of guy do you usually like?

1867
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,600
To be honest,

1868
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,360
Familiar?

1869
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,520
Do you have any requirements for height or anything?

1870
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,880
I like height.

1871
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,040
Because I think

1872
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,280
I'm not that tall.

1873
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,360
So

1874
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,760
I want to find

1875
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,080
A little higher.

1876
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,760
Higher than me.

1877
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,960
Thank you. Okay.

1878
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:15,800
Enjoy.

1879
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,280
Let's eat.

1880
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:18,680
Okay.

1881
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,960
You're welcome.

1882
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,040
You're a good cook.

1883
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:23,960
Really?

1884
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,960
I've been watching you

1885
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,680
I've been watching you taking care of everyone.

1886
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,080
No, because among girls,

1887
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,240
I know a little

1888
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,120
Really?

1889
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:34,920
Let me take a photo.

1890
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,680
Do you usually take photos?

1891
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,120
I like to record it. Yes.

1892
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,120
Let me try it for you.

1893
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:42,680
Okay.

1894
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,080
I brought a camera.

1895
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,200
There's an ancient city nearby.

1896
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,120
Let's take photos later.

1897
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:49,520
Sure.

1898
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,280
Can I?

1899
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,040
Are you interested?

1900
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:51,560
Or do you think...

1901
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,160
Of course.

1902
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:52,520
Really?

1903
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,640
Me too. If I want to go,

1904
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,720
I'll choose a small town like this.

1905
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:01,960
I don't think it's spicy.

1906
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:02,680
Really?

1907
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,640
It's a lot of numb.

1908
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,800
It shouldn't be spicy.

1909
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,480
Yes, it's not spicy.

1910
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,640
It's a little numb.

1911
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,200
This chili is just fragrant.

1912
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:10,520
These days,

1913
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,320
I've never eaten anything spicy.

1914
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,600
Luckily, I can eat it.

1915
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,640
Right?

1916
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,520
Because it's not spicy.

1917
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,120
Yes, it looks spicy, but it's actually okay.

1918
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,040
So you just said

1919
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,000
more care of you before.

1920
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,600
Do you like her type or...

1921
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,240
Sisters.

1922
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,320
Maybe in real life,

1923
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,400
in real life.

1924
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,280
Do you need her to pay attention to you?

1925
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,280
Because I'm a bit in love.

1926
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,200
You're in love.

1927
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:40,960
Can't you tell?

1928
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,360
You're the one being taken care of.

1929
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,600
You're so lovesick.

1930
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,920
You're totally different

1931
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,000
I'm not alone at all.

1932
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:47,640
Really.

1933
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,920
But you're being taken care of.

1934
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,200
You always ask her

1935
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,640
to take care of you,

1936
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,800
and she's been taking care of you.

1937
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,240
No.

1938
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,480
Anyway, when I'm in a relationship,

1939
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,560
life is around each other.

1940
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,280
Then you...

1941
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,000
For example, you like boys.

1942
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,120
other than tall ones.

1943
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,880
In other aspects,

1944
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,200
I like bossy ones.

1945
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:11,520
Okay.

1946
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,160
Hua said she likes bossy girls.

1947
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,160
If I don't say anything,

1948
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,920
my image will be overbearing.

1949
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,680
Tell me.

1950
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,880
Do you have any questions

1951
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:24,760
about my behavior?

1952
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,320
you can ask.

1953
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:27,600
Do I?

1954
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,960
Of course.

1955
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,120
I'm actually quite...

1956
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,360
I don't want you to feel awkward.

1957
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,200
No, I'm fine.

1958
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,360
Because I did think about it later.

1959
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,560
I know what you want to ask.

1960
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,640
I sent the message to Xinxin.

1961
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,560
The girls in the small house are excellent.

1962
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,640
Actually, I want to get in touch with them.

1963
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,120
I received Hua's message.

1964
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,760
It was obviously her.

1965
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,920
I thought I was quite fascinated.

1966
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,520
That behavior

1967
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,200
Did you realize it yourself

1968
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,240
or because you received something,

1969
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,480
because you received something?

1970
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,920
I got your text.

1971
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:11,680
Yes.

1972
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,080
Then I regretted

1973
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:14,680
Back then...

1974
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,840
So if I didn't take this step,

1975
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:17,640
you won't regret it.

1976
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,520
But you'll regret only after I take this step.

1977
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:19,920
No.

1978
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,040
I didn't think that much.

1979
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,040
Because we were not a team that afternoon.

1980
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,960
We had fun this afternoon.

1981
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,160
I was happy thinking about it.

1982
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:28,560
Right?

1983
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,280
I've been thinking

1984
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,000
I said,

1985
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,000
Flower.

1986
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,680
It really gives people emotional value.

1987
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,560
Xinxin may have been in touch with me a lot.

1988
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,040
I didn't think too much.

1989
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:39,400
So I sent it directly.

1990
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,360
Xinxin.

1991
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,040
It's Xinxin. I'll send it to Xinxin.

1992
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,320
You sent it to Xinxin?

1993
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,320
Who do you think I sent it to?

1994
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,480
Of course I just made an appointment with you, Susu.

1995
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,200
No, I sent it to Susu the first night.

1996
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,560
I sent it to Xinxin the second night.

1997
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:55,880
It's okay.

1998
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:56,560
I came in before you.

1999
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,200
I know enough about other boys.

2000
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,600
In the future,

2001
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,800
come to Beijing.

2002
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,120
Not necessarily.

2003
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,080
Shanghai is also good.

2004
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:09,440
Yes.

2005
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,320
Hua took the initiative

2006
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,640
asked me many questions.

2007
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,200
What she wants to know

2008
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,120
With her guidance,

2009
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,760
we may talk more

2010
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,400
more and more.

2011
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,600
and more relaxed.

2012
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:25,520
I'm full.

2013
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,800
Let's go to the ancient city nearby.

2014
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,240
Sure.

2015
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,640
I saw you all black today.

2016
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:34,680
So I wore white.

2017
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,200
They look good together.

2018
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,400
They look good together.

2019
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:37,960
You did it on purpose.

2020
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,680
What is this?

2021
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,640
These are for you.

2022
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,200
You can put it anywhere.

2023
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,520
A date is more formal.

2024
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,600
I'll give you a gift.

2025
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,200
Do you want to guess what it means?

2026
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,880
What is this?

2027
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,080
A butterfly or a snowflake?

2028
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,320
It's a butterfly.

2029
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:17,920
Butterfly

2030
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,040
Because we watch the first snow.

2031
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,360
It's blue.

2032
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,280
But there's another meaning.

2033
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,600
Because we listened to Butterfly together.

2034
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,000
Thank you.

2035
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,440
It's similar, but it's not.

2036
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,400
You can see what's special about butterflies.

2037
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,320
This butterfly

2038
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,440
has no wings.

2039
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,400
Yes.

2040
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,480
A butterfly with broken wings on the ground.

2041
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:05,520
Yes.

2042
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:07,680
I guessed it.

2043
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,360
I think that's your favorite song.

2044
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,160
I like it the most.

2045
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,640
Maybe many people don't know

2046
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,240
what it's called.

2047
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,520
My Tears Smashed.

2048
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:18,840
You know?

2049
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:22,680
I love it.

2050
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,880
This is my favorite song.

2051
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,520
Did you make this yourself?

2052
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:29,440
Yes, I did it.

2053
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,600
Yesterday

2054
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,280
I went yesterday.

2055
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,080
It's not like him.

2056
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,080
The things I know

2057
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,120
he would do.

2058
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,120
It takes time and energy to do.

2059
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,480
It's very sincere.

2060
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,280
I'm happy to receive a gift.

2061
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,640
Because I've been

2062
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,360
in these days.

2063
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,880
It will be affected by Su's actions.

2064
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,960
It's not a positive development.

2065
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,480
So I said I wanted to make some breakthroughs.

2066
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,680
What is your ideal love state?

2067
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,560
We have our own things to do.

2068
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,280
And

2069
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:18,680
But I can't say

2070
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,680
too much to do.

2071
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,440
You can't be

2072
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,840
that we haven't seen for a long time.

2073
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,880
We have our own things to do.

2074
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,840
And during the break,

2075
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,280
we go out for dinner, watch a movie

2076
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,280
or stay somewhere.

2077
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,160
I don't like foreign places.

2078
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,840
I need someone to be with me.

2079
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:39,840
Okay.

2080
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,640
What about you?

2081
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,560
I think we're similar.

2082
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,000
If he's not busy with his own things,

2083
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,960
he will

2084
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,440
put a lot of pressure on another person.

2085
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,800
You can't be busy when you're in a relationship.

2086
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,680
I have a lot of free time.

2087
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,400
That way, the one who's free will think too much.

2088
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,480
The busy one will think he's unreasonable.

2089
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,240
Do you like to live in a quiet place

2090
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,160
or a bustling place?

2091
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,960
I like to go to the park.

2092
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,120
You prefer a quiet place.

2093
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,720
But I can't keep saying

2094
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,440
go to the park every day.

2095
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,360
Sometimes I have to rely on

2096
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,520
to absorb some energy.

2097
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,960
You're an alien.

2098
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,200
But I like to go to the park.

2099
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:26,880
Why did you

2100
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,840
last night?

2101
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,160
I was playing Harry.

2102
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,360
Why? He's not sleeping either.

2103
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:31,920
No.

2104
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,240
I want to hit someone's brother.

2105
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:37,840
to vent my anger.

2106
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,920
No.

2107
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,400
Is he that handsome?

2108
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,400
Just kidding.

2109
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,720
I'll support you.

2110
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,680
You don't like it?

2111
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,400
people praise your sister?

2112
01:20:59,200 --> 01:20:59,800
Okay.

2113
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,160
I see.

2114
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,400
Then what?

2115
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:03,840
I really think he's handsome.

2116
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:04,640
I want him to come over.

2117
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,200
So I can know him.

2118
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,760
I also asked something unhappy.

2119
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,800
Susu was just supporting me.

2120
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,760
But her emotional value

2121
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,000
too much.

2122
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,680
I may be a little unhappy.

2123
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:20,080
But I feel much better after we talked.

2124
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:20,960
Maybe

2125
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,800
we haven't been in touch for long.

2126
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,320
He doesn't know

2127
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,000
or what kind of person I am.

2128
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,600
or the way

2129
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,840
my way of doing things.

2130
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:29,640
I think

2131
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,400
we should communicate more.

2132
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,200
So you were angry yesterday?

2133
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,240
A little.

2134
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,160
Really?

2135
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:39,680
Are you angry?

2136
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,120
Why didn't you tell me yourself?

2137
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:49,640
I don't know.

2138
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,560
It might be stuffy.

2139
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,000
I'll tell you when I get angry next time.

2140
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,520
Yes, I have to tell you.

2141
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,880
I think we need to solve something.

2142
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,120
Will something happen?

2143
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,480
For example, you didn't think it through.

2144
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,440
Then we met today.

2145
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,440
We went on a date.

2146
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,800
You may just hang up

2147
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,400
or you're cold to me.

2148
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,880
I'll think you're weird.

2149
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,880
I think you're suspicious.

2150
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,200
And then I get angry.

2151
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,560
So you're just

2152
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,560
Because I said others are handsome.

2153
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,320
And you...

2154
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,160
It seems a little...

2155
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,160
Next time.

2156
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:24,720
Next time.

2157
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:25,720
Still angry?

2158
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,280
Next time.

2159
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,040
Okay, I'll learn from you next time.

2160
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,120
As long as you talk to other girls,

2161
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:29,880
I get angry.

2162
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,680
I started to lose face.

2163
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,600
What?

2164
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,400
I want to learn from you.

2165
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:33,560
What did I do?

2166
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,480
When you talk to a girl,

2167
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,240
when you talk to a girl.

2168
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,240
Okay?

2169
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,160
No.

2170
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,640
I think our relationship

2171
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:47,720
is progressing.

2172
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,400
Because she would joke

2173
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,000
I'm going to date another girl.

2174
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,880
I would think

2175
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,640
if she cares about this,

2176
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,960
it means she likes me.

2177
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,120
You're happy now.

2178
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,040
Cheapskate.

2179
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,480
Then be petty. I have no choice.

2180
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,960
You're so petty.

2181
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:17,760
I'm speechless.

2182
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:29,720
Do you want some?

2183
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,240
No.

2184
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,560
Why aren't you eating?

2185
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,520
I'll eat it.

2186
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,040
You picked it for me?

2187
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,360
I did it for you.

2188
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,440
I'll give you a big piece.

2189
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,840
I never took the initiative

2190
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,520
to talk to someone.

2191
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,240
Thank you.

2192
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,120
I did it myself.

2193
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,200
You can't do this.

2194
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,520
This will make some people anxious.

2195
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,080
He can't sleep all night.

2196
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,160
If the table is here,

2197
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,480
will you do it?

2198
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,720
That's easy.

2199
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:07,440
Really?

2200
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:08,880
Ten minutes.

2201
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,280
It's so hard. Ten minutes.

2202
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,880
I think

2203
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,680
a vacuum cleaner humidifier.

2204
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,440
To me, it's already...

2205
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,640
Yes, Harry said he bought one.

2206
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,360
He bought that for me and I took it upstairs.

2207
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:21,920
But I haven't used it

2208
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:23,640
Not yet

2209
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,400
I did.

2210
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,320
It's useless.

2211
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,200
No water.

2212
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,160
It has been upstairs for three days.

2213
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,560
He's better than one person.

2214
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,280
I didn't bring it up.

2215
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,240
It's from the tower.

2216
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,720
No wonder your room is crowded.

2217
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,240
I hope someone is kind.

2218
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,120
Please add water and open it for me.

2219
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,080
You can't enter a girl's room.

2220
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,120
You don't have to come in.

2221
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,520
I'll put that at the door.

2222
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,320
Thank you.

2223
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:52,920
Okay?

2224
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:53,640
Okay.

2225
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,040
I think our relationship

2226
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,000
is developing in a good way.

2227
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,880
I think it's good to take it slow.

2228
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,880
This is a very fulfilling date.

2229
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,760
It's well arranged.

2230
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,600
Maybe everything

2231
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,280
the girl's imagination.

2232
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:12,960
I think

2233
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,280
did a good job.

2234
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,440
It's already perfect.

2235
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,720
I don't think any man

2236
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,080
would give me a date like this.

2237
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,240
Let's go.

2238
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:25,800
Okay.

2239
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:27,240
Did you have fun today?

2240
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,880
Yes.

2241
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,880
I want to play ping-pong.

2242
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,960
I want to play now.

2243
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,600
Do you think there are

2244
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,600
in the house?

2245
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,120
Yes, I'm on a date.

2246
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,000
Okay, I'm happy.

2247
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,240
So when you're in a relationship,

2248
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,400
you will...

2249
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,320
The question you asked me before

2250
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,240
Did you fall in love at first sight

2251
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,080
or love grows over time?

2252
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,160
I feel that

2253
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:03,800
Both.

2254
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,240
Yes.

2255
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,880
Actually, I'm not like you.

2256
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:07,880
you may be slow.

2257
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:08,760
You'll observe for a long time.

2258
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:09,560
I'll observe for a long time.

2259
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,000
Yes.

2260
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,640
There's something

2261
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,840
touched me.

2262
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,520
I will

2263
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,400
fall in love.

2264
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,600
Yes, I won't observe for long.

2265
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,000
I'll be together and slowly

2266
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,520
Because I think

2267
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,320
eye contact is very important.

2268
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,120
Maybe

2269
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,760
At that moment, you think it's right.

2270
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,840
you think

2271
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,400
you won't have any conflicts with him anymore.

2272
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,120
Do you have a good temper?

2273
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,080
What do you think?

2274
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,600
It's good for now.

2275
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,200
He has a good temper.

2276
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,080
Do you fight?

2277
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,520
Do you fight like crazy?

2278
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,680
It may be noisy when you suffocate to death.

2279
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:47,640
But

2280
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,800
I have a big flaw.

2281
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,000
I'm stubborn.

2282
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,280
Stubborn.

2283
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,320
Yes, my family and I are stubborn.

2284
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,680
But will you regret it after that?

2285
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,040
Yes, if this

2286
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,320
is my problem,

2287
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,640
I will reflect on myself.

2288
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,920
But if I think I'm fine,

2289
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:04,560
I'll be stubborn to the end.

2290
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,280
I saw it.

2291
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,480
Yongning Ancient City.

2292
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:16,680
So many people.

2293
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:17,560
Yes.

2294
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,320
The weather is nice today.

2295
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,760
Do you want candied haws?

2296
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,120
You can do it.

2297
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,040
Strawberry

2298
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,080
Two strawberries.

2299
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,960
Okay, let's go.

2300
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:29,760
Let's go.

2301
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,880
This is my first time eating candied haws in Beijing.

2302
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:34,920
There's a car.

2303
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:38,720
It's quite sweet.

2304
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,520
The strawberries are quite sweet.

2305
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,160
I think it's sweet.

2306
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,680
Every time I come to Beijing,

2307
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,040
eat candied haws in Beijing.

2308
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,200
but I didn't have the chance to eat them.

2309
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,120
Nest.

2310
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,120
It suddenly occurred to me that Xin said she couldn't understand

2311
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,120
dried fruit.

2312
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:56,680
Do you like it?

2313
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,520
I'm fine.

2314
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,160
I might like beef jerky.

2315
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,520
And I like nuts too.

2316
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,880
I saw you buy

2317
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,520
Happy Fruit.

2318
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:06,840
A dart.

2319
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:07,960
Do you want to play?

2320
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,520
Can we play this?

2321
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,040
Yes.

2322
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:10,640
Have a try.

2323
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,160
I'll play.

2324
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,000
Okay.

2325
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:13,640
I won't.

2326
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,240
I'm off.

2327
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,280
Let me try.

2328
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:18,680
You do it.

2329
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,480
Try it. Try again.

2330
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,280
It's okay. You can move forward.

2331
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,880
Okay, two.

2332
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,400
Almost.

2333
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,040
If you fail, I'll do it, right?

2334
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:31,400
Yes.

2335
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,160
Three.

2336
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:33,960
I think you should do it.

2337
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:34,840
Really?

2338
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:37,880
Four.

2339
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,640
Five.

2340
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:40,520
You're better.

2341
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,600
I'll hold it for you.

2342
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:46,920
Seven.

2343
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,680
Almost. You do it.

2344
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:50,960
Seven.

2345
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,600
Really?

2346
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,360
I think you're better.

2347
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,360
Why don't you do it?

2348
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,440
Stab right.

2349
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,640
You do it. You do it.

2350
01:28:59,360 --> 01:28:59,960
Seven.

2351
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:01,440
Eight.

2352
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,120
I'll stand here. It's windy here.

2353
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,040
Here you are.

2354
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,440
Okay, thank you.

2355
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,360
I think he's quite considerate.

2356
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,680
Standing at the wind

2357
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,000
It's warm to be able to block the wind for me.

2358
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,000
Thirteen, the last one.

2359
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,520
14.

2360
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:17,880
Count us fifteen, boss.

2361
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,840
Pick one of the prizes.

2362
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,000
This one?

2363
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:21,320
Yes.

2364
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,360
Thank you.

2365
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,800
I guess you're not as good as me in shooting.

2366
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:26,920
I'm not convinced.

2367
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:28,360
I'm not convinced.

2368
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,560
Let's find someone who can shoot.

2369
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:30,400
There's a chance later.

2370
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,680
How do I use this?

2371
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,960
Turn around.

2372
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,280
Can we use this?

2373
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,280
Can we?

2374
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,360
Sure.

2375
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,120
Turn it around.

2376
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:44,760
Like this.

2377
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,680
How to turn?

2378
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,390
Now, let me teach you. Turn like this.

2379
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:48,440
Find the direction first.

2380
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,920
Turn like this when you find the direction.

2381
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,720
I think I got it.

2382
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:51,960
You should.

2383
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:52,990
I can see now.

2384
01:29:52,990 --> 01:29:54,110
Let me try. Can my hand do it?

2385
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:54,840
Let me see.

2386
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,070
Okay.

2387
01:29:59,070 --> 01:29:59,680
Let me try again.

2388
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,520
No.

2389
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,520
Why don't you try it?

2390
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:04,600
Try it.

2391
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,400
Let me try.

2392
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,350
I think you're learning so fast.

2393
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,270
But you failed.

2394
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,480
Don't stop.

2395
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,200
Yes.

2396
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:14,960
Don't raise it too high.

2397
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,350
But hurry up, right?

2398
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:18,640
Let me show you

2399
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:19,160
Okay.

2400
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,720
Look at this.

2401
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,360
Look.

2402
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:22,800
Like this.

2403
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:24,720
Practice makes perfect.

2404
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,950
Look, he must be conscious.

2405
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:27,230
Tell it to turn around.

2406
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:28,120
Got it?

2407
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:32,400
Thank you. We learned it today.

2408
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,240
Yes.

2409
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,200
Thank you.

2410
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:34,840
You're welcome.

2411
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:35,710
Bye.

2412
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,310
Let's take a walk.

2413
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:38,680
Okay, when we get back...

2414
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,590
Guodan skin.

2415
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,310
I brought them some.

2416
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,400
Let me.

2417
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:46,910
It's okay.

2418
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:48,830
I want to bring a gift too.

2419
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,800
This is your nuts.

2420
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,190
I want to call it one kilo of this.

2421
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,680
This strawberry is really big.

2422
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:57,040
Buy some

2423
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:57,840
Thank you.

2424
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,000
Bye.

2425
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,560
Boss, buy some beef jerky.

2426
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:01,150
Okay.

2427
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,750
Thank you.

2428
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:04,160
Let's go.

2429
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:08,120
You're here in fashion week's clothes.

2430
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,840
I think today

2431
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:12,800
with Huahua today.

2432
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,040
Our relationship must have improved.

2433
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,030
and a lot.

2434
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:19,360
When two people shopping in life,

2435
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,760
and more relaxed.

2436
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,520
Because these are life.

2437
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,470
If I get full marks,

2438
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:28,190
I'll give him eight points for today's date.

2439
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,110
I think he's quite considerate.

2440
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:33,360
Warm his hands with the heating pads.

2441
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,960
and block the wind for me.

2442
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,480
The bag is a little heavy.

2443
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,600
He didn't even carry it for me.

2444
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,230
I think it's quite interesting.

2445
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:46,320
Take a look.

2446
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:47,320
Let me take a photo for you.

2447
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:48,600
The city tower?

2448
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,080
Three, two, one.

2449
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,600
What impressed me the most

2450
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:57,760
I took a photo for her.

2451
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:58,960
She smiles when she takes photos.

2452
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,560
She looks really cute

2453
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,240
She's really cute.

2454
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,840
Take my prize.

2455
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,560
Three, two, one. Cheese.

2456
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:08,320
Excuse me.

2457
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:09,950
Excuse me.

2458
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,240
Three, two, one.

2459
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,560
I was a mother who was loved

2460
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,520
who loved me.

2461
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,310
Not many people record me after that.

2462
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:22,110
Take photos for me.

2463
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:23,800
I don't know.

2464
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,240
I want to be recorded.

2465
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,030
he took photos for me all day.

2466
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:30,110
This is what touched me the most today.

2467
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:31,960
Just stand there today.

2468
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,960
I'll take a photo for you.

2469
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:33,880
You know,

2470
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:36,350
this really touched me.

2471
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:37,760
I'm so happy.

2472
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,920
Let's go home.

2473
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:51,480
Let's go.

2474
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:53,440
So cold

2475
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,040
Chef

2476
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,320
Do you know what it is?

2477
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,920
Table Tennis table.

2478
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,200
You only think about ping pong table.

2479
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:15,760
You're back.

2480
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,040
I'll freeze the meat.

2481
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,480
Do you know what we are doing?

2482
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:20,400
What are we doing?

2483
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,630
We're making your dragon.

2484
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:23,520
Love it.

2485
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,720
A man who can cook

2486
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:25,790
He forced himself to do something.

2487
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,440
Let me rest.

2488
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:28,920
Babies.

2489
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,360
I got up at six.

2490
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,000
Go and rest.

2491
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,320
I know you.

2492
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,120
Go.

2493
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:34,720
Love you.

2494
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,400
I'm in a good mood today.

2495
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,200
Indeed.

2496
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:45,280
So many packages.

2497
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,040
It's freezing.

2498
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,190
What are you doing?

2499
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,000
What did you buy?

2500
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,520
You're back too.

2501
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,280
Good afternoon.

2502
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:51,680
Yes.

2503
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,080
We're back too.

2504
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:53,840
I suddenly realized

2505
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:54,720
we don't have to

2506
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:55,520
make so much food?

2507
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,080
We bought a lot of food.

2508
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:11,680
We're amazing, Xiao Ling.

2509
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,400
Cut the beef meatballs and put them in the plate.

2510
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,110
Awesome.

2511
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,560
Thank you for your compliment.

2512
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,470
So virtuous.

2513
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,350
Give it to me.

2514
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,870
Give it to me.

2515
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:29,440
Okay.

2516
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,440
I'll let you join.

2517
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,190
It makes me feel participated.

2518
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:33,150
Thank you.

2519
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,320
Do you need help?

2520
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,200
You're dressed like this.

2521
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:42,840
I don't think so.

2522
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,040
Are you hungry?

2523
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,870
I don't think the meat is enough.

2524
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:49,760
If you think it's enough,

2525
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,120
I can do it alone.

2526
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:51,960
Is it enough?

2527
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:52,920
There's shrimp slices.

2528
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:53,600
I think we can

2529
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,800
with one spoon.

2530
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:55,840
I don't think it's enough.

2531
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:56,350
To be honest,

2532
01:34:56,830 --> 01:34:57,760
Then open another one.

2533
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:58,960
Okay.

2534
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:02,200
Are you waiting for that?

2535
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:05,440
How do you know me so well, woman?

2536
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:07,320
I'm a smart person.

2537
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:08,670
You shouldn't be that smart.

2538
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:09,720
I'm just very smart.

2539
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:20,640
I think I'm too strong.

2540
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,960
I need to be praised.

2541
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:24,400
You're amazing.

2542
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,000
You're the chef of this house.

2543
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,390
We'll starve to death without you.

2544
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,520
Are you happy?

2545
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,200
Rainbow boot.

2546
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,760
I'll take these down first.

2547
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:36,440
That should be enough.

2548
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,800
Okay.

2549
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,080
This is for you.

2550
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,320
You're kind.

2551
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:45,360
It's just a gift

2552
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,360
It's a gift.

2553
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,150
Finally we have meat.

2554
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,550
I don't think there's anything to cut.

2555
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:56,510
No.

2556
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:02,520
Xiao Ling.

2557
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:04,880
Try it.

2558
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:11,230
How is it?

2559
01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:12,640
No taste

2560
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:13,950
But does it smell good?

2561
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:15,120
Yes.

2562
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:15,920
You asked so many questions.

2563
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,280
Why don't you try it yourself?

2564
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,520
Do you want some salt?

2565
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,000
No need.

2566
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,360
Then I won't.

2567
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:21,950
No need.

2568
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:23,520
It's actually white water.

2569
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:23,920
Both are fine.

2570
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:24,960
I won't do it then.

2571
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,040
I won't.

2572
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,560
Shut up.

2573
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:29,760
I'm afraid

2574
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,640
Check again.

2575
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:31,070
Yes.

2576
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:31,760
I won't.

2577
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,560
Check again, Xiao Ling.

2578
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,120
Let's check again and again.

2579
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:41,310
Actually, I'm hungry.

2580
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:42,560
You can have beef meatball soup first.

2581
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,550
I think it's okay.

2582
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,400
I'm just too virtuous.

2583
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:50,750
I'm a woman.

2584
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:51,640
I will marry myself.

2585
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,480
Did you hear

2586
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:57,630
Did you hear it?

2587
01:36:57,630 --> 01:36:59,320
the joy of having dinner downstairs?

2588
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:03,920
Hello.

2589
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:07,000
Whose bowl is this?

2590
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:17,120
Did you put chili?

2591
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:18,400
I put a bag.

2592
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,200
Because this is...

2593
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,120
You put them all.

2594
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,150
You want to compete with me?

2595
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:26,110
I can eat better than you.

2596
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:26,840
Do you dare to compete with me?

2597
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:28,030
I don't want to compete with you.

2598
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,590
There's sauce over there.

2599
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:35,360
You can get it.

2600
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,560
Tata cut some chili for you.

2601
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,040
Where is it?

2602
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:38,720
Here.

2603
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:39,760
You cut it for me?

2604
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,400
Only you eat spicy food.

2605
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,440
That's nice.

2606
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:44,800
Okay.

2607
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:45,360
Here.

2608
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,040
We've divided the meat.

2609
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:48,830
Thank you.

2610
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,000
Like that little bird waiting for mom

2611
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,160
Get that earthworm back.

2612
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,150
He's opening his mouth.

2613
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,030
It feels good.

2614
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,640
Bring me the bowl.

2615
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:17,310
Here, shrimp slices.

2616
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:20,960
You spent all of it.

2617
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:21,440
Thank you.

2618
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,680
How do you know?

2619
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:28,400
Is there anything you want to eat?

2620
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,000
I want to eat crayfish.

2621
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,800
Do you want shrimp skating?

2622
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,480
Harry, come here.

2623
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:44,990
Come and eat hot pot.

2624
01:38:44,990 --> 01:38:45,760
I'm really tired.

2625
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:46,520
I'm very tired now.

2626
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:47,040
You know?

2627
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:50,360
Xinxin.

2628
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:52,990
Xinxin, come here.

2629
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,160
Sit here.

2630
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:13,880
Hua.

2631
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:14,910
You went to Gu Beishui Town?

2632
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:15,710
Well...

2633
01:39:15,710 --> 01:39:17,120
Yongning Ancient Town.

2634
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:18,880
So many tofu.

2635
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,320
We bought a lot of things.

2636
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,270
Its specialty, Yongning Tofu.

2637
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:23,040
Over there.

2638
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:23,840
Do you want some?

2639
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:24,990
I'll get you some.

2640
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:25,760
Sure.

2641
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,400
I'll get some.

2642
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,000
This is a bribe.

2643
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:32,640
Do you understand?

2644
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:33,840
Wash it for me tonight.

2645
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:35,520
For what?

2646
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,160
It's none of your business.

2647
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,600
It's a secret between us boys.

2648
01:39:41,150 --> 01:39:42,040
He bribed me every day.

2649
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,390
He paints pastries for me every day.

2650
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,600
He does?

2651
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,240
Don't listen to him.

2652
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:47,840
He's so happy.

2653
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,670
He smiled like a monkey.

2654
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:49,470
I heard it.

2655
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:51,200
Are you that happy, Tu?

2656
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,000
Dried tofu.

2657
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,120
Try it.

2658
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:58,360
I put them together.

2659
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,120
There are many kinds.

2660
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,400
Do you want to try it? You haven't tried it.

2661
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,400
It's really delicious.

2662
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:06,750
Is it spicy?

2663
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,600
Not very spicy.

2664
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:09,790
Try this tofu.

2665
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:10,910
I like bean products.

2666
01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:11,480
Really.

2667
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,600
These are all

2668
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,190
we had today.

2669
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:16,920
We had the first bite.

2670
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:17,400
I thought

2671
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,910
it's better than drawing.

2672
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,150
It's really delicious.

2673
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,720
But it's not as good as mine.

2674
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,200
Yes.

2675
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,920
That's a line.

2676
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,440
You're not as good as the flow line, the map.

2677
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,960
Why did you

2678
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:32,880
that day?

2679
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:33,760
I don't know.

2680
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:34,560
I'm weak.

2681
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,480
sensitive little boy.

2682
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:36,480
No, you're not dark.

2683
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,560
Just remove your makeup.

2684
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:38,960
I think it's so dark.

2685
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:39,800
So dark.

2686
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,520
It's really dark.

2687
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:43,390
What about me?

2688
01:40:45,470 --> 01:40:46,160
Brother.

2689
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:47,200
I mean your face.

2690
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:49,400
Your hands didn't get tanned.

2691
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:53,560
That's because your face is whiter than mine.

2692
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,110
If you say that,

2693
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:55,600
your hands are darker than mine.

2694
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,360
Almost.

2695
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,400
I beg you.

2696
01:40:58,400 --> 01:40:59,360
Say it again.

2697
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,830
Where's Xinxin? Doesn't she eat?

2698
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:06,040
I ate a lot.

2699
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,360
I haven't seen Xinxin.

2700
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,280
I've been sitting here.

2701
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,150
Because a mountain blocked me.

2702
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:10,560
Yes, he blocked it.

2703
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:12,640
I blocked him.

2704
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:15,320
Hua, sit down.

2705
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:15,920
Let me tell you.

2706
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:16,350
I had a dream

2707
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:17,440
the night before yesterday.

2708
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,800
At our school,

2709
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:20,830
He was a superstar.

2710
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:21,360
And he...

2711
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,910
I met him in the toilet.

2712
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:23,440
Then I met him.

2713
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:24,640
I said I met a star.

2714
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:25,950
I said let's take a photo.

2715
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:26,910
Then I took him in.

2716
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:27,920
Then I said, "Take a photo quickly."

2717
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:29,040
After that?

2718
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,640
I ran into flowers after I came out.

2719
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:32,080
Then I met them.

2720
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,360
they were acting as partners.

2721
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:34,800
And...

2722
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:35,840
Then I said,

2723
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:36,800
I said,

2724
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,840
Master Hua taught me how to fry eggs.

2725
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:38,720
I said,

2726
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:41,760
I was wondering why Hua showed up.

2727
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,040
I said I was weird.

2728
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,000
They were filming here.

2729
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,600
I chased them behind the motorcycle.

2730
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,590
Because he didn't...

2731
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:48,320
He hasn't signed my autograph yet.

2732
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,600
Then I went after them.

2733
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:50,910
After I met a slope,

2734
01:41:50,910 --> 01:41:52,240
their car fell over.

2735
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:54,590
Then we went to save them.

2736
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:55,800
and found they were fine.

2737
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,040
Then he was lying there.

2738
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,640
He fell down and gave me an autograph and woke up.

2739
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:01,680
A 12-hour dream.

2740
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,360
That long? That short?

2741
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,630
Catch me.

2742
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:15,390
I said you'll get scratched.

2743
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:16,350
You need an injection to tell the truth.

2744
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:17,920
Really?

2745
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,230
Go wash your hands with soap.

2746
01:42:19,230 --> 01:42:19,870
You're not bleeding.

2747
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:20,960
There's nothing you can do.

2748
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:21,280
No.

2749
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,240
It's a stray cat.

2750
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:23,710
Is it bleeding?

2751
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,280
A little.

2752
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:25,840
Go.

2753
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:26,520
There's blood.

2754
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:28,000
Does it count?

2755
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:31,760
Go.

2756
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:32,400
Go.

2757
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,470
Use cold water for five minutes.

2758
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:34,590
Hurry.

2759
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:35,280
No need.

2760
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,800
Use cold water for real.

2761
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,790
I don't know how.

2762
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:38,640
Brother.

2763
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:38,960
No.

2764
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,080
It'll be fine

2765
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,240
it will be fine.

2766
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:41,760
Of course.

2767
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,120
If you're not alive,

2768
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:44,120
It will live.

2769
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,200
Don't scare me.

2770
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:48,190
There's no soap.

2771
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:49,760
Use soap first.

2772
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,390
Don't pinch it.

2773
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:52,030
It's okay.

2774
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:52,960
I think it's okay.

2775
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,240
It's really okay.

2776
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:56,240
At least 15 minutes.

2777
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:57,560
Hold it.

2778
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,320
I don't want to go.

2779
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:06,680
Keep going.

2780
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,640
I don't want to.

2781
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,310
What are you doing?

2782
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:14,480
I know.

2783
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:16,960
it only gets infected

2784
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,270
by a mad dog.

2785
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:20,990
There is no virus on the claws.

2786
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:21,790
Only saliva.

2787
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:24,160
It licked the claws, man.

2788
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:25,920
I'm really fine.

2789
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:27,760
No bleeding.

2790
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,560
No bleeding.

2791
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,000
I got a text.

2792
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:42,110
(Every member of the house)

2793
01:43:42,110 --> 01:43:45,560
Every member of the cabin can be the questioner

2794
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:46,750
to the Mirror House

2795
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:48,720
to have an anonymous secret conversation.

2796
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:50,240
We only have one chance

2797
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,000
to invite the opposite sex.

2798
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,360
So you don't have to use it, right?

2799
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,800
You don't have to use it.

2800
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:35,960
This is a good opportunity.

2801
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,680
to torture each other.

2802
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:38,720
Maybe on a date,

2803
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,280
you don't want to answer,

2804
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:42,240
you may get through it.

2805
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,760
But there's no escape.

2806
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,960
I can ask questions secretly later.

2807
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,240
Then I want to ask

2808
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:51,800
five to seven questions.

2809
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:52,800
Think about it for me.

2810
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:55,640
A question?

2811
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:57,280
Just ask her.

2812
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,750
Which one do you like

2813
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:02,240
Which one do you like?

2814
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,240
After your date today,

2815
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:06,080
do you think

2816
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,870
do you prefer dating Fatty

2817
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:09,240
or Tae-ri?

2818
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,070
I think it's better

2819
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:12,350
I should ask myself.

2820
01:45:12,830 --> 01:45:14,840
Ask her if she's happy today.

2821
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,240
She'll definitely say she's happy.

2822
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:17,120
That's what I thought.

2823
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:18,750
With her personality, she would say she's unhappy.

2824
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:20,000
Which one is happier?

2825
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:20,600
What do you mean?

2826
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,800
I made a wrong date with her.

2827
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:23,800
You can be happy if you make a mistake.

2828
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:24,960
Why can't I be happy?

2829
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:26,750
Which date

2830
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:27,390
or the last date?

2831
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:28,120
Yes.

2832
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,320
Ask her some details.

2833
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,270
to make her feel that you didn't ask.

2834
01:45:34,270 --> 01:45:36,440
Just some of her real thoughts.

2835
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:39,000
You are

2836
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,990
You're hesitant when it comes to love.

2837
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:41,520
Yes.

2838
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,520
Then you have to ask her

2839
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,040
if you are

2840
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:47,230
If a man has feelings for you,

2841
01:45:47,230 --> 01:45:48,600
you'll feel pressured.

2842
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,320
Do you think

2843
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,510
you think

2844
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:53,950
you must give him feedback.

2845
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,360
or

2846
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,440
you will give feedback immediately

2847
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:00,120
or a resolute person who can make it clear?

2848
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,080
who keeps the boundary.

2849
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:02,960
It's obvious that

2850
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,440
I can feel that she's a friendly person.

2851
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,680
She's kind of friendly.

2852
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:06,910
Just ask this question again.

2853
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:09,600
Is your feedback subconsciously

2854
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,440
Or do you think

2855
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:15,120
you feel guilty

2856
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:16,800
You feel guilty without feedback.

2857
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:17,760
The question just now is

2858
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,440
if the boy is feeling pressured.

2859
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:20,440
She's obviously stressed out.

2860
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,520
I knew it yesterday.

2861
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,200
You saw it?

2862
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,880
might be her subconscious.

2863
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:25,840
But if she answered you herself,

2864
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:26,720
I still have to ask.

2865
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:27,200
Yes.

2866
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,160
Because what she said to you

2867
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,600
what she really thinks.

2868
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,550
is different from her subconscious.

2869
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:34,840
It's too hard.

2870
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,600
I feel

2871
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:56,800
It was amazing.

2872
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,160
There was a mirror in front of me

2873
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,240
And I took a look.

2874
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,310
I also did my hair.

2875
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:02,750
Later I found out

2876
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:04,640
the other side can see what I'm doing.

2877
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,160
I want to ask Hua the most.

2878
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:11,870
I've thought about a lot.

2879
01:47:11,870 --> 01:47:13,790
How should I ask?

2880
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:15,280
Do you want to be relaxed

2881
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,350
or ask

2882
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:18,910
what you want to know.

2883
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,710
I'll ask you a few questions.

2884
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:27,040
Let me ask you something simple.

2885
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,520
Are you happy today

2886
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,200
or did you have a good date before?

2887
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:42,590
We went to two places today.

2888
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:45,280
We had a date before.

2889
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I think

2890
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:51,120
I think today's date might be more fun.

2891
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:56,240
Okay.

2892
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,430
The second question.

2893
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,200
Are you a friendly person?

2894
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,590
Yes.

2895
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:06,240
If two boys are nice to you,

2896
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:08,350
will you choose to accept

2897
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:09,680
or discrimination?

2898
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,280
If she says she wants to do it at the same time,

2899
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,880
I'll probably know

2900
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,640
it takes more time to contact.

2901
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,680
If she says discrimination,

2902
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:19,070
those days,

2903
01:48:19,070 --> 01:48:20,000
or tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,

2904
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,720
I knew I was

2905
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:22,590
I'm the one who's different.

2906
01:48:22,590 --> 01:48:23,840
or the other one?

2907
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,520
There will be discrimination.

2908
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,920
In a relationship,

2909
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,920
in a relationship

2910
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,470
and control your desire?

2911
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:34,560
Yes.

2912
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,670
Can you accept your other half

2913
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,080
the same as you?

2914
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:44,350
I can accept it.

2915
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:45,400
I have a question.

2916
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,840
if there were two or three girls

2917
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,720
if he has two or three girls

2918
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:51,800
and let him go,

2919
01:48:52,510 --> 01:48:53,760
He did the same thing as you.

2920
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,750
Can you accept it?

2921
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,270
What I'm doing now is

2922
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:02,320
I'm meeting everyone equally.

2923
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:02,590
Yes.

2924
01:49:02,590 --> 01:49:04,400
I think it's okay at the beginning.

2925
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,110
But I can't accept it later.

2926
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:07,870
Got it.

2927
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:08,560
Got it.

2928
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,040
Okay.

2929
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:10,320
No more questions.

2930
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:14,270
I think when he asks questions,

2931
01:49:14,270 --> 01:49:15,520
from the first question,

2932
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,200
his mood wasn't that high.

2933
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:19,200
From his pause,

2934
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:20,990
and the way he questions,

2935
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:23,480
I think I should be fat.

2936
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:30,960
I think this answer

2937
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,560
is a bit official.

2938
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,920
but also

2939
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:35,550
a little sincere.

2940
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:36,120
I think

2941
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,760
this may not be the best answer in my heart.

2942
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:57,720
I went to the Mirror Room today

2943
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:59,710
because it's a one-sided glass.

2944
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:00,830
I can see her

2945
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:02,110
her movements and expressions.

2946
01:50:02,110 --> 01:50:02,750
She can't see it.

2947
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:03,870
Through some questions,

2948
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:06,800
and her facial expressions,

2949
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,120
are you nervous?

2950
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:10,680
I wonder if you can see something.

2951
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:15,680
I want to ask you some questions.

2952
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,560
I want to ask you some questions.

2953
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:18,480
Okay.

2954
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:21,630
About today's...

2955
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:22,360
date today,

2956
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:24,000
Are you satisfied that I made this choice for you?

2957
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:26,240
The choice you made for me

2958
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,640
is today's date.

2959
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:31,000
Isn't it the date I chose for you?

2960
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,790
I asked her questions as her brother.

2961
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:38,960
because I think

2962
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,080
she would let her guard down.

2963
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:43,230
She may be more sincere.

2964
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:44,920
Satisfied.

2965
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,360
The second boy is dramatic.

2966
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:49,280
He's pretending to be my brother.

2967
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:52,920
Why would he ask me to go to the Mirror House?

2968
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:53,880
Besides,

2969
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:55,760
he doesn't know there's a sibling house.

2970
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:56,350
This thing?

2971
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:57,630
I'll definitely ask him.

2972
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:58,960
I think it's funny.

2973
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:00,320
But I still pretended

2974
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,400
you were my brother.

2975
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:02,200
I answered you.

2976
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,110
Are you happy today?

2977
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:07,640
I might be happier today.

2978
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,880
First date is eating

2979
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,600
And this date

2980
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,080
except eating.

2981
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:14,560
It's been recorded for a day today.

2982
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:23,070
How do you think he cares about you?

2983
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:26,320
Actually, I think everyone is different.

2984
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,400
Some people

2985
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,200
is a little reserved.

2986
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:32,080
I'll make you breakfast

2987
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,630
or bring you food.

2988
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:35,320
and care if you eat it or not.

2989
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:37,310
But some people

2990
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:38,680
express

2991
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:40,400
more passionate.

2992
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:43,040
I'll give it to you.

2993
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,280
Just you.

2994
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,440
These two are divided into

2995
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,240
One is initiative.

2996
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:49,560
and the other is passive.

2997
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,520
which one

2998
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,190
which one do you prefer?

2999
01:51:52,190 --> 01:51:52,990
The latter

3000
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:54,680
Just give it to me.

3001
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,120
Okay.

3002
01:51:57,790 --> 01:51:58,910
Do you have

3003
01:51:58,910 --> 01:52:00,830
you want to know more about?

3004
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,000
Yes.

3005
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:02,880
Since when?

3006
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:05,280
Recently or before

3007
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:06,360
Recently?

3008
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:07,440
Recently,

3009
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:12,320
I think

3010
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,080
this person may be me.

3011
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,880
Because I'm the only one

3012
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,000
is me.

3013
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,640
Something happened that made you

3014
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:22,840
change your mind.

3015
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:24,640
Because in the past,

3016
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:26,270
I tend to take care of others.

3017
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:27,920
But I think

3018
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:30,750
I might be taken care of recently.

3019
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,030
And a lot.

3020
01:52:36,350 --> 01:52:37,470
Through these answers,

3021
01:52:37,470 --> 01:52:38,680
I want to confirm

3022
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:39,760
what she thinks

3023
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,560
at this stage?

3024
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:44,280
Today's thought

3025
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:46,480
has changed a few days ago, right?

3026
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:50,680
I think I might be

3027
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:52,600
a little hesitant.

3028
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,870
A little.

3029
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:57,080
The dilemma

3030
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,600
The problem is

3031
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:02,040
I can compare myself.

3032
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,280
Because I had two dates.

3033
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:09,840
I didn't meet the same person.

3034
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:13,680
I think he has been

3035
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,600
about

3036
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:17,310
how I feel.

3037
01:53:17,310 --> 01:53:18,840
She might be testing me.

3038
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,040
Actually, she knew

3039
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:22,880
another guy.

3040
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,440
Maybe when she comes to me recently,

3041
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:26,160
she might have

3042
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,070
in her heart.

3043
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:28,240
may be changing.

3044
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:30,320
I haven't decided yet.

3045
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:32,560
There must be a bonus for today's date.

3046
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:33,840
But she's still observing.

3047
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,920
She still wants to know more about me

3048
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,200
or another guy.

3049
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:39,920
That's all.

3050
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:40,560
Okay.

3051
01:53:44,670 --> 01:53:45,880
After I asked him today,

3052
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:47,800
I think Hua is still

3053
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:49,680
between the two boys.

3054
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:52,280
I'm usually passive.

3055
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,160
I think I might do something

3056
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:55,870
a little straight.

3057
01:53:55,870 --> 01:53:56,920
Because she said today

3058
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:59,480
One is to bring the food to you.

3059
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:00,880
and say you'll give it to me.

3060
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:03,000
One is asking if you want it.

3061
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,440
She might prefer the former.

3062
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,400
I belong to the latter.

3063
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,800
But I may

3064
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,830
try to change.

3065
01:54:08,830 --> 01:54:11,800
I may be more straightforward in the future.

3066
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,120
I haven't

3067
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:25,280
to ask the person I want to ask.

3068
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:27,920
So I sent it that I need this place

3069
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,150
to have a conversation.

3070
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:44,030
I invited Fatty.

3071
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:45,950
Because Fatty and I argue a lot every day.

3072
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:48,000
But we seldom sit down and chat.

3073
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,150
Except for the first date,

3074
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:51,440
I think it must be Hua.

3075
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,440
My reaction was

3076
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:54,160
Oh no.

3077
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:56,120
I'm going to accept the trial of my soul.

3078
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:02,720
Do you feel happy

3079
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,520
these days?

3080
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:05,600
Yes.

3081
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:07,840
Are you unhappy?

3082
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:09,840
Yes.

3083
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:10,320
Not much.

3084
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,670
What makes you unhappy?

3085
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:15,390
Because of my brother.

3086
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:18,400
Have you ever been unhappy?

3087
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:19,840
Not really.

3088
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:21,200
I don't think so.

3089
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:25,310
He said he's basically not unhappy.

3090
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:25,840
I was thinking

3091
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:26,430
that is

3092
01:55:26,430 --> 01:55:28,510
when I met other boys,

3093
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:30,110
he didn't feel unhappy.

3094
01:55:30,110 --> 01:55:31,000
So at the moment,

3095
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,670
I feel a little disappointed.

3096
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:38,000
So you are

3097
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,030
fall in love at first sight?

3098
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:41,920
or love at first sight?

3099
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:44,800
I fell in love at first sight, right?

3100
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,520
You fell in love at first sight

3101
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,310
you fell in love at first sight.

3102
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:56,400
Will you keep in touch with her

3103
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,880
or every girl

3104
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,480
and compare them.

3105
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:03,680
The one in the room

3106
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:06,160
the one I told you at first sight

3107
01:56:06,430 --> 01:56:07,710
at first sight.

3108
01:56:07,710 --> 01:56:09,630
I think love at first sight

3109
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:11,870
it must be built

3110
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:13,470
a little bit.

3111
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:14,680
It's love at first sight.

3112
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:16,760
It's not that

3113
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:18,080
It's love at first sight.

3114
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:18,640
right?

3115
01:56:22,430 --> 01:56:23,870
Will you

3116
01:56:23,870 --> 01:56:25,790
express your feelings for everyone?

3117
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:27,600
Not really.

3118
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:31,550
It's obvious that I like someone.

3119
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:35,680
Have you ever expressed it to the people in the house?

3120
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:37,280
Yes.

3121
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:38,960
What did you do?

3122
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,560
or what kind of things

3123
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:41,790
to make her feel it?

3124
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:44,480
I'll observe her every move.

3125
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,150
And...

3126
01:56:45,150 --> 01:56:47,680
I can listen to what she says.

3127
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:50,720
Do you think

3128
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:51,760
she felt

3129
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:53,040
your feelings for her?

3130
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:54,880
I feel it.

3131
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,720
If you have a crush on a girl,

3132
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:00,760
she didn't give you a response,

3133
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:03,040
Will you keep fighting or step back?

3134
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,480
I will keep fighting.

3135
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:09,880
How long will it take for you?

3136
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:10,840
I'll keep trying.

3137
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,760
If she doesn't reply,

3138
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:15,800
A week.

3139
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:19,680
If the girl you like

3140
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:21,280
she knows what others do,

3141
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,000
She's just touching someone.

3142
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,190
Will you be angry?

3143
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:27,000
I won't.

3144
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,240
Will you retreat?

3145
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:29,440
I won't.

3146
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,520
You want her to choose you

3147
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,160
and choose you,

3148
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:34,560
or her choice is always you.

3149
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,120
I think this is the right of a girl.

3150
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:39,070
I will respect her.

3151
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:42,430
Because

3152
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:44,320
this thing is one-sided.

3153
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,560
It's not that I like her

3154
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:47,040
just because I like her.

3155
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:48,190
At this stage,

3156
01:57:48,190 --> 01:57:49,920
you can do

3157
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:51,840
what you want to do.

3158
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:52,760
Respect.

3159
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,870
I didn't expect his answer.

3160
01:57:55,870 --> 01:57:57,120
I think Fatty is quite confident.

3161
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:59,360
He hopes the person he likes

3162
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:00,480
to get in touch with everyone

3163
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:01,950
and choose him.

3164
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,960
He wants to respect the girls.

3165
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,680
I think

3166
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:07,760
I have changed my view on him.

3167
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,960
If you see her going on a date with someone else,

3168
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:13,760
you will

3169
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,360
by yourself.

3170
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:16,560
or

3171
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:19,390
in front of her,

3172
01:58:19,390 --> 01:58:21,880
or let her see

3173
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:22,840
Let her see.

3174
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:24,510
First,

3175
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:25,840
digest it yourself?

3176
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:29,600
As a mature person,

3177
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:32,560
you will choose to do the first thing.

3178
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:33,680
Do you think

3179
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:35,160
a mature person?

3180
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:37,950
I think I am.

3181
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:39,520
At least in the small house.

3182
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,040
I understand.

3183
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,390
Do you think

3184
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:45,040
a half-minded person?

3185
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,040
After entering the house,

3186
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,240
after entering the house,

3187
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:49,840
I wasn't half-minded.

3188
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,470
Because you haven't made a choice yet.

3189
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:58,640
is that you haven't

3190
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,440
you haven't made a choice.

3191
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:00,990
Really?

3192
01:59:00,990 --> 01:59:03,070
I'm here.

3193
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:06,750
After the sports day,

3194
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:09,280
after the sports day.

3195
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:11,680
I know.

3196
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:16,480
We went to the sports day together.

3197
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,200
And you have a date too.

3198
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,560
Do you think dating is more fun

3199
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:22,880
or the sports day?

3200
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:29,150
A date?

3201
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:31,520
Date?

3202
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:38,880
That's all for my question.

3203
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:40,350
Okay.

3204
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:43,550
After the sports day,

3205
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:44,760
I texted her.

3206
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:46,590
Don't you know how she feels?

3207
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:49,150
I'm sure she can feel my feelings.

3208
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:50,160
She's a smart person.

3209
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:53,400
Actually, I didn't understand.

3210
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:56,160
He said after the sports day,

3211
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:57,880
after the sports day.

3212
01:59:57,880 --> 01:59:59,360
But I asked him

3213
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:00,760
or the sports day.

3214
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:02,000
Because the date is me.

3215
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,120
It's Xiao Ling.

3216
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:05,150
But he said after the sports day,

3217
02:00:05,150 --> 02:00:06,520
after the sports day.

3218
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:08,120
After meeting Xiaoling,

3219
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:09,920
he was sure of his feelings.

3220
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,120
He also sent it to Xiaoling that day.

3221
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:13,950
So I don't know

3222
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:15,920
whether he's telling the truth or lying.

3223
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:17,280
I think

3224
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,840
he has a different mind.

3225
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:21,760
Maybe I didn't understand what he meant.

3226
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:28,600
What are you doing?

3227
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:29,950
Playing with your phone.

3228
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:31,280
What do you mean?

3229
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:32,720
What do you mean?

3230
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:34,880
What do you mean?

3231
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:35,710
Sit.

3232
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:37,760
You want to talk to me?

3233
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:39,710
No, I just care about you.

3234
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,240
I haven't seen you for a long time. I miss you.

3235
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,280
Why do you

3236
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:45,440
care so much about me at night?

3237
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:48,760
So your personality is because of you.

3238
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:50,520
You love social

3239
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:51,520
Or is it because

3240
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,560
because you don't have any social connections?

3241
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:54,800
Am I bored?

3242
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:56,990
Take your time. You're not bored actually.

3243
02:00:57,470 --> 02:00:58,400
Slowly.

3244
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:01,440
We seldom talk about

3245
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,440
with others.

3246
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:07,600
Come in.

3247
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:13,840
I'm going out.

3248
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,760
What are you two talking about?

3249
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:17,680
I was just discussing

3250
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:19,000
how to survive.

3251
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:20,400
I thought he was stressed out from love.

3252
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,520
Let me answer it for him.

3253
02:01:23,070 --> 02:01:24,120
You can come in.

3254
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:26,750
Do you think

3255
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:28,600
there are some obstacles in communication?

3256
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:29,310
No.

3257
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:31,120
I was wondering how to communicate

3258
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,830
how to communicate.

3259
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:37,630
I personally think the most important thing

3260
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,600
is happiness.

3261
02:01:42,270 --> 02:01:43,320
That makes sense.

3262
02:01:48,990 --> 02:01:50,360
instead of staying by his side.

3263
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:51,390
I think every day

3264
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:53,720
things.

3265
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,480
I think this is the right relationship.

3266
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:02,080
I think it's important to be relaxed and happy.

3267
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:03,440
When you stay with him,

3268
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:06,080
when you stay with him,

3269
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,360
when they're together.

3270
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:09,040
But if you are with someone,

3271
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:09,950
you will feel

3272
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:11,230
I'm going on a date with her later.

3273
02:02:11,230 --> 02:02:12,480
I'm going to get started.

3274
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:14,080
You're actually unhappy.

3275
02:02:14,590 --> 02:02:16,510
But if you think you're with her,

3276
02:02:16,510 --> 02:02:18,040
you two don't need to talk about it.

3277
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:19,360
You also think she's not uncomfortable

3278
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,190
or awkward.

3279
02:02:20,190 --> 02:02:21,200
I'm very happy.

3280
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:23,480
Because some people

3281
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:24,350
are right.

3282
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:27,520
You can understand your relaxed point.

3283
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:29,120
Because you can feel it

3284
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:30,520
you can feel awkward.

3285
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:32,080
But some people don't talk.

3286
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:32,880
you still think

3287
02:02:33,310 --> 02:02:34,680
It doesn't matter.

3288
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,080
She's comfortable by your side.

3289
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:37,310
It means

3290
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:39,550
you're not feeling well.

3291
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:41,310
If you find this problem,

3292
02:02:41,310 --> 02:02:42,480
you have to

3293
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,800
in time.

3294
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:47,710
Don't think too much.

3295
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:51,480
Just measure it with a standard.

3296
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:52,400
with one standard.

3297
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:54,110
Because it's useless to think so much now.

3298
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:57,120
You just need to get along with someone.

3299
02:02:57,120 --> 02:02:58,040
For example, let's hurry up.

3300
02:02:58,040 --> 02:02:59,040
We'll get along three or five times.

3301
02:02:59,040 --> 02:02:59,870
You may slow down.

3302
02:02:59,870 --> 02:03:01,280
You'll get along more than ten or twenty times.

3303
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,590
After you get along,

3304
02:03:02,590 --> 02:03:04,440
there will be an answer in your heart.

3305
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:04,990
Yes.

3306
02:03:04,990 --> 02:03:06,910
Yeah, don't think about it.

3307
02:03:06,910 --> 02:03:08,440
Think won't solve anything.

3308
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:09,280
You do it.

3309
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:18,520
Come in.

3310
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:21,310
Hello.

3311
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:23,680
Why are there so many people today?

3312
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:24,920
Come on, Xiaoling, join us.

3313
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:25,440
Hurry up.

3314
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:26,040
What?

3315
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:27,200
What?

3316
02:03:28,030 --> 02:03:29,310
This room.

3317
02:03:29,310 --> 02:03:30,720
This room needs you so much.

3318
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:35,040
Well, to put it bluntly,

3319
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:37,360
do you feel happier

3320
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:38,520
to talk to me?

3321
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:40,960
I can't date you.

3322
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,320
Maybe your joke is bad.

3323
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:44,280
No, I'm asking you.

3324
02:03:44,670 --> 02:03:45,920
Do you feel happier

3325
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:49,280
to get along with us?

3326
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:50,320
Yes.

3327
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:52,160
When you're with us,

3328
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:52,990
when you're with us?

3329
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:54,320
But I think it's normal.

3330
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:55,440
You get nervous when you like it.

3331
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:56,000
Yes.

3332
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:56,760
I'm just afraid of making mistakes.

3333
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,320
That's why I'm nervous when I like it.

3334
02:03:58,720 --> 02:04:00,080
You can do more.

3335
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:01,630
and do more things.

3336
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:02,880
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.

3337
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:03,710
and make more mistakes.

3338
02:04:06,270 --> 02:04:10,000
If you can learn something about him,

3339
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:10,750
and chat,

3340
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:12,320
I think it'll be much better.

3341
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:14,520
Actually what I'm showing now

3342
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:15,680
I've already kept it.

3343
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:20,000
I dare not open myself completely.

3344
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:23,800
It's okay.

3345
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:26,480
You have two men who can help you.

3346
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:28,880
You can talk to them more.

3347
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:29,790
I don't think

3348
02:04:29,790 --> 02:04:32,120
are not good at dealing with such problems.

3349
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:33,760
I think his brothers are good at it.

3350
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,120
He looks smart.

3351
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,640
I think sometimes,

3352
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:40,800
girls

3353
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,270
jokes or something.

3354
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:45,240
You can ask easily.

3355
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:45,880
You don't have to.

3356
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:47,200
When girls joke with you,

3357
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:48,400
you would take it seriously.

3358
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:50,110
Actually girls are afraid of boys being serious.

3359
02:04:50,110 --> 02:04:50,590
Yes.

3360
02:04:50,590 --> 02:04:51,680
she wouldn't dare

3361
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:52,830
I dare not joke with you.

3362
02:04:52,830 --> 02:04:53,790
I dare not talk to you more.

3363
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,640
That way, your conversation will be less and less.

3364
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:57,120
But sometimes when girls joke with you,

3365
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:58,240
you can take it as a joke.

3366
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,600
It doesn't seem like you're easy-going.

3367
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:00,240
or anything.

3368
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:01,720
This is how we get along.

3369
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:09,080
You give people

3370
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:10,960
Don't know how to control it.

3371
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:11,440
Yes.

3372
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:11,920
You can't be relaxed.

3373
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:13,520
I noticed a detail of you yesterday.

3374
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,000
When reading the album,

3375
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:19,390
Tata showed her brother.

3376
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:23,200
Sue Su said, "Yes."

3377
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:24,000
So cool.

3378
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,950
Your expression was so serious.

3379
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:28,240
Look. So handsome.

3380
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:29,440
So handsome.

3381
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:30,880
Do you want him to come?

3382
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:31,600
Yes.

3383
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:37,520
I'm really unhappy.

3384
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:38,000
Yes.

3385
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:39,640
But I shouldn't.

3386
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:40,760
Of course not.

3387
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:41,950
I can't be a fan.

3388
02:05:41,950 --> 02:05:43,200
I think boys are cool.

3389
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:45,560
I seem to be

3390
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:47,040
about this.

3391
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:48,800
You are very serious.

3392
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:49,720
He's not very serious.

3393
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:51,200
He's quite possessive.

3394
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:54,640
He's too strong to make himself unhappy.

3395
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:56,920
I think I've felt it.

3396
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:58,200
Yes, because you will

3397
02:05:58,200 --> 02:05:59,360
in this trap.

3398
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:02,480
So you shouldn't care about others.

3399
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:04,160
You should take care of yourself.

3400
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:04,990
Yes.

3401
02:06:04,990 --> 02:06:06,560
Maybe you play more ping-pong,

3402
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:07,440
you always want to win.

3403
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,400
But in love,

3404
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:10,400
in love.

3405
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:15,000
You have to respect others.

3406
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,160
You have to respect yourself.

3407
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:18,320
If you do something

3408
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:19,550
you are unhappy,

3409
02:06:19,550 --> 02:06:20,830
but others are happy.

3410
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:21,920
As time goes by,

3411
02:06:23,070 --> 02:06:24,000
you're just unhappy.

3412
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,240
So you disrespected yourself.

3413
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:26,840
So when you do something,

3414
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:27,800
ask yourself first.

3415
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,440
And all your efforts and rewards

3416
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:32,240
are not valuable.

3417
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:34,160
The effort in love is the effort.

3418
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:35,230
No reward.

3419
02:06:35,230 --> 02:06:36,280
There is no reward for love.

3420
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:37,310
There's only one way to pay off.

3421
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:38,480
Don't expect

3422
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:39,840
how I love you today.

3423
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:40,990
How I treat you,

3424
02:06:40,990 --> 02:06:42,160
If you don't reply tomorrow,

3425
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:43,710
I won't treat you well in the future.

3426
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:45,200
That's not a good idea.

3427
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:47,520
You should know that giving is giving.

3428
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:48,760
Devotion.

3429
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:49,400
and do.

3430
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:50,800
you did it willingly.

3431
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,400
If you are unwilling,

3432
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,230
others may not accept it.

3433
02:06:57,790 --> 02:06:58,720
Fatty told me

3434
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:01,200
maybe my possession and control desire

3435
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,800
that makes this girl nervous too.

3436
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,120
I think so too.

3437
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:08,510
Since I can feel it,

3438
02:07:08,510 --> 02:07:11,960
Susu likes me,

3439
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,360
I think it's a good choice

3440
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:14,750
is a good choice.

3441
02:07:14,750 --> 02:07:15,870
Relax.

3442
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:17,520
Don't be so formal.

3443
02:07:47,230 --> 02:07:48,920
I'm looking forward to seeing Hwa's text.

3444
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:51,800
I found that she was very sincere today.

3445
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:53,560
Sincerity is a bonus.

3446
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:56,000
Because everyone likes sincere people.

3447
02:07:58,160 --> 02:07:59,760
Tata, I don't know who she's sending it to.

3448
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:01,280
Then we sat on the same side.

3449
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,680
I didn't know what she was going to send.

3450
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:03,840
So I was really

3451
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,560
nervous and excited.

3452
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:32,560
Every day is like an exam.

3453
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:44,280
My eyes are feet.

3454
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:03,160
I received it from Harry.

3455
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:04,760
Lastly, I marked one.

3456
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:06,110
Don't cry after the injection.

3457
02:09:08,830 --> 02:09:11,680
Because he wasn't caught by a stray cat at night.

3458
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:13,040
Then he was worried.

3459
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:14,240
He told me

3460
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:14,590
Later,

3461
02:09:14,590 --> 02:09:16,800
take me to the hospital for an injection tonight.

3462
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:21,920
I'll definitely send it to Tata.

3463
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:36,670
The moment I received her text,

3464
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:38,800
I was really happy.

3465
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:44,280
I sent the message to Harry.

3466
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:46,040
When I bought him a gift today,

3467
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:47,390
I didn't know much about him.

3468
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:50,080
I brought him a cup of matcha drink.

3469
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,870
He told me he didn't drink matcha.

3470
02:09:51,870 --> 02:09:53,040
But he finished it.

3471
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:54,640
When I heard him say he doesn't drink matcha,

3472
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:56,880
I felt a little guilty.

3473
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:57,840
So in the text,

3474
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,440
in the text message.

3475
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:01,840
and added a sad expression.

3476
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:14,590
I got a text from the soup.

3477
02:10:14,590 --> 02:10:16,640
Because I mentioned it in my message.

3478
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:17,470
When can I hear

3479
02:10:17,470 --> 02:10:18,320
more piano songs.

3480
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:21,360
And in private, I said it several times.

3481
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,440
When can I play my favorite song?

3482
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,280
He said it was hard.

3483
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:25,840
He's already learning.

3484
02:10:28,670 --> 02:10:30,200
I only send it to Susu.

3485
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:31,600
In my opinion,

3486
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:33,760
in a period of time,

3487
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:34,750
in one time.

3488
02:10:34,750 --> 02:10:38,240
is my respect for love.

3489
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:47,440
I received Su's

3490
02:10:47,870 --> 02:10:49,240
I sent the soup.

3491
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:50,880
I had fun playing ping-pong today.

3492
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,240
Mr Tang taught me well too.

3493
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:54,000
Good.

3494
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:55,230
I have to control you.

3495
02:10:55,230 --> 02:10:56,190
I won't let you use your strength.

3496
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:00,190
You prepared well for today's date.

3497
02:11:00,190 --> 02:11:01,200
And also praise him.

3498
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:02,360
He taught me well.

3499
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:04,080
Give him some confidence.

3500
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:22,960
I guess it's Xin's.

3501
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:23,920
Because

3502
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:25,520
I had a chat

3503
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:26,590
with Xinxin and Fatty.

3504
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:28,830
My message

3505
02:11:28,830 --> 02:11:30,320
I sent the soup today.

3506
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:32,990
I sent this encouragement message to soup.

3507
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:33,760
Because I think

3508
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,070
he is actually

3509
02:11:35,070 --> 02:11:35,960
a very good person.

3510
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:37,840
I don't think

3511
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:39,870
he doesn't need to be bothered by these things.

3512
02:11:39,870 --> 02:11:40,800
Just be yourself.

3513
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:42,400
Then listen to

3514
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:43,550
others' opinions.

3515
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:44,670
Because with his personality,

3516
02:11:44,670 --> 02:11:46,240
many people will like him.

3517
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:55,640
I'm 100% sure.

3518
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:56,720
This is the map.

3519
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:57,720
Because the photo

3520
02:11:57,720 --> 02:11:58,750
the two of us

3521
02:11:58,750 --> 02:12:00,350
for the two of us.

3522
02:12:02,270 --> 02:12:03,520
Beautiful. That's it.

3523
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:04,030
Yes.

3524
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:07,160
Okay.

3525
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:10,720
Today's message

3526
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:12,190
to Xiaoling.

3527
02:12:12,190 --> 02:12:13,280
Because I think

3528
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,360
I just want to

3529
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:17,470
with Xiaoling.

3530
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:26,720
Xiao Ling's.

3531
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:30,430
I'm going to express my feelings today.

3532
02:12:30,430 --> 02:12:32,160
to take photos for her.

3533
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:36,000
I texted Tu today.

3534
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,360
We also have some

3535
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:38,200
our own memories.

3536
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:39,360
So I think it's good.

3537
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:40,720
It makes me feel

3538
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:42,320
this person might be more unique.

3539
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:56,320
It's probably from Tae-seo.

3540
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,280
I'm happy today.

3541
02:12:57,280 --> 02:12:59,480
I hope we can know more about each other.

3542
02:12:59,480 --> 02:12:59,640
Yes.

3543
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:03,040
I sent Hua Hua the text message at night.

3544
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:05,880
After my contact with Hua today,

3545
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:07,000
I think our relationship

3546
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:07,870
between us

3547
02:13:07,870 --> 02:13:09,240
and understand each other better.

3548
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:11,200
I just want to express my feelings.

3549
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:13,680
I want to get to know more about you.

3550
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:28,440
Can you pick me on the next date?

3551
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:31,230
I think this one

3552
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:33,150
touched me.

3553
02:13:33,150 --> 02:13:33,840
I think

3554
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:36,670
I'm happy to be so straightforward.

3555
02:13:36,670 --> 02:13:38,110
I think I like it.

3556
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:45,040
I think it should be Fatty.

3557
02:13:46,160 --> 02:13:48,000
I sent it to Hua today.

3558
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,270
Will you pick me on your next date?

3559
02:13:50,270 --> 02:13:51,920
I've already made it very obvious.

3560
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:17,840
I'm happy to receive Hwa's text.

3561
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:18,800
After receiving the text,

3562
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:19,870
I think we gave each other

3563
02:14:19,870 --> 02:14:22,000
each other.

3564
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:25,400
After our date today,

3565
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:26,040
I've already figured out

3566
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:27,710
who to send today's message to.

3567
02:14:27,710 --> 02:14:28,480
No matter

3568
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:29,920
anything may happen tonight,

3569
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:31,840
I'll text you how I feel today.

3570
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:33,880
(Tae-seo makes me happy all day.)

3571
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:36,480
It feels good to be recorded all day.

3572
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:39,230
Three, two, one.

3573
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,280
Three, two, one.

3574
02:14:43,230 --> 02:14:43,920
So I said

3575
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:45,720
thank you for today's photographer.

3576
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:03,120
We've already tortured each other.

3577
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:04,760
You already know how I feel.

3578
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:07,760
We went to the sports day together.

3579
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:09,470
and you had a date too.

3580
02:15:09,470 --> 02:15:11,920
Do you think dating is more fun

3581
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:14,160
or the sports day?

3582
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:15,440
Date?

3583
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:16,640
Date?

3584
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:18,640
I don't understand.

3585
02:15:19,710 --> 02:15:20,720
I really don't understand.

3586
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,110
I didn't receive your message today.

3587
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:36,350
Because I don't think

3588
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:39,000
with anyone.

3589
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,120
It's like getting along with friends.

3590
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:42,480
I don't think

3591
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:44,920
They don't text me their feelings.

3592
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:47,280
Everyone has someone they want to know.

3593
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:07,120
I got two of them.

3594
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:08,240
I felt very happy.

3595
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:25,920
My first reaction was

3596
02:16:27,390 --> 02:16:28,480
I was like this.

3597
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:30,400
Because I didn't expect

3598
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:31,710
In my impression,

3599
02:16:31,710 --> 02:16:32,990
I think the interaction

3600
02:16:32,990 --> 02:16:33,920
Their interaction

3601
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:34,750
is very obvious.

3602
02:16:34,750 --> 02:16:36,120
I said in this situation,

3603
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:38,320
in such a situation?

3604
02:16:53,309 --> 02:16:54,360
Today I can feel

3605
02:16:54,360 --> 02:16:55,799
Xinxin's pressure

3606
02:16:55,799 --> 02:16:56,760
is obviously gone.

3607
02:16:56,760 --> 02:16:58,160
I feel relieved.

3608
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,400
I've been saying that zero votes are not that you're not good,

3609
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:00,799
right?

3610
02:17:00,799 --> 02:17:03,120
This is very limited.

3611
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:04,190
It's obvious that

3612
02:17:04,190 --> 02:17:05,879
others are already in love.

3613
02:17:06,270 --> 02:17:06,750
right?

3614
02:17:06,959 --> 02:17:08,400
Then do your job.

3615
02:17:13,559 --> 02:17:14,320
I feel

3616
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:15,870
I feel a little disappointed.

3617
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:18,110
He must have sent

3618
02:17:18,110 --> 02:17:19,160
to Hua today.

3619
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:21,760
But Hwa went on a date with Tae-seo today.

3620
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:23,320
I think the flowers are for Terri.

3621
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:24,959
So Fatty

3622
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:26,639
won't send a sincere message today.

3623
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:37,120
Bye.

3624
02:17:37,790 --> 02:17:38,520
Bye.

3625
02:17:38,719 --> 02:17:39,480
Bye.

3626
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:48,030
I want to get a skinny face shot.

3627
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:49,400
You...

3628
02:17:50,430 --> 02:17:51,000
Here.

3629
02:17:51,639 --> 02:17:53,440
My cheekbones are too high.

3630
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:55,320
Your cheekbone? Then you have to peel the bones.

3631
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:00,120
I just said if you want it,

3632
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:00,830
This is it.

3633
02:18:04,670 --> 02:18:05,680
Meat?

3634
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:10,270
You might not have it when you get old.

3635
02:18:10,910 --> 02:18:11,600
Thank you.

3636
02:18:12,639 --> 02:18:14,080
I won't get old even if you're old.

3637
02:18:15,799 --> 02:18:16,719
I'm already 80 and I still look like this.

3638
02:18:16,719 --> 02:18:19,040
He has a high cheekbone.

3639
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:20,510
So he won't be ugly, you know?

3640
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:24,719
Why do I feel so dark?

3641
02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:25,400
What's going on?

3642
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:26,430
My sky has collapsed.

3643
02:18:26,430 --> 02:18:27,389
You're so dark.

3644
02:18:27,389 --> 02:18:28,480
You're so dark today.

3645
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,270
You look like a black man.

3646
02:18:30,910 --> 02:18:33,440
You know my face is...

3647
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:34,160
Do you know how long

3648
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:35,320
how long it took me to hold it in so white?

3649
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:36,959
I used to be at least four degrees darker than this.

3650
02:18:36,959 --> 02:18:38,360
I used to play basketball.

3651
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:42,200
Why are you laughing?

3652
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:44,000
Can you stop...

3653
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:45,920
You're really overwhelming.

3654
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:47,230
You don't respect me.

3655
02:18:47,230 --> 02:18:48,719
I'm a sensitive and fragile little boy.

3656
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:53,120
You're not weak.

3657
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:54,910
I'm not weak.

3658
02:18:56,600 --> 02:18:56,990
Is it dark?

3659
02:18:56,990 --> 02:18:57,879
It's really dark.

3660
02:18:58,160 --> 02:18:59,200
Can you stop talking?

3661
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:00,350
I won't talk.

3662
02:19:03,870 --> 02:19:05,150
We have the same color.

3663
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:07,440
Right? Did you apply foundation?

3664
02:19:08,639 --> 02:19:09,840
Are we in the same color?

3665
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:12,719
Why not?

3666
02:19:12,719 --> 02:19:13,680
You're black.

3667
02:19:17,790 --> 02:19:18,559
Can you do it?

3668
02:19:18,559 --> 02:19:19,120
No.

3669
02:19:19,549 --> 02:19:20,280
Turn over.

3670
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:21,360
Press the volume button.

3671
02:19:22,110 --> 02:19:22,910
Isn't it ugly?

3672
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:24,030
Come on.

3673
02:19:24,030 --> 02:19:24,990
I'm speechless.

3674
02:19:24,990 --> 02:19:25,950
I can't.

3675
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:27,360
Why are there so many?

3676
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:31,120
Let me see.

3677
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:34,639
I turned it off.

3678
02:19:34,639 --> 02:19:36,080
It's off. You can't turn on my phone.

3679
02:19:37,150 --> 02:19:38,639
I can't tell anyone the password.

3680
02:19:38,639 --> 02:19:40,350
Because my phone password is the bank card password.

3681
02:19:41,559 --> 02:19:43,549
Let me see it first.

3682
02:19:45,469 --> 02:19:46,480
Why is my face so big?

3683
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:48,030
Of course.

3684
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,760
Don't laugh. Your eyes are so small when you smile.

3685
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:05,840
Is it going down

3686
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:06,240
Yes.

3687
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:06,720
Let's go.

3688
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:10,920
Hua.

3689
02:20:11,880 --> 02:20:13,520
I want to talk to you.

3690
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:16,160
What's wrong? Tell me.

3691
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,720
No, I was just asking if you were happy today.

3692
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,160
How was your date?

3693
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:21,680
So you asked me today

3694
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:24,880
from my best friend's point of view,

3695
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,400
from my best friend's point of view.

3696
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:27,440
or

3697
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:29,800
asking how I feel today

3698
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:31,080
or ask for myself?

3699
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:32,480
Ask for yourself.

3700
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:33,800
How could I ask for myself?

3701
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:35,720
Why can't I ask for myself?

3702
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:38,000
Because I'm not interested in him.

3703
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:38,640
First of all,

3704
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:41,360
I'm asking you as a good friend.

3705
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:43,200
Secondly,

3706
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:46,760
I'm trying to help my brothers.

3707
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:47,960
But he doesn't know this.

3708
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:50,240
Actually, on the whole today,

3709
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:51,360
I feel very happy.

3710
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:54,640
But because I know

3711
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:57,600
his original thoughts and present.

3712
02:20:57,600 --> 02:20:59,880
including his current observation on me.

3713
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:00,640
Yes.

3714
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:01,680
It doesn't mean

3715
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:04,480
he decided to choose me or him.

3716
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:05,040
No.

3717
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:09,480
And he's quite passive.

3718
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:12,160
I may observe him for a long time.

3719
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:13,800
So you're more passive.

3720
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:15,840
Very passive.

3721
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:16,880
Yes.

3722
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:20,840
Because I've always been a proactive type.

3723
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:22,480
I also need

3724
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:26,720
to be passive.

3725
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:29,480
I don't want to take the initiative alone.

3726
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:30,640
I don't want to take the initiative alone.

3727
02:21:30,640 --> 02:21:32,640
to be on my own.

3728
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,200
I don't want him to take 99 steps.

3729
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:37,760
at least 50 steps, right?

3730
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:43,680
But at this stage,

3731
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:46,160
I want to have a good relationship.

3732
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:47,640
I think we can take care of each other.

3733
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:49,760
But I think we need the same amount.

3734
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:50,960
Or more than me.

3735
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:51,800
I know that.

3736
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:55,960
It means men have to pay more attention

3737
02:21:55,960 --> 02:21:57,960
and take the initiative.

3738
02:21:57,960 --> 02:21:58,640
Yes.

3739
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:00,600
Although I had a good time with him today,

3740
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:01,680
I think

3741
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:05,120
a date is quite different.

3742
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:06,360
But in this regard,

3743
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:07,600
I may

3744
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
think carefully.

3745
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,120
I won't be like before.

3746
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:14,160
just like before.

3747
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:17,600
If you meet someone you really like,

3748
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:19,080
you can do anything

3749
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:20,560
even that person doesn't like me very much.

3750
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:22,440
I just think I like him.

3751
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,280
I used to be like this.

3752
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:26,200
I just touched the wall, you know?

3753
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:29,440
It's more fair.

3754
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:30,120
No.

3755
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:30,840
equal.

3756
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:31,360
Not like that.

3757
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:32,000
Yes.

3758
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Only you are giving.

3759
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:37,000
But I think

3760
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,480
if he is also passive,

3761
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:40,120
you two will be very tired

3762
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:42,960
at this time.

3763
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:45,200
He said

3764
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:46,080
he would respond.

3765
02:22:47,240 --> 02:22:52,040
But I'm not sure if he's here.

3766
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:54,120
Because I'm his date,

3767
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:56,280
because I'm his boyfriend.

3768
02:22:57,360 --> 02:22:58,560
Because he talked to me today.

3769
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,560
He said he didn't.

3770
02:22:59,560 --> 02:23:01,120
But he said he'll be his ex-wife later.

3771
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:02,080
Ex-wife.

3772
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:04,440
Previously.

3773
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:05,960
Previously?

3774
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:06,880
Yes.

3775
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:07,880
He described

3776
02:23:07,880 --> 02:23:09,600
after he's determined,

3777
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:11,640
he thought we could go together.

3778
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:12,400
But I'm not sure

3779
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:15,120
Is what he said true?

3780
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:15,520
Yes.

3781
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:17,760
Because from what I know about him,

3782
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,480
I don't think so.

3783
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:22,320
Actually, I'm in the room with Tae-ri.

3784
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:23,080
Except for Terri,

3785
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:24,840
I get to know Fatty the most.

3786
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:28,520
So these two are also

3787
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:29,360
the two people

3788
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:30,880
I want to know the most.

3789
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:32,960
I think

3790
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:35,280
in terms of caring,

3791
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:37,160
in taking care of people.

3792
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:38,680
But I think he always changes.

3793
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:42,400
Even though I'm changing,

3794
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:43,960
but I think he's also changing.

3795
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:45,840
You're changing too. You should let him change too.

3796
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:47,280
I allow him to change.

3797
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:48,920
But I think

3798
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:51,280
I think I know him too.

3799
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:52,360
Yeah.

3800
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:53,040
And I think Fatty

3801
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:54,840
is quite mature.

3802
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:59,080
I think he thinks

3803
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:01,040
you can understand everyone.

3804
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:03,080
and think I'm the best.

3805
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:05,400
He's confident.

3806
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:06,240
I think so too.

3807
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:07,640
He is.

3808
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:09,680
I'm stubborn

3809
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:11,480
and persistent.

3810
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:15,280
I don't want to know.

3811
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:16,800
But I don't think you're stubborn.

3812
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:18,800
I think you gave up.

3813
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:20,120
No.

3814
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:22,200
I just don't like

3815
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:23,360
Fortunately.

3816
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:24,040
Yeah.

3817
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:24,720
I don't like to go.

3818
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:25,840
But if you don't try,

3819
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:28,120
how would you know

3820
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:29,320
you're forcing him?

3821
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:30,800
Don't you want

3822
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:34,080
to master your own happiness?

3823
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:36,000
I took the initiative when we first met.

3824
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,280
I did.

3825
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:38,280
You will take the initiative.

3826
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:39,640
Yes, I will.

3827
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:41,240
But I want to see

3828
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:43,480
if you have any feedback.

3829
02:24:43,480 --> 02:24:44,760
If your feedback

3830
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:46,240
or your feelings

3831
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:47,560
your feelings.

3832
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:50,040
I think we're not in a relationship.

3833
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:51,520
That's very acceptable.

3834
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:53,960
If we were in a relationship,

3835
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:55,760
I would have asked you.

3836
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:56,760
How could you do this?

3837
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:57,240
Yes.

3838
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:58,360
Because I think

3839
02:24:58,360 --> 02:25:00,680
it's normal to change your mind.

3840
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:01,680
Let's say

3841
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:05,640
if a new guy suddenly appears,

3842
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:08,400
I'm more interested in him.

3843
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:10,120
I think it's normal.

3844
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:12,280
But I think we should fight for it.

3845
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:13,840
If you just think

3846
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:15,240
you don't like him,

3847
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:15,840
Yeah.

3848
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:16,320
Go for it.

3849
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:18,120
You don't have to.

3850
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:18,880
Yes.

3851
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:20,600
I think boys' attitude is very important.

3852
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:21,560
It's obvious.

3853
02:25:21,560 --> 02:25:22,280
That's good.

3854
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,120
Is it possible that

3855
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:27,320
he was in contact with two girls

3856
02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:28,720
He didn't contact us at the same time.

3857
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:30,680
He didn't talk to me at all.

3858
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:31,640
And I think

3859
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:32,800
it's very obvious.

3860
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:34,840
Have you talked to each other?

3861
02:25:34,840 --> 02:25:35,240
No.

3862
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:36,680
Have you ever wanted to talk to him?

3863
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:37,680
Do you want to ask him?

3864
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:41,120
I don't think I'll talk to him.

3865
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,720
Because he doesn't want to talk to me

3866
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:44,560
He doesn't want to talk to me.

3867
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:45,600
it means

3868
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:48,920
he thinks everything is natural and reasonable.

3869
02:25:48,920 --> 02:25:50,760
Because I think

3870
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:52,560
I'm the kind of person

3871
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:53,200
Yes.

3872
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:54,080
And I think

3873
02:25:54,080 --> 02:25:56,320
it's the best way.

3874
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:00,480
Then I met a new guy.

3875
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:01,840
I'll tell you directly.

3876
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:03,320
I said I got along well today.

3877
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:05,520
I'll tell you directly

3878
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:07,720
the order of a friend.

3879
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:10,240
We will go back to being friends.

3880
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:14,080
But I think everyone's habits

3881
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:16,480
To be honest,

3882
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:19,080
he didn't do anything.

3883
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:20,360
He's not shaking.

3884
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:20,760
Got it.

3885
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:22,680
I know what you mean now.

3886
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:24,840
I think if you choose this way,

3887
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:26,240
to make you happier,

3888
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:28,560
I think you are right.

3889
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:31,600
Actually, you gave me a lot of inspiration today.

3890
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:33,760
I think I should think about it.

3891
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:43,760
Didn't you want to go to that room?

3892
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:44,480
Me?

3893
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:46,480
I don't know what to ask you.

3894
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:47,920
You don't know what to ask me.

3895
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:49,200
I want to ask a lot of questions.

3896
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:49,760
I don't think

3897
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:50,840
to go to the Mirror House.

3898
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:52,000
I think so too.

3899
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,640
Actually, I was ready to go.

3900
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:54,320
Later I thought

3901
02:26:54,320 --> 02:26:55,520
I can ask you these questions in person.

3902
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:56,800
I don't think it's necessary.

3903
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:58,120
Yes, ask him directly.

3904
02:26:58,720 --> 02:26:59,000
Come on.

3905
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,400
We're in the Mirror Room.

3906
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:01,560
Okay.

3907
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:03,400
Tell us

3908
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:06,240
how you feel about every girl in the house.

3909
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:09,680
Let's start with Susu.

3910
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:10,600
You're heartless.

3911
02:27:10,600 --> 02:27:11,880
Hua is like a sister.

3912
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:13,880
Xiaoling is like a good friend.

3913
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:18,080
Xinxin.

3914
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:21,160
Since I texted you,

3915
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:22,320
since I texted you.

3916
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:23,920
I'm talking about Xinxin.

3917
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:24,680
Since I texted you,

3918
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:26,120
I haven't talked to her.

3919
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:28,720
Just a normal house.

3920
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:33,800
Are you nervous?

3921
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:35,000
I'm not nervous.

3922
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,240
I'm thinking about how to say it.

3923
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:37,960
It's normal.

3924
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:39,360
If we don't know each other,

3925
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:41,160
how do you feel about other guests?

3926
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:41,800
What do you think?

3927
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:43,120
I have feelings for her.

3928
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:46,640
Go on.

3929
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:48,000
Who else?

3930
02:27:48,520 --> 02:27:49,200
Who else?

3931
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:49,840
Me too.

3932
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:54,120
What did you say?

3933
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:55,760
You don't know who I am now.

3934
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:57,360
You don't know who you're talking to now.

3935
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:04,600
Okay, I don't feel anything.

3936
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:05,640
Say no more.

3937
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:06,600
I'm sorry.

3938
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:08,080
Okay, stop it.

3939
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:10,160
It's okay.

3940
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:11,200
Of course.

3941
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:12,040
Go ahead.

3942
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:13,120
Give me some time.

3943
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:15,080
It's a little hot.

3944
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:17,240
I should have dragged you there.

3945
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:18,400
You don't even answer me now.

3946
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:19,040
I answer.

3947
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:22,040
I'll answer you when I go inside.

3948
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:22,920
No.

3949
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:24,440
It's okay.

3950
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:25,480
I'm fine.

3951
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:26,480
It's okay.

3952
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:27,600
Why?

3953
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:28,120
I'm not okay.

3954
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:28,880
Why?

3955
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:29,480
No.

3956
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:31,760
Why are you only telling me in the room?

3957
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:33,920
I'm sorry.

3958
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:39,040
Let's talk at home.

3959
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:39,840
I'm hanging up.

3960
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:40,920
Stop talking to me.

3961
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:44,960
Let's get down to business.

3962
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:47,840
Actually,

3963
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:51,280
I don't like girls with short hair.

3964
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:54,280
Okay.

3965
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:55,560
Good answer.

3966
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:56,640
No, listen to me.

3967
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:57,280
It's easy to answer.

3968
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:57,840
But when I see you,

3969
02:28:57,840 --> 02:28:58,360
I think it's good.

3970
02:28:58,360 --> 02:28:59,040
It's over.

3971
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:01,680
What's wrong with short hair?

3972
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:04,040
No.

3973
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:05,520
When I saw you, I felt...

3974
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:07,160
Wait.

3975
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:08,120
I said wait.

3976
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:10,560
Wait, I said wait.

3977
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:12,560
It's about my aesthetic point.

3978
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:13,560
Because you know why?

3979
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:14,920
You like long hair.

3980
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:16,640
I didn't say I like long hair.

3981
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:18,520
I've never tried short hair.

3982
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:19,000
Yes.

3983
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:20,240
Then I said,

3984
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:22,240
Because I like small heads.

3985
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:23,480
with big facial features.

3986
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:25,680
collapsed

3987
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:27,400
Big face

3988
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:28,240
and small head.

3989
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:30,440
Then why did you say you're not shallow?

3990
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:33,160
Look at your face, you're a bit...

3991
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:34,080
That's true.

3992
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,840
But the standard sometimes

3993
02:29:36,680 --> 02:29:37,760
I don't know how to describe it.

3994
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:38,160
To be honest,

3995
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:41,280
I'm sweating.

3996
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:43,320
Wait.

3997
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:44,840
It's just eye contact.

3998
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:46,120
At first glance,

3999
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:48,800
I think it's okay.

4000
02:29:52,280 --> 02:29:53,760
I always see you smile.

4001
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:55,080
I like girls who smile.

4002
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,080
But you didn't

4003
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:58,400
that night.

4004
02:30:00,240 --> 02:30:02,320
It proves that I'm not shallow.

4005
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:08,520
There's too much information today.

4006
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:09,760
Why? Nothing today.

4007
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:10,960
I don't think anything happened today.

4008
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:11,720
Don't you think today's information

4009
02:30:11,720 --> 02:30:12,520
more than the day before yesterday?

4010
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:13,280
Why?

4011
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:19,760
Tell me.

4012
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:23,040
What are you saying? I didn't say anything.

4013
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:24,400
Just what you think.

4014
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:26,720
How do you know what I'm thinking?

4015
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:27,920
Go on.

4016
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:29,600
No more questions.

4017
02:30:29,880 --> 02:30:30,440
That's all?

4018
02:30:33,640 --> 02:30:34,360
Tomorrow is

4019
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:36,520
a party tomorrow.

(Prince of Depression)

4021
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:49,960
She looks a little cold

4022
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:52,040
when she sees the text.

4023
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:54,840
Did you get along with other girls today?

4024
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,280
Will you text me today?

4025
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:01,440
I'm texting you again today.

4026
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:02,560
I'm also encouraging you today.

4027
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:04,040
Do you know

4028
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:04,960
is?

4029
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:06,360
I think I know

4030
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:07,240
how they feel.

4031
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:07,920
