1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm not.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,760
I'm very angry.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,400
Really?

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,360
Am I?

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,960
No.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,239
Not Tom.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,960
No, you don't know how embarrassed I am.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,120
It has to be Tom.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,120
I think you did a good job

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,800
at the piano yesterday.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,320
It's really like a foreigner wearing a Chinese suit.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,800
I think so too.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,920
After learning Chinese,

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,280
I love China.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,120
It tastes so good.

16
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,880
That's right.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,880
Love Siblings.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,720
Let love double.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,480
Irisan, welcome to watch

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,240
brothers intervene in love.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,480
and social therapy.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,440
Love Sisters.

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,880
We're lovers' family members.

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,400
We're going to

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,160
for this episode.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
Do you want to eat in a clean place like this?

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,240
Okay.

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,080
Are you hungry?

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,880
Are you hungry?

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,840
No.

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,280
What's wrong?

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,440
Can you open my shoulder?

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,240
Yes.

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,200
I'll kill you.

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,759
Good night.

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,240
Did you two fight?

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,720
No.

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,320
Are you done?

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,200
Aren't you going to ask

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,680
if Tako wants to eat?

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,160
She said she's not hungry.

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,160
Are you hungry?

43
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,000
Are you hungry?

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,639
No.

45
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,039
She must be happy.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,880
Aren't you unhappy?

47
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,920
When did you say that?

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
He's happy now.

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm very happy.

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,160
You've been coaxed.

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,480
He's just talking.

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,040
It doesn't matter anymore.

53
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,800
I've forgiven her.

54
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,320
Your forgiveness is fast.

55
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,720
I can't be angry all day.

56
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,120
Fine.

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,880
When did you get angry?

58
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,520
Can you tell me?

59
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,320
I'm not angry.

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,480
Can you tell me how long you've been angry?

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,920
An hour.

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,720
No, because it happened

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,920
Maybe only an hour.

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,440
Yes.

65
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,400
Can I know what it is?

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
It's mainly because I coaxed him quickly.

67
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,240
You forgive me too fast.

68
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,520
You shouldn't have forgiven him so soon.

69
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,280
He's not that...

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,440
The soup is not that good.

71
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,200
Okay

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,880
Yes.

73
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,080
I'm just too embarrassed.

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm not.

75
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,880
I'm very angry.

76
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,520
Really?

77
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,480
Am I more shameless?

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
No.

79
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,960
No, we are...

80
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,880
Or we are roommates.

81
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
It's fate.

82
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,880
No.

83
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,160
Not Tom.

84
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,880
No, you don't know how embarrassed I am.

85
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,040
It has to be Tom.

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,760
I almost died, you know?

87
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,320
No one understands.

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Only I understand you.

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
Only we understand this feeling now.

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,600
Really?

91
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,120
Now you understand.

92
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,360
I don't understand now.

93
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm fine now.

94
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
You know it too.

95
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,760
I don't.

96
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,400
I got it.

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,120
I don't understand now.

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,880
Yes.

99
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,360
One hour.

100
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,960
A little bit.

101
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,000
I understand for an hour.

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,880
I understand a little bit.

103
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,760
Try your best.

104
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm so nervous.

105
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,200
So awkward.

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,480
Not at all.

107
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,520
Applaud for you as "Iron Clap".

108
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,159
Really, I love you.

109
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,400
Who knows?

110
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,800
Why are you doing this?

111
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
What?

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,600
Really?

113
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,080
I thought we had zero votes.

114
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,000
Me too.

115
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,360
Amazing!

116
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,080
Tom.

117
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,960
I love you.

118
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,760
(Prince of Depression)

119
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,000
I want Terri's temperament.

120
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,240
Chest out, look up.

121
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
Occupational disease.

122
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,960
But I think the poster

123
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,640
at the piano yesterday.

124
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,920
Because I look pretty with my own eyes.

125
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,680
Yes.

126
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
It's really like a foreigner wearing a Chinese suit.

127
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,160
I think so too.

128
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,360
After learning Chinese,

129
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Then I forced myself to perform.

130
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,760
I love China.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,400
It tastes so good.

132
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,320
It's so right.

133
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,640
Your Mandarin is so good.

134
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,680
I jumped out.

135
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,080
But in my eyes,

136
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
he just opened his mouth like this.

137
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,680
Yes.

138
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,480
No, I have to record this.

139
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,360
What?

140
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,200
Soup. Here.

141
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,960
Show us.

142
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,640
Okay.

143
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,320
Here we go.

144
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,920
Okay.

145
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,840
Hello, friends from China.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm Soup.

147
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,520
I love China.

148
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,720
I don't think it tastes right.

149
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,440
Let's go out and play.

150
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,080
Come down.

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
It's coming down.

152
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,320
Let's go.

153
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's play hawk catch chickens later.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,720
Who is the eagle?

155
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,320
I'll catch it.

156
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,120
Huahua is like an eagle.

157
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,960
You can take the picture.

158
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,560
I'll be "Mom".

159
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,320
Don't make my clothes bigger.

160
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,280
No, I ran away from home.

161
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,520
I caught you.

162
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,320
I caught you.

163
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,160
How did you...

164
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,240
I've caught him.

165
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,720
You let Master Hua here.

166
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,600
I got it. Put it aside.

167
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,520
You can't touch me.

168
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
Why are you hugging the eagle?

169
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,440
This is too hard.

170
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,440
You can't touch me.

171
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,200
I got it.

172
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,040
I got it.

173
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,560
Go away.

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,520
Fat Chicken, go!

175
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,720
She grabbed me.

176
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
This is too tiring.

177
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,240
Let's play dodgeball.

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,400
I'll throw it at Soup.

179
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,960
They're in the middle, we'll throw you.

180
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,480
OK. OK. Come on.

181
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,240
Ready.

182
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,600
Help me.

183
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,760
I'm going to send one away.

184
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,280
Where are you going?

185
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,720
You can't hit me.

186
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,960
I feel bad.

187
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,360
You two can go over there.

188
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,919
Then we'll run around.

189
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,120
I'll smash wherever I want.

190
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,040
Don't smash the soup.

191
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,640
I'll smash Terri.

192
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,240
Come on.

193
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,960
So stupid.

194
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,560
Tarri is the most obvious.

195
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,400
He's quite flexible actually.

196
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,720
My bag is flexible.

197
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,760
Why did you throw it so hard?

198
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,400
That ball is going to hit my face.

199
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,440
My face has to be flat.

200
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,600
Relax.

201
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,640
Nice.

202
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,760
How dare you hurt your sister?

203
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,240
I hit you in the face, now I hit your leg.

204
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,160
Remember.

205
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,480
I want to hit someone.

206
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,240
We need to cooperate.

207
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,000
cooperate.

208
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,800
How dare you hurt your sister?

209
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,000
Susu.

210
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,360
Don't push me.

211
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
You can't avoid me if you push me.

212
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,280
Don't push me.

213
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,440
You can't avoid me if you push me.

214
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,720
You two are still alive.

215
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,640
Su siblings.

216
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,520
Su siblings are good at hiding.

217
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,720
Su siblings are the most flexible.

218
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,920
I'm so scared.

219
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,320
So scary.

220
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,560
So flexible.

221
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,080
So scary.

222
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,400
You're on the left and I'm on the right.

223
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,080
So cooperative.

224
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,880
So you won, right?

225
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,080
I won.

226
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,760
Okay.

227
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,680
Good.

228
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,400
Good cooperation.

229
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,520
We can cooperate.

230
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,320
Yes.

231
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,640
Let's

232
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,840
Let's throw it.

233
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,480
Okay.

234
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,000
Nice shot!

235
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,840
So scary.

236
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,360
I want to be with you.

237
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,520
So scary.

238
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,640
You always hit me.

239
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,360
Two.

240
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Two.

241
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,680
leave the stage first.

242
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,040
Ouch!

243
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,040
Are you okay?

244
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,480
I didn't hit your face.

245
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,360
It's okay. It's not disfigured.

246
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,400
I'll take off my clothes.

247
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,480
Someone is taking it off. Someone is serious.

248
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,160
Oh no, our face is going to be hit.

249
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,280
Your face needs to be hit like this.

250
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,800
It's okay. I'll follow the soup.

251
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,520
You follow me.

252
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,720
Me too.

253
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,440
It's not like eagle catching chickens.

254
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,600
We all follow the soup.

255
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,560
You scared me.

256
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
You scared me.

257
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,680
Are you crazy?

258
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,920
Brother.

259
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
Hurry.

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
I'm behind you.

261
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm wearing glasses.

262
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,600
and dodge.

263
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,320
Fatty is so flexible.

264
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
Almost.

265
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,120
No, man.

266
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,200
You didn't hit me.

267
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I dodged perfectly.

268
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,840
You want to throw me away?

269
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,240
You don't know how to feel sorry for others.

270
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
Xiaoling lost it, so I lie down to catch the ball.

271
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,240
You'll play Fatty next time.

272
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
Okay.

273
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,640
Okay.

274
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,320
Get in.

275
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Fatty.

276
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,600
A fatal blow!

277
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,360
I joined the battle.

278
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,960
We have four angles.

279
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,800
Xiao Ling lost it, so I went to catch the ball.

280
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,280
So funny.

281
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,840
Hua is good at hiding.

282
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,640
Beautiful.

283
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
So scary.

284
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,200
Fortunately, it's crooked.

285
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,520
Almost.

286
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,880
Let's pass it on.

287
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,360
Yes.

288
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,480
Then give him a powerful one.

289
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,680
and then throw it out.

290
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,320
Nice shot!

291
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,240
Awesome.

292
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,560
Here we go.

293
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,840
Here comes our best shooter.

294
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,200
Cool.

295
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,920
Master Hua didn't dance in vain.

296
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,800
What happened?

297
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,480
He hit his sister so hard.

298
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,440
Hit her hard.

299
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,800
The flower looks pale.

300
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,520
So tired.

301
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,280
I'm really tired.

302
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,160
Rest for five minutes.

303
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Take a break.

304
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,720
Do you remember

305
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,960
in your memory?

306
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,760
Jump.

307
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,280
One, two, three, Mutong.

308
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,240
Collect the wrapping paper of the candy.

309
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,280
I know.

310
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,360
Now there are still

311
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,040
And throw the bottle right

312
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,920
And marbles.

313
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,000
and filming foreign films.

314
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,520
in the northeast.

315
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,440
Pa Pa

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,400
Have you ever danced before

317
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,840
I did.

318
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,640
I can't jump that high now.

319
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,760
When I was young, I danced so high.

320
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,240
I could tie my skin here when I was young.

321
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,600
Like this.

322
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,160
Right.

323
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
I used to jump high.

324
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
And I got hurt.

325
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,280
We had two teams.

326
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,760
one of our team members will die.

327
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,040
I had to save him.

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
When I was saving someone,

329
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,360
I was so happy.

330
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,440
Because I think I danced so well.

331
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
That jumping power is admirable.

332
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,200
When I jumped up in the sky,

333
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,360
I was very happy. I was pouting.

334
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,800
and suddenly lost balance.

335
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,120
Then I fell down from the sky.

336
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,360
I fell with a smile.

337
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,080
Then...

338
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,360
Yeah, my teeth hit the ground.

339
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,440
But I didn't feel it.

340
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
I was smiling when I woke up.

341
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,480
They asked me if I was fine.

342
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,120
I said I was fine.

343
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,760
And I was smiling.

344
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,960
They said

345
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,240
Lu,

346
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Your front tooth is gone.

347
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,160
I was so frustrated.

348
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Then I went home.

349
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,680
I didn't dare to tell my mom

350
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,560
I lied to my mom.

351
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,120
I fell into the bathroom

352
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,520
I fell into the toilet.

353
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,280
and broke my front tooth.

354
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,800
Because at that time,

355
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
I didn't know

356
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,320
in this world.

357
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,040
I was at my home.

358
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,520
I remember facing a round one.

359
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,160
Mirror.

360
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,320
Yes, it's "Returning Princess".

361
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,160
That mirror.

362
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,800
Then I thought

363
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,320
look at Ziwei and Swallow on TV.

364
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,800
Whose teeth are not complete?

365
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,680
My teeth are incomplete.

366
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,560
My life won't be complete anymore.

367
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,000
I was there alone.

368
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,160
I cried all afternoon.

369
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
You're so cute.

370
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,520
I have a similar one to this game.

371
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,160
It's called the blind touch the phlegm.

372
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,880
What is it?

373
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,800
Touch phlegm.

374
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Because we played at school

375
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,800
Then we covered our eyes.

376
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,960
Like this.

377
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,920
Then five or six people started running.

378
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,240
He stopped after saying three, two, one.

379
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,000
He can't move.

380
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,440
The "blind" can't see it.

381
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,760
and then touch it.

382
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,720
Jiang Dunhao, what did you play when you were young?

383
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,200
Don’t count on me.

384
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
Say the Xinjiang characteristics from my mouth.

385
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,200
It's the same.

386
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,440
It's all in the country.

387
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,320
For example cards

388
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,560
Then jump the square and do the skin tendon.

389
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,080
They are all the same.

390
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,800
They were playing volleyball

391
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,560
to avoid the ball.

392
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,440
I used to be a sandbag.

393
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:30,920
I also played it

394
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,680
It's sandbags.

395
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,720
sandbags. Yes.

396
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,240
Look how good it is.

397
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,280
This kind of game is great.

398
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,880
I want to play the piano.

399
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,560
Play the piano with me.

400
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,360
What do you want to play?

401
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,760
I want to play yesterday.

402
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,480
I think I'm going to transform.

403
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,440
Try again.

404
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,840
Let's see if it's wrong.

405
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,800
No.

406
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,240
Try it.

407
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,880
I'm tired.

408
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,600
Hurry up.

409
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,360
Just once.

410
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,120
Just once.

411
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Step on it.

412
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,680
OK.

413
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,440
Three, two, one, go.

414
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,560
You look like a war.

415
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,760
This is "The River of Heart".

416
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,319
It's my turn.

417
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,720
Again.

418
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,560
Really?

419
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,800
No way.

420
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
Like this, right?

421
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,080
Okay.

422
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm off.

423
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Bye.

424
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,080
I want to sit for a while.

425
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,600
What do you want?

426
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,120
Let's play five-in-a-row game.

427
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,760
Let's go.

428
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,080
Are you good?

429
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
I'm not.

430
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,440
Mr Tang will teach you.

431
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
I think we can win by two against one.

432
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,480
One defends.

433
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,840
One is responsible for attacking.

434
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,440
You first. Me first.

435
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,520
Me first.

436
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,640
It's up to you.

437
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,840
Why don't you put it in the middle?

438
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,800
She has OCD.

439
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,640
Maybe he played this

440
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,800
to stop us from playing this.

441
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,080
The strongest brain, Susu.

442
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,920
Luckily, I have Susu.

443
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,160
Otherwise, we'll lose.

444
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,480
What if I can't defeat you two?

445
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
I think it's okay to play with the soup singles.

446
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,080
Indeed.

447
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
Susu can help me think of something else.

448
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,920
Maybe people who are serious only see small places.

449
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,000
What do you mean? Who is serious?

450
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,080
Me?

451
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,920
So you're looking at the overall situation.

452
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,680
How?

453
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,360
Wait.

454
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,320
Don't look who played it.

455
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,800
Listen.

456
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,880
Which one is better?

457
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,120
Just choose one and two.

458
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,880
Okay.

459
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,240
Okay, let's start.

460
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,280
Listen to it first.

461
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,960
Don't look at who it is.

462
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,080
Don't be biased towards me.

463
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,400
Action.

464
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,800
You think too much.

465
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,440
She's hinting that you must be biased.

466
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,240
Okay, the second one.

467
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Add the key.

468
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,120
Which one is better? 1 or 2?

469
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,920
One or two?

470
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,760
Two. It must be two.

471
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,840
Of course it's two.

472
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,680
Come play five-in-a-row game.

473
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,200
We're going to win.

474
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
What game are you playing?

475
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,040
I can't beat them.

476
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,200
They bullied me.

477
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,120
I'm a little dizzy.

478
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,320
I'll keep an eye on them for you.

479
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,880
They're bullying me.

480
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,800
I'll keep an eye on them for you.

481
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,520
They're in front.

482
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,280
Try this.

483
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,400
Block it up.

484
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,400
It's blocked.

485
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,560
I think I won.

486
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,400
We won.

487
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,080
Where did you win?

488
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,360
We won.

489
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,800
We finally defeated Yinbo.

490
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,920
It’s hard. You’ve won several rounds.

491
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,520
Really?

492
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
Yes, he won several rounds. He did.

493
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,640
We can't play anymore.

494
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,040
Just keep it to win.

495
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,600
One more round.

496
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,080
Take a break.

497
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,320
I didn't see your strategy.

498
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Let your brain rest.

499
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,520
Hurry up.

500
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,000
No.

501
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,240
I have something to do later.

502
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,840
Three minutes.

503
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Ten minutes.

504
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,040
Are you still rehearsing?

505
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Is there a rehearsal?

506
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,440
Yes.

507
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,960
They learned the formation.

508
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,760
If I lose to Hua,

509
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,160
Will Bobo kill me?

510
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,560
I'm avenging him.

511
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,240
Play basketball.

512
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,760
Do you want to play?

513
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,560
I can.

514
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,720
Come on. Two against two.

515
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,280
It's time to teach you a lesson.

516
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,960
Come on.

517
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,480
I'll follow Tu.

518
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,680
Five balls, right?

519
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,200
So scary.

520
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,120
Those two tall guys.

521
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,880
What are you afraid of?

522
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,920
Should we send it?

523
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,640
Sure.

524
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
One.

525
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,840
As usual.

526
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,000
The loser will run around and run five laps.

527
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,480
Isn't it one lap?

528
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,600
Really?

529
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,640
So accurate.

530
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,480
No, I have to put it on guard.

531
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,600
You don't have a chance to attack.

532
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,120
Defend!

533
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,880
Mine.

534
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,000
Mine.

535
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,560
It's okay.

536
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,960
You're anti-soup.

537
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,360
Tom.

538
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,960
Is it a foul?

539
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,600
No.

540
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,120
It's too high.

541
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,360
Nice shot!

542
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,360
It's been a while. Me too.

543
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,800
It's okay. Don't get hurt.

544
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,440
Koro.

545
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,400
Three to two. Come on.

546
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,680
Three to two.

547
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,640
You guard against him.

548
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,760
There's nothing I can do.

549
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,280
Long hands and legs.

550
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,720
You grab it. Hold it.

551
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,520
I want to prove myself.

552
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,040
Foul.

553
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,840
I almost sprained my ankle.

554
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,120
Don't hurt yourself.

555
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,920
So accurate.

556
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
It's okay. Take a break.

557
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,680
I do push-ups.

558
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,280
How many?

559
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,080
Ten.

560
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,160
Twenty.

561
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,160
I don't understand.

562
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,040
I don't understand.

563
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,640
Let's go.

564
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,120
I think there's nothing to talk about.

565
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,000
Have you visited Xin?

566
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,280
Your brother misses you.

567
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,840
Is it that hard?

568
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,200
I'm very angry.

569
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,640
The point is

570
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,080
You don't have to go on this date?

571
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,160
No. I don't understand this behavior either.

572
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,200
This letter

573
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,640
is written by others, right?

574
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,920
Maybe others think it's too much

575
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
I did, but...

576
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
I think

577
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,360
he didn't go.

578
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,560
But to be honest,

579
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,960
if she messaged me

580
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,440
what she did today,

581
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
I kind of understand.

582
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,960
But now,

583
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,560
Judging from her performance,

584
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,040
This letter seems to be written on the first day.

585
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,840
Put it here.

586
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,440
No, I don't want to say it. It makes me excited.

587
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,600
to attack Hua.

588
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,240
I don't understand this.

589
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,440
Why not?

590
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,680
The point is I was thinking

591
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,440
because she cried at the map.

592
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,280
I thought

593
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,400
if we went too far.

594
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,200
No.

595
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,800
After I came out,

596
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,480
I was confused with this move.

597
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,880
I was totally confused.

598
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,720
I was wondering

599
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,680
if we were too harsh.

600
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,520
It's not good for her.

601
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,440
When I wrote a letter here today,

602
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,280
I wrote to Tu.

603
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,120
I always

604
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,600
I wonder if today

605
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,160
She is indeed a bit excited.

606
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,040
I can see that

607
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,120
I was wondering if I would treat her badly.

608
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,840
But I was worried for nothing.

609
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,200
If she had

610
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
her attitude just now

611
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,360
was very easy-going.

612
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,800
And she also said

613
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,280
Yes, she kept saying

614
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,520
Actually, I'm not sure.

615
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,840
Although I'm in contact with Tae-seo,

616
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
but I have feelings for you.

617
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,000
If she said something like that,

618
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,360
I wouldn't be so sad.

619
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,800
Because I think

620
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,120
I can understand

621
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,080
I can understand.

622
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,480
Well,

623
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,200
I was wrong.

624
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,800
I was wrong.

625
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,880
I don't mean to blame you.

626
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,480
I'm not blaming you.

627
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,360
Your brother misses you.

628
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,240
He's so upset.

629
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,920
I'm really angry.

630
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,480
The point is

631
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,840
You don't have to go on this date?

632
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,320
No.

633
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,120
I don't understand this either.

634
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,600
I'm actually fine.

635
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,720
Look at me. I just wanted you to cry.

636
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,920
You didn't ask me before.

637
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,560
I haven't seen you cry for a long time.

638
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,360
I didn't see you cry

639
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,720
I didn't see you crying.

640
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,200
All right.

641
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,040
Why are you more...

642
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,280
Stop crying.

643
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,320
I don't understand.

644
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,920
They must have different ideas.

645
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,200
But I don't understand.

646
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,160
And I think

647
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,440
I didn't need to worry.

648
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,440
When I came back, I was thinking,

649
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,200
she cried at the map.

650
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,360
She must be very upset.

651
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,680
So I was wondering

652
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,800
if we were too harsh.

653
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,760
Because it's like three-on-one.

654
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,480
Really

655
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,640
Funny

656
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,760
Who knows family

657
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,760
I haven't had a date for a long time

658
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,680
I want to go on a date.

659
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,240
So annoying.

660
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,640
I haven't had a date for a long time.

661
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,320
Empty heart.

662
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,880
Don't hurt yourself.

663
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,960
So accurate.

664
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,800
I think when I choose between the two,

665
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,160
I think I will put Tom

666
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,320
in the first place.

667
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,880
To me,

668
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,040
no one is more important than Tom.

669
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,360
I don't know why I chose to go.

670
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,480
We quarreled.

671
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,040
We've been here for a long time.

672
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,600
Yeah, I didn't know you were like this.

673
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,800
I didn't know this would happen.

674
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,960
Don't be sad.

675
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,040
So tired.

676
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,080
Hug me.

677
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,200
Hold on. Come down and catch him.

678
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,800
Are you okay?

679
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,680
Let's hug.

680
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,840
Don't you have anything to say to me?

681
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,480
I want to know.

682
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,320
I want to tell you

683
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,400
I'm the only one who helped you go on a date.

684
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,880
Here,

685
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,920
I really found the flow of the house is faster.

686
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,640
Yes.

687
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,880
It keeps happening.

688
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,720
The so-called conflict and progress

689
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,600
From the perspective of the bystander,

690
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,400
we really hope the members

691
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,880
we can think about

692
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,680
face your heart.

693
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,920
Don't miss it

694
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,680
because of

695
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,760
that could have been created.

696
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,360
Yes.

697
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,920
The confidence of our next show

698
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,840
is about to start.

699
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,320
What happened

700
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,360
What happened?

701
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,640
And the relationship between

702
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,040
and Terri?

703
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,840
with Tae-seo?

704
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Let's look forward to next week's show.

705
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,720
Let's

706
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Love and Sisters

707
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,760
Double the love.

708
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,240
Have you thought of going on a date with me today?

709
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,960
Yes.

710
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,440
Xiao'er wants to be happy forever.

711
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,600
Okay.

712
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,640
OK, Yinbo.

713
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,400
Make yourself for me.

714
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,760
Stay with you for me.

715
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,880
You're back.

716
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,080
How did it go, Tom?

717
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,840
Great!

718
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,520
Okay.

719
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,600
I didn't feel it.

720
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,840
He didn't say much in total.

721
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,760
and took a photo for you.

722
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,360
No.

723
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,200
He's playing with him.

724
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,960
I'm a little upset.

725
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,720
I think he doesn't want to continue.

726
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,680
Hush.

727
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,840
Susu, are you eating?

728
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,520
Is it that serious?

729
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,320
Every Thursday at 18:00 p.m. Members will enjoy the replication of "Sibling Defense Diaries".

730
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,560
Send live comments to witness the bond between family and love.
