1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Party Xiao.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
Party Xiao wild drink, feels immediate.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
Fluffy like the top of the skull.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
Fluffy like the top of the skull perm, scalp feels fresh and breathable.

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:45,800
More.

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,120
Beautiful.

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,720
Wind paper.

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,160
Saint can say.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,560
Wind red.

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
Party Xiao wild drink, feels immediate.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
Fluffy like the top of the skull perm, scalp can breathe.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,720
Go on Weibo and participate in the #LoveSiblingsTrueHeartGuardList# exclusive gameplay for a chance to win surprise benefits.

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,720
Please welcome this handsome guy.
Announcer.

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,680
Tata.
Why?

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,120
Why does he suddenly want to perform?
Tata.

16
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,800
Meina.
Tang Tang might be about to make a public confession.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
Susu.
I said, what's going on?

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,800
I said, what's the situation?

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,640
What's going on?

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,320
What is he going to do?

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,160
My whole mind was just...

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,080
At that moment, I had a hundred thousand thoughts.

23
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,880
They just came flooding out.

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,520
Watch what he's going to do.
Wu Zun.

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,520
Tang Tang.
As for me,

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,880
I wrote a little story on the spot.
Tang Tang.

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,840
Let me tell everyone about it.

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,240
It might not be fun.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,920
So everyone, please bear with it.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Okay.
Tu Tu.

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
If it were me, I'd definitely 'die'.

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,760
Standing on that.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,120
One day,

34
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,840
My door was knocked.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,960
I hurried over in confusion.

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,720
Thinking to myself,

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,600
What's this about?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,080
Actually wrote a comic dialogue.
Yang Gen.

39
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,720
I don't have any friends coming over today.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,280
As soon as the door opened,

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,240
A pair of big, twinkling eyes.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,320
Blinked at me a few times.

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,040
At that moment, I thought,

44
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,880
Oh no,

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,079
I've fallen in love.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,880
Xiaoling.
What?

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,280
Huahua.
So romantic.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,960
But the strange thing is,

49
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,040
Neither of us likes to talk much.

50
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,640
I thought, what should I do?

51
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,960
Two silent gourds, big eyes staring at small eyes.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,480
Couldn't say a word for a long time.

53
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,320
It's all so extremely romantic.
Zhu Dan.

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,200
So romantic.
Yi Meina.

55
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,480
Tang Tang.
I kept staring at her.

56
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,400
just kept looking.
Tang Tang.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,880
Tang Tang.
helped her pass water and bowls.

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,200
I wondered if I was being too forward.
Tang Tang.

59
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,400
Tang Tang.
There's something on top.

60
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,200
Tang Tang.
I'm not very thirsty.

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,840
Thank you.
Su Su.

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,960
Tang Tang.
Perhaps this is as proactive as an earth sign gets.

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,800
Tang Tang.
After a few days together, the misunderstandings were endless.

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
I felt like we clearly had a connection.
Tang Tang.

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,560
Tang Tang.
Why is it so difficult?

66
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,160
Even Zhu Bajie marrying wasn't this hard.
Tang Tang.

67
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,040
Tang Tang.
I decided to seek some wisdom.

68
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
The ninety-nine and eighty-one hardships.
Tang Tang.

69
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,280
Tang Tang.
Even Bajie got through them.

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640
Tang Tang.
I've only faced a few difficulties.

71
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,960
I chatted with Pang Pang over and over.
Tang Tang.

72
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,840
Tang Tang.
chatted again and again.

73
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,720
Teacher Zhuang's advice is,
Tang Tang.

74
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,840
Tang Tang.
don't be so constrained.

75
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,160
Tang Tang.
you have to relax when interacting with girls.

76
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,760
otherwise, girls feel a lot of pressure too.
Tang Tang.

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Tang Tang.
I said, 'Master, I understand.'

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,400
Tang Tang.
just like that.

79
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,880
I think I've been quite proactive.
Tang Tang.

80
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,280
Tang Tang.
I wrote a letter.

81
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,800
Tang Tang.
I dreamed of a flower seller.

82
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,280
empty-handed, they told me,
Tang Tang.

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,840
Tang Tang.
'One must feel happiness before seeing the roses.'

84
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,800
We started talking more and more.
Tang Tang.

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,320
Tang Tang.
You also started smiling a lot more.

86
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,160
Yang Gen.
It's so wonderful.

87
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,160
Tang Tang.
I think this might be

88
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,360
the process from acquaintance to understanding.
Tang Tang.

89
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,480
Tang Tang.
The flower seller asked me what I wanted.

90
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,240
There was a dazzling array of choices.
Tang Tang.

91
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,600
Tang Tang.
I walked around and chose white roses.

92
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,480
The flowers are like you,
Tang Tang.

93
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,360
Tang Tang.
pure and elegant, unworldly.

94
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,760
I hid my sincerity in the flowers and gave them to you.
Tang Tang.

95
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,560
Tang Tang.
We've made great progress these past two days.

96
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,159
Thanks to the muscle master's help.
Tang Tang.

97
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,600
Tang Tang.
'Bajie' is about to succeed.

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,080
Wait for my success news, everyone.
Tang Tang.

99
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,240
Then we'll meet again in the world.
Tang Tang.

100
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,920
This confession is so sophisticated.
Zhu Dan.

101
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,240
Zhang Zining.
It's so awesome.

102
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
Zhu Dan.
And it's so romantic.

103
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,080
It's very...
Zhu Dan.

104
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,000
Zhu Dan.
sincere.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,880
Susu.
I'd give it a perfect score. It's very brave.

106
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,520
I really don't feel
Susu.

107
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,400
Susu.
this is something he would do.

108
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,720
Although it would make me very shy
Susu.

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,800
Susu.
and embarrassed,

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,120
I'm actually very touched inside.
Susu.

111
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,200
Susu.
It feels like it took a lot of courage.

112
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,320
Because if it were me,
Susu.

113
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,120
Susu.
I probably

114
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,480
wouldn't dare to go on stage and do this.
Susu.

115
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,320
Jiang Dunhao.
Jiang Dunhao, it's a confession without pressure.

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,920
Yes.
Jiang Dunhao.

117
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,400
Tangtang.
At that time,

118
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,280
I wasn't actually that scared or nervous.
Tangtang.

119
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,160
Tangtang.
Because we had already held hands the day before.

120
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,360
I just felt that
Tangtang.

121
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
Tangtang.
I could openly express my feelings.

122
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,200
There wouldn't be any bad outcome.
Tangtang.

123
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,960
Yang Gen.
So polite.

124
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,360
So sincere.
Yang Gen.
So polite.

125
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
Zhu Dan.
Those who understand, understand.

126
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,080
Thank you for this handsome guy's wonderful performance.
Announcer.

127
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,720
Announcer: Let's give him another round of applause.

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,760
Susu.
When did you write it?

129
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,280
Tangtang.
Just now in the car.

130
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,800
Yang Gen.
Our Tang charged forward bravely for love.

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Jiang Dunhao.
Yes.

132
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,760
Huahua.
Tangtang raises his hand.

133
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,640
I thought he would sing a song
Huahua.

134
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,080
Huahua.
to warm up the atmosphere or something.

135
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,159
I didn't expect he would
Huahua.

136
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,920
Huahua.
recite such a heartfelt monologue.

137
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,560
It really
Huahua.

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,920
Huahua.
impressed me.

139
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,400
Xiaoling.
He pulled off such a big move.

140
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,320
I didn't expect it,
Xiaoling.

141
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,480
Xiaoling.
because Tangtang is someone

142
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
who wouldn't even dare to perform on stage if you asked him to.
Xiaoling.

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,920
Xiaoling.
He gets very nervous in front of the camera.

144
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,960
So I would think
Xiaoling.

145
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,480
Xiaoling,
He's really taking this matter to heart.

146
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,000
he's so serious and proactive.
Xiaoling,

147
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,760
Xiaoling,
It's like seeing a whole new Tom again.

148
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,240
one I've never seen before.
Xiaoling,

149
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,880
Xiaoling,
He must have grown a lot.

150
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,520
Huahua,
Tangtang, how long did you rehearse that speech?

151
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,120
Tangtang,
I started writing it when we got in the car just now.

152
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,880
Huahua,
you just wrote it?

153
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,280
Tangtang,
wasn't I reading and speaking at the same time up there?

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,640
so last-minute.
Pangpang,

155
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:18,960
Tangtang,
Yes.

156
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,800
so last-minute.
Huahua,

157
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,920
Huahua,
I was already moved while watching from below.

158
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,760
Xiaoling,
I recorded it all for you.

159
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,080
Xinxin,
Xinxin, from those big, sparkling eyes...

160
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,840
I was already starting to feel moved.
Xinxin,

161
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,760
Huahua,
Yes, I think it was really touching.

162
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,480
at that moment.
Huahua,

163
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,840
Zhu Dan,
This love is so presentable.

164
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,080
the power of love.
Wu Zun,

165
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,600
Pangpang,
At first, I thought you were going up to sing.

166
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
passionate Aries.
Pangpang,

167
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Tangtang,
Really?

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,880
Xinxin,
I also thought you were going to sing.

169
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,600
Tangtang,
it was really too passionate.

170
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
I've always been passionate.
Tangtang,

171
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,960
Tangtang,
What did you do this morning?

172
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,880
Tutu,
we went shopping this morning.

173
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,159
visited ancient temples.
Tutu,
we went shopping this morning.

174
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,960
Xinxin,
We visited a museum.

175
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,200
Huahua,
museum.

176
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,120
the clay figurine museum was so much fun.
Tutu,

177
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,640
Huahua,
Do you know where we went?

178
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,200
Tutu,
Where?

179
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,600
guess.
Terry,

180
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,720
Huahua,
Actually, I think this place...

181
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,480
should be quite famous in Beijing.
Huahua,

182
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,360
Tutu,
Quite famous in Beijing.

183
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
Terry,
actually, every city has one.

184
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,600
Tangtang,
you'll be judged by the elderly.

185
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,880
judged by the elderly.
Huahua,

186
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,560
Tutu
You went square dancing.

187
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,240
Something like that.
Terry

188
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,800
Harry
You went to the matchmaking corner.

189
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,560
Terry
That's right.

190
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,640
Matchmaking corner.
Tutu

191
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,120
Huahua
Yes.

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,040
Tutu
You went to the matchmaking corner.

193
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,560
Huahua
Those three guys were really popular.

194
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,320
They kept pulling them along.
Huahua

195
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,880
Susu
They were constantly being praised.

196
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,920
They wanted to register them.
Huahua

197
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Like, seriously register them.
Xinxin

198
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,480
Seriously.
Huahua

199
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,560
Pangpang, did you leave your contact?
Xinxin

200
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,000
Pangpang
I did.

201
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,440
Xinxin
Good.

202
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,720
Pangpang
I needed it the most, so I left mine first.

203
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,920
Xinxin
I was so worried, I was really worried.

204
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,480
Alright.
Xinxin

205
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,800
Pangpang
What about you guys?

206
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,640
Xinxin
We went to the Ancient Culture Street.

207
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,280
Huahua
Ancient Culture Street? Shopping?

208
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
Then we bought a lot of snacks.
Xiaoling

209
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,280
Huahua
Wait a minute.

210
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,920
You just had snacks for lunch?
Huahua

211
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,440
Yes.
Tutu

212
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,120
Xinxin
Tutu ordered a basket of Goubuli buns.

213
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
Xinxin
He ate four by himself.

214
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,440
I misspoke. They're called Goubuli buns.
Tangtang

215
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,360
Goubuli buns.

216
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,560
Huahua
Goubuli buns.

217
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Then we learned some Tianjin dialect.
Huahua

218
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,080
Xinxin
We learned quite a lot.

219
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,960
Xiaoling
I learned how to say 'I miss you a lot in Tianjin.'

220
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,320
I miss you a lot in Tianjin.
Together.

221
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,880
Xinxin
I really miss you.

222
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,800
Susu
I learned one that goes...

223
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,680
What?
Susu

224
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,200
Beautiful girl with handsome guy.
Tangtang

225
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,360
Susu
We were just standing there.

226
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,640
Then an old man said to us.
Susu

227
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,440
Susu
Beautiful girl with handsome guy.

228
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
Handsome guy with beautiful girl.
Susu

229
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,960
Hua Hua.

230
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,920
Xiao Ling.

231
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,960
Tai Rui.
Let's meet back at the cabin.

232
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,760
Tu Tu.
Goodbye, go ahead.

233
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,120
Xiao Ling.
Goodbye.

234
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Let's go, we should leave too.
Ta Ta.

235
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Xiao Ling.
We should leave too.

236
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,120
Let's go.
Tu Tu.

237
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
Yang Gen.
Actually, Tang Tang this.

238
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,360
publicly expressing love.
Yang Gen.

239
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,400
Yang Gen.
I think it's very brave.

240
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,039
Compared to Tang Tang when she first entered the cabin,
Yang Gen.

241
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,960
Yang Gen.
there has been a dramatic change.

242
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,000
Jiang Dunhao, in relationships,
Yang Gen.

243
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,679
Yang Gen.
have you ever, because of love,

244
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,320
made any brave moves
Yang Gen.

245
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Yang Gen.
or changes?

246
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,800
Jiang Dunhao.
When I was in school,

247
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,120
every classmate around me
Jiang Dunhao.

248
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,560
Jiang Dunhao.
would go out to do part-time jobs

249
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,400
and earn some tuition money
Jiang Dunhao.

250
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,040
Jiang Dunhao.
or living expenses to support themselves.

251
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,920
At that time, when I was dating,
Jiang Dunhao.

252
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
Jiang Dunhao.
my girlfriend wanted those in school

253
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,880
these classmates
Jiang Dunhao.

254
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,960
Jiang Dunhao.
to be able to eat fresh fruits.

255
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,120
So I would accompany her to the market,
Jiang Dunhao.

256
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,920
Jiang Dunhao.
buy some fruits and cut them up.

257
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,400
Then we would set up a stall on campus,
Jiang Dunhao.

258
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,760
Jiang Dunhao.
and I would help her sell the fruits.

259
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,800
Mei Na.
How romantic!

260
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,160
This is very romantic, this
Mei Na.

261
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,000
Jiang Dunhao.
I think for me, it counts as brave.

262
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,400
Wu Zun.
Brave.

263
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,200
Jiang Dunhao.
I consider myself someone who cares about face,

264
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,840
but I had to set up a stall there,
Jiang Dunhao.

265
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,120
Jiang Dunhao.
and also persuade my classmates to buy.

266
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
Xiao Ling.
Let me tell you,

267
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,320
don't tell anyone else.
Xiao Ling.

268
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,960
Let me see what that is.
Tu Tu.

269
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,480
Xiao Ling.
Not telling you.

270
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,880
Xiao Ling.
What do you think?

271
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,880
Xin Xin.
You have to rate it from one to ten.

272
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,960
You ask me how many points,
Xin Xin.

273
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,600
Xin Xin.
I think,

274
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,120
six points.
Xin Xin.

275
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,640
Xinxin.
Is there?

276
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,960
There still is.
Xinxin.

277
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
Xinxin.
A score of 60 is passing for me.

278
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,800
Xiaoling.
I'm thinking.

279
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
and I'm also feeling it.
Xiaoling.

280
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,640
Xiaoling.
But I really don't know.

281
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,520
Xinxin.
I think there still is.

282
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,400
Really?
Xiaoling.

283
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,800
Then I'll try harder to feel it.
Xiaoling.

284
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,120
Yang Gen.
I think the fact that Xiaoling can ask this question

285
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,680
shows that
Yang Gen.

286
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,080
Zhu Dan.
she cares.

287
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,360
Yang Gen.
She really cares about Tutu.

288
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,160
Zhu Dan.
Yes.

289
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,040
Xinxin.
It's because of your comparison.

290
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,960
Xinxin.
You can't compare it to a perfect ten.

291
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,720
Indeed.
Xiaoling.

292
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,960
Xinxin.
Many people have different personalities.

293
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,680
Indeed.
Xiaoling.

294
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,360
Tutu.
Mimi.

295
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
Xiaoling.
It's so unfamiliar, suddenly.

296
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
Is it Donkey Roll?
Xiaoling.

297
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,880
Yes.
Tutu.

298
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,600
Xiaoling.
It's here.

299
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,240
Harry.
Isn't it?

300
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,360
Sister Zhu's hair bun, hair updo.
Harry.

301
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,400
Sister Zhu's hair updo.
Tata.

302
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Xinxin.
Sister Zhu's hair updo.

303
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,800
Jiang Dunhao.
Hair updo.

304
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,040
This is very popular in Tianjin.
Yang Gen.

305
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,880
Xiaolu.
Extremely popular.

306
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,000
Many internet celebrities go there.
Xiaolu.

307
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,480
Yang Gen.
Yes.

308
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,800
The hairstyle can be as tall as a floor.
Yang Gen.

309
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,720
Harry.
Hello.

310
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,160
Sister Zhu.
Hello.

311
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,920
Sister Zhu.
Hello.

312
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,080
Beautiful ladies and handsome gentlemen.
Sister Zhu.

313
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,080
Sister Zhu.
Hello.

314
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
Let's try some hair styling.
Harry.

315
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,480
Sister Zhu.
Let's try the Tianjin auntie's hairstyle.

316
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,720
Yeah, just messing with us.
Harry.

317
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,320
Sister Zhu.
Three girls, two boys.

318
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,080
Xinxin.
Right.

319
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,040
Let's choose one girl.
Xinxin.

320
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,080
then choose one.
Xinxin.

321
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,040
Choose one boy.
Sister Zhu.

322
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Eyes locked on.
Yang Gen.

323
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,920
Count me out.
Harry.

324
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,080
Sister Zhu.
You're out.

325
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,480
I think you look good.
Sister Zhu.

326
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,720
Harry.
Don't look at me.

327
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,840
I don't need it.
Harry.

328
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,040
Xinxin.
It's already fluffy without styling.

329
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,440
Yes.
Tutu.

330
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,480
Xiaoling.
Let's vote.

331
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,240
Yang Gen.
In each episode.

332
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,000
We will set up the reasoning content
Yang Gen.

333
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,200
Yang Gen.
based on the direction of the show's content.

334
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
The person who answers correctly will receive
Yang Gen.

335
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,000
Yang Gen.
a Fruit Cube wild badge.

336
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,080
In the last episode,
Yang Gen.

337
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
Yang Gen.
the guest who obtains the most

338
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,920
Fruit Cube wild badges
Yang Gen.

339
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,120
Yang Gen.
will receive a mysterious grand prize

340
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,680
provided by Fruit Cube.
Yang Gen.

341
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,400
Yang Gen.
The content of this episode's reasoning is

342
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,080
who are the boy and girl that Yang Gen will accept for hair styling?
Yang Gen.

343
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,240
This is hard to guess.
Zhu Dan.

Xiaoling.
Starting with Xinxin.

358
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,680
Raise your hand if you vote for Xinxin.
Xiaoling.

359
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,720
No one.
Xinxin.

360
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Xinxin.
Raise your hand if you vote for Mizi.

361
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,760
You pick one.
Tutu.

365
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,440
Xinxin.
I choose

366
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,880
Xinxin.
Do you want to do it?

367
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,160
I don't think I can do it.
Tata.

368
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,120
Xinxin.
Then Mizi, you give it a try.

369
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
mainly because I think
Xinxin.

370
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
Xinxin.
you have a very stylish effect.

371
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,840
Xiaoling.
I'm fine, I can do it, no problem.

372
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,040
Xinxin.
This team has sent out one.

373
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,880
I think your team
Xinxin.

374
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,000
Xinxin.
should also send out one.

375
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,880
Alright, then we'll send out Tata.
Harry.

376
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,920
Xinxin.
Did you see it at the crucial moment?

377
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,800
Harry.
Okay.

378
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,640
How do we do this?
Harry.

379
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,760
Harry.
Let's do it.

380
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,240
Xiaolu.
Harry.

381
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,720
Yang Gen.
I answered correctly.

382
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,240
We got it right.
Together.

383
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,840

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Jiang Dunhao.
Teacher.

387
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,160
And me too.
Jiang Dunhao.

388
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,240
Yang Gen.
I'm sorry.

389
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,480
Come on.
Wu Zun.

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,280
Yang Gen.
Jiang Dunhao.

00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,600
Congratulations, Jiang Dunhao.
Yang Gen.

392
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,840
Looking forward to it.
Tata.

393
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,040
Xiaoling.
You're so excited, Tata.

394
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,480
Xinxin.
To be honest, I'm more looking forward to Harry's.

395
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
Harry.
Which one is wearing a wig?

396
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,240
Which one isn't wearing a wig?
Harry.

397
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,120
Sister Zhu.
There's no wig here.

398
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,040
These are all their own hair.
Sister Zhu.

399
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,520
Isn't this a sea urchin head?
Sister Zhu.

400
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,360
What about this one?
Harry.

401
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,160
This is a flying dragon in the sky.
Sister Zhu.

402
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,120
Sister Zhu, you can't do this dragon.

403
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,000
let's do a snake instead.
Sister Zhu,

404
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,720
Xinxin,
It's auspicious this year.

405
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,640
we must do a snake.
Xinxin,

406
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,400
Harry,
Really?

407
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,680
what style?
Harry,

408
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,440
a snake.
Sister Zhu,

409
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,560
Sister Zhu,
A small snake.

410
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,640
it's the Year of the Snake.
Sister Zhu,

411
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,600
how do we do this?
Tata,

412
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,440
Sister Zhu,
We'll coil it up later.

413
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,640
wrap it around his head.
Sister Zhu,

414
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,200
okay, let's do this.
Harry,

415
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,040
alright, that works.
Tata,

416
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,800
Xinxin,
I think this hairstyle

417
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,320
can shut Harry's mouth.
Xinxin,

418
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,120
Xinxin,
I finally know what can cure him.

419
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,680
Sister Zhu,
your hair is really quite stiff.

420
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,400
is there enough hair?
Harry,

421
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,560
Sister Zhu,
It's enough.

422
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,000
it's alright.
Harry,

423
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,920
this time I'll curl your hair.
Sister Zhu,

424
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,920
auntie looks so happy.
Zhu Dan,

425
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,160
Harry,
Why are you laughing so happily?

426
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
honestly, don't laugh so happily.
Harry,

427
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,320
I feel pressured when you laugh so happily.
Harry,

428
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,360
you're laughing so happily.
Harry,

429
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,120
Meina,
Auntie is laughing out loud.

430
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,840
this time I'll choose this hairstyle for you.
Sister Zhu,

431
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,920
Xiaoling,
Harry,

432
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,040
honestly, I'm a bit overwhelmed.
Harry,

433
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,000
Tata,
You finally achieved this little bun.

434
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,280
Zhu Dan,
Harry's little bun is so cute now.

435
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,680
Sister Zhu,
do you understand my hair styling?

436
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,480
I understand now.
Harry,

437
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,960
you're learning, right?
Xinxin,

438
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,800
it's like a dream back to the 90s.
Xiaolu,

439
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,560
Xiaoling,
What's this?

440
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,120
it's covering one eye.
Xiaoling,

441
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,600
honestly, I'm about to transform.
Harry,

442
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,360
Tata,
No, Harry,

443
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,920
Tata, can you go eat by yourself later?
Tata,

444
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,320
Harry,
Let me tell you,

445
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,760
after I get my hair done,
Harry,

446
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
I'm taller than Terry.
Harry,

447
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,640
Terry,
Tata,

448
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,840
Xiaoling looks so peaceful over there.
Tata,

449
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,360
Xiaoling should have this style.
Harry,

450
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,920
Xiaoling
I

451
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,480
I dare not look.
Tata,

452
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,880
Sister Zhu,
The handsome guy you can't shake off.

453
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,440
don't think
Sister Zhu,

454
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,080
Sister Zhu,
you can shake it off so easily.

455
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,880
it can't be shaken off,
Sister Zhu,

456
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,360
Zhu Dan,
not even one.

457
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,080
better cover it up.
Harry,

458
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,880
Sister Zhu,
You all seem pleased,

459
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,960
it's not difficult for you, right?
Sister Zhu,

460
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,760
no,
Tutu,

461
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,080
we're looking forward to it.
Tata,

462
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,520
we're really looking forward to it.
Tutu,

463
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,760
it really suits you, mainly because
Xinxin,

464
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,120
Tutu,
I suddenly regret not being chosen.

465
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,800
it looks so good.
Tutu,

466
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,520
Tata,
It's like Jay Chou himself is sitting here.

467
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,240
don't you think so? This hairstyle.
Tata,

468
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,960
the left eye is to remember you.
Tutu,

469
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,960
Xinxin,
Tata, don't laugh at him.

470
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,280
you should give him some loving encouragement.
Xinxin,

471
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,560
I don't want to.
Tata,

472
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,440
it must have taken ten pounds of hair gel.
Zhang Zining,

473
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,080
Harry,
Do you think for me to do one hairstyle,

474
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,440
it requires using up an entire bottle of hair gel?
Harry,

475
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,000
I've lost money, I've lost money.
Sister Zhu,

476
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Harry,
How did you lose money?

477
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,960
Sister Zhu,
it's also a cost.

478
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,360
Tutu,
let me tell you,

479
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,120
you can use this to top Susu later.
Tutu,

480
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,680
Harry.
I'll fan her with this.

481
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,200
I'll fan her a bit.
Harry.

482
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,080
I said I'd come to fan you.
Harry.

483
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,080
Xinxin.
I think this,

484
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,320
is right on our theme.
Xinxin.

485
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,120
Xinxin.
'Just Kidding.'

486
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,960
Yes, it's really 'Just Kidding.'
Tutu.

487
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,560
Xiaoling.
I don't think I've been teased much yet.

488
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,240
He was teased.
Xiaoling.

489
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,480
Harry.
I'm almost done.

490
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,120
laughing so happily.
Harry.

491
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,960
Xinxin.
Really.

492
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,760
I can't even imagine,
Xinxin.

493
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,600
Xinxin.
what if it's Pangpang?

494
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,200
Xiaoling.
If it's Pangpang,

495
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,960
Tutu.
why wasn't it Pangpang who drew 'Just Kidding'?

496
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,720
Tata.
If it's Pangpang,

497
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,440
then Pangpang must be sitting here.
Tata.

498
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,480
Tata.
Definitely, Pangpang must be sitting here.

499
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,240
Sister Zhu.
Okay.

500
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,320
Tata.
The snake is on.

501
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,640
Nervous, Harry?
Tata.

502
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,560
I seem a bit nervous.
Harry.

503
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,960
Harry.
You're laughing so happily.

504
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,119
When the snake coils up, it's a bit,
Tutu.

505
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,280
like adding the finishing touch.
Tutu.

506
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,440
Prince, you become a prince.
Tata.

507
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,079
An Egyptian prince appears.
Tutu.

508
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,960
Yes.
Tata.

509
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,200
So handsome.
Tutu.

510
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,079
Xiaoling.
Harry now looks like that,

511
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,600
half-hidden behind a pipa.
Xiaoling.

512
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,240
Xiaoling.
You're holding that thing in your hand.

513
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,480
And sprinkling powder.
Zhu Dan.

514
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,080
Xinxin.
Really.

515
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,440
Absolutely, so many girls love you, Harry.
Xinxin.

516
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,320
To be honest,
Xinxin.

517
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
to be honest,
Harry.

518
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,280
there's something there.
Harry.

519
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,200
Tata.
Have you already fallen in love with yourself?

520
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,960
Xinxin
Did you vote today?

521
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,360
I must vote.
Xinxin
Did you vote today?

522
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,520
Tata
Definitely voting for Harry.

523
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,920
Xinxin
Is there any privilege?

524
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,120
I must vote for you.
Xinxin

525
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,240
Tata
Best of the day.

526
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,440
Bull Demon King
Tata

527
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,880
Tata
You really are the Bull Demon King.

528
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,680
Go away.
Harry

529
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,760
Mom, there's a monster.
Tata

530
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,320
Speak.
Xinxin

531
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,400
Xinxin
Monster, what's your name?

532
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,600
Xinxin
Monster

533
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,600
Xiaoling
I'm starting to get a little scared.

534
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,040
so tall, I feel like I
Harry

535
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,680
Tutu
Anna, you've really become Anna.

536
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,560
like those foreign royals.
Tutu

537
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,640
She turned into Angelina Jolie.
Tata

538
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,560
Xiaoling
That's quite a high compliment, Tata.

539
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,640
Looking forward to Xiaoling.
Tata

540
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,480
Xinxin
You are simply beautiful.

541
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,080
I think
Xinxin

542
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,360
Tata
Indeed.

543
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,880
Xiaoling looks beautiful no matter what.
Tata

544
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,200
Tata
Feeling Xiaoling

545
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
Even the Bull Demon King's head looks good.
Tata

546
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,280
Sister Zhu
Looks good, right?

547
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,000
Xiaoling
Looks good, really good.

548
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,840
Tutu
You really look like a 'spy' now.

549
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,720
You know what?
Tutu

550
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,840
Xiaoling
I'm going to act in 'The Eternal Wave'.

551
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,360
Tutu
You have this too.

552
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,360
Yes.
Xiaoling

553
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,160
Tutu
You're simply like a beauty from the Republic era.

554
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,080
Really stunning.
Xinxin

555
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,600
Indeed, beautiful no matter what.
Tata

556
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,280
Zhang Zining
She's really suited for this.

557
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,480
Zhu Dan
So pretty.

558
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,040
Wu Zun
Like a Disney princess.

559
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,880
Jiang Dunhao
Really.

560
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,080
Sister Zhu
Good.

561
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,240
Thank you.
Xiaoling

562
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,400
Sister Zhu
You're welcome.

563
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,880
Beauty and the Beast.
Tata.

564
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,320
Xinxin.
Alright, let's go.

565
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,080
Come on, come out.
Tata.

566
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,560
Zhang Zining.
It's so beautiful.

567
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,600
Yang Gen.
So pretty.

568
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,560
Tutu.
So beautiful.

569
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,120
A stunning beauty.
Tutu.

570
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,240
Really.
Tata.

571
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,960
Jiang Dunhao.
Can we go back again?

572
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,920
Zhu Dan.
So 'Shamate'.

573
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,360
Harry.
Three, two, one.

574
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,240
Meina.
It's become a landmark.

575
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
Really kind of handsome.
Xinxin.

576
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,480
So cool, 'Zhou Dong'.
Tutu.

577
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,200
So stylish.
Xinxin.

578
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,280
Tutu.
'Zhou Dong' is so cool.

579
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,480
Tata.
'Zhou Dong'.

580
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,080
Tutu.
'Zhou Dong', come.

581
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,840
Xinxin.
It's support, right?

582
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
Tata.
Tutu feels very scared.

583
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,680
Tutu is scared.
Tata.

584
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,840
Harry.
Next one.

585
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,680
Xinxin.
Just like that.

586
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,800
Xinxin, just keep it like that, it's very funny.

587
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Xiaoling.
Three, two, one.

588
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,680
Dad.
Harry.

589
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,960
Dad, do you want to see my hair, Dad?
Harry.

590
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,600
Susu Harry Dad.
Alright, open it, let me see.

591
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,000
Is it handsome?
Harry.

592
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,800
Susu Harry Dad.
I didn't see clearly, let me open it and see.

593
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,440
Harry.
Look, is it handsome?

594
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,800
Susu Harry Dad.
What head?

595
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,080
Snake Year Good Luck Hair.
Harry.

596
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,960
Susu Harry Dad.
Let me see again.

597
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,840
Harry.
You take a look.

598
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,680
Zhu Jie.
Look again.

599
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,480
Dad is really scared, Dad.
Xinxin.

600
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,640
Susu Harry Dad.
Stand back, I didn't see clearly.

601
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,080
Dad can't believe that's hair.
Xiaolu.

602
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
Zhu Jie.
Look again.

603
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,640
Harry.
You're screenshotting me now.

604
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,280
Speechless.
Harry.

605
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,720
Pang Pang.
The 'Is this the way?' route.

606
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
There's one last stop.
Pang Pang.

607
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,040
Pang Pang.
to experience.

608
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,920
Pang Pang.
The Tianjin Eye at sunset in Tianjin.

609
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,240
Let the romance freeze in time.
Pang Pang.

610
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,280
Hua Hua.
Romance frozen in time.

611
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,520
This one dares to sit.
Pang Pang.

612
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,840
Who would sit here?
Tang Tang.

613
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,520
Then you two sit.
Pang Pang.

614
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,560
Tang Tang.
We two won't sit.

615
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,280
Not sitting.
Tang Tang.

616
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,080
Pang Pang.
Why?

617
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,800
Su Su.
Because I'm afraid of heights.

618
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,880
This holding hands looks so natural now.
Jiang Dunhao.

619
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,960
Then you two sit.
Pang Pang.

620
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,240
All are afraid.
Hua Hua.

621
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,760
Pang Pang.
Yes, those two.

622
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,400
Terry.
Then we two.

623
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,080
I'll sit with Hua Hua.
Terry.

624
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,200
Then it's you two.
Pang Pang.

625
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,280
Hua Hua.
You're not afraid?

626
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,080
Pang Pang.
I'm afraid of you.

627
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,600
You go ahead.
Pang Pang.

628
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,880
Hua Hua.
Afraid of me.

629
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,360
Hua Hua.
Funny.

630
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,200
Pang Pang.
You go ahead.

631
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,360
Su Su.
Aren't you sitting, Pang Pang?

632
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,680
Pang Pang.
I'm not sitting.

633
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,560
Three of us sitting is a bit cramped.
Pang Pang.

634
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Pang Pang.
I'll let them two sit.

635
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,520
Tang Tang.
Three sit.

636
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
Pang Pang.
Go ahead.

637
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,600
Hua Hua.
How to board?

638
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,320
Wu Zun.
He gave up.

639
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,200
Zhu Dan.

640
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,720
Pang Pang.
From my perspective.

641
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,040
Then my initiative from the day before,
Pang Pang.

642
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,840
Pang Pang.
plus your avoidance today,

643
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,520
Actually, I personally think,
Pang Pang.

644
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,480
Pang Pang.
this is a kind of rejection.

645
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,960
Maybe she's a bit shy to reject.
Pang Pang.

646
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,320
Xiao Lu.
Actually, this understanding is correct.

647
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,280
Zhu Dan.
Alright, Brother Pang.

648
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,120
Zhu Dan
I respect you as a real man.

649
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,080
Dare to chase and let go.
Zhu Dan

650
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,040
Hua Hua
Bo Ge, are you excited?

651
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,720
We're going on the Ferris wheel.
Hua Hua

652
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,040
Hua Hua
Because I've never been on one before.

653
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,360
I really want to ride it.
Hua Hua

654
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,000
Really?
Terry

655
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,240
Hua Hua
Yes.

656
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,720
I appreciate you being with me.
Hua Hua

657
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,240
Terry is also a real man.
Zhu Dan

658
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,440
Zhu Dan
For people afraid of heights, this is really

659
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,320
unbearable.
Zhu Dan

660
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,960
Xiao Lu
A terrifying place.

661
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,520
The distance between two people will also get closer.
Xiao Lu

662
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,360
Hua Hua
I'm not afraid. Are you?

663
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,240
Terry
I'm okay.

664
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,360
Hua Hua
I'm a bit scared.

665
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,440
Terry
I'll hold onto this.

666
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,240
Hua Hua
It's okay.

667
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,640
You can lean on my shoulder.
Hua Hua

668
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,880
Terry
I'm trembling right now.

669
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,280
Hua Hua
Will it be transparent here later?

670
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,120
Terry
No.

671
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,440
This feels like dying.
Terry

672
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,560
If this is transparent,
Terry

673
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,120
Terry
No, this better not be transparent.

674
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,240
If this is transparent, I might really 'die'.
Terry

675
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,120
Hua Hua, I think if you overcome this today,

676
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,360
Terry
No.

677
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,280
Terry
My legs are shaking a bit now.

678
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,120
Hua Hua
Don't be afraid.

679
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,240
Bo Ge, I'm here.
Hua Hua

680
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,640
This is okay.
Hua Hua

681
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,000
Terry
Looking at it like this, I feel a bit...

682
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,840
I feel a bit uneasy inside.
Terry

683
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,600
Hua Hua
How can you be so handsome even when you're scared?

684
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,840
Hua Hua
Alright, I'm happy now.

685
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,280
Once happy, then
Hua Hua

686
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,640
Terry
back to normal.

687
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,000
I definitely wouldn't ride this Ferris wheel.
Terry

688
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,680
Terry
Because I'm a bit afraid of heights.

689
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,200
As long as Hua Hua wants to ride,
Terry

690
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,480
Terry
I think I'll overcome it.

691
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,800
my own fear.
Terry

692
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,960
Xiao Lu
He's a bit braver now.

693
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,400
The type who quietly contributes.
Mei Na

694
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
Pang Pang
We embrace back to back.

695
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,280
Pangpang
Come closer to me.

696
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,680
Otherwise, I'll look a bit bored.
Pangpang

697
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,760
Susu
You walk between us two.

698
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,880
Pangpang
It really is.

699
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
Pangpang is lonely.
Yang Gen

700
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,400
Tangtang
It's okay.

701
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,440
One hand for brotherhood, one hand for happiness.
Tangtang

702
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,360
Pangpang
Grab with both hands.

703
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,600
Susu
You've got everything.

704
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,360
Pangpang
Yes.

705
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,960
Susu
Wanting this and that again.

706
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,120
Why don't we take a photo of them?
Tangtang

707
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,720
Pangpang
Let's take it.

708
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,360
Pangpang
Really impressive.

709
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,640
Tangtang
Alright.

710
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,480
Susu
Zoom in.

711
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,680
Although we can't see their faces,
Tangtang

712
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,080
Tangtang
it's still quite special.

713
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,280
Tangtang
They look so happy.

714
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,880
Pangpang
I captured it, their happiness.

715
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,440
Zhu Dan
Such a bitter smile.

716
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,800
You've let it go, haven't you? That phrase.
Jiang Dunhao

717
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,840
Yang Gen
It's a bit painful.

718
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,000
Pangpang, I see them approaching the twelve o'clock position.

719
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,440
Let's go.
Pangpang

720
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,960
Huahua
Are you feeling better now?

721
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,840
Huahua
Just look at the sunset outside.

722
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,280
You can't see anything else.
Huahua

723
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,480
Huahua
Right, look outside.

724
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,240
Huahua
Right?

725
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,840
Just look outside.
Huahua

726
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,600
Huahua
You have no idea

727
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,680
what we're doing right now.
Huahua

728
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,560
Huahua
It's really beautiful.

729
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,720
Then let me take a photo of you.
Terry

730
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,120
Huahua
Is that okay?

731
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Let me try.
Terry

732
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,560
Terry
Don't turn too much to the side.

733
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,000
You're too sideways, come back a bit. Yes.
Terry

734
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,360
It's blocked by this.
Terry

735
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,120
Terry
Turn your face back a little.

736
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,280
Right.
Terry

737
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,280
Zhang Zining
Overcame the fear.

738
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,200
Even helped her take photos.
Zhang Zining

739
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,000
Yang Gen
So sweet.

740
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,560
This girl will be very touched.
Zhang Zining

741
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,280
Isn't this what Huahua really needs?
Zhu Dan

742
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,000
Huahua
Bro, I'll be grateful to you for life.

743
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,160
Always ready when called.
Huahua

744
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,080
Terry
It's nothing.

745
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Huahua
That's enough, bro.

746
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,480
Thank you.
Huahua

747
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,520
Sweet.
Zhang Zining

748
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,080
Huahua
I can't imagine.

749
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,880
We were up so high in the sky.
Huahua

750
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,360
Huahua
taking this photo.

751
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,200
Terry
Help!

752
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,160
Huahua
Next time when someone asks,

753
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
look at yourself,
Huahua

754
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,080
Huahua
you say, 'I'm not afraid.'

755
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,960
Terry
I'm not afraid.

756
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,200
Huahua
Terry has always given me the impression

757
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,760
that he's not a proactive person.
Huahua

758
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,840
Huahua
But I've really seen him take initiative.

759
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,720
Huahua
Willing to become a butterfly with you.

760
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,880
Huahua
'Rain Butterfly'

761
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,800
They're setting off fireworks over there.
Terry

762
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,720
Huahua
Where?

763
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,720
Huahua
Yes.

764
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,840
Terry
Let's buy some fireworks to play with.

765
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,480
Huahua
Sure.

766
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,120
Those are theirs, right?
Huahua

767
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,360
Terry
I'll ask if we can buy some.

768
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,720
Can you sell us some?
Terry

769
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,680
Terry
Can we buy a bundle?

770
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,200
Terry
Is that okay?

771
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,800
Huahua
Is that enough?

772
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,560
Thank you.
Huahua

773
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,040
Terry
Alright, I'll scan your code.

774
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,720
I'll light it for you.
Terry

775
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,520
Huahua
I'm afraid it might spark on you.

776
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,560
Terry
I'll light it for you.

777
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,040
Huahua
You'd better follow me.

778
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,440
Can we do it together?
Huahua

779
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,480
Huahua
Sure.

780
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,320
Come quickly.
Huahua

781
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,760
Huahua
Why weren't we at the top just now?

782
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,800
say Happy New Year.
Huahua

783
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,560
Terry
Right.

784
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,200
Huahua
Wait for yours to light up, then we'll do it together.

785
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,440
Huahua
You need to say Happy New Year.

786
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,320
Ready, begin.
Huahua

787
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,680
Happy New Year!
Together

788
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,840
Terry
Today, I'm setting off fireworks with Huahua.

789
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,600
Actually,
Terry

790
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,680
Terry
Terry wasn't originally in our itinerary.

791
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,200
It's quite a pleasant surprise.
Terry

792
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,680
It's quite blissful.
Terry

793
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,800
Thank you, Brother Bo.
Huahua

794
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,400
Huahua
I'm so happy.

795
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,320
Every time I see
Huahua

796
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,240
Huahua
fireworks blooming in the sky,

797
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,400
I feel very happy.
Huahua

798
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,040
Huahua
When it's my turn,

799
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,600
I feel even happier.
Huahua

800
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,280
Huahua
Moreover,

801
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,960
these fireworks are set off for me by someone.
Huahua

802
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,160
Huahua
Even if it's small,

803
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,120
that moment of light
Huahua

804
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,000
Huahua
is radiating for me.

805
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,280
It belongs to me.
Huahua

806
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,920
Huahua
It's not the lighter that lit the sparkler,

807
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,120
it's him who lit me up.
Huahua

808
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
Huahua has also found her own preference.
Zhang Zining

809
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,880
Lock it down.
Yang Gen

810
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,480
It's over.
Terry

811
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,520
Let's go,
Pangpang

812
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,280
Susu
time to head home.

813
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,360
Where's Su Ziyi?
Tangtang

814
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,280
Susu
Just put it here.

815
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,080
Okay.
Tangtang

816
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,320
This is really boyfriend material overload.
Zhu Dan

817
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,720
Thanks, bro.
Susu

818
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,320
Tangtang
Where's the original video?

819
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,360
Can I see it?
Tangtang

820
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,000
Susu
No.

821
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,600
Tangtang
Let me see.

822
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,400
Tangtang
I should have used my own phone to record.

823
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,560
Then I could watch it myself.
Tangtang

824
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,280
Tangtang
Let me see it quickly.

825
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,280
Susu
No.

826
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,000
Tang Tang.
Take a look.

827
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,360
You're not sending it to me again.
Tang Tang.

828
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,360
Su Su.
No, I'm busy right now.

829
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,000
you go ahead and take care of your own business first.
Su Su.

830
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,120
Su Su.
don't disturb me for now.

831
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,720
Tang Tang.
Okay.

832
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,000
Haven't finished drinking yet.
Tang Tang.

833
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,280
Su Su.
Can't drink anymore, it's too heavy.

834
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,800
Jiang Dunhao.
So natural.

835
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,720
Jiang Dunhao.
Here we go again.

836
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,440
Yang Gen.
Battle song.

837
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,840
Yang Gen.
The battle song begins.

838
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Jiang Dunhao.
Battle song.

839
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,800
Jiang Dunhao.
Let's charge!

840
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,920
Zhang Zining.
So sweet.

841
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,720
Tu Tu.
Actually, I think that today...

842
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,960
That osmanthus cake was quite delicious.
Tu Tu.

843
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,680
It's sweet.
Tu Tu.

844
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,840
Tu Tu.
You like your crispy pork the most, right?

845
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,560
Xiaoling.
Yes.

846
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
Xiaoling.
How did you know?

847
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,800
Tu Tu.
I hope one day Xiaoling...

848
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,080
can...
Tu Tu.

849
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,040
Tu Tu.
with eyes closed...

850
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,600
buy those clay figurines.
Tu Tu.

851
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,520
Xiaoling.

852
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,440
Xin Xin.
I thought you were going to say...

853
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
I hope one day Xiaoling...
Xin Xin.

854
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,520
Xin Xin.
will like me as much as she likes crispy pork.

855
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,680
I was waiting for those words.
Xin Xin.

856
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Xin Xin.
But you didn't say them.

857
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,120
I'm already awake.
Xin Xin.

858
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,280
Xin Xin.
Tu Tu, I've been following you all day, really.

859
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,160
Xinxin is very disappointed with your performance.
Xiaoling.

860
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,720
Tutu.
No, this is a very nice wish.

861
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,840
We need to be a bit more realistic, right, Xiaoling?
Tutu.

862
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,720
Zhu Dan.
Look.

863
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,560
Who wants to be realistic with you?
Xiaolu.

864
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:30,960
Zhu Dan.
Exactly.

865
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Xiaoling.
At that time, I could actually understand.

866
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,200
Maybe he didn't want to pick up on this topic.
Xiaoling.

867
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,240
Xiaoling.
I could feel that he was interested in me.

868
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,600
but if I were to continue taking the initiative,
Xiaoling.

869
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,000
Xiaoling.
I would feel

870
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,840
is it really worth it?
Xiaoling.

871
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,760
Xiaoling.
Because I feel that Tutu

872
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
doesn't seem to be very proactive.
Xiaoling.

873
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,720
Zhang Zining, sister, now that the conversation has come to this point,

874
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,680
Zhang Zining.
he still doesn't pick up on it.

875
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,120
Avoidance.
Xiaolu.

876
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,240
Yang Gen.
What do you think Tutu's current attitude towards Xiaoling is?

877
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,360
What kind of state is he in?
Yang Gen.

878
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,280
Meina, I think he doesn't even know what state he's in himself.

879
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,440
Zhu Dan.
It seems like he doesn't have the heart

880
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,720
to feel this thing.
Zhu Dan.

881
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,920
Wu Zun.
He's like a little kid,

882
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,720
Zhu Dan.
Right.

883
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,200
Zhang Zining.
just feels like he can chat well with you.

884
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,720
Zhu Dan.
Yes, it's fun.

885
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,080
Zhang Zining.
Gets along well.

886
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,880
Zhu Dan.
Just having a great time.

887
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,880
Xiaolu.
Tutu really is

888
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,840
came to Tianjin,
Xiaolu.

889
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,880
Xiaolu.
but didn't learn anything.

890
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,560
Meina.
It's too abstract.

891
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,800
Tutu.
The cat is back.

892
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,360
Mimi is back.
Tutu.

893
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,800
It feels like it's been a long time since I've been back.
Tutu.

894
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,120
Xiaoling.
My room.

895
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,960
Loves to stay.
Xinxin.

896
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,120
Let's go, those with smaller suitcases go down first.
Terry.

897
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Pangpang.
It feels like coming back to the cabin for the first time.

898
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,720
Buddy.
Pangpang.

899
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,760
Let's go.
Huahua.

900
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Huahua.
We're home.

901
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,080
Huahua.
Xiaoling.

902
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,960
Tangtang.
Buddy.

903
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
A bit startled.
Tangtang.

904
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,480
Tutu
He really has that expression.

905
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,680
Xiaoling
Yes.

906
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,719
You should see Harry.
Xiaoling

907
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,320
Xiaoling
But he's already gotten rid of it now.

908
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,560
He still had it (the hairstyle) this afternoon.
Xiaoling

909
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,159
It's too stunning, to be honest.
Harry

910
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,719
Xinxin
I dare not open my eyes.

911
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,440
I hope it's just my imagination.
Xinxin

912
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,560
Tata
I was singing that one.

913
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
So for now,
Tata

914
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,719
Xinxin
so I closed my eyes for now.

915
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,480
Pangpang
Why don't you let me join your group?

916
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,920
Xinxin
No.

917
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,040
If you had that hairstyle,
Xinxin

918
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,159
Xinxin
I might laugh for a year.

919
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,920
You know what?
Xinxin

920
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,159
Xinxin
I would change my profile picture immediately.

921
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,320
Huahua
Why is Tata sitting there today?

922
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,480
What's wrong?
Tata

923
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,360
Huahua
You've taken my seat.

924
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,120
Tata
Come on,

925
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,840
let's switch.
Tata

926
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,280
Terry
Switch.

927
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,280
Xiaoling
Let's quickly look at Harry's hairstyle.

928
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,199
Really?
Harry

929
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,040
I really burst out laughing.
Tata

930
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,320
Tata
Just you mentioning it makes me want to burst out laughing again.

931
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,960
Susu
What is it?

932
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,320
Tata
He's keeping it to come back.

933
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,880
Tata, I probably won't ride in the same car back with him.

934
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,800
Xiaoling
I think if he has that hairstyle,

935
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,160
He should be about the same height as Terry.
Xiaoling

936
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,440
I'm even a bit taller than him.
Harry

937
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,080
Really?
Terry

938
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,760
Really.
Harry

939
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,760
There shouldn't be any suspense about this, right?
Zhu Dan

940
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Jiang Dunhao
Pangpang definitely won't post it.

941
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,120
Pangpang
Why do your eyes look so lifeless?

942
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,720
Tangtang
They're lively.

943
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,080
I call it bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
Tangtang

944
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,920
Pangpang
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

945
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,800
Pangpang

946
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,240
Zhu Dan
i'm always anxious.

947
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,520
worried you might push me away.
Zhu Dan

948
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,440
Zhu Dan
worried you might not like me at all.

949
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,120
but when it comes to feelings, there's no 'should'.
Zhu Dan

950
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,400
Zhu Dan
just go ahead and do it.

951
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,280
Meina
that's nice.

952
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,080
Zhu Dan
you've worked hard, Susu.

953
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,960
this trip,
Zhu Dan

954
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,400
Zhu Dan
you gave me a lot of energy.

955
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,920
turns out being with someone you like
Zhu Dan

956
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,080
Zhu Dan
is this happy.

957
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,560
Jiang Dunhao
it's well written too.

958
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,840
Susu, I was really happy to receive Tang Tang's message.

959
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,560
Susu
it feels like because indeed we,

960
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,200
on the second day in Tianjin, we became much closer.
Susu

961
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,440
Susu
the feelings are heating up.

962
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,960
there are those who started dating back in 1999.
Susu

963
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,920
Susu
what he wrote is also very sincere.

964
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,080
and he also remembered to say,
Susu

965
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,480
Susu
that I like watching the sea.

966
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,240
Susu, I hope we can watch the sea together next time.

967
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,840
Tang Tang
what I want to express is,

968
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,560
Tang Tang, I might have considered face and other factors before,

969
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,280
Tang Tang
but now I'm lowering my stance.

970
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,840
i'm just 'Bajie', and I'm going to pursue you.
Tang Tang

971
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,520
Zhu Dan
how nice.

972
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,480
Tang Tang, what I want to tell her is just this meaning.

973
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,840
Yang Gen
to Tang Tang,

974
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
i'm a juicy little soup dumpling.
Yang Gen

975
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,120
Yang Gen
had a great time in Tianjin.

976
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,680
the photos were taken very satisfactorily.
Yang Gen

977
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,680
Yang Gen
it feels like it's been well documented all along.

978
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,800
that long speech today,
Yang Gen

979
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,520
Yang Gen
made me both surprised and touched.

980
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,400
well said.
Yang Gen

981
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,480
Yang Gen
remember to say something next time you speak.

982
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,600
was originally full of sleepiness,
Yang Gen

983
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,160
Yang Gen
but after listening, my face turned red.

984
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,680
thank you for your blatant honesty.
Yang Gen

985
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,240
Tang Tang
my feeling at that time was really good.

986
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,320
also very happy to be liked so much.
Tang Tang

987
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,560
Su Su.
I sent my text message to Tang Tang.

988
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,680
Why did I send it like that?
Su Su.

989
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,560
Su Su.
It's because of him.

990
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,800
When he took photos of me at the beach on the first day,
Su Su.

991
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,360
Su Su.
then he had one photo,

992
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,960
which was also among those three photos of his,
Su Su.

993
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,480
Su Su.
he said I looked like a steamed bun.

994
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,640
He said my face was very round.
Su Su.

995
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,320
Su Su.
Because I like round faces,

996
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,760
round and quite cute.
Su Su.

997
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,080
Su Su.
It's like my dream is to be one.

998
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,320
Su Su.
Plus, I came across a saying before,

999
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,200
which goes,
Su Su.

1000
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,280
Su Su.
Happiness is a juicy little soup dumpling.

1001
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,240
The feeling is,
Su Su.

1002
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,920
Su Su.
it also applies to how we feel now.

1003
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,640
It's a feeling of being quite happy.
Su Su.

1004
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,160
Su Su.
I also praised him

1005
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,640
for going on stage to perform that crosstalk,
Su Su.

1006
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,720
Su Su.
and then writing lyrics for me.

1007
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,360
And I'm also very grateful for his courage.
Su Su.

1008
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,600
Su Su.
Yes, his initiative.

1009
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,960
Su Su is also very good at encouraging him.
Wu Zun.

1010
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,680
Zhu Dan.
Yes.

1011
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,320
Giving him a response.
Zhu Dan.

1012
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,320
a positive response.
Zhu Dan,

1013
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,440
Zhu Dan,
To Harry,

1014
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,120
These two days have been the best arrangement for everything.
Zhu Dan,

1015
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,520
Zhu Dan,
I've gained a deep understanding.

1016
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,800
It's like how I didn't enter the small house on the first day.
Zhu Dan,

1017
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,720
Zhu Dan,
Everything is happening naturally.

1018
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,160
We drew lots in the same room,
Zhu Dan,

1019
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,280
Zhu Dan,
and we're on the same route.

1020
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,960
It's really amazing,
Zhu Dan,

1021
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,920
Zhu Dan,
such a coincidence.

1022
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,600
Today I experienced many new things.
Zhu Dan,

1023
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,040
Zhu Dan,
I'm very happy.

1024
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,160
Your Ox Demon King hairstyle,
Zhu Dan,

1025
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,640
Zhu Dan,
I'll really laugh about it for a lifetime.

1026
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,080
Harry,
The moment I received her text message,

1027
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,840
I was very happy.
Harry,

1028
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,560
Harry,
Because whether it's going to the museum

1029
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,240
or going to the folk museum,
Harry,

1030
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,480
Harry,
or seeing those little clay figures,

1031
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,240
I feel that where we go isn't very important.
Harry,

1032
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,640
Harry,
But it's about who you go with.

1033
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,480
Harry,
Including riding in the same car with Tata,

1034
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,280
or being in the same group,
Harry,

1035
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,600
everything is the best arrangement.
Harry,

1036
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,600
Tata,
The text message was still sent to Harry.

1037
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,840
because actually,
Tata,

1038
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,320
Tata,
traveling can really reveal

1039
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,720
whether two people are compatible.
Tata,

1040
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,440
Tata,
Then during this trip,

1041
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,240
I also felt that Harry
Tata,

1042
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,040
Tata,
was still very caring towards me in many ways.

1043
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,760
and then plus two days,
Tata,

1044
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,600
Tata,
our travel itinerary

1045
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,520
was also together.
Tata,

1046
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,680
Tata,
So basically for two days,

1047
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,840
it felt like forty-eight hours
Tata,

1048
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,440
Tata,
we were really together all the time.

1049
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,240
we really became closer.
Tata,

1050
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,040
And we also got to know each other better.
Tata,

1051
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,560
Yang Gen,
To Tata,

1052
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,840
our feelings are gradually warming up.
Yang Gen,

1053
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,520
Yang Gen,
I've found that you come to me to talk about everything.

1054
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,200
today, together with everyone,
Yang Gen,

1055
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,520
Yang Gen,
we experienced the local customs of Tianjin.

1056
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,880
Having the chance to spend the whole day with you
Yang Gen,

1057
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,560
Yang Gen,
made us feel

1058
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,320
incomparable joy and satisfaction.
Yang Gen,

1059
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,560
Yang Gen,
Suddenly, a song came to mind:

1060
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,960
Love can overcome long distances.
Yang Gen,

1061
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,640
Yang Gen,
I hope you can be happy every day.

1062
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,880
what's wrong?
Harry,

1063
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,040
Tata,
I don't know, it's nothing.

1064
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,400
Harry,
I know Tata today

1065
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
was especially happy to receive the text message.
Harry,

1066
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,880
Harry,
The first sentence I said began with

1067
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,480
our feelings are warming up,
Harry,

1068
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,320
Harry,
and it's a very noticeable warming up.

1069
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,840
Whether she's becoming more dependent on me,
Harry,

1070
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,320
Harry,
or just needs me more,

1071
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,240
or comes to find me,
Harry,

1072
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,280
Harry,
anyway, we'll need each other more.

1073
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,040
So I think
Harry,

1074
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,640
Harry,
the extent, the degree of this warming up

1075
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,520
is also very stable.
Harry,

1076
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,920
Tata,
It was also mentioned in the text message tonight.

1077
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,080
he said he felt he was needed.
Tata,

1078
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,840
Tata,
Actually, he complained about this today.

1079
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,240
He said I give him all kinds of trash
Tata,

1080
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,560
to hold?
Harry,

1081
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,280
Let it go.
Tata,

1082
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,080
Am I your 'slave'?
Harry.

1083
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,200
These things between couples.
Yang Gen.

1084
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,160
Tata.
You're so annoying.

1085
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,200
Yang Gen.
Flirting tactics.

1086
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,720
I.
Harry.

1087
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,880
Harry.
Why?

1088
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,560
Tata.
I asked you to get something.

1089
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,800
You said you were my 'slave'.
Tata.

1090
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,080
Harry.
I said from today onwards,

1091
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,160
you give me everything,
Harry.

1092
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,400
Harry.
whether it's useful or not.

1093
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,000
You give it all to me.
Harry.

1094
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,960
Tata.
I won't give it to you anymore.

1095
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,480
Give it.
Harry.

1096
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,320
Tata.
Not giving it anymore.

1097
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:52,600
Give it.
Harry.

1098
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,240
I gave it to Terry.
Tata.

1099
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,480
Harry.
You go give it.

1100
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,600
Give it.
Harry.

1101
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,400
Give it.
Harry.

1102
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,080
Tata.
I was really upset at that time.

1103
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,280
What's wrong?
Tata.

1104
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,440
Tata.
Couldn't he help me throw it away?

1105
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,040
I was a bit angry at that time,
Tata.

1106
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,680
Tata.
but tonight he said in a text message,

1107
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,360
it feels like being needed.
Tata.

1108
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,000
Tata.
He really is a,

1109
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,560
very hypocritical man.
Tata.

1110
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,800
Tata.
These very detailed things,

1111
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,080
I feel very happy.
Tata.

1112
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,000
Tata.
It feels like he really cares about my feelings.

1113
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,840
Chatting with me offline,
Tata.

1114
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,600
Tata.
I feel he is quite mature and steady.

1115
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,760
And then in the text message,
Tata.

1116
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,960
Tata.
he talked about some of his inner thoughts,

1117
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,720
some things he doesn't dare to express.
Tata.

1118
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,520
Tata.
I feel he,

1119
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,560
is still a child at heart.
Tata.

1120
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,320
Harry.
You said I wrote a lot?

1121
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,240
Actually, it's not long.
Harry.

1122
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,280
Tata.
Well written.

1123
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,640
Written with care.
Tata.

1124
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,840
Tata.
Written to make me happy.

1125
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,880
Yang Gen
To Xiaoling

1126
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
Your hair looks so cute today.
Yang Gen

1127
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,920
Yang Gen
Today's interaction mode

1128
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,440
is just like elementary and middle school students,
Yang Gen

1129
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,160
Yang Gen
with that kind of playful teasing between classmates.

1130
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,920
It's very relaxing
Yang Gen

1131
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,880
Yang Gen
and comfortable.

1132
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,000
It makes me feel like I'm back in school for a moment.
Yang Gen

1133
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,600
Yang Gen
This trip has been very enjoyable.

1134
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,120
Okay.
Yang Gen

1135
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,920
Tutu
When I sent the heartfelt message tonight,

1136
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,200
I wrote a phrase in Tianjin dialect,
Tutu

1137
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,600
Tutu
complimenting her on being really cute.

1138
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,760
Then I kept waiting for her reaction,
Tutu

1139
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,440
Tutu
just waiting for that message to pop up.

1140
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,080
Sure enough, when she saw that message,
Tutu

1141
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,040
Tutu
we looked at each other and smiled.

1142
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,280
We even laughed out loud at that moment.
Tutu

1143
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
It's a very good way of interacting.
Tutu

1144
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,320
Xiaoling
Today I received a heartfelt message

1145
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,240
from Tutu.
Xiaoling

1146
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,800
Xiaoling
The content he sent me was,

1147
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,200
'Had a great time together today.'
Xiaoling

1148
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,640
Xiaoling: Maybe when I'm interacting with him,

1149
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,320
Xiaoling
because when I'm interacting with him,

1150
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,240
there might be some new things,
Xiaoling

1151
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,680
Xiaoling
so I also bring out

1152
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,440
more of my own personality.
Xiaoling

1153
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,000
Xiaoling
He said,

1154
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,840
'Today, our interaction was especially like
Xiaoling

1155
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,080
Xiaoling
elementary and middle school students,

1156
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,120
with that kind of atmosphere from before.
Xiaoling

1157
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,600
Xiaoling
Just playful teasing and having a lot of fun.'

1158
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,360
Very relaxed and enjoyable.
Xiaoling

1159
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,760
Xiaoling
I actually feel the same way.

1160
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,240
Because normally I probably wouldn't say,
Xiaoling

1161
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,920
Xiaoling
pointing to a place and saying,

1162
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,160
'Go imitate his actions.'
Xiaoling

1163
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,680
Xiaoling
This kind of behavior wouldn't happen.

1164
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,680
Then he said this trip felt especially good.
Xiaoling

1165
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,600
Yang Gen
To Tutu

1166
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,800
Had a lot of fun today.
Yang Gen

1167
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,640
Yang Gen
It feels like time flew by.

1168
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,280
The two-day trip has come to an end.
Yang Gen

1169
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,160
Yang Gen
We talked a lot,

1170
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,240
and played a lot.
Yang Gen

1171
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,800
Yang Gen
The first thing we did when we got back to the cabin

1172
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,000
was actually playing ball.
Yang Gen

1173
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,920
Yang Gen
But I won, haha!

1174
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,200
Your ball skills need improvement.
Yang Gen

1175
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,120
Xiaoling
After returning to the cabin,

1176
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,240
the first thing we did was play ball.
Xiaoling

1177
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,280
Xiaoling
But he lost to me.

1178
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,000
I can't believe I lost.
Tutu

1179
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,120
Xiaoling
I had never been able to beat him before,

1180
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,240
but this time I won.
Xiaoling

1181
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:02,840
Zhu Dan
To Huahua,

1182
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,560
Was your first time on the Ferris wheel enjoyable?
Zhu Dan

1183
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,120
Zhu Dan
I guess it must have been very exciting.

1184
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,200
There were even fireworks.
Zhu Dan

1185
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,000
Zhu Dan
The Tianjin trip was perfect.

1186
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,400
Huahua
It's Terry.

1187
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,240
Huahua
Asked in a smug way,

1188
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,920
How was it?
Huahua

1189
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,200
Huahua
The Ferris wheel and fireworks must have been romantic, right?

1190
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,000
Indeed, they were.
Huahua

1191
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,400
Terry
Terry: Today I sent my heartfelt message to Huahua.

1192
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,520
Then I expressed
Terry

1193
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,920
Terry
about our two-day, one-night trip to Tianjin.

1194
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
The Ferris wheel and fireworks,
Terry

1195
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,800
Terry
I really think

1196
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,280
Terry
setting them off together, riding together,

1197
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,080
was very enjoyable.
Terry

1198
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,920
Terry
I feel that our relationship

1199
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,800
is getting better and better.
Terry

1200
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,880
Received another one.
Yang Gen

1201
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,600
From Pangpang?
Zhu Dan

1202
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,240
Zhang Zining
We should probably sort them out now.

1203
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,040
Zhu Dan, these two days have been like a fresh start, right?

1204
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
Zhu Dan, today we even learned each other's ages.

1205
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,240
Zhu Dan
Traveling indeed helps to foster relationships.

1206
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,440
It allows us to understand each other better.
Zhu Dan

1207
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,240
Zhu Dan
After being here for so many days,

1208
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,400
I didn't expect this to be the first time
Zhu Dan

1209
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,160
we've formally gone out together.
Zhu Dan

1210
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,960
Zhu Dan, it has made me see our relationship more clearly.

1211
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,920
Zhu Dan, I think you're an excellent girl,

1212
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,680
Zhu Dan
with a cheerful personality.

1213
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,800
You can get along happily with everyone
Zhu Dan

1214
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
Zhu Dan
and are considerate of everyone's feelings.

1215
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,040
Huahua
There's another message from Pangpang.

1216
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,240
He was very heartfelt.
Huahua

1217
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,520
Huahua
He said it helped me see more clearly

1218
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,760
and understand the relationship between us.
Huahua

1219
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,160
Huahua
I think he probably

1220
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,160
realized that we might
Huahua

1221
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,480
Huahua
both

1222
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,560
be better off as friends.
Huahua

1223
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Let it go.
Zhang Zining.

1224
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,280
Xiaolu.
Make a graceful exit.

1225
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:35,600
Wu Zun.
Yes.

1226
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,360
This is the right thing to do.
Wu Zun.

1227
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:38,960
Pangpang,
I said,

1228
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,600
after our communication and understanding over the past two days,
Pangpang,

1229
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,880
Pangpang,
I have confirmed our relationship.

1230
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,600
because I took them to the Ferris wheel today,
Pangpang,

1231
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,600
Pangpang,
including when they came back after the Ferris wheel ride,

1232
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,720
I didn't communicate with her at all.
Pangpang,

1233
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,760
Pangpang,
She and Terry have already had

1234
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,880
a warming of temperature.
Pangpang,

1235
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,800
Pangpang,
She knows

1236
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,280
I'm talking about our friendship.
Pangpang,

1237
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,080
Xiaolu,
Okay.

1238
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,280
it can still be romantic.
Xiaolu,

1239
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,280
super romantic.
Zhu Dan,

1240
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,600
Huahua,
Today's heartfelt message is undoubtedly

1241
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,320
definitely from Terry.
Huahua,

1242
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,720
Huahua,
Terry has been by my side all day.

1243
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,600
including when I mentioned that fireworks display,
Huahua,

1244
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,320
Huahua,
and the Ferris wheel in the letter,

1245
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,720
he was there for all of it.
Huahua,

1246
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,320
Huahua,
Before, I might have felt about Terry

1247
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,600
that he was
Huahua,

1248
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,800
Huahua,
in an equal relationship,

1249
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,320
I might have had a little bit of fondness,
Huahua,

1250
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,600
Huahua,
but it couldn't rise to the level of being smitten.

1251
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,960
but these two days, I feel that maybe
Huahua,

1252
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,160
Huahua
Terry's initiative

1253
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,680
makes me feel like I can have that heart-fluttering feeling.

1254
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,080
Huahua,
Because I've never ridden it before,

1255
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,560
I really wanted to ride it.
Huahua,

1256
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,080
really?
Terry,

1257
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,720
Huahua,
Yes, I'm grateful for your company.

1258
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,160
Huahua,
Bo, I'll be grateful to you for a lifetime.

1259
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,480
always there when called.
Huahua,

1260
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,280
Happy New Year.
Together,

1261
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,040
Huahua,
At the moment when the fireworks were lit,

1262
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,760
it must have ignited my
Huahua,

1263
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,680
Huahua,
I really saw his initiative.

1264
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,960
it overturned my previous statements.
Huahua,

1265
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,960
Huahua, I think he actually has a good sense of ceremony.

1266
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,720
Tutu
I think currently my sibling

1267
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,440
should be more interested in Terry.
Tutu

1268
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,440
Tutu,
Because from her daily words and actions,

1269
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,040
she just cares more about Terry.
Tutu,

1270
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,280
Xinxin,
My siblings didn't receive the heartfelt message.

1271
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,640
but as for Pangpang,
Xinxin,

1272
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,840
Xinxin,
I think he's made a significant breakthrough.

1273
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,520
because he's been working hard
Xinxin,

1274
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,120
Xinxin,
to pursue his own feelings.

1275
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:00,960
in my eyes,
Xinxin,

1276
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,920
Xinxin,
he's still quite rational about relationships.

1277
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,080
there aren't so many moments of hesitation.
Xinxin,

1278
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,360
Xinxin,
And I think he's always been

1279
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,800
quite able to take things in stride.
Xinxin,

1280
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,840
Pangpang,
Pangpang, I think Xinxin might have let loose today.

1281
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,800
she's in a good mood.
Pangpang,

1282
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,920
So Xinxin won't
Pangpang,

1283
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,200
Pangpang,
cast that shadow of zero votes on herself anymore.

1284
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,840
Pangpang,
you were able to go up and speak today.

1285
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,320
I think it's already exceeded my expectations of you.

1286
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:27,960
Huahua,
Really.

1287
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,400
you were shining in that moment.
Huahua,

1288
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,080
Xiaoling,
The shy little boy went on stage.

1289
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,080
who did you go on stage for?
Xiaoling,

1290
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,040
Yang Gen,
Actually, if you look at this episode of ours,

1291
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,000
after experiencing a two-day-and-one-night trip,
Yang Gen,

1292
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,720
Zhu Dan,
the love triangle

1293
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,760
has finally returned to a normal two-person relationship.
Zhu Dan,

1294
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,480
I see.
Xiaolu,

1295
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,440
Yang Gen,
It's back to a normal two-person relationship.

1296
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,520
Zhu Dan,
yes, it's back to normal.

1297
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,200
it shows that traveling is really
Yang Gen,

1298
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,280
Yang Gen,
a way to promote the development of relationships.

1299
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,800
Yang Gen,
have you ever had any interesting experiences

1300
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,520
while traveling
Yang Gen,

1301
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,240
Yang Gen,
with your partner before?

1302
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,600
can you share with us?
Yang Gen,

1303
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,720
Xiaolu,
I had one

1304
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,280
interesting travel experience.
Xiaolu,

1305
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,520
Xiaolu,
We were in Harbin,

1306
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,600
and we casually hailed a taxi.
Xiaolu,

1307
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,880
Xiaolu,
On our way back to the hotel,

1308
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,360
my husband and I got off to buy a bottle of water.

1309
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,120
Xiaolu,
When we came out of the small store,

1310
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,280
the taxi had left.
Xiaolu,

1311
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,360
Xiaolu,
Then we suddenly realized

1312
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,200
it didn't matter that the taxi had left,
Xiaolu,

1313
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,040
but I had left my phone in the taxi for navigation.

1314
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,760
Xiaolu.
Then we immediately called the police.

1315
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,720
Three days later,
Xiaolu.

1316
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,040
Xiaolu.
the police called me.

1317
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:20,880
and asked me,
Xiaolu.

1318
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,640
Xiaolu.
'What does your phone case look like?'

1319
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,400
Then I said,
Xiaolu.

1320
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,000
Xiaolu.
He said, 'Is it the hope of the village?'

1321
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,080
I said, 'Yes.'
Xiaolu.

1322
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,320
Xiaolu.
Then he said,

1323
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,600
I've never seen such efficient police.
Xiaolu.

1324
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,840
Xiaolu.
Who usually helps you with this kind of thing?

1325
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,000
Later, Xiaolu and I made a banner together.
Xiaolu.

1326
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,760
Xiaolu.
Yes, we sent it there.

1327
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,240
Then we took a lot of photos.
Xiaolu.

1328
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,600
Great.
Zhu Dan.

1329
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,760
Jiang Dunhao.
Once, with my management team,

1330
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,640
we went back to Xinjiang for a trip.
Jiang Dunhao.

1331
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,640
Jiang Dunhao.
As soon as my plane landed,

1332
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,360
our manager's appendicitis acted up.
Jiang Dunhao.

1333
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,040
Jiang Dunhao.
In the end, his appendix

1334
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,160
was forever left in my hometown.
Jiang Dunhao.

1335
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,920
Jiang Dunhao.
Then he was lying alone in the hospital.

1336
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,120
I continued to go out with the remaining colleagues.

1337
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,720
Jiang Dunhao said my plan couldn't change.
Xiaolu.

1338
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,040
Jiang Dunhao.
Yes.

1339
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,400
Because before traveling,
Jiang Dunhao.

1340
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,800
Jiang Dunhao.
I am the one who must do thorough planning.

1341
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,760
Yang Gen.
You are a J (Judging) person.

1342
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,880
I am very J (Judging).
Jiang Dunhao.

1343
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,400
Even when I go out with friends, I

1344
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,800
Jiang Dunhao.
must be the one to buy tickets.

1345
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,800
I book the hotels.
Jiang Dunhao.

1346
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,760
Meina.
Really.

1347
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,920
Jiang Dunhao.
Where to go and what to do.

1348
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,480
I have to make spreadsheets.
Jiang Dunhao.

1349
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,840
Meina.
I really like people like you.

1350
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,880
Becoming friends.
Meina.

1351
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,720
Jiang Dunhao.
After making the spreadsheets, that's it.

1352
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,760
I will also convert it into a document and send it to the group.

1353
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,560
Zhu Dan.
I like it too.

1354
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,360
Wu Zun.
I am like this too.

1355
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,720
I will also beautify the poster.
Wu Zun.

1356
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
Yang Gen.
It's really fortunate to be friends with you.

1357
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,840
Jiang Dunhao.
But now around me,

1358
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,960
there are more and more P (Perceiving) friends.
Jiang Dunhao.

1359
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,240
Jiang Dunhao.
I am starting to slack off a bit now.

1360
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,160
I can't control them.
Xiaolu.

1361
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,000
Jiang Dunhao.
Yes.

1362
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,480
Wu Zun,
What impressed me the most is,

1363
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,880
I went to Taiwan, China at that time,
Wu Zun,

1364
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,280
Wu Zun,
to watch a movie with my girlfriend.

1365
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,120
Then when we came out of the cinema,
Wu Zun,

1366
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,600
Wu Zun,
and then, um,

1367
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,280
the producer told me,
Wu Zun,

1368
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,840
we have a TV series,
Wu Zun,

1369
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,720
Wu Zun,
are you interested in trying it out?

1370
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,400
Because this kind of thing,
Wu Zun,

1371
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,480
Wu Zun,
I had never been involved in before,

1372
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,320
I was very scared and didn't dare to go for it.
Wu Zun,

1373
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,240
Wu Zun,
Then my girlfriend at that time,

1374
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,040
who is now my wife,
Wu Zun,

1375
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,240
Wu Zun,
she said, 'You should give it a try.'

1376
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:55,880
Yes,
Wu Zun,

1377
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,280
Wu Zun,
and really because of this,

1378
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,600
I became an artist today.
Wu Zun,

1379
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,800
She is both my love and my benefactor.
Meina,

1380
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,520
Wu Zun,

1381
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,400
Zhu Dan,
If she wasn't by my side,

1382
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:03,840
it probably wouldn't have happened.
Zhu Dan,
If she wasn't by my side,

1383
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,520
It definitely wouldn't have happened.
Wu Zun,

1384
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,320
Xiaolu,
You might say,

1385
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:05,760
liar.
Xiaolu,
You might say,

1386
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,960
Wu Zun,
It's because she encouraged me.

1387
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Yes,
Wu Zun,

1388
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:08,600
You see,

1389
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,200
Yang Gen,
actually, during travel,

1390
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,040
many interesting things can happen,

1391
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,480
especially,
Yang Gen,

1392
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,080
for couples who have just entered a close relationship,

1393
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,720
Yang Gen,
there might be a great opportunity,

1394
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,800
to examine each other.
Yang Gen,

1395
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,200
Yang Gen,
Of course,

1396
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,160
this is just the beginning of their love.
Yang Gen,

1397
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,760
Yang Gen,
There will be many things in the future,

1398
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,560
that they need to face.
Yang Gen,

1399
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,400
Zhang Zining,
Yes,

1400
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,440
Yang Gen,
In the next episode,

1401
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,440
we will welcome,
Yang Gen,

1402
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,560
Yang Gen,
the heartfelt party for boys and girls.

1403
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,120
Can they withstand,
Yang Gen,

1404
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,640
Yang Gen,
the sharp questions from the siblings of their crushes?

1405
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,560
Let's look forward to next week's show together.
Yang Gen,

1406
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,280
Yang Gen,
Let's join together,

1407
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,160
'Love Siblings'
Yang Gen,

1408
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,360
let love double.
together,

1409
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,440
Bye-bye.
Wu Zun,

1410
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,720
What task?

1411
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,680
The confession is coming,

1412
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,840
for boys and girls,

1413
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,560
we have prepared different heartfelt parties.

1414
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,280
let's go swimming.

1415
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,240
soak in this.

1416
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,400
do you accept siblings?

1417
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,840
the opposite sex you're currently seeing,

1418
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,560
I don't accept it.

1419
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,720
I even feel a bit unworthy.

1420
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,960
Does Xiaoling know?

1421
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,360
Is she your second choice for a date?

1422
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,440
so,

1423
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,040
is he,

1424
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:06,880
was he eliminated by you,

1425
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,760
so he came to me?

1426
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,640
okay, stop talking.

1427
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,160
the opposite sex you're currently seeing,

1428
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:10,920
did they break,

1429
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,880
your previous ideal type?

1430
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,240
who in the house was once,

1431
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,240
your competitor?

1432
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,640
the person you're currently seeing,

1433
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,800
is it because you genuinely like them,

1434
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,040
or just want a partner?

1435
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,400
so scary.

1436
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,400
what,

1437
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,080
are you not satisfied with this result now?

1438
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,920
I think I said something wrong.

1439
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,720
so sharp.
