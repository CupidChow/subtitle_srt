1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
Let's have some wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

5
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It's like drinking wild wine

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,720
Weibo. Participant #Love and Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game You'll get a surprise benefit.

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,080
Weibo. Take part in #Love siblings and friends observation room #Interaction You might be the next one to be flipped.

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,760
Because...

10
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,240
I'm not sure

11
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,120
if you will...

12
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,840
I don't know other words.

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,360
I'm not sure

14
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,120
if you like me too.

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,720
Did they come directly?

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,800
I'll use this word.

17
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,479
This word may be a bit heavy.

18
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,880
But I'm sure of one thing now.

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,600
that you're also interested in me.

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,080
So I might try to

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,840
to send you more.

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,200
They're using expressions now.

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,640
I haven't used it before.

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,600
Yes.

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:01,720
Okay.

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,600
As long as you're not unhappy.

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,440
Maybe

28
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,560
a sensitive girl.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,000
No.

30
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,680
Anything else?

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,560
Nothing.

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
I'll sit with you.

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
I'm fine with anything.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,079
Their relationship

35
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,680
all the people here.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,960
Keep smiling.

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,920
So tired.

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,200
I can only be your cousin.

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,920
Anyway,

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
let's talk alone.

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,200
It's about the feelings.

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,079
Text?

43
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,840
Then you must follow your heart.

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,320
right?

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,800
Let me ask you.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,640
Don't tell me you won't contact anyone

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,960
after sending this message?

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,800
I will also contact others.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
This rule has a reasonable existence.

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
It exists here.

51
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,040
And this thing

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,960
is not a confession text.

53
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,240
It's just a token of appreciation.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,720
Right?

55
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,000
It doesn't mean

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,120
she doesn't like you.

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,520
Yes.

58
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
She didn't send it to me.

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,960
but it doesn't mean she doesn't like me.

60
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,800
There's a matter of which is more important.

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,200
Fine.

62
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,880
Since I know I'm light,

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,720
I don't have to

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,800
force others.

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,520
I think it makes sense.

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,560
And I personally think

67
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,760
I'm already

68
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,960
the one who takes the initiative.

69
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,600
So I think

70
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,320
you need to understand this fact.

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,440
Do you understand?

72
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,840
Or are you also confused?

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,160
If she really has no feelings for you,

74
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
she won't talk to you.

75
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,520
Whether you're in a good mood or not,

76
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,760
why did she ask me

77
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,160
to tell you this,

78
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,960
right?

79
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,040
Yes.

80
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,160
When she texted me this text,

81
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,120
she didn't know this would happen today.

82
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
But in that environment,

83
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,640
Do you know that feeling?

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,040
That environment.

85
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,480
So don't think about it.

86
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,600
So you think

87
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,200
I'm chatting with you?

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,680
Am I struggling?

89
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,720
I can tell you directly.

90
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,920
I'm not struggling.

91
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,079
I already have a choice.

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,600
I don't understand.

93
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
Fatty has to make a decision.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,480
Maybe she really likes Terri.

95
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
In my knowledge,

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
I think she has made her choice today.

97
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,600
But to be honest,

98
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,040
I feel

99
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,160
I don't dare to contact Xiaoling.

100
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,480
I'm so scared.

101
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,800
Their family is amazing.

102
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,280
That's the feeling.

103
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm a postgraduate.

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,280
And my mom is like that, right?

105
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,360
That's why I'm shaken.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,640
You don't have to.

107
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,360
I think

108
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,440
to be swayed.

109
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,320
Love is love

110
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,160
Let's go.

111
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,200
I told you.

112
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,920
I'm paying you back.

113
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,839
The return is the return.

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,920
You can't give up just because there's a reward.

115
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,200
Just love boldly.

116
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,720
the closer the heart is to each other?

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,040
I can understand

118
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,280
how Fatty feels.

119
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,600
Because he was like me for a while.

120
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,400
No, she just

121
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,720
for me.

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,760
He was afraid

123
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,240
he didn't dare to face

124
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
the deepest voice in his heart.

125
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,840
If this really happened,

126
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,200
if she really doesn't like me,

127
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,600
I might not be able to accept it at that moment.

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
He doesn't want to be the passive.

129
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,480
Yes.

130
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
So he has to put it in front.

131
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,920
give himself a psychological hint first.

132
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,360
It's okay.

133
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,200
She just doesn't like me.

134
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
Just accept it.

135
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,840
In psychology,

136
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
in psychology.

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
Through a series of predictions,

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,720
For example, this person doesn't take my side.

139
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,520
So my reaction to her

140
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,680
very negative.

141
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,800
To make her true to me.

142
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Indeed. Look how she treats me.

143
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
to prove

144
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,960
your previous conclusion.

145
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,320
Yes.

146
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,760
Why do I have different opinions?

147
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,840
I think Fatty

148
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
is very proud.

149
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,160
He wants...

150
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,480
I agree.

151
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,120
He really

152
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,760
between him and Hua.

153
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,600
he is obviously the chosen one.

154
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,720
It seems Hua has given up on him.

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,320
So now,

156
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,400
at this subtle moment,

157
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
you must have the right to choose.

158
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
Yes.

159
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,680
If it goes on,

160
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,320
if the total amount

161
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,120
If it's what he's afraid of,

162
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
he's the one who got dumped.

163
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,360
That's why he can't let this happen.

164
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,560
He's fighting right now.

165
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,120
Yes.

166
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,800
I have to

167
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,560
as a man.

168
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,200
I think it's more like this.

169
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,240
Look at the original family.

170
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,880
are really different.

171
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
When you are in love,

172
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
you will be affected

173
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,159
their original family?

174
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,320
I care about

175
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,120
Because the person I love...

176
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
I chose that person and wanted him to be independent.

177
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,320
But if this family

178
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,800
is entangled with him,

179
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,840
and deeply.

180
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,960
into his bones and blood,

181
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,200
I would feel that

182
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,240
I don't have the ability to peel him out.

183
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
But if his family was there,

184
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,440
he grew up

185
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,280
in the mud.

186
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,520
He exists there as an independent person.

187
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,200
I admire him.

188
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Because I think

189
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,240
he can understand

190
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,680
to cut ties with his original family.

191
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,880
So I care more about this.

192
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,400
Yes.

193
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,520
I don't think it has much to do with the original family.

194
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,880
and resonance.

195
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,560
The person I love

196
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
has the quality I think is beautiful.

197
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,920
I'm sure she can't leave her family.

198
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,960
So I think you can face

199
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
you can face it later.

200
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,040
Yes.

201
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,960
But I think

202
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,400
sometimes their Moments

203
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,360
I think we should pay attention

204
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,920
how he treats friends.

205
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,840
Yes, this is very important.

206
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,920
If all his friends are very spectacular,

207
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,400
his parents love each other,

208
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,880
Then he might become a flower too.

209
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,680
Yes.

210
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
I like to mediate for others.

211
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,920
to mediate for others.

212
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,320
When I was in college,

213
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,880
My roommate

214
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
She happened to be the boy.

215
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,240
She thought it was great.

216
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,560
Then one day,

217
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,960
I saw her boyfriend just now.

218
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,040
and friends around him

219
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,560
They look very naughty.

220
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,640
I thought

221
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
something was wrong.

222
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,240
So what happened in the end?

223
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,600
I persuaded her to leave and broke up.

224
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,560
And coincidentally, after persuading her to break up,

225
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,520
I found this man

226
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,440
flirting with another girl again.

227
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,520
Because I can't stand it.

228
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,480
My friends will get hurt because of love.

229
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,240
No matter what,

230
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,320
I will persuade her to break up.

231
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,920
You're the love judge.

232
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,120
The guardian of love.

233
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,200
I may not care about my family structure,

234
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,640
whether I'm single

235
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,360
or her family background.

236
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,200
What I care more

237
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
whether they communicate rationally

238
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,200
whether they can express their feelings freely.

239
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
I think it's quite important.

240
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,360
Don't suppress his emotions

241
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,560
and the child who grew up.

242
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,400
he might not feel secure

243
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
or expressiveness.

244
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,600
So in love,

245
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,040
in love.

246
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,760
For example,

247
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,000
being too spoiled by his parents.

248
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,600
He may be a little mama.

249
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,720
So I will still

250
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,159
their way of communication.

251
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
I think good original families

252
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,840
will give a person a lot of points.

253
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,400
You see

254
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,840
with a good family atmosphere.

255
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,320
You want to fit in.

256
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,760
But no matter how much you love someone,

257
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,080
when you see a family

258
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
a terrible family,

259
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,160
you do doubt

260
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,200
if it's possible

261
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,320
that I haven't seen yet

262
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,080
that I haven't seen yet.

263
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,560
I heard a friend of mine

264
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,400
told me something.

265
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,360
Good original family attracts people.

266
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
a good interpretation.

267
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,200
A friend

268
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,280
went to his boyfriend's house for the first time.

269
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,360
He and his boyfriend's family

270
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,320
with his family.

271
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,160
and make fun of each other.

272
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,920
My friend said

273
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,840
the lower his head

274
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,360
the lower his head is.

275
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,200
Because his tears keep flowing.

276
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,240
He said it was the first time

277
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,640
that a family

278
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,679
can get along in this atmosphere.

279
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,960
Because his original family

280
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,120
was a little broken.

281
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,760
His father doesn't go home all year long.

282
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,040
His mother is very strict.

283
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,760
She has high requirements

284
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,240
for him and his sister.

285
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,280
So at the dinner table,

286
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,640
they're either discussing

287
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,160
about what you didn't do well.

288
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,880
Then he said,

289
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,960
it was the first time he realized

290
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,680
he wanted to join this family.

291
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,280
So he was also

292
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
by his original family

293
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,640
and concepts.

294
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,480
Yes.

295
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,800
In psychology, they often say

296
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,640
parents are the primary imitation of children.

297
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,440
Parents communicate with others

298
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,040
and how to deal with emotions.

299
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,840
will be subconsciously

300
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,040
in his subconscious.

301
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,600
If it's a good mode,

302
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,400
he'll feel secure

303
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,880
he will feel safe.

304
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,800
He knows how to communicate with others.

305
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,400
He's good at expressing himself.

306
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,120
If it's bad,

307
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,600
there will be various marks.

308
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,360
Yes.

309
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,480
In fact, the safety type

310
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,840
he's more eager to find

311
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,160
a good communication model.

312
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,520
He's a kid without emotional attachment.

313
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,320
Because he lacked love when he was young.

314
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
he wanted more tolerance.

315
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,240
to see what he needs and give him love.

316
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,960
such a partner.

317
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,240
It's kind of complementary.

318
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,600
Yes.

319
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,480
07:10.

320
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Susu.

321
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,840
She's washing up.

322
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,280
She's still upset.

323
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,640
About the text.

324
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,880
I heard you were angry.

325
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,560
No.

326
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,720
Why would I be angry?

327
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,920
I heard you're angry.

328
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
I'm going to cook.

329
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's talk after cooking.

330
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,040
Put on makeup first.

331
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,920
He's so prepared.

332
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,640
Yes.

333
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,320
And quick response.

334
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,000
Girls should do this.

335
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
Yes, you should.

336
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,680
Just do it.

337
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,560
Apologize.

338
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,120
I have nothing to say.

339
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,840
I plan to cook her a meal

340
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,320
and feed her well.

341
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,800
Only when she's full can she talk to me

342
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,160
At least you don't get up

343
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,880
to communicate.

344
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,240
What are you doing?

345
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,520
Done

346
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,000
What should I make

347
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,320
I'll make a wonton.

348
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,960
Today

349
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,240
Are you going to cook flowers for us?

350
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,520
Yes.

351
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,720
Cook one for Ms. Hua.

352
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,480
I watch her cook every day.

353
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,600
It's so hard, flowers.

354
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,040
Our flowers are so good.

355
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,360
Make one for the map.

356
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,520
Okay.

357
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,280
Good people should be all-round.

358
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,680
Who is like me?

359
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,080
Not really.

360
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,800
Good morning.

361
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,000
Someone is making breakfast for you. Flowers.

362
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,920
Really?

363
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,200
Great

364
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,280
This is obvious.

365
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,320
And it's the way Hua wants.

366
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,080
Do you want to put that?

367
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,600
Sure.

368
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,760
Try the original flavor.

369
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,080
He made wontons this morning.

370
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,680
Very light.

371
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,480
It suits his taste.

372
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,800
So I think

373
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,280
he's trying to give me a good impression.

374
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,800
Favorite? Favorite? Favorite?

375
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,440
Look, biased.

376
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,840
Here you are.

377
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,800
I took it myself.

378
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,720
He didn't give it to me.

379
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
In fact, he gave it to you in his heart.

380
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,320
You're chosen.

381
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,720
He wants to give it to you.

382
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,040
Thank you.

383
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,280
You're good at talking.

384
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,200
Sit next to me.

385
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,320
What's this

386
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,160
Kimchi fried rice

387
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,000
It's for my sister.

388
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,040
Sister Ou did it.

389
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,400
It's not a tower.

390
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,280
Yes.

391
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,360
It's not for him anyway.

392
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,680
It's not for you.

393
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,040
Yours is over there.

394
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,920
I'm sorry.

395
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,960
I knew it.

396
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,240
To be honest, the soup

397
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm a bit arrogant.

398
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,160
To be honest,

399
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,760
You're right.

400
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,400
I thought there was me.

401
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,640
I shouldn't have said anything

402
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,800
and let you eat again.

403
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,040
That's too dangerous.

404
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,640
So scary.

405
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,400
You dig a hole for me every day.

406
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,640
The soup almost

407
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,960
ate yours again.

408
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,680
I stopped him.

409
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,320
Hello.

410
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,080
Come and eat.

411
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Eun-jo.

412
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,640
I can't call her by her name anymore.

413
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,720
I think she's older than me.

414
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,560
Come on.

415
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,520
Mi.

416
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,800
What are you doing, Su Zihao?

417
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,520
Do you know my name?

418
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,320
What's my name?

419
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,960
I know.

420
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,560
I don't know either.

421
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,440
Get lost!

422
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,080
Get out!

423
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,920
Okay.

424
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,880
Rolyn.

425
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,400
Who asked you?

426
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,120
My name is Lo Ling Kai.

427
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,440
I'm also Louis.

428
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,240
You still want to be her brother?

429
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,840
Are you done?

430
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,280
Let's go.

431
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,400
Where are we going?

432
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,320
Go upstairs with me.

433
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,720
Just...

434
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,200
What?

435
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,280
Nothing.

436
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,840
Say it.

437
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,600
Let me hear it.

438
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,840
Don't...

439
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,200
You're making me nervous.

440
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,400
Don't be nervous.

441
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,160
Nervous.

442
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,560
Really nothing happened

443
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,720
Nothing happened?

444
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,600
Yes.

445
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,240
I heard someone

446
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,760
No.

447
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,080
I'm analyzing it for her.

448
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,720
I heard that

449
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,760
someone even showed her her text message.

450
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,160
She asked me to show it to her.

451
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,640
Then,

452
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,920
She said she helped me analyze.

453
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,120
He's staring at me again.

454
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,000
He's really good at this.

455
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,280
Actually I found HAVE G before.

456
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,280
I found it before.

457
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,080
What did you find?

458
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,680
Something is wrong.

459
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,520
When?

460
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,560
When you got in the car,

461
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,120
I found

462
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,640
when I texted him,

463
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,160
I wondered what was wrong with him.

464
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,000
My face is red.

465
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,240
I found it.

466
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,760
You're really angry.

467
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,120
You are indeed angry.

468
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,760
No.

469
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,600
It's okay.

470
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,360
I just think

471
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,320
I sent it too proactive.

472
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:05,920
It's good.

473
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,240
I like it.

474
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,760
No.

475
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,480
I like it.

476
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,880
Not really.

477
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
It's not because of the text.

478
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Then why?

479
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,800
No.

480
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,560
I think it's very complicated.

481
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,600
Tell me how complicated it is.

482
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,960
Maybe all kinds of things.

483
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,720
Why are you exactly like me?

484
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
You asked me yesterday

485
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,960
what bothers you.

486
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,200
What is it?

487
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,080
Actually, I don't know.

488
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,640
There are a lot of things

489
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,320
which annoys me.

490
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,720
Then he said,

491
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,440
Tell me what it is.

492
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,160
Then I said

493
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,880
I have something to do.

494
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,640
But I just

495
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,440
It's annoying to add them together.

496
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,480
Who?

497
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,400
Who asked you?

498
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,800
My buddy.

499
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:36,840
Yes.

500
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,960
Nothing happened.

501
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,760
I don't know what's going on.

502
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,880
Actually the girl is no longer angry now.

503
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

504
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,800
What are you doing?

505
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,360
Guolifang.

506
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,360
Sorry.

507
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm sorry.

508
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,120
Not really.

509
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,000
Not really.

510
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I thought I was too proactive.

511
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,800
Really?

512
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,160
I think I'm licking it.

513
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,400
Lick?

514
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,160
Do you think...

515
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,480
I don't know.

516
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,720
Anyway,

517
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,160
I can't feel the mood you texted.

518
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,800
I think I am.

519
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,040
You're too emotional.

520
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,520
Yes.

521
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,240
And you do this.

522
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,400
No.

523
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,120
Accident?

524
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,720
No, don't.

525
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,360
Accident.

526
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,960
Nothing.

527
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,840
Accident.

528
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,480
People always make mistakes.

529
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,760
Okay.

530
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,720
I'll give you a chance.

531
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,880
Give me a chance.

532
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,280
Su Zihao.

533
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,880
Still sticking?

534
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,000
More?

535
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,440
Su Zihao.

536
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,320
He's so good.

537
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,200
How can he hide?

538
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,320
See?

539
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,800
Here.

540
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
He won't let me talk.

541
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,760
Hurry.

542
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,200
Can you change your clothes first?

543
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,560
Let's see what to wear together.

544
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,320
Let's go.

545
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,800
Go?

546
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,280
Hurry up.

547
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,680
Okay.

548
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,880
I'm forced.

549
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,000
Who knows?

550
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,880
A letter came in.

551
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,640
And the letters

552
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,560
Letters.

553
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,960
Come on.

554
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,200
Hurry up.

555
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
This is very exciting today.

556
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,960
Very fun.

557
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,560
Come on.

558
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,800
I can only say

559
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,520
this card is the most fun one.

560
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,240
About brothers.

561
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,920
Come on, sit down.

562
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,360
We've made our relationship public.

563
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
To let everyone know you better,

564
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,600
tomorrow is your party.

565
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,440
I feel like I'm going to perform this.

566
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,800
Yes.

567
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,440
Tomorrow is siblings' night.

568
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,720
Please discuss it with your brothers.

569
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,960
with your brothers.

570
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,200
No.

571
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,320
I look forward to your handsome appearance.

572
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,480
There are more notes.

573
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
Please make

574
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
your own siblings.

575
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,600
Brothers?

576
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,200
Do you have pink clothes?

577
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,920
Okay.

578
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,640
You're wearing my pink pants.

579
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,319
Do you want to embarrass me?

580
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,640
No.

581
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,720
It's funny when we walk.

582
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,119
Can I wear this?

583
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,599
It'll get stuck in the crotch.

584
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,480
Try it.

585
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,920
Or you can wear mine.

586
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,119
This is pink.

587
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll leave it to you.

588
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,680
What should I wear, Mr. Wang?

589
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,840
Let me see your clothes first.

590
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,760
I'll go with you.

591
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
I'm going to wear

592
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,040
a little bit educated.

593
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,640
Because we are a girl group.

594
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,680
You need to dance a little bit.

595
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,640
Let's interact this time.

596
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,800
In the first part,

597
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,760
in the first part.

598
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,880
and act.

599
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,200
That kind of plot.

600
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,520
Okay.

601
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,000
Let's put down the microphone

602
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,040
and dance together.

603
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,880
Yes, really.

604
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,760
I can really dance.

605
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,520
You play here.

606
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,960
No.

607
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,720
Right hand.

608
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,800
Okay.

609
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,640
Ready, go.

610
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,120
Playing the piano

611
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,520
Play with four hands.

612
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Bro.

613
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,960
It's impossible.

614
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,480
It's impossible.

615
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,680
Try again.

616
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,600
I'll be cursed to death.

617
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,480
You insulted the piano.

618
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:30,960
Try again.

619
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,520
Try again.

620
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Ready, go.

621
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,440
Hello.

622
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,040
What do you think?

623
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,760
What do you think of

624
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,800
What do you think?

625
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,600
I think black and white are good.

626
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,880
So you think it's not bad, right?

627
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,160
Just add some accessories.

628
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,040
That's all.

629
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,720
Bye.

630
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,640
What are you two doing?

631
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,600
We were just chatting.

632
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,040
What are you doing with Susu?

633
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,760
Don't take our job.

634
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,480
I want to know

635
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,440
What are you doing?

636
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,680
We... Then you...

637
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,800
Awesome.

638
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,640
Very greasy.

639
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,520
What are you doing?

640
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,640
We're ashamed.

641
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,360
I don't want to say it.

642
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,320
Dance "Northeast Love Story"?

643
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,080
No.

644
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,640
Really?

645
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,280
No.

646
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,720
Fatty can't do anything.

647
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,920
Do you think I can?

648
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,600
What can you do?

649
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,720
I'll show her

650
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,640
what a rugby game is.

651
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,040
Knock her over.

652
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,920
No, I have to ask Fatty.

653
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,280
Okay.

654
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,520
He's tired.

655
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,400
The most embarrassing day.

656
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,320
Really, I have to rap in my thirties.

657
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,320
How can we piece together the future?

658
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Happiness is mine. No one can borrow it.

659
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,200
Forget who I hate

660
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,960
Who forgot to thank you?

661
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,800
I think I should

662
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,400
for 500 times.

663
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,800
I think I can rap.

664
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,400
I mean

665
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,760
you're going to practice "Planet Fall".

666
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,000
We only have half an hour.

667
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,960
That's enough.

668
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,080
We need to divide it.

669
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,480
"Don't Guess" is easy.

670
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,320
The rap part.

671
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,160
I'll do it.

672
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,120
Four sentences each.

673
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,600
We need to adjust the atmosphere.

674
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,640
Because we are rapping.

675
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
Be funny.

676
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,200
There's no funny part.

677
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,960
How?

678
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,760
I told you to adjust the atmosphere.

679
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,960
She's so happy.

680
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,280
Let's sing.

681
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,240
They'll be excited.

682
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,360
What should we do?

683
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Why is it funny when someone plays the piano?

684
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,400
This thing

685
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,720
You can't force it.

686
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,920
Mine should be funny.

687
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,720
Adjust the atmosphere

688
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,640
I'd better be the one

689
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,800
We can't be together.

690
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,960
I can practice alone.

691
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,600
Let me finish this first.

692
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,040
Let's go.

693
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,880
Stay close to each other.

694
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,680
Once again announce to the world

695
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,080
Don't grab your throat on purpose.

696
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,640
Just shout it out.

697
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,720
But my voice cracked.

698
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,080
Let me hear it.

699
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,320
Announce all over the world

700
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,640
I'll really die of embarrassment.

701
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,600
Let me tell you.

702
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,280
I want to wear a mask to perform.

703
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,480
and chase away my worries secretly.

704
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,120
It'll make the soup crazy.

705
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,920
Get rid of him.

706
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,320
Do you want me to die?

707
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,760
No.

708
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,120
Whose heartbeat is it?

709
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,560
It's screaming.

710
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,200
There, thump thump.

711
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,840
Use this.

712
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,000
So cute.

713
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,880
I quit.

714
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
I wish you happiness every day.

715
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720
Cherish it.

716
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,680
Now the romantic trip

717
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,800
in the house

718
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,040
Find your true love.

719
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,840
Come on, soup.

720
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,440
I beg you.

721
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,280
I said, come up here.

722
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
I have something to tell you.

723
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,840
Crazy.

724
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,800
Why are they so sleepy?

725
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,320
We can't sleep together.

726
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,920
They can dance.

727
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,080
The Wang siblings practice group silently.

728
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,640
Dates are automatically

729
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,040
or random?

730
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,840
I don't know.

731
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,200
Actually, I didn't know

732
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,680
everyone in the room

733
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,800
put on full makeup.

734
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,520
It's so charismatic.

735
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,160
Me too.

736
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,160
Have you had a date with Xinxin?

737
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,680
No.

738
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,080
I only have one date with Susu and Hua.

739
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,680
That's not a date.

740
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,960
I'm always with Harry anyway.

741
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,640
So if you have a chance in the future,

742
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,320
if you have a chance next time?

743
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,040
I don't know.

744
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,120
I don't think so.

745
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,360
I may be passive.

746
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,600
Let's see if you want to ask me out.

747
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,680
Okay.

748
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,560
Sure.

749
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
I'll ask you out with Harry.

750
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,160
Who will you choose?

751
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,560
So bad.

752
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,120
Answer me.

753
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,960
He must be under pressure.

754
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,560
Although you're a fake brother,

755
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,080
he was nice to me.

756
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,160
I still don't know

757
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,280
who sent me

758
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,640
on the first day?

759
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,880
Five boys.

760
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,280
I'll get rid of them first, right?

761
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,040
Harry too

762
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,320
and the soup.

763
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,160
It can only be fat or map.

764
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,800
I think it's probably a map.

765
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,240
But the map...

766
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,280
When we texted,

767
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,960
the map didn't come back.

768
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,440
I think there should be ten people.

769
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,040
when all ten people are here.

770
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,720
So do you think it should be a map?

771
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,080
I think it's probably a map.

772
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,800
Go back and ask.

773
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,760
and ask around.

774
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,400
In reality,

775
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,640
you don't have such emotional ups and downs.

776
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,680
It's also rare.

777
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,960
Yes, very rare.

778
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,160
you won't text you

779
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,640
because of a girl?

780
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,840
Why are you so angry?

781
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,560
I don't think it's bad.

782
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,200
I think so too.

783
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,600
I've been in love for years

784
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
for years.

785
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,320
Yes.

786
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,840
How long has it been since I had such ups and downs?

787
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,600
To be honest,

788
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,840
Yes.

789
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,120
Up.

790
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,760
This is love.

791
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,040
Desco.

792
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,160
The first pair is amazing.

793
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,480
The ceiling of romance show.

794
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,160
What do you want to draw?

795
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,520
Pick a color.

796
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,920
I'll draw one.

797
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,560
I want blue.

798
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,440
Okay, I'll draw an egg tart.

799
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,280
I drew two hearts.

800
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,080
Okay.

801
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,960
Tae-seo.

802
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,800
Can I sign this?

803
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,320
Yes.

804
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,240
Okay.

805
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,200
It's so atmosphere.

806
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,120
They're all cool.

807
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,480
Yes.

808
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,880
You sit inside. I'll sit outside.

809
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Good evening.

810
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,440
Sweet sense of campus.

811
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,400
Very young.

812
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,840
Good evening.

813
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Let's sign the center.

814
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,800
Hua.

815
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,560
You want to be next to me?

816
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,520
Sure.

817
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,680
What do you want to draw?

818
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,480
I'll draw a big ear picture.

819
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,600
Okay, it's done.

820
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,240
Hold my hand.

821
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,080
Okay.

822
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,440
So cute.

823
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,360
Cute.

824
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,360
We're the center.

825
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,600
OK.

826
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,080
I'll invite you later.

827
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,280
Who will be the next group?

828
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,160
Take a guess.

829
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,880
Maybe it's Fatty.

830
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,000
I guess it's Fatty Xinxin.

831
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,960
It sounds like Susu.

832
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,440
Good evening.

833
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,480
Harry is the street.

834
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,360
Yes.

835
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,880
Look, so pretty.

836
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,240
Her figure is great too.

837
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,600
She looks like

838
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,200
who dances ballet.

839
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,120
Sweet.

840
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,560
Done.

841
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,280
Your hand...

842
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,560
Good evening.

843
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,960
I'm fine. Thank you.

844
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,160
It's like a noble sibling

845
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,400
The soup was dressed up

846
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,240
Soup looks like a foreigner wearing a suit

847
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,920
You're wearing a Chinese uniform?

848
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,760
Yes, that's it.

849
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,960
His clothes are very nice today.

850
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,360
I feel like a little prince.

851
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,920
Like a nobleman.

852
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,280
Draw a picture of you.

853
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,240
I don't know how to draw.

854
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,320
It's colorless.

855
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,840
Bro, you're a little rash.

856
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,280
Xiao Ling is good at drawing.

857
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,880
I heard someone praising me.

858
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,360
You wrote my name for me.

859
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,160
Aren't we too slow?

860
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,880
Okay, good.

861
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,360
Your handwriting is ugly.

862
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,480
Thank you.

863
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,560
Why did you draw a head like me?

864
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,600
I didn't draw it.

865
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,400
I drew it.

866
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,960
Did you draw the head?

867
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,720
The one with big ears.

868
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,200
I thought it was a balloon.

869
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,680
You are the "Biography of the Triple Calendar".

870
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,600
I’m 4 Mao.

871
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,480
Long time no see.

872
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,000
Is this the real thing?

873
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,040
Yes.

874
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,400
This way.

875
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,280
Why do you want green?

876
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,640
This is yellow.

877
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,960
Sit inside.

878
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,400
I want to be the first.

879
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,120
You want to be the first?

880
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,000
Who wants to be the first?

881
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,760
Sure.

882
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,840
No.

883
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,800
So awkward.

884
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,120
We were a bit

885
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,920
Because the first one has no pressure.

886
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,680
The first one has no pressure.

887
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,800
I was too stressed.

888
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,560
Don't worry.

889
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,640
Don't be afraid.

890
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,280
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

891
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,800
Don't be afraid.

892
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,120
Watch the performance.

893
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,520
Who's going to perform?

894
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,480
Hua.

895
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,880
Wang siblings.

896
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,800
Wang siblings.

897
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,120
We are siblings of the Luo family.

898
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,680
Why can't it be the Yuan family?

899
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,040
Anything is fine.

900
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,080
We brought two songs.

901
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,320
One is singing.

902
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,680
and the other is singing and dancing.

903
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,080
So you want to see singing and dancing first

904
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,800
or first?

905
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,920
Singing and dancing.

906
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,280
Singing and dancing, OK?

907
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,840
Singing and dancing.

908
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,560
Let's interact more later, okay?

909
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,480
Don't make us too embarrassed.

910
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,440
Let's warm up the stage.

911
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,600
Music.

912
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,720
And the formation.

913
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,360
So cute.

914
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,520
Full of vitality.

915
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,000
YES! OK!

916
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,080
Yes! OK!

917
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,680
The flowers are beautiful.

918
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,200
Thank you.

919
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
So cute.

920
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:28,960
This is...

921
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,080
This is a secret.

922
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,440
Tonight.

923
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,360
Answer with your heart

924
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,680
I will repay your sincerity with my heart.

925
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,240
Application

926
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:42,840
ApPright ApPright

927
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,680
No matter how far

928
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,680
No matter how far it is

929
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
My dream

930
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,040
Hey!

931
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,480
Youth With You

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,720
Youth With You.

933
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,800
Youth With You We planted our promise 1

934
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,320
My my

935
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,640
My dream

936
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,200
Hey

937
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,720
Your eyes give me

938
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,280
Your eyes give me support

939
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,400
And little as I am, I'm brave enough to go

940
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:06,880
With the best fragrance

941
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,800
With the best look

942
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,400
Go to the most beautiful place with the best look

943
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,840
I'm going to live in your heart

944
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,240
Let's make a deal and bloom together

945
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:14,760
Let's make a deal and bloom together.

946
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
Let's make a deal and bloom together

947
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,760
Let's do it.

948
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,840
You sing so well

949
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,080
Yes

950
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,280
Yes! OK!

951
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,280
Let's go, BamBam.

952
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,480
Yes! OK!

953
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,480
We can get there, no matter how far it is

954
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,000
We can get there, no matter how far it is. Pursue it with me.

955
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,440
Flower is great.

956
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,120
This place is getting hot.

957
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,160
It's really a great opening.

958
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,840
When Hua was performing on stage,

959
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,000
she was very confident.

960
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,240
Be confident and shine.

961
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,880
His singing is really good.

962
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,440
The two of them

963
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,880
are always happy.

964
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,800
Their singing and dancing will be fine.

965
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,960
It's really great.

966
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Next is our BBQ.

967
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,520
Yes.

968
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,600
I think our performance

969
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
perfect teamwork.

970
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,640
Brothers' Night makes me very happy.

971
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
Because as a

972
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,040
the atmosphere,

973
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,440
Not only did I sing,

974
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,400
I also performed a show.

975
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,280
and danced.

976
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,760
I think he can give us

977
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,680
100 points.

978
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,960
First of all, we're brave enough

979
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,280
is commendable.

980
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,760
Yes.

981
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,200
And during the performance,

982
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,360
we also heard a lot of applause.

983
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,080
The picture is so cool.

984
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,840
The kind of singing and dancing.

985
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,920
Passion and liveliness can touch me.

986
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,280
With so many songs together,

987
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,640
He remembers the moves.

988
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,760
He can even sing it.

989
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Drawing.

990
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,680
When dancing,

991
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,880
when dancing.

992
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,280
Let me see

993
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,160
I've never seen before.

994
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,160
Thank you.

995
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,920
Awesome!

996
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,840
So strong.

997
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,080
I'm really panicking now.

998
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,880
I'm under a lot of pressure.

999
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Too much pressure.

1000
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,920
My toes are really stingy.

1001
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,880
What should I do?

1002
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,760
I don't know.

1003
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,520
It must be stressful.

1004
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,120
We'll only be beautiful.

1005
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,920
Oh no, I want to go home.

1006
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,280
We just play

1007
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,720
"The River of Heart".

1008
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,640
Okay.

1009
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,400
So elegant.

1010
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,440
They look good together.

1011
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,560
A noble and elegant combination.

1012
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,480
So charming.

1013
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,639
Su Su's eyes are shining.

1014
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,040
My four hands are playing together.

1015
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,960
We didn't have enough time to practice.

1016
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,760
We just cooperated in a mess.

1017
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Come on.

1018
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,960
I'm still a little nervous.

1019
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,320
I made a little mistake.

1020
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,560
But the overall effect

1021
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,480
is not bad.

1022
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,680
I think it's good to be happy.

1023
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,480
It's good.

1024
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,040
It's so nice.

1025
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,600
Beautiful.

1026
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,680
We have another song.

1027
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,440
One has a single song.

1028
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,880
They are well prepared.

1029
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,040
This song is more fun.

1030
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,560
Okay.

1031
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:35,960
Okay.

1032
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,160
Is she a princess?

1033
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,720
Xiao Ling is so elegant.

1034
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,800
She doesn't look like us.

1035
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,080
He's performing for us.

1036
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,400
It's beautiful sitting there.

1037
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,680
It's just a poster.

1038
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,760
I'm looking at their handsome side.

1039
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,560
It's really beautiful.

1040
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,640
It's easy to see.

1041
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,120
I can tell she's a princess.

1042
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
Mimi is great.

1043
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,040
Thank you, Sunny.

1044
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,360
The prince is here

1045
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,160
Prince.

1046
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,880
Love.

1047
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,960
Did you practice before?

1048
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,800
He practiced it for me alone.

1049
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,680
Not this.

1050
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,240
Boys can play an instrument.

1051
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,040
Increase points.

1052
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,400
This is the charm of soup.

1053
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,280
of the soup.

1054
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,480
When he plays the soup,

1055
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
he's also charming.

1056
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,800
It's a bonus.

1057
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,800
Tom.

1058
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,760
I love you.

1059
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,440
Prince of Depression.

1060
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,520
My restless heart

1061
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,400
I calmed down.

1062
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,080
Really.

1063
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,920
I'm so stressed.

1064
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,560
You know?

1065
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,080
I'm going to faint.

1066
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,400
My stomach hurts.

1067
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,080
During the rehearsal,

1068
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
I sang better.

1069
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,320
I'm basically confused now.

1070
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,400
Xinxin.

1071
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,640
I'm nervous.

1072
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,840
It's okay.

1073
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,680
The moment I got the microphone,

1074
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,640
my hands were stiff.

1075
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,680
I can't move my legs.

1076
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,920
Let's sing "Planet Fall".

1077
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,640
I'm more nervous now.

1078
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,600
Who knows?

1079
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,920
Both of you are rappers.

1080
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,360
I'm responsible for "Zhai Xinxin".

1081
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,240
You want to give me the stars?

1082
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,640
This.

1083
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,120
This is it.

1084
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,720
Come on.

1085
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,600
Can you dance with me?

1086
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,640
Your clothes are full of thought of giving up

1087
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,640
and practice Iron Palm.

1088
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,520
I was going to say

1089
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,160
I can't let you Go

1090
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,160
I can't let you Now

1091
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,600
Xinxin.

1092
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,800
Fatty.

1093
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,240
Xin, Fatty.

1094
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,160
Try your best.

1095
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,920
I'm so nervous.

1096
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,840
Give me a hug.

1097
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,680
I thought it through.

1098
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,400
to interact with you.

1099
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,680
We talked and laughed.

1100
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,040
and rhythm.

1101
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,360
and rhythm.

1102
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,640
We look at each other.

1103
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,320
No.

1104
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,800
Nothing.

1105
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,600
She's more nervous than me.

1106
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I didn't expect that.

1107
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,040
He didn't even move.

1108
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,480
I was going to have some interaction

1109
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,560
I didn't dare to move at all.

1110
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,160
I kept staring at the screen.

1111
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,760
Hurry up.

1112
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,600
Finish it quickly.

1113
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,360
Xin.

1114
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,200
Fatty.

1115
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,080
Xinxin.

1116
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,000
Have fun.

1117
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,800
What?

1118
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,720
Brothers and sisters.

1119
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,800
I dare not go on.

1120
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,440
I dare not.

1121
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,680
Who knows what ice cellar is?

1122
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,000
This is an ice cellar.

1123
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,800
I need to change later.

1124
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,200
Somebody help me

1125
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,160
Somebody help me

1126
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,120
I'm so nervous.

1127
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,080
You're too nervous.

1128
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,320
I swallowed all the words.

1129
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,400
I'm so embarrassed.

1130
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,560
Not at all.

1131
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,760
Applaud for you like iron clap.

1132
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
Really.

1133
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,360
I love you.

1134
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,400
Okay.

1135
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,120
Don't forget the moves.

1136
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,320
Move.

1137
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,680
Not now.

1138
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,520
I want to stand out, you know?

1139
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,920
I want a sprayer now.

1140
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,000
We were both nervous before the performance.

1141
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,240
I was still reading the lyrics.

1142
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,480
and thinking about the movements.

1143
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,240
Harry is him.

1144
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,360
My hands are cold and sweating.

1145
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,680
It's actually warm in the arena.

1146
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,880
But he kept sweating.

1147
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,520
Maybe it's because of him.

1148
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,800
a man who has a crush on him.

1149
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,840
he gets more nervous.

1150
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:01,840
Who knows?

1151
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,000
Who knows?

1152
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,720
Everyone.

1153
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,600
I know everything.

1154
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,360
So handsome and beautiful.

1155
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,480
They're talking about the talk show.

1156
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,680
The hat is fine.

1157
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,200
Sister and brother

1158
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,120
They switched their clothes.

1159
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,720
So cute.

1160
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,600
We're going to perform a song.

1161
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,880
and micro gesture dance.

1162
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,120
Please forgive me.

1163
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:31,880
Okay.

1164
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,960
Three, two, one.

1165
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,560
The DNA is moving.

1166
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,960
It's like your singing style

1167
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,080
Harry's outfit

1168
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,480
I think it's very cute.

1169
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,360
That suit and hat

1170
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,960
are all his sister's.

1171
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,080
I think it's cute.

1172
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,520
It's funny.

1173
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,400
Harry is wearing

1174
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,680
a white cow.

1175
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,360
Susu looks handsome.

1176
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,480
Black and white.

1177
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,760
It's like a stage performance.

1178
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,720
I think their costumes impressed me.

1179
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:58,760
Who knows?

1180
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,960
We need to add some movements.

1181
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,520
Harry.

1182
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,400
Who knows?

1183
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,600
Why do you do this?

1184
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,080
Sing it again.

1185
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,000
OK. The king is coming.

1186
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,240
Come on.

1187
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,200
Nervous.

1188
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,200
So stressed.

1189
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,080
So nervous.

1190
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,840
Supermodel

1191
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,920
You've got full marks.

1192
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,480
Are you two standing up there?

1193
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,920
Five minutes.

1194
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,200
Tarri and I will do a show together.

1195
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,320
And...

1196
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,920
We'll invite you

1197
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,440
with us.

1198
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,880
Please cooperate.

1199
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,320
No.

1200
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,520
I didn't even expect that.

1201
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,960
Yes, you can do it.

1202
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,800
Good luck.

1203
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,360
Okay.

1204
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,680
A fashion show.

1205
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,040
It's shocking.

1206
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
This aura

1207
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,080
It's different.

1208
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,040
It's full.

1209
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,280
It's different instantly

1210
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,680
The skewers in my hands don't smell good anymore.

1211
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,400
The look in Tata's eyes will change soon.

1212
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,040
Tata.

1213
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,920
Is this the tower next to me?

1214
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,280
Tae-ri is so handsome too.

1215
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,760
They look good together.

1216
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,960
They're stuck.

1217
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,840
Get ready to go with us.

1218
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,480
Let's go together.

1219
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,520
Fatty, come with me.

1220
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,280
Get up.

1221
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,600
Susu, get up.

1222
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,760
Get up.

1223
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,440
Okay, let's go.

1224
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,720
Let's take a detour.

1225
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,240
Pants?

1226
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,600
Really? We look like clowns.

1227
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,200
It's not like a fashion show.

1228
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,600
Walk a few laps.

1229
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,120
Throw the handkerchief.

1230
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,480
Throw the handkerchief.

1231
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,000
Okay.

1232
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,440
Please take your seats.

1233
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,840
Thank you.

1234
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,600
Seeing Tata's performance today

1235
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,440
As expected from a professional.

1236
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,320
She should shine so brightly.

1237
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,360
If I tell you how I feel,

1238
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,000
Tata is always

1239
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,400
is always the best.

1240
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,000
Tata and Terri are really like that.

1241
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,280
are totally out.

1242
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,440
It's totally different

1243
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,480
It's totally different

1244
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,000
Terri is cool and cool.

1245
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,440
Tata is totally different

1246
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,480
is totally different.

1247
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,720
That kind of cat outfit.

1248
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,120
I feel

1249
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,120
I got goose bumps.

1250
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,080
It's very eye-catching.

1251
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,320
I've never seen them go on a show before.

1252
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,800
Not only did they go on a show,

1253
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,280
they also took us to the show.

1254
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,760
The atmosphere was really good.

1255
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,320
It made us all happy

1256
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,520
into it.

1257
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,600
Amazing.

1258
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,480
Because in my eyes,

1259
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,400
is a little girl.

1260
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,280
kind

1261
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,320
and spoiled by her family.

1262
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,120
When she went on stage, her temperament changed.

1263
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,760
I feel like I can see her other side.

1264
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,120
This is a huge contrast.

1265
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,400
For me and Tata,

1266
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,640
this is a piece of cake.

1267
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,960
Because we've all been to a bigger TV station.

1268
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,360
Tata and I are quite confident.

1269
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,840
The whole process went well.

1270
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,880
Let's have a toast.

1271
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,720
Cheers.

1272
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,080
Cheers.

1273
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,320
The first party.

1274
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,240
Cheers!

1275
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,200
It's brother and sister's night.

1276
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,480
This design is amazing.

1277
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,040
There's a text message.

1278
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,680
The first party is over.

1279
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,680
Editor and reply their names.

1280
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,200
Don't edit yourself.

1281
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,480
and your brother's name.

1282
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,360
I can't edit my own name.

1283
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,240
I can't give you the name of the soup.

1284
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,080
Okay.

1285
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,040
Let's follow

1286
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,560
the content of each episode

1287
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,520
for every episode.

1288
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,160
Our guess for this episode is brother and sister's night.

1289
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,520
The best team

1290
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,600
Which pair?

1291
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,240
This time it's individual battle.

1292
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,600
Write your answer.

1293
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,640
The right member

1294
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,560
will get

1295
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,360
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

1296
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,480
In the last episode,

1297
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,560
the Wild Crest of Guoli

1298
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,960
The one who gets the most

1299
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,120
will receive a mysterious award

1300
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,320
provided by Yuwo.

1301
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,720
Now let's go to

1302
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,480
the emotional moment.

1303
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,320
Because we have two new members

1304
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,400
two new members.

1305
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,680
Ziying and Mina.

1306
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,360
So you'll follow the seats

1307
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,520
according to the seats.

1308
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,080
and Song Yanfu's badge.

1309
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,800
So now Zi Ning

1310
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,520
got five

1311
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,880
Guoli Wild Crest.

1312
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,520
So many.

1313
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,600
Then Mi-na got three

1314
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,200
of Huang Zifan.

1315
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,840
Not bad.

1316
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,080
Okay.

1317
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,160
Have you written the answer?

1318
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,160
Yes.

1319
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,880
Three two

1320
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,320
Let's show

1321
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,440
Flower, map.

1322
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,160
Tata.

1323
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,960
Tata and Terri.

1324
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,920
Map. Flower.

1325
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,840
Tata, Terri.

1326
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,120
Soup, Xiaoling.

1327
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,680
I'm drawing and Hua Hua.

1328
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,840
Drawings and flowers.

1329
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,880
Four versus three, right?

1330
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,760
Lu's is different.

1331
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,440
Next, we're going to

1332
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,360
we're going to have wild wine.

1333
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,360
It's time to reveal the truth.

1334
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,600
Which pair is the best performance partner?

1335
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,800
Best performance partner.

1336
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,440
Tata.

1337
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,600
Tata, Terri.

1338
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,120
I voted for Terri and Tata.

1339
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,080
The model is very cool.

1340
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,840
I feel like this.

1341
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,520
Then they pulled us up

1342
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,680
and interacted.

1343
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,760
This is something I didn't expect.

1344
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,680
I think we can play like this.

1345
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,840
So I think it's very memorable.

1346
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,960
I remember the model step.

1347
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,120
So I voted for them.

1348
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,680
Tata.

1349
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,000
Why did you choose Terri and Tata?

1350
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,480
Because it’s related to my training.

1351
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,360
I think whoever performs better

1352
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,480
I will vote for.

1353
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,000
I vote for Xinxin and Fatty.

1354
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Because other people

1355
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,560
our major is

1356
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,000
to show themselves.

1357
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,200
They can stand in front of so many people

1358
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,440
in front of so many people.

1359
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,120
and rap.

1360
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,280
I think he's very brave.

1361
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,320
I voted for Tata and Terri.

1362
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,840
It's so cool.

1363
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,760
It's rare to see such a performance.

1364
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:55,840
Tata.

1365
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,640
Tata.

1366
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,480
I voted

1367
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,560
the best performance partner.

1368
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,200
Because I think

1369
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,960
she and Tu

1370
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,160
The passion and liveliness can touch me.

1371
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,920
I voted for soup and Xiaoling.

1372
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,920
Maybe I'm being selfish.

1373
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,560
I choose soup.

1374
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,040
I think the soup is great.

1375
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,120
Map.

1376
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,880
Because their group is singing and dancing.

1377
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,760
I think they're great.

1378
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,920
The best performance partner of this year's siblings' night

1379
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,360
for Terri and Tata.

1380
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,160
both have the right

1381
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,760
to choose one man and go back to the house together.

1382
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,200
It's so sudden. Why?

1383
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,600
Model group.

1384
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,000
Really?

1385
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,400
I thought we had zero votes.

1386
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,400
Me too.

1387
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,600
Amazing.

1388
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:00,520
OK.

1389
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,240
Let's congratulate

1390
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,200
Tarri Tata

1391
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,160
got the best performance partner in this episode.

1392
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,280
So the correct answer

1393
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,080
the wildlife badge of Guoli.

1394
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,920
After the night of siblings,

1395
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,880
all the siblings

1396
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,440
in the small house.

1397
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,520
Our theme for this episode is

1398
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,040
Thank you for growing up with me.

1399
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,520
As the first friend

1400
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,440
in life.

1401
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,720
We grew up together.

1402
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,320
Witnessing each other's growth in silence

1403
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,040
Maybe

1404
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,120
they won't express their love directly,

1405
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,480
but they must be the one who stands by silently

1406
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,520
and be each other's support forever.

1407
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,160
Just like the song

1408
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,320
in our theme song.

1409
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,480
Being mean is a disguise

1410
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,400
I just want you to live better than me.

1411
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,560
We're siblings.

1412
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,240
and you'll always rely on me.

1413
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,200
In the next episode,

1414
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,920
Our Romantic House will open for the first time.

1415
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,360
A sweet chat.

1416
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,840
Why does it feel like they're fighting?

1417
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,840
What's going on?

1418
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,480
(What will happen)

1419
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,360
What will happen?

1420
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,520
Family and love

1421
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,520
You can only choose one.

1422
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,720
That's all.

1423
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,160
Let's look forward to next week's show.

1424
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,080
Let's

1425
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,320
Love Sisters

1426
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,600
Double the love.

1427
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,520
Thank you.

1428
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,080
Let's get straight to the point.

1429
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,840
I'm the one being treated differently.

1430
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,800
Why should I change myself

1431
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,640
because of this?

1432
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,280
I can't.

1433
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,320
You don't need to stress.

1434
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,320
Do you want to hear me out?

1435
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,080
I can't accept this explanation.

1436
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:19,920
But what you said and did

1437
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,680
are different.

1438
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,400
No.

1439
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,200
Make it clear.

1440
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:23,840
Okay.

1441
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,320
I'm sorry.

1442
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,080
I apologize for this.

1443
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,080
Just say it if you want to.

1444
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,360
It doesn't matter if you don't want to.

1445
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,560
I hope this day will come for you.

1446
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,640
Forget it.

1447
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,720
Whether I go or not is in my hands.

1448
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,480
I want to go on a date.

1449
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,360
Okay, you try.

1450
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,400
I'll try too.

1451
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,480
to see who will get it.

1452
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,920
Every Thursday at 18:00 p.m. Members will enjoy the reproduction of "Sibling Guardian Diaries".

1458
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,360
"Love Siblings" has been searched hundreds of times. It's all about Baidu Baidu.

1459
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,560
I'm from the neighboring China, Beijing Yanqing Resort Village. and enjoy the French vacation in the suburbs.
