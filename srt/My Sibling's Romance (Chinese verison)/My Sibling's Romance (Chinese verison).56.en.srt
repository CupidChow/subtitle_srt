1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's fluffy like a scalp It's refreshing and refreshing

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,440
Beam.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:47,880
National Tale.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,400
(Network)

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:48,800
One.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,120
Wind paper.

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
It feels like there's a wild wine at a party.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,840
Take part in it on Weibo #Love and Siblings

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
Go on Weibo. Participant #Love and Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game. You can get a surprise benefit.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,200
Do you think

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,039
someone will come later?

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,840
Don't ask that.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,480
I have a strange feeling.

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,400
He's coming.

19
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,160
Coming.

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,440
Xin.

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,920
Xin.

22
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,360
Fatty.

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,280
After a round of round and round,

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,920
Xin

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
He made a confession to his sister.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,560
This is killing.

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,720
What is this?

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:03,880
What is this?

29
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
This is your gift.

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,600
What is this?

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,919
You're so scary.

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,280
You're so mean, aren't you?

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,120
Didn't you confess your love?

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,200
Didn't you go to confess?

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,920
You're so mean, aren't you?

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
This is so touching.

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,600
What is it?

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,600
Okay, don't cry.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,840
Stop making me cry.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,960
I didn't choose ABCD.

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,200
Why?

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
Why don't you try it?

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
Because I think

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,160
you can't lose

45
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,480
you can't lose either.

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,600
You can't lose either.

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,360
I really thought you went to confess your love.

48
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,920
I've thought about how to comfort you tonight.

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,960
Because you will fail.

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,000
No.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,160
I won't let you comfort me.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,960
As we have zero votes,

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,800
I think my sister can also

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,520
a ritual.

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,480
I can't tell you how I feel.

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,600
But I think

57
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,720
she can receive

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,880
from her brother.

59
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,640
So nice.

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,960
Is this Bo Niu?

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,000
Is it Bo Niu?

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,440
Yes.

63
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,360
And this is the same style

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,280
the same style.

65
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,760
Yes.

66
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,640
It's so cute.

67
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,760
This is my first gift.

68
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,280
What else?

69
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,120
And this.

70
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
Camera.

71
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,400
Really?

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
You gave it to me?

73
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,120
Girls should record themselves more.

74
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,480
You're crying.

75
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,360
I prepared

76
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,000
something touching.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,080
I dare not say.

78
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Tell me.

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,480
I choked here.

80
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
Tell me.

81
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,079
Do you have another letter?

82
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,079
No.

83
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,880
But...

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,640
Eight characters.

85
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,720
Read it.

86
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
I think these words are well written.

87
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,240
This is for you.

88
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,800
The journey is flourishing and elegant.

89
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,760
Be content, ambitious, gentle and firm.

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,920
Is it for me?

91
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,240
You can't count well.

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,360
It's 16 words.

93
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,960
Yes.

94
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,560
A long journey.

95
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,920
I'm not elegant either.

96
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,040
You know what?

97
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,440
When I heard

98
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,760
when I heard the word "xin",

99
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,080
So scary.

100
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,159
Fatty.

101
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,360
Xin.

102
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,520
Fatty.

103
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,159
Xin.

104
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,640
Fatty.

105
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,760
Xin.

106
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,120
Xin.

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,320
Fatty.

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,040
Xin.

109
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,200
Fatty.

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,440
Xin.

111
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,360
Fatty.

112
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Help!

113
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,080
Actually, I thought about this last night.

114
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,680
Well,

115
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,960
I think

116
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,440
closing yourself.

117
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
I think you can

118
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
try more new people.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
And I'll be with you.

120
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,400
First of all,

121
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,440
you should open yourself a little bit.

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
Be it friends, besties,

123
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,159
and your love partner,

124
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,560
No matter what choice you make,

125
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,640
no matter what choice you make.

126
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
The thing I fear the most is

127
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,040
is when I'm with you.

128
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,720
When I face the girl you like,

129
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
or the girl who likes you,

130
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,320
I can't

131
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,159
I can't be very open

132
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,640
to get along with her.

133
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,800
So I think

134
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,560
the relationship between siblings

135
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
can't

136
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,480
Words are hard to express.

137
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,720
Blood is thicker than water.

138
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,400
very...

139
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,680
Like I told you today,

140
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,600
I used to think

141
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't think we can get along.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,560
I can see that

143
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
I think

144
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,720
you can get along with each other.

145
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,840
You can slowly find

146
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,040
their shining points.

147
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,120
I think

148
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,320
a pair of eyes like this.

149
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,600
Yes.

150
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,120
We're both in a hurry when something happens.

151
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,640
Let's calm down.

152
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,240
Let's observe more when we're in trouble.

153
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,480
I think we can slow down.

154
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
especially to you.

155
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,920
Then you will meet someone

156
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,800
who suits you better.

157
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,320
I think

158
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,800
I will also

159
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,840
as an observer.

160
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,159
I won't...

161
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,120
I won't do it

162
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,240
I won't do

163
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,920
to disturb you too much.

164
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,520
There are more than four boys in life.

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,080
You will have a better one.

166
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,640
I think

167
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,120
But if I don't get married,

168
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,000
will you scold me?

169
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,920
We have zero votes.

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,280
I found that

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
I didn't know

172
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,840
express myself with words.

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,880
When facing a girl,

174
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
facing a girl.

175
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,040
I think too much.

176
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,320
including my sister.

177
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,280
Recently, when my sister is with me,

178
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,760
I feel she's much better.

179
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,800
She talked to me calmly.

180
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
When we had dinner that day,

181
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,800
She said we got along well like this.

182
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,520
She wants me to communicate more.

183
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,400
We didn't communicate before.

184
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,760
His state today

185
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,160
beyond my imagination.

186
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,400
My relationship with Fatty

187
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,480
more mature

188
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,440
and care about each other.

189
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
That's good.

190
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,520
Although I didn't find love,

191
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,840
but I became

192
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,960
in the small house.

193
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,840
And then

194
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,800
as important as love.

195
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,480
The love from their siblings in the future

196
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,480
will also become the foundation of their love.

197
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,720
This may be the strength

198
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
to each other.

199
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,640
Good love and good family love

200
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,560
are waiting for you.

201
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,840
Come on.

202
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,920
I just saw a scene.

203
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,280
I want to share it with you.

204
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,400
Because I suddenly feel that

205
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,320
many people

206
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,600
pursue love bravely.

207
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,960
I was a little stubborn.

208
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,080
Love is just a part of love.

209
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,920
Actually, our lives are full of love.

210
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,200
It's not love, but your whole sky.

211
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,920
Sometimes,

212
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,640
when love doesn't come to you,

213
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,320
it's better to turn around and find

214
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,080
someone is still protecting you.

215
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,040
and loving you.

216
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,960
Maybe family love.

217
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,000
Maybe friendship.

218
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
but it's a kind of love.

219
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,120
I really hope no one will miss it.

220
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,840
The expression of love

221
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,080
Even a small portion

222
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,520
Wait.

223
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,040
I have news.

224
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,640
(It's time for you to confess.)

225
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,200
Please choose the girl you want to confess to

226
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,360
and run towards her.

227
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,920
My heart is racing.

228
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,280
Xiaoling is waiting for the drawing to confess her love.

229
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,560
I wonder if he'll go.

230
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,040
Yes.

231
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,040
I don't think he'll go.

232
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,720
Tu, you can't do this.

233
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,200
You can't not even come.

234
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,720
At least show your feelings.

235
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,440
Yes.

236
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,160
Will anyone come?

237
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm relieved.

238
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
You scared me.

239
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,560
I don't think there's any reason

240
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,760
can stop me from going.

241
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,800
Whether it's for Xiaoling

242
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,280
or for yourself,

243
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,360
It makes me feel

244
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,760
I won't regret for the past 20 days.

245
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,200
The sun is waiting

246
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,040
Pick B.

247
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,360
Go ahead.

248
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,160
Come on.

249
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,000
Let me take a break.

250
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
to calm down.

251
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,880
Okay.

252
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,640
Come on.

253
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,240
Let me hear what you want to say.

254
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,440
After so many days,

255
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,400
after so many days.

256
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,480
the two of us

257
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,720
texted each other for the first time.

258
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,240
We're destined

259
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,080
together.

260
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,040
I sent a message.

261
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,880
That night, I thought

262
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,320
she would send it to me.

263
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,000
Then I received your text that day.

264
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,400
Tell me, can you teach me how to fight against the landlord?

265
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,360
Although

266
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,000
I haven't taught you how to play the Landlord,

267
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
But I think

268
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,240
from that moment on,

269
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,800
from that moment on.

270
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,240
Including that time when I cried and broke down,

271
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,520
you also cared about my emotions.

272
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,160
When I sit alone in the room,

273
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,400
you will knock carefully.

274
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,040
Can I come in?

275
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,920
Yes.

276
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,280
It's okay. Tell me if you want to.

277
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,720
It doesn't matter if you don't want to.

278
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,120
How should I put it?

279
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,200
Wait, let me take a break.

280
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm actually

281
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,280
who doesn't like others

282
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,800
who sees my fragile side.

283
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,880
When you came in,

284
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
I really want to express

285
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,440
to you.

286
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,760
You heard it

287
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,640
and comforted me.

288
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,320
I feel

289
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,840
I think it's something else

290
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I'm very touched

291
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
and trust.

292
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
I think it's very rare.

293
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,320
I saw the disappointment in Xiaoling's eyes.

294
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,640
Yes.

295
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,360
At first,

296
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,480
my impression of you was

297
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,640
she doesn't talk much.

298
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,360
In the crowd,

299
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,960
you may be

300
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,520
to observe us.

301
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,920
But after getting used to it,

302
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,880
you will slowly communicate with them.

303
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,560
and even make jokes with them.

304
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,560
Add another egg

305
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,360
Eggs are more nutritious anyway.

306
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,480
It can grow you to 180 cm.

307
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,240
This is actually

308
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,640
our tacit understanding.

309
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,840
At the end,

310
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,400
in many aspects.

311
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,560
This is also

312
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,960
a very strange feeling.

313
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,960
I think my brothers like drawing.

314
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,440
a clean boy.

315
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,440
Choosing Xiao Ling

316
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,040
They communicate a lot.

317
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,000
And their emotional value

318
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,800
seems to be full of each other.

319
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,000
You look like an artist.

320
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,320
I think you look like an announcer.

321
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Actually, I cook

322
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,520
cook.

323
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,040
Do the dishes

324
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,000
Me too.

325
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,200
What's his name?

326
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,000
Harry.

327
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,080
I actually like outdoor.

328
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,000
I like skiing.

329
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,080
I only know how to use double plates.

330
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,800
Me too.

331
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,240
I think when she is really happy,

332
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,600
is eating.

333
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,640
Whether it's food or fun

334
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,600
I like them all.

335
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,960
Which dish do you think is the best today?

336
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,880
Does it count?

337
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,200
No sweetness, no joy.

338
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,800
No sweetness, no meat.

339
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,560
I see.

340
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,400
Map.

341
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,280
Ling.

342
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,360
We didn't

343
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
cry because of ourselves.

344
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,360
We always cry because of others.

345
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,680
Why?

346
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:05,920
Let's go.

347
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,040
Let's go eat. Let's go.

348
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,680
Let's go.

349
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,960
It's really hard to meet

350
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,120
It's really hard.

351
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,400
And it's actually the same frequency.

352
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,280
It's kind of mysterious.

353
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,800
It's like God thinks

354
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,240
you two should get to know each other.

355
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,400
Yes, you have to.

356
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,040
So I'm really lucky

357
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,200
and beautiful.

358
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,560
In fact,

359
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,520
We're friends.

360
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,920
If you really think it's friendship,

361
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,520
don't give Xiaoling such hope.

362
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,360
Just make it clear.

363
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,120
Yes.

364
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,320
Here.

365
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,240
Guess what it is.

366
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,800
Let me guess.

367
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,480
It's a very popular thing recently.

368
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,760
What is it?

369
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,440
Open it.

370
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,560
You're not the same as me, are you?

371
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
No.

372
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,520
But

373
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,400
the same thing.

374
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,960
It's the same thing.

375
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
We have a tacit understanding again.

376
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,040
Before I gave him the gift,

377
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,760
what he would prepare for me.

378
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360
Could it be something similar to me?

379
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,320
What did you buy?

380
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,080
I didn't buy this.

381
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,000
But it's similar.

382
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,880
It means

383
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,000
you can focus on your study

384
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,240
and purify your magnetic field.

385
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,800
It can make you

386
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,080
you want me to become a career-type career woman.

387
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,120
Because both of us

388
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
in different places.

389
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,000
We are mainly

390
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
our own study.

391
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,360
Yes.

392
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,800
bring you more energy.

393
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,720
Actually, I thought

394
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,920
if I should buy a dark one.

395
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,400
But I think

396
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,560
you may have more dark colours.

397
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,320
Yes.

398
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,120
I thought about it when I bought it for you.

399
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,600
what color do you usually have?

400
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Really?

401
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,040
I wrote a letter. You read it first.

402
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,520
Okay.

403
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,920
Zhan Xinjia.

404
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,480
Don't read it out.

405
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll feel awkward.

406
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,320
Get to the point.

407
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,160
I trust you.

408
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,480
you can clearly feel

409
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,280
I'm interested in you.

410
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,800
I also got the same feeling

411
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,520
from you.

412
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,720
Even if the show is over,

413
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,800
it doesn't mean it's over between us.

414
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,000
relaxed and happy.

415
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,360
So I feel lucky

416
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,400
to meet you.

417
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,800
I remember the last thing.

418
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,320
Even if I skip class, I want to hang out with you.

419
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,240
What makes me feel the most

420
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,960
I can break it sometimes.

421
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,320
Don't keep

422
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,200
Because I thought about it.

423
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,680
You were born in 2004.

424
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,480
Are you a monkey?

425
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:48,840
Yes.

426
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,680
Right?

427
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,840
And this rope and the red bead in the middle

428
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,320
is related to the monkey.

429
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,200
And it means protecting.

430
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,120
And the two beside.

431
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,280
This is a six-word proverb.

432
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,800
And this is also a six-word proverb.

433
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,839
It means

434
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,319
to keep you safe and healthy.

435
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,280
I think you'll wear more

436
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,800
in bright colors.

437
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,480
So I think it's okay

438
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
to buy you a bright color.

439
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,000
Monkey's guardian rope.

440
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,960
Is it touching?

441
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,480
She made it for him.

442
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,760
is more attentive than that crystal bracelet.

443
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,800
This part should be made up by me.

444
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,680
Because it's ugly.

445
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,760
Did you make it up yourself?

446
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,080
What should I do?

447
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,080
It's like this.

448
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,680
Yes.

449
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,680
Here.

450
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,880
I do have a lot to tell you.

451
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,800
but I don't know what to say.

452
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,360
Xiao Ling is going back.

453
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,880
This is not what she expected.

454
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,400
My brain is...

455
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,240
I can't say it's messy.

456
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,960
I just feel

457
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,680
I got a lot of information.

458
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,800
Thank you.

459
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,640
Thank you even more.

460
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,000
You've written it down.

461
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,160
I'm really grateful.

462
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,800
Okay.

463
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,320
Anyway, we'll meet later.

464
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,360
We have to meet again.

465
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,600
Will you come to see me?

466
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,720
Of course.

467
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,520
I'll bring the bracelet.

468
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,400
Me too.

469
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,560
I want to hug you

470
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,360
on the last day.

471
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,160
I'm very touched.

472
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,760
Being together is something

473
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
time and test.

474
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,840
We need more time

475
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,120
to understand each other.

476
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,360
I think we can

477
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,160
we can

478
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
in life

479
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,760
your weaknesses

480
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,600
or advantages,

481
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,760
or hobbies,

482
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,840
or hobbies.

483
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,480
communicate and get to know more

484
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,520
and make a decision.

485
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,240
is a kind of respect for each other

486
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,360
and choices.

487
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,000
Because they may need to

488
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,560
in relationships.

489
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,760
Communicate more.

490
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,880
When the picture realizes it,

491
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,040
don't regret it.

492
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,680
Because Xiaoling is so nice.

493
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,640
I'll miss her.

494
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,960
People's fate is limited.

495
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,160
Actually, I feel sorry for Xiaoling.

496
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
At first, she was

497
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,560
who really hides herself.

498
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,160
So cold.

499
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,440
In the first few episodes,

500
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,240
she seemed to be out of love.

501
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Everyone's giving out a signal.

502
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,680
It seems to have nothing to do with her.

503
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,280
But the entrance of the map

504
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,080
she gradually opened herself up.

505
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,280
She must have trusted

506
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
or that feeling is very strong.

507
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,840
she would open it.

508
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,880
But when she blooms for someone,

509
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,440
she felt like she was wrong.

510
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,200
It turns out that

511
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,160
can't get someone

512
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,520
to smell this incense.

513
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,520
Yes

514
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,720
Really.

515
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,000
I think Xiao Ling is so excellent.

516
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,360
She's excellent in all aspects.

517
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,040
Actually,

518
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,800
think

519
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,080
why she likes drawing.

520
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,560
Because we always think

521
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,480
such a perfect existence.

522
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,360
The one we imagined

523
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,520
who will date her.

524
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,440
are evenly matched.

525
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,560
I can take care of her and protect her.

526
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,160
But I sympathize with

527
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,960
when Xiaoling looks at the picture,

528
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,440
the gentleness in her eyes.

529
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,160
You feel the map

530
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,040
the only one

531
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
can make her relax completely.

532
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,120
The Return Original.

533
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,440
Yes.

534
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
The Return Boy.

535
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,840
Yes.

536
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
Like a child.

537
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,600
Everyone is happy together.

538
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,200
She must enjoy this kind of relationship.

539
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,680
Speaking of which,

540
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,760
thank Tu Tu for letting Xiaoling

541
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,960
for letting Xiaoling have her way.

542
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,640
Yes.

543
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,200
In the future,

544
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,120
Xiao Ling laughs freely.

545
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,840
For this glory,

546
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,320
Thank you, Tu.

547
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,720
My message is here.

548
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,920
To Su Zihao.

549
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,960
Your confession time has begun.

550
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,480
Please choose you.

551
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,320
Take your time.

552
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,200
Please choose the girl you want to confess to.

553
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,200
and run towards her exclamation mark.

554
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,920
A, Wang Yin-cheol.

555
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,200
B Brandisie.

556
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,120
C He Wenxin

557
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,360
D Rollin.

558
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,560
That's all.

559
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,280
Are you nervous?

560
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,920
I want to see it.

561
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,160
Let's go.

562
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,240
I'm a little nervous.

563
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,000
Don't be nervous.

564
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,320
First, don't talk too much.

565
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,640
Don't shake your legs.

566
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Don't touch yourself.

567
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,080
My muscles are a little spasm.

568
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Don't spasm.

569
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,360
She knows her brother well.

570
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,640
Come on, Harry.

571
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,240
I'm nervous too.

572
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Don't be nervous.

573
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,080
Bye. Good luck.

574
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,680
Don't cry when you get rejected.

575
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,520
Don't touch yourself.

576
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,240
No.

577
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,760
Okay.

578
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
Believe in yourself.

579
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,080
Come on. Bye.

580
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,400
I won't look back.

581
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,040
Okay.

582
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,360
I can accept this result.

583
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,160
I've thought it through.

584
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,240
You did a good job today.

585
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,120
You don't need to give him an out.

586
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,280
I can't give him any comments.

587
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,200
I just... OK.

588
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,720
I understand.

589
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,680
That's how I am.

590
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,240
Yes.

591
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,360
I think I like it.

592
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,480
must be passionate.

593
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,520
It must be sincere.

594
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,760
I'm sure it's true.

595
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,120
It must be emotional.

596
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,960
I didn't feel

597
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,320
from the guy just now.

598
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't think you need to feel sorry for him.

599
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
Be the best version of yourself.

600
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,200
and the most beautiful me.

601
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,800
is enough.

602
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,840
You're self-confident.

603
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
I think you need to be proud.

604
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,360
I didn't do that well.

605
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,320
I'll do my best.

606
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay.

607
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,280
Before you start dating,

608
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,200
let me check.

609
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,040
Okay.

610
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,240
I'm worried about you.

611
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,680
I'm so bullied.

612
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,720
Okay, no problem.

613
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,160
Let me introduce you first.

614
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,760
Okay.

615
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,280
Even if no one loves you,

616
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,040
I will still love you.

617
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,400
He's so eloquent.

618
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,640
So cheesy.

619
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,720
It's cheesy but I like it.

620
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,160
Yes.

621
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,360
Help.

622
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,200
She changed her style.

623
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,360
So beautiful.

624
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,480
Why are you carrying so many things?

625
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,240
Again and again.

626
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,160
I'm very nervous.

627
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,480
He's taking a deep breath.

628
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,120
He's under a lot of pressure.

629
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,240
Smile before coming in.

630
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,080
You're so formal today.

631
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,840
I've been waiting for you again today.

632
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,000
I've been waiting for you.

633
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,840
Wait for me here?

634
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
You look good with long hair.

635
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,040
It's for Harry.

636
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,720
It surprised me.

637
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,640
Because Harry likes long hair.

638
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,560
Wait.

639
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm nervous.

640
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,120
I'm so nervous.

641
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,080
Me too.

642
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,160
I think what I bought

643
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,200
has my own meaning.

644
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,760
Do you remember

645
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,960
our first date

646
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,920
is not a Cupid date.

647
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,760
It's a date.

648
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,240
Do you remember what flowers I bought?

649
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,920
Shaoyao.

650
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,280
Yes.

651
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,200
Do you know

652
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,320
what peony symbolizes?

653
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,120
I'm shy.

654
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
This time,

655
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,760
I bought tulips.

656
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,120
You bought two.

657
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,480
Because they are...

658
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,080
Thank you.

659
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,440
I think the meaning of flowers is different.

660
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,720
Red tulips.

661
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,080
It symbolizes love confession.

662
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,880
And pink tulips.

663
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,360
It symbolizes happiness.

664
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,360
having happiness

665
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,120
and love you forever.

666
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,560
Do you remember the day before yesterday?

667
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,520
If I remember correctly,

668
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,640
we sat there and chatted.

669
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,520
When we were in the room,

670
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,280
I looked at your leg.

671
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,240
Then your arm...

672
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,080
I said,

673
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,960
Why are you so dry?

674
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,280
Hello.

675
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,560
And...

676
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,240
Body breast?

677
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,760
Yes, body lotion.

678
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,920
One is body oil.

679
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,240
I bought two

680
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,320
And this

681
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,240
It seems to be a set.

682
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,800
I forgot.

683
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,000
You bought too much.

684
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
Wait.

685
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,400
Open it yourself.

686
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,160
I'll explain to you after you're done.

687
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,440
This is...

688
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,040
I'll buy you two phone cards.

689
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,680
Phone card?

690
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,520
If we are together,

691
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,200
I'm afraid I can't reach you.

692
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,560
Just in case.

693
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,400
This is very useful.

694
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,400
It's been a long time since I've been so formal.

695
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,040
Do you remember

696
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,080
I texted you yesterday

697
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,520
after you gave me my perfume.

698
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,600
I'm not saying

699
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,560
Thank you very much

700
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,480
for giving me your favorite perfume.

701
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,040
I thought

702
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,400
I thought I wanted to share

703
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,920
with you.

704
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,480
So,

705
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,040
I'm afraid Looney will steal your perfume.

706
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,680
I bought one too.

707
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,320
Gosh.

708
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,160
It's so funny.

709
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,000
But I didn't bring it.

710
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,360
Actually, I thought

711
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,760
I bought one myself.

712
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,680
I bought it for you today.

713
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,600
You don't have to buy it yourself.

714
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,040
It's so practical.

715
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,640
His confession list

716
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,320
There are many details.

717
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,200
It's not the first time

718
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
giving you a doll.

719
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,120
You told me

720
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,800
you like to sleep with your sheep.

721
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,360
Do you remember

722
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,120
when you went out,

723
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,600
when you went out.

724
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,680
and brought me a puppy's eye mask.

725
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,840
You said I looked like a "puppy".

726
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,680
I thought

727
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,720
I'll do as you say.

728
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,880
Then I'll treat myself like a puppy.

729
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,080
My heart skipped a beat.

730
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,520
This is good.

731
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,560
I said if you want to go to Japan,

732
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,320
I can't go with you.

733
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,800
I'll bring this puppy

734
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,920
with the puppy.

735
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,400
and sleep with it.

736
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,680
I'll accompany you.

737
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,480
Yes.

738
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:48,960
Black.

739
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,680
I like dogs.

740
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,360
A black dog.

741
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,720
A black dog is not black.

742
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,400
This is the only time in life.

743
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,200
No matter how many gifts you prepare,

744
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,680
no matter how much effort

745
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,440
As long as I can express my feelings,

746
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,400
she can accept my feelings.

747
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,760
I can accept

748
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,880
I can accept it.

749
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,920
What I want to say is

750
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,160
our first date.

751
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,680
I prepared everything

752
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,720
for the moment.

753
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,360
I didn't know you were going to Japan.

754
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,120
But after that date,

755
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,240
you told me you were going to Japan.

756
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,760
This gift is mostly for

757
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,640
for the future.

758
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:18,920
Yes.

759
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,200
I've prepared

760
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,280
So I prepared these

761
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,160
just

762
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,520
when I wanted you to go later,

763
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,440
I wasn't that worried.

764
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,320
Or things will go smoothly.

765
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,000
Okay.

766
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,280
I bought it too.

767
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,240
I think

768
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,920
very meaningful.

769
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,080
I didn't expect

770
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,640
it would be such a coincidence.

771
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,600
It's like this.

772
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,400
It's a chick.

773
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,280
Aren't you born in the year of chicken?

774
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,080
When I picked it up,

775
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,440
I found that

776
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,360
What is it?

777
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,440
It's a dragon.

778
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,040
The zodiac sign of Tata.

779
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,400
This is sweet.

780
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
I was born in the year of dragon too.

781
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,840
It's just a coincidence.

782
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,960
The buyer told me

783
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,680
there is a Liuhe.

784
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,080
Dragon and chicken.

785
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,600
They are helping secretly.

786
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,280
Really?

787
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,840
Yes.

788
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,680
What a coincidence.

789
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,440
What a coincidence!

790
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,000
What a coincidence.

791
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,360
I didn't know

792
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,640
to choose for you.

793
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,840
It is.

794
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,400
When I saw this chick,

795
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,440
I thought I should buy it.

796
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,120
Left hand.

797
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,640
Good.

798
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,360
It suits you.

799
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,160
I wrote a letter.

800
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,840
What are you doing?

801
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,280
Don't be nervous.

802
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,120
I'm nervous too.

803
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,560
Wait.

804
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,560
Don't be nervous.

805
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,080
OK.

806
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,640
Hello, Su Zihao.

807
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
The first day I met you,

808
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,960
I thought it through.

809
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,880
None of them seems to be my ideal type this time.

810
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,880
But it's really easy to talk to you.

811
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,800
If you don't mind, I'll hold out my stomach.

812
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,600
I'm really full.

813
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,640
No problem.

814
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,520
You will find the topic.

815
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,800
Although there are many

816
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,560
your formula,

817
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,680
But at least after that,

818
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,320
I'm willing to extend ten minutes for you.

819
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,280
Where were we?

820
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,800
After thinking about it,

821
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,480
if on the first day,

822
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,360
I chose you to take me back to the house.

823
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,600
Will we get to know each other faster?

824
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,360
But I still think

825
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,760
the current development order is the best.

826
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,920
and the most suitable one for us.

827
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,160
We regret it when we pass by.

828
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,000
When we sent the wrong feelings,

829
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,480
we firmly made our choices.

830
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,400
Every contradiction

831
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,440
is the highlight of our relationship.

832
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,600
Like you said,

833
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,800
If everything goes well,

834
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,440
life will be boring.

835
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,680
You're not my type,

836
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,200
You're not tall,

837
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,920
and small eyes.

838
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,360
But when I got to know you,

839
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,800
I did neglect these things.

840
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,600
including the age I care about the most.

841
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,640
I know you're younger than me.

842
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,880
but I have to admit that

843
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,640
you're very mature.

844
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,680
Your personality

845
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,920
is also my type.

846
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,040
You're delicate, gentle and considerate.

847
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,520
and a little humorous.

848
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,880
You'll remember what I said.

849
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,400
Green.

850
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,920
and willing to act for me.

851
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,240
and dare to break some rules.

852
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,960
These are what I like

853
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,160
and I need.

854
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,040
He's been staring at her.

855
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,920
I can feel the heat between them.

856
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,240
Nervous.

857
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,320
Don't be nervous.

858
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,440
You know I'm dull.

859
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
and a bit old-fashioned.

860
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,920
But you kept guiding me

861
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,240
and took me away again and again.

862
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,600
I'm immersed in the inner world

863
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,760
Talking to me

864
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,560
Thank you.

865
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,840
The girls said that

866
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,720
you were dancing at their thunder point.

867
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,320
But I didn't expect

868
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,800
Sometimes,

869
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,760
I feel comfortable.

870
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,720
Maybe this is the reason

871
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,080
we get along.

872
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,200
You said the car where Cupid went on a date

873
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,920
is the turning point of your feelings for me.

874
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,040
Then my change may be

875
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,680
the moment

876
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,840
to celebrate my birthday.

877
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,160
Wait.

878
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,480
It's your birthday. You can't leave yet.

879
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,960
I thought you were shining.

880
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,080
I felt very warm.

881
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,760
And when you said you needed me,

882
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,320
you gave me a reason

883
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,920
to stay with you and Susu.

884
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,560
Although I'm a safe relationship,

885
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,960
but I really

886
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,280
I need this kind of favourite and proactive expression.

887
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
I look forward to

888
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,880
What kind of text will you send me?

889
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,640
I want to know how you feel today.

890
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,800
I want to know what's on your mind.

891
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,600
Be it happy

892
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,960
or sad,

893
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,680
I want to know what you think about every day.

894
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
Maybe liking someone

895
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,360
to know everything about him.

896
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
I'm not good at talking.

897
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,200
but I must be an excellent listener.

898
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,000
So...

899
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,080
Harry, I don't want you to suffer internal consumption.

900
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,400
or pressure yourself.

901
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,120
I can be your emotional trash can.

902
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
As long as you are willing to find me,

903
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,600
I will always be there.

904
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,120
I will face it with you

905
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,640
and solve all the problems together.

906
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,920
It's touching.

907
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,600
Yes. Tata is really sincere.

908
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:20,920
Great.

909
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,960
Kiss.

910
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,840
Kiss.

911
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,920
So good.

912
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,080
Oh, no. I'm stressed.

913
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,560
You...

914
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,240
Okay.

915
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,600
I'll stand up and read.

916
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,320
Be formal.

917
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,720
You must have a sense of ritual.

918
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,280
Yes.

919
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,600
Wait.

920
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,040
Okay.

921
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
This letter shouldn't be sentimental.

922
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
but I think I'll cry.

923
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,920
It's been 15 days

924
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,400
since we first met.

925
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,600
Although time is short,

926
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,400
I have the chance to meet you every day.

927
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:11,840
It's been two or three months

928
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,440
for two or three months.

929
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,440
You told me

930
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,239
you told me

931
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,040
you're slow to warm up.

932
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,600
So when a person

933
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,159
(who actively released the signal to me,)

934
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,880
I want to seize this opportunity.

935
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,440
Because I'm afraid we won't meet again

936
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,719
we won't meet again.

937
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,960
I'm very happy

938
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,320
when I first met you,

939
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,400
I could celebrate your birthday with you.

940
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,080
You left me a whole day.

941
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,040
You asked me a lot of questions on my birthday.

942
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,520
A very memorable question.

943
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,920
You asked me

944
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,400
if I'd have a good life.

945
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,600
I said,

946
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,159
Actually, my thoughts of dating

947
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,520
is my ordinary

948
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,960
I'm already passionate to others.

949
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,560
After that, if my passion

950
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,239
it's a bit crazy for others.

951
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,159
I hope my preparation today

952
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,280
can give you

953
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,600
a very disappointing confession.

954
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,280
When I choose someone firmly,

955
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,120
I will rush at any cost

956
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,320
to express my love.

957
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,480
What do you want to eat?

958
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,400
I'll eat this then.

959
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,160
Who cooked it?

960
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,840
I cooked it.

961
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,480
I fell asleep at four last night.

962
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,960
I've been doing a lot of strategies.

963
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,960
If we go on a date,

964
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,880
we can't go on a date.

965
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,720
We've been watching movies.

966
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,600
Watching TV?

967
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,360
Today is a perfect day.

968
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,440
Look at me.

969
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,280
You're really pretty.

970
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,560
I know you'll doubt me.

971
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,960
and my feelings.

972
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,120
You would ask why I changed so fast.

973
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,960
In words,

974
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,200
I may not be able to express

975
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,080
what I want to say.

976
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,800
But all my feelings are in my actions.

977
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,960
What can't be controlled is love.

978
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,520
If a person

979
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,880
stay sober and control,

980
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,440
That's not love.

981
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,360
Love is not sober

982
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,320
You can't control it.

983
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,040
That's why

984
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,280
I want to be with you every day.

985
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,160
Stay together.

986
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,080
My sister will say

987
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,360
I'm like a plaster.

988
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,800
Gum is always behind you.

989
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,000
In the handwritten letter you wrote to me,

990
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,560
you mentioned

991
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,000
I prepared so much for you.

992
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,120
Don't you know

993
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,360
should be at ease

994
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,000
and accept my kindness to you?

995
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,040
But from now on,

996
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,240
I hope you can accept

997
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,480
my kindness to you.

998
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,400
Because I think you deserve it.

999
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,240
You're not good at expressing yourself.

1000
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,800
It's really hard to express.

1001
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,520
So I will take the initiative

1002
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,920
to express my feelings.

1003
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,760
But I...

1004
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,800
need your response.

1005
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,440
Or I don't know

1006
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,800
if I did it right.

1007
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,040
Being sensitive is our common point.

1008
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,960
Although we are sensitive,

1009
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,160
I hope you can tell me

1010
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,040
you can tell me.

1011
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,280
Tell me what's bothering you.

1012
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,760
Safety is very important.

1013
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,400
You told me

1014
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,960
You have a pet phrase.

1015
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,880
Say sorry.

1016
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,280
I hope this pet phrase

1017
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,200
to be

1018
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,960
Because I want to be good to you.

1019
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,080
and let you down.

1020
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,800
In the past,

1021
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,840
I only liked you more.

1022
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,680
You'll see me

1023
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,720
to care about my emotions.

1024
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,600
What are you doing?

1025
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,400
I'll tell you later.

1026
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,960
You will explain it

1027
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
when there's a misunderstanding.

1028
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,240
Sorry.

1029
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,840
I regretted it after I sent it.

1030
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,680
Think of me when you go out.

1031
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,000
and buy it for me.

1032
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,120
What do you think I like?

1033
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,920
I like it.

1034
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,680
I like it.

1035
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Where did you get it?

1036
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,080
I gave it to him.

1037
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,840
It's from Tata.

1038
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,080
Here.

1039
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,840
I bought you something.

1040
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,240
I'll give it to you later.

1041
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,720
It's okay. I bought it for you.

1042
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,080
Okay.

1043
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,280
I'll buy it for you too.

1044
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,760
Does it smell?

1045
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,320
So cute. I'll buy it for you.

1046
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,160
When I don't want to

1047
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,120
pouring water for my sister,

1048
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,520
when I pour water for my sister.

1049
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,720
I want water.

1050
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,760
Drink some water. Go ahead.

1051
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,600
What are you doing?

1052
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,520
Let me pour you some.

1053
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,600
Get me a glass of water.

1054
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,640
She's already there.

1055
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,840
You'll pick up new dishes when eating.

1056
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,200
and give it to me first.

1057
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,600
Thank you.

1058
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,320
Don't...

1059
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,720
Yes.

1060
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,600
Thank you.

1061
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,800
A lot of details may be

1062
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,360
the subconscious of liking someone.

1063
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,840
I saw it and remembered it.

1064
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,360
I was very happy and touched.

1065
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,840
Especially when I walk alone.

1066
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,800
Come to me.

1067
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,520
Come and hold my hand.

1068
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,480
That's what I thought.

1069
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,000
It's really good to have you.

1070
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,800
It's really good.

1071
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,600
Thank you.

1072
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,320
And thank you for liking me.

1073
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,280
And...

1074
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,280
One last question.

1075
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,400
Question.

1076
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,920
is

1077
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,600
Will you be with me?

1078
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,080
Will you be with me?

1079
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Yes.

1080
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,920
Love can overcome all difficulties

1081
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,680
We'll be together no matter how far it is.

1082
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,920
Congratulations, Harry.

1083
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
Electricity.
Congratulations.

1084
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,800
Lovers are finally together.

1085
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,240
Although there are real problems,

1086
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,920
It's like a foreign relationship hasn't been solved yet.

1087
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,400
But love is emotional.

1088
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,240
Even if we have difficulties,

1089
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,560
we still choose each other firmly.

1090
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,880
and take a step at a time.

1091
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,680
That's right.

1092
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,400
Do you remember

1093
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,760
a memorable confession to each other?

1094
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,000
Mr. Zhou’s confession

1095
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,520
It seems that the whole country knows

1096
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,800
when we were filming a variety show,

1097
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,080
I remember two sentences.

1098
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,280
In one sentence, in a setting,

1099
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,520
you wanted to say to your partner

1100
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:44,920
I'm sorry.

1101
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,440
Thank you.

1102
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,480
or I love you?

1103
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,760
I chose to love you.

1104
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,480
and interpreted

1105
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,280
Then my husband

1106
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,840
said

1107
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,480
you were shining in my eyes.

1108
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,800
I care about you.

1109
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,120
whether I've been shining

1110
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,680
in my partner's eyes?

1111
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,240
In a blink of an eye.

1112
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,400
I'm quite touched.

1113
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,120
There's another sentence.

1114
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,240
It's like a dragon.

1115
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:04,960
What is it?

1116
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,040
ADHD.

1117
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,480
It’s classic.

1118
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,600
Just be yourself.

1119
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,160
How were you before?

1120
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,360
and how I am now,

1121
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,800
we will be in the future.

1122
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,640
Don't change.

1123
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,040
You can live however you want in your life.

1124
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,000
We won't change.

1125
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,120
But why can't I remember this?

1126
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,280
Because the crew

1127
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,320
set it

1128
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,400
in a haunted house

1129
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,760
through a haunted house.

1130
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,120
But I was extremely afraid of that part.

1131
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,240
So in that process,

1132
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,400
my soul went out.

1133
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,920
When the whole country is moved,

1134
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,400
To be honest,

1135
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:36,920
At that moment,

1136
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,720
I really didn't.

1137
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,760
I heard nothing.

1138
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,920
I think it's a mistake.

1139
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,200
I even printed that sentence

1140
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,440
on the napkin of our wedding.

1141
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,600
One time, he suddenly told me

1142
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,720
he said thank you.

1143
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,640
For what?

1144
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,280
He said thank you for being here.

1145
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,600
And I think this sentence

1146
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,840
It must be because of them.

1147
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,400
not because of what I said.

1148
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:58,560
No.

1149
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,360
I just feel that

1150
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,840
the education you received

1151
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,240
or when you grow up,

1152
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,640
when you grow up,

1153
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,880
every character of you

1154
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,840
must be valuable.

1155
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,200
Based on such values,

1156
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,800
it's hard for us to relax.

1157
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,080
It's hard to accept

1158
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,840
or someone who did something wrong.

1159
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,760
But there is someone

1160
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,640
who accepted you completely

1161
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,160
and grateful for your existence.

1162
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,880
I think

1163
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,160
touched me.

1164
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,680
What I said to him

1165
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,880
I said to him.

1166
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,760
was written by me

1167
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,680
I wrote

1168
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,720
I said thank you

1169
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,480
for helping me fall in love with myself.

1170
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,760
Because he often acknowledges

1171
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,640
all my strengths.

1172
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,680
Whether I'm funny

1173
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,840
or I treat others well,

1174
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,240
I'm good to my family.

1175
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:40,960
and friends.

1176
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,160
Every time I do something

1177
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,560
I think,

1178
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,560
he would praise me.

1179
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,800
He thought I did a good job.

1180
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,240
I shouldn't deny myself repeatedly.

1181
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,680
I should acknowledge myself

1182
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,240
and love myself.

1183
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,320
and even love myself.

1184
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,400
Why not now?

1185
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,160
ADHD

1186
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,760
I remember everything.

1187
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,280
Seriously.

1188
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
We have to show him this.

1189
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,480
He will cry when he sees it.

1190
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,480
You deserve it.

1191
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,080
Thank you.

1192
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,000
We love you too.

1193
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,040
Okay.

1194
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,960
Next one.

1195
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,120
Don't stay here.

1196
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,200
I remember when I proposed to you,

1197
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,480
if you would marry me.

1198
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,560
Because we're already together.

1199
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,680
But I think

1200
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,280
it's not enough for me to be with her all my life.

1201
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,480
So I hope God can see

1202
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,840
we can still be together in the next life.

1203
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,360
I don't think such a good man

1204
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,440
When you meet a good woman,

1205
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,120
you'll become a good man too.

1206
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,200
I think it's mutual.

1207
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,960
Yes.

1208
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,440
I've lifted it here.

1209
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,600
I think

1210
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,240
Actually,

1211
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,560
I'm so stressed.

1212
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,800
ten years later,

1213
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,160
you may be better than us.

1214
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,000
Yes.

1215
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
In this relationship,

1216
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
in this relationship.

1217
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,200
Because she's an amateur.

1218
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
She will be more stressed

1219
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,560
she will bear more pressure.

1220
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,520
But it's all thanks to

1221
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,640
all these years

1222
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,560
her endless love for me.

1223
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,080
That's why I can support her.

1224
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,600
She gave up so much for me.

1225
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,560
for me.

1226
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,240
So I think

1227
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,120
what she said,

1228
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,560
I think I remember more

1229
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,440
what she did for me.

1230
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,320
So you'll be better to her.

1231
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,520
and she'll treat you better.

1232
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,960
Then you will be happier.

1233
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,600
So the man who successfully confessed his love

1234
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,320
Harry and soup.

1235
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,560
Soup.

1236
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,400
I won.

1237
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,080
Who else?

1238
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:22,960
Me.

1239
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,920
Congratulations to Jiang Dunhao

1240
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,320
for getting four Guoli Wild Crests.

1241
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,960
Congratulations.

1242
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,360
Awesome.

1243
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,320
So Jiang Dunhao and I

1244
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,280
with 11

1245
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,600
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

1246
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,680
ranked first.

1247
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,800
We're tied first.

1248
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Congratulations on winning

1249
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,760
of "Love Sisters" this season.

1250
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,200
The grand prize is

1251
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,320
get 365 bottles each.

1252
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,560
Guoli Wild Wine.

1253
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,560
365 bottles.

1254
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,640
Thank you, Guoli.

1255
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,920
Wish Jiang Dunhao and me

1256
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,600
have wild wine every day.

1257
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,520
Every day I feel

1258
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,720
one bottle a day.

1259
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,960
Here, Jiang Dunhao.

1260
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,320
This is our fruit juice wine.

1261
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,360
and "Love Sisters",

1262
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,760
Guoli Wild Wine.

1263
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,160
The top ten

1264
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,000
very cute little house members.

1265
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,360
This is so sweet.

1266
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,640
Do you think this is the end?

1267
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,280
No.

1268
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:11,880
Jiang Dunhao and I

1269
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,160
For the audience

1270
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,680
who have been watching

1271
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,000
won

1272
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,280
from Guoli Party.

1273
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,720
Follow Guoli's official account.

1274
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,520
Reply the code in private, "Receiving benefits".

1275
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,360
Join the interaction

1276
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,200
you can participate.

1277
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,960
I'll wait for you to come and get a hundred gifts.

1278
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,000
Great.

1279
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Thank you.

1280
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,600
Before I came here,

1281
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,120
I had a peach-flavored fruit cube.

1282
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,720
to boost my courage.

1283
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:36,920
Really?

1284
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,480
It's 23 degrees Celsius

1285
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,880
let me go at once.

1286
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,360
It seems that many important moments

1287
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,240
in many important moments.

1288
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,560
Yes, I'm an introvert.

1289
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,640
On the first day you came,

1290
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,480
I drank

1291
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,520
a lot of peach-flavored fruit cube.

1292
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,800
You always ask me to taste grapefruit.

1293
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,480
I thought you wanted E.

1294
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,120
It's like the fruit jar I won for the first time.

1295
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,000
It tastes like grapefruit.

1296
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,120
Because of you,

1297
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,040
I became E.

1298
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,120
So we complement each other.

1299
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,920
Cheers.

1300
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,440
(To members of the house.)

1301
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,680
(The confession is over.)

1302
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,680
Please go to the Starry Sky Ballroom.

1303
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,560
Let's go.

1304
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,040
Let's go.

1305
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:26,720
Who's here?

1306
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,200
My hand.

1307
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,640
Soup

1308
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,480
We held hands and came.

1309
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,000
Here, cover it for a while.

1310
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,360
Who are you waiting for?

1311
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,800
Waiting for everyone.

1312
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,600
Why?

1313
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,360
Because we confessed our love here.

1314
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,000
Yes.

1315
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,760
Really?

1316
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,640
Are you inside?

1317
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,120
They're inside.

1318
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,720
Of course.

1319
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,560
Well...

1320
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,440
Don't be too jealous.

1321
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,040
Your confession here

1322
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,680
because it's too cold.

1323
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,520
I want to end it quickly.

1324
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,000
I'm afraid you'll be too cold.

1325
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,480
You're quite generous.

1326
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,720
This little move.

1327
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,360
They are so sweet.

1328
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,240
Coming.

1329
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,200
Sit here.

1330
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,680
What are you holding?

1331
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,080
Isn't it obvious?

1332
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,360
We don't have any.

1333
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,440
You didn't.

1334
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,280
Let's sit here.

1335
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:51,720
Let me see.

1336
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,560
You have long hair.

1337
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,040
He said you have long hair.

1338
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,480
I've kept the middle seat for you.

1339
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,880
Yes, the center.

1340
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,680
Really?

1341
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,240
Yes.

1342
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,040
Let's sit here.

1343
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,640
Really, just sit here.

1344
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,160
The two groups at the back...

1345
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,240
You are...

1346
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,400
Are you "welding" already?

1347
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,320
Are you stuck to each other?

1348
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,760
You're using magic glue.

1349
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,960
Don't lean on me.

1350
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:28,880
Tom.

1351
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,360
How do you feel now?

1352
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,240
I'm so happy.

1353
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,800
Tell us about yours.

1354
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,120
Our...

1355
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:39,960
is to

1356
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,880
I think if I have to take my feelings seriously,

1357
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,640
we might not have enough time.

1358
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,440
So we want to

1359
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,520
to continue

1360
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,040
after this.

1361
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,040
and get to know each other.

1362
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,000
Besides,

1363
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,960
have a very tacit understanding today.

1364
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,840
Yes, a gift.

1365
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,920
Show them together.

1366
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,480
They are all

1367
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,800
for free.

1368
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,520
A bracelet?

1369
00:47:59,520 --> 00:47:59,960
Yes.

1370
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,560
Very tacit this time.

1371
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,600
We're in sync again.

1372
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,240
They gave me one too.

1373
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:04,760
Yes.

1374
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,080
Hua, tell us.

1375
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,640
I think we have a tacit understanding.

1376
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,160
Well,

1377
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,560
Tae-ri is also

1378
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,080
who has a long relationship observation period.

1379
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,440
I didn't understand him at first.

1380
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,360
He said he was under observation for so long.

1381
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,120
I think it might be a dangerous speech.

1382
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,600
He's a bad boy.

1383
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,600
to push away.

1384
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,720
But after I met him,

1385
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,720
I think this is

1386
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,680
very serious about his relationship.

1387
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,080
After we leave the house,

1388
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,680
I think we will have more contact.

1389
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,080
The end of the house

1390
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,440
It doesn't mean us.

1391
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,160
Our end

1392
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,920
may represent our beginning.

1393
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,560
Okay.

1394
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,640
Is it good?

1395
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,200
Cry then.

1396
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,320
Then cry.

1397
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,840
Did your confession go well?

1398
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,120
They're all together.

1399
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,320
How could it not go well?

1400
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,160
How smooth it is.

1401
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,040
Of course.

1402
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,200
It's like tripping.

1403
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,480
Is there anything in the middle?

1404
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,160
Let me tell you.

1405
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
I'm Tom.

1406
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:12,920
And...

1407
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,280
This is my girlfriend, Susu.

1408
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,560
I'm going to cry.

1409
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,520
Help!

1410
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,680
Don't cry.

1411
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,600
Hello, I'm Su Ziyi.

1412
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,480
And

1413
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,560
This is my boyfriend Tom.

1414
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,280
Thank you.

1415
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,000
Kiss.

1416
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,720
Kiss!

1417
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,920
When should we stop kissing?

1418
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,840
Yes. Hurry up.

1419
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,560
Hurry.

1420
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,920
My eyes are welding to them.

1421
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,760
Kiss.

1422
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,640
Kiss.

1423
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,680
OK?

1424
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,160
Kiss.

1425
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,520
Su siblings.

1426
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,640
Kiss!

1427
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,240
Soup.

1428
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:04,640
Hurry up.

1429
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,480
As a man,

1430
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,400
Here.

1431
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,240
Coming.

1432
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,600
You're so reserved.

1433
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,960
The distance is so close.

1434
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,880
Okay.

1435
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,600
I'll give you time to take your time.

1436
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,960
So cheesy.

1437
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,160
I can't stand it.

1438
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,520
I'm not used to it.

1439
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,600
We were laughing so happily.

1440
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,000
What about you?

1441
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,440
This friend with muscle spasm.

1442
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,880
My name is Su Zihao.

1443
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,720
And

1444
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,840
This is mine.

1445
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,760
Girlfriend.

1446
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,040
Congratulations.

1447
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,800
It's my turn to introduce.

1448
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,920
My name is Rolyn.

1449
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,600
Nice to meet you.

1450
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,080
I'm also happy to be friends with you.

1451
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,320
Who's next to you?

1452
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,480
Next to me is

1453
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,360
a stranger.

1454
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,920
Next to me is my boyfriend, Su Zihao.

1455
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,480
Su Sisters.

1456
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,760
I'm so happy.

1457
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,760
I got a lot.

1458
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,080
Harry, give me a kiss.

1459
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,920
He can't wait any longer.

1460
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,600
Aren't you going to show me your ticket?

1461
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,640
I want to show my ticket.

1462
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,320
Look at the ticket I drew for Fatty.

1463
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,560
I thought I'd show my muscles.

1464
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,880
Me too.

1465
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,120
I really drew it.

1466
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,880
I received a ticket today.

1467
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,680
From where?

1468
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,120
You can write any address.

1469
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,640
But you have to exchange it with me within a year.

1470
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,080
Otherwise, the expiration date will be canceled.

1471
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,480
Let's fly from the sun to the sea

1472
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,560
to show off our love.

1473
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,520
Go to Singapore.

1474
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,320
and go to college in Singapore.

1475
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,440
I decided to study again.

1476
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,400
I burst into tears.

1477
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,960
I cried when I read the diary.

1478
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,280
After that, he told me

1479
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,440
he decided

1480
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,640
to confess his love.

1481
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,720
Have you made up your mind?

1482
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,160
He said I had.

1483
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,080
Then I decided to confess my feelings.

1484
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,400
So he told me a lot.

1485
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,480
And my mood

1486
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,920
I was so emotional.

1487
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,280
Then he left.

1488
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,640
No one would confess to me.

1489
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,640
Then I kept waiting.

1490
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,200
and waited.

1491
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,160
He came in.

1492
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,160
Then he came in with the gift.

1493
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,640
Then he was at the door.

1494
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,360
at the door.

1495
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,320
He said

1496
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,600
It's okay. I'm here.

1497
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,120
I'm touched twice, really.

1498
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,800
I'm touched too.

1499
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,960
Because I'm already very relaxed.

1500
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,680
I think it's over.

1501
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,880
I was relaxed and sat there.

1502
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,480
I was so touched and touched.

1503
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,640
Fatty drew a perfect end

1504
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,480
on the journey of Love Sisters.

1505
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,760
This is very precious.

1506
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,720
Yes.

1507
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,880
Great.

1508
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,000
Do you want to show my gift?

1509
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,960
It's too big.

1510
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,680
I think it's okay.

1511
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,240
This is my dog.

1512
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,800
and the flower.

1513
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,880
Is this Bo Niu?

1514
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,880
Yes, let me show you.

1515
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,360
This is Poppet Girl.

1516
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,040
So cute.

1517
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,960
West Highland.

1518
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,120
I learned another thing.

1519
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,440
Remember to ask me to continue your class.

1520
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,560
Next time you confess to Xiao Ling.

1521
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,480
Okay.

1522
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,320
Xiao Ling is happy when you cry.

1523
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,040
This is...

1524
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,640
House.

1525
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,280
Soup.

1526
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,040
The first person.

1527
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,320
The soup is thinner.

1528
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,320
Thank you.

1529
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,280
The second one.

1530
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,720
My forehead.

1531
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,520
The third one.

1532
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,600
Is the heroine...

1533
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,200
Harry.

1534
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,800
Stagnant.

1535
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,360
I'm so flustered.

1536
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,760
You're flustered.

1537
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,680
So bad.

1538
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,120
Really?

1539
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,680
Xinxin.

1540
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,280
So handsome, Terri.

1541
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,560
Cupid's date.

1542
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,840
So sweet.

1543
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,160
Trust me, Tata.

1544
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,080
Come on.

1545
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,160
So sweet.

1546
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,000
Take a look. Turn around.

1547
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,120
Oh no.

1548
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,640
I'm falling in love.

1549
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,240
So sweet.

1550
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,920
That's it.

1551
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,920
I won't be a comedian starting tomorrow

1552
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,720
I won't be a comedian

1553
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,520
Fighting

1554
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,840
This memory is so precious.

1555
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,400
Yes, it's always recorded.

1556
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:48,600
Yes.

1557
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,840
Not only friendship, love.

1558
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,440
Yes.

1559
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,200
or family?

1560
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,040
I think you are an excellent person.

1561
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:56,880
To be honest,

1562
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,840
Turn around.

1563
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,160
Get that out.

1564
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,760
Help me.

1565
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,440
I want to cry even more.

1566
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,000
I'm sorry.

1567
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,600
Time flies.

1568
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,800
It's too fast. It passed in a blink of an eye.

1569
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,720
It's the first time

1570
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,960
with so many people.

1571
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,120
24 hours a day

1572
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,640
24 hours a day.

1573
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,840
I feel that many things can't be recorded.

1574
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,560
Happiness can't be recorded in time.

1575
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,800
It can only be felt with eyes and heart.

1576
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,880
Actually, I hope to stay in the small house

1577
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,600
for a long time.

1578
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,520
for a long, long time

1579
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,480
for a long time.

1580
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,320
We'll have a lot of group activities

1581
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,600
and cook.

1582
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,680
Sitting together makes me feel like a family.

1583
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,360
Happy birthday to you

1584
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,480
So warm.

1585
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,720
A family is united.

1586
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,760
This is a special fate.

1587
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,600
I can't do it anymore.

1588
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,440
Actually,

1589
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,080
afraid of loneliness.

1590
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,040
In life,

1591
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,400
in life.

1592
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,720
Now, before going to bed,

1593
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,240
before sleep.

1594
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:26,960
Every day when we eat,

1595
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,320
when we eat every day.

1596
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,880
In the past 20 days,

1597
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,120
I feel like

1598
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:32,880
home.

1599
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,960
I'm very grateful

1600
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,120
I'm very grateful.

1601
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,240
I'm also very lucky to have this experience.

1602
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,480
Whether in life,

1603
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,000
my attitude towards love,

1604
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,880
and friendship,

1605
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,160
about friendship.

1606
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,880
It's fate

1607
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,680
to gather here for over 20 days.

1608
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,520
Eat and drink together.

1609
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,160
We're all together.

1610
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,240
I feel very lucky

1611
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,600
and very romantic.

1612
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,680
Like that little bird

1613
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,240
waiting for mom to get the earthworms back.

1614
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,840
We're really like playing house.

1615
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,440
We're a family now.

1616
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,080
Cheers.

1617
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,800
Let's go wild and enjoy the world.

1618
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,640
The first season of "Love Sisters".

1619
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,920
It's a wrap.

1620
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,920
This is a high-concentration love experience.

1621
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,640
We are accompanying them.

1622
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,960
When watching these films,

1623
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,440
I feel that

1624
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,080
the most sincere feelings.

1625
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,080
So I believe

1626
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,600
the members of the house are like that.

1627
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,400
Whether it's family or love,

1628
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,720
they must have become

1629
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,920
in the small house.

1630
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,480
Our love family members

1631
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,800
Which roommate

1632
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,800
or which group impressed you the most?

1633
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,400
Susu, soup.

1634
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,320
Me too.

1635
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,000
Jiayi.

1636
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,680
Me too.

1637
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,920
Fatty, Xinxin.

1638
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,440
I think so too.

1639
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,520
Love is praised by too many people.

1640
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,600
We're used to that expression.

1641
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,800
But it seems that

1642
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,040
sometimes we ignore

1643
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,360
our closest siblings.

1644
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:22,600
Just like us.

1645
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,880
in this industry for so many years.

1646
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,680
It's rare to describe

1647
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,560
to focus on brotherhood.

1648
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,080
Because of this show,

1649
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,480
we found that

1650
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,680
that sometimes brotherhood and love

1651
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,040
can be together.

1652
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,360
It turns out that

1653
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,720
there is such a person.

1654
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,360
is quietly

1655
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,600
and protecting us.

1656
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,760
and protect us.

1657
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,720
I think this

1658
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,040
really touched me.

1659
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,400
Because we're used to

1660
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,640
to pursue a love passionately.

1661
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,080
and enjoy a love.

1662
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,360
But you're always

1663
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,280
feel the siblings.

1664
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,280
But it turns out that love is so passionate.

1665
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,120
Sometimes,

1666
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,320
as long as you feel it with your heart,

1667
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,320
you will still

1668
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,480
Really. Tears are like rain.

1669
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:00,960
Yes.

1670
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,520
Actually,

1671
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,760
I think this ending is good.

1672
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,920
Moved for love

1673
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,000
For the brotherhood

1674
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,080
In fact, the soup

1675
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,160
I was touched.

1676
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,160
Because when people take action,

1677
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,040
you always think

1678
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,000
it's hard to change yourself.

1679
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,600
But for 21 days,

1680
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,920
I think the soup has made efforts

1681
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,800
in love and family.

1682
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,600
So he might also tell us

1683
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,400
that for the people worth it,

1684
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,400
For love

1685
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,680
It's not that hard to change

1686
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,000
One small step

1687
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,760
you'll gain a lot of energy.

1688
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,480
Actually, the soup...

1689
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,000
He's been like that since the beginning.

1690
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,280
until the end.

1691
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,080
being with Susu

1692
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,520
has experienced

1693
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,920
a huge change.

1694
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,040
Including his relationship with his sister Xiaoling.

1695
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,280
Their relationship is growing rapidly.

1696
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,800
I think some of the credit

1697
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,840
from Sue.

1698
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,400
Yes.

1699
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,200
Because it's Susu.

1700
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
In this relationship,

1701
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,480
in this relationship

1702
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,120
and make him a better person.

1703
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,760
Actually, I like

1704
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:02,200
the sibling relationship between Harry and Susu.

1705
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,320
Because their whole family

1706
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,960
is the kind of

1707
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,160
to get along.

1708
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,240
Very relaxed.

1709
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,440
Free and happy.

1710
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,520
and say whatever you want.

1711
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,520
We just hang out all day.

1712
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,760
It's a life I've been longing for.

1713
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,560
Whether it's brotherhood or love,

1714
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,720
we're both going for it.

1715
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,600
Yes.

1716
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,160
I like Xiaoling and soup very much.

1717
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,280
Brotherhood.

1718
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,520
Because they really grew up

1719
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,640
in a relatively strict family environment.

1720
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,560
So their

1721
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,480
should be polite.

1722
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,640
Be modest and control yourself.

1723
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,000
And Xiaoling deserves (better).

1724
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,360
I think Xiaoling

1725
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,640
represents

1726
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,480
a very good girl.

1727
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,360
a very typical reflection.

1728
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,800
She has been doing very well.

1729
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,600
When you see her,

1730
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,480
in love,

1731
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,680
in love,

1732
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,560
you'll be very sad.

1733
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,920
And I'm glad

1734
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,120
in this show,

1735
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:57,640
in this show

1736
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,800
with Tom.

1737
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,360
I think

1738
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,400
the book that Mr. Lynn often mentioned.

1739
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,560
I like that book too.

1740
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,640
There's a saying

1741
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,320
in "The Brave of being Hated".

1742
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,160
the pain of people

1743
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,880
comes from relationships.

1744
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,040
But I think most people's happiness

1745
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,120
comes from relationships.

1746
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,240
Whether it's family, friendship, love,

1747
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,560
you take it seriously.

1748
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,680
any kind of love

1749
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,560
you can give love and get love.

1750
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,680
These things are

1751
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,520
very instinctive

1752
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,760
and unbreakable source of happiness.

1753
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,880
So Xiaoling is great.

1754
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,240
She's really an excellent girl.

1755
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,040
Yes, from beginning to end, look.

1756
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,680
She makes me feel very comfortable.

1757
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,800
And we also believe that

1758
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,200
will meet someone who loves her

1759
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,440
who loves her very much.

1760
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,960
She deserves it.

1761
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,920
I think what I said to Xiaoling

1762
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,720
to Xinxin.

1763
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,840
Because I can't accept

1764
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,120
who was talking to me the other second.

1765
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,840
didn't say anything to me.

1766
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,560
Then he suddenly turned around and fell in love with someone else.

1767
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,480
But I think

1768
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,480
Esther's expression and performance

1769
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,520
are very decent.

1770
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,920
And she's a big woman.

1771
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,760
A girl with strong inner core.

1772
01:03:59,440 --> 01:03:59,720
Yes.

1773
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,280
So I also think

1774
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,920
will meet a better man

1775
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,880
a better man for her.

1776
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,360
Yes.

1777
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,120
Good love must be waiting for you too.

1778
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:07,800
Xin.

1779
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,160
Come on.

1780
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,880
I want to tell Hua

1781
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,560
I may not know

1782
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,480
if you love yourself more

1783
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,240
do you love yourself more?

1784
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,400
Have you ever

1785
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,480
with your past

1786
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,840
in the past.

1787
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,360
But I still wish you

1788
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,200
I hope you can understand

1789
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,320
that in our psychology,

1790
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,520
that

1791
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,360
Sometimes the more you fight against something,

1792
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,440
the more you fight against.

1793
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,440
The more you accept it,

1794
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,640
the more you accept.

1795
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,240
So get along with yourself.

1796
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,880
Accept yourself and love yourself.

1797
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,720
I think the whole season

1798
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,560
It's not easy.

1799
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,000
I'm very grateful to the ten of them

1800
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,560
to share

1801
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,160
in front of the screen

1802
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,400
Very personal.

1803
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:54,720
Yes.

1804
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,320
I think it's hard.

1805
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,080
And they have to accept

1806
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:58,760
discussions

1807
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,960
good things.

1808
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,280
Bad things.

1809
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:01,560
Yes.

1810
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,880
So no matter what, I think

1811
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,200
I saw everyone

1812
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,240
happy and positive.

1813
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,960
And we made this relationship, friendship, family relationship.

1814
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,560
I think it's worth it.

1815
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,320
Don't care about so many things.

1816
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,480
I think we should care about their memories.

1817
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,520
I think this is the best.

1818
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,480
Let's applaud

1819
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,680
to our brave members.

1820
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,400
Thank you.

1821
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,400
I hope you can always believe

1822
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,560
that there will always be people who love you because you are you.

1823
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,840
We also hope that

1824
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,560
can continue

1825
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,960
and continue to express love

1826
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,680
in our lives.

1827
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,840
In this journey,

1828
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,440
no matter what the result is,

1829
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,000
whether we've gained love,

1830
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,520
But we must have become

1831
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,520
a better family and lover.

1832
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,640
Thank you again.

1833
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,440
for giving us

1834
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,280
for our first season

1835
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,680
This is the end of our first season.

1836
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,480
It's time to say goodbye.

1837
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,800
Unwilling

1838
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,200
Let's say our slogan for the last time.

1839
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,720
Love Sisters

1840
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,560
Double the love.

1841
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,040
It's really over.

1842
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,240
Love Sisters.

1843
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,840
This song should go with those two.

1844
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,080
If it weren't for those two,

1845
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,280
I got goose bumps.

1846
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,720
Why do we look like this?

1847
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,520
I hope my baby will look like this in the future.

1848
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,160
You've never had this expression in the whole season.

1849
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:19,080
12:00 p.m. on Thursday. Members will enjoy
