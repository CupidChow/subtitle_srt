1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
Feels like we have wild wine right away.

3
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,520
Feels like there's a wild wine.

4
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,840
will watch Love Sisters first.

5
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,000
Love Siblings.

6
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,960
Double the love.

7
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,560
Dear friends,

8
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,280
Welcome to

9
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,680
(Brothers intervene in relationships.)

10
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,480
"Love Sisters".

11
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,960
This show is called "Little Wild Wine",

12
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
IYI, IYI,

13
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,520
I'm Joo Dan.

14
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,800
We're a dating family member.

15
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:21,720
Yes.

16
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,440
From today on,

17
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
in the future,

18
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,320
we will stand in different families

19
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,600
from different families

20
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,960
with different families.

21
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,440
our "Love Sisters".

22
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,400
Yes.

23
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,200
What kind of family are you from?

24
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,079
I'm the eldest sister at home.

25
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,160
I have a sister.

26
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,320
And I'm a mother.

27
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,320
I have a son and a daughter.

28
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,120
She's seven years old.

29
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,240
And my son

30
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,520
My brother is four years old.

31
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,880
So I have a family perspective.

32
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,400
and parents.

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
Yes, as a sister.

34
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,240
That's why I have a double perspective.

35
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,640
I have a brother and a sister

36
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,600
I have a brother and a sister.

37
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,800
and a daughter.

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,040
A son.

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,920
Yes, my daughter is 14 years old.

40
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,120
My son is 11 years old.

41
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,640
So I'm very excited this time.

42
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,680
It depends on how young people date.

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,680
Because next,

44
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,040
I have to face the kids.

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,640
There are also

46
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,320
Eye to eye.

47
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,360
Yes, so I'm looking forward to it.

48
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,320
From my perspective,

49
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,560
I have a real brother.

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,520
And I look forward to having a son and a daughter.

51
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We sit together

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,399
Soon.

54
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,480
Yes, very soon.

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,760
What is this seat?

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,120
A seat of fortune, you know?

57
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,360
Soon. How about we take turns to sit next time?

58
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,640
If you need anything,

59
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,040
This is a couch for the second child.

60
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,240
I want to see

61
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,760
how other siblings get along.

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,440
Because I think my relationship with my brother

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,640
meet each other when we're in trouble.

64
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,840
Don't contact him often.

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,360
Does your brother care more about you?

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,600
No, he won't.

67
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,120
Does he care about your love life IYI

68
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,200
I'm not qualified.

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,800
My two brothers are twins.

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,040
Yes.

71
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,600
When I was young,

72
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
they joined forces to beat me.

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
Then I fought them alone.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,960
Will you

75
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,360
will you care about their relationship?

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,080
Never.

77
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,480
And my brother is in a relationship.

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,159
and take them home.

79
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,640
My parents

80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,920
eat together.

81
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,040
Not very formal.

82
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,800
My parents have met

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,200
all of us in love.

84
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm an only child.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,320
But I can't give up even when I'm here.

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,680
I have nine different parents.

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,640
and even established a "family enterprise".

88
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
Let's welcome "Chairman"

89
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,880
to our show.

90
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,960
for the next season.

91
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
for the next season.

92
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,600
Bring ten people along.

93
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,520
I have a younger sister who is 12 years younger than me.

94
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,160
12 years younger than me.

95
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,040
You'll spoil your sister too, right?

96
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
I dote on her very much.

97
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,760
The kind of love that's in my hands.

98
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,520
If she's in a relationship,

99
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,760
if she's in a relationship,

100
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,000
But I'll let her try more

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,600
and experience

102
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Our Love Sisters

103
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,560
is a combination of different families in China.

104
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,080
and several brothers

105
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,600
and the boys and girls

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,480
our show.

107
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,720
We will observe them

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,760
to observe them

109
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,360
and see if they can meet love.

110
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,560
And in this process,

111
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,840
in this process.

112
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,720
what their family brings to themselves.

113
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,120
and what kind of attitude

114
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,840
when you choose a partner.

115
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,400
I've been paying attention to

116
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,440
is whether love

117
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,720
is pure or complicated.

118
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
Many people say

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
that love is a relationship

120
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,400
between people.

121
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Some friends said

122
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,920
when you're in love,

123
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,600
The family behind you

124
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,960
So

125
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,720
I always hear different voices.

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,600
But this show

127
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
combine love and family

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,880
are actually combined.

129
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,560
Siblings represent

130
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,880
family more relationships.

131
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,280
and love.

132
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,320
You have to consider your IVII

133
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,280
and your siblings.

134
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,080
I think when intersection,

135
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,000
it will become

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,600
the essence of love

137
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
is a little complicated.

138
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,000
So I came to see it.

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
I was curious.

140
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,640
Yes.

141
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,600
Because I'm here

142
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,480
with my brothers.

143
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,680
When you're in a relationship,

144
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,960
or being friendly,

145
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,159
you'll be watched from the back.

146
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,800
Yes, you feel like a live commentary is evaluating you.

147
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,360
I think their relationship

148
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,720
will become closer

149
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,920
they will be closer

150
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,000
and understand each other better.

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,920
Because these things

152
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,840
like you said,

153
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,960
you won't get involved in their relationship.

154
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,120
But in this show,

155
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,280
in this show.

156
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,600
Because I'm also

157
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,080
my brother-in-law.

158
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,159
He introduced my wife to me.

159
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,240
Really?

160
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Yeah, my brother-in-law and I are close.

161
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,160
Because my brother-in-law took me to the gym.

162
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,520
Then we'll always be together.

163
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,880
Yeah, so we have this kind of relationship.

164
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,520
So I think

165
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,520
the vibe of "Love Sisters".

166
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,600
Yes, in this atmosphere,

167
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
I think this is interesting.

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
We have comrades working together.

169
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,400
I hope that through our show,

170
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,080
love is not limited to love.

171
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,120
but also brotherhood.

172
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,040
No one in this show

173
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,080
will leave alone.

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,280
Because behind you

175
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,640
behind you.

176
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,880
Are you ready?

177
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,840
I want to see it.

178
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,040
I can't wait.

179
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,440
It's obviously Beijing.

180
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,760
Yes.

181
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,880
A secret relationship.

182
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,040
Is this where they live?

183
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,720
Yes.

184
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
He has good clothes.

185
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,680
His eyes are too excellent.

186
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,680
Tall and handsome.

187
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,760
Maybe a model.

188
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,240
He didn't read the rules.

189
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,280
and rushed into the door.

190
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,840
This house is so beautiful.

191
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,880
There are so many books.

192
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
I feel like I'm in a daze.

193
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,360
He has no big ups and downs.

194
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,560
He's stable.

195
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,360
Right?

196
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,880
I finally see the rules.

197
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,440
He's really...

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,720
This is a good drone.

199
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,920
Yes, the facial expression didn't change much.

200
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,960
It's more introverted.

201
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,720
Yeah.

202
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,800
Here comes the girl.

203
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,080
So pretty.

204
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,160
I'm sure you're not siblings.

205
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,280
Yes.

206
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,680
Of course not.

207
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,000
They don't look alike.

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,920
Yes, he doesn't.

209
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,280
Oh no.

210
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,280
Rules of check-in.

211
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,360
How to open it?

212
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,080
Nice, cool.

213
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
No response.

214
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,720
So cute.

215
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,280
Hello.

216
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,160
Did you avoid your eyes?

217
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,600
One.

218
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,480
No eye contact.

219
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,200
Thank you.

220
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,680
Here, slippers.

221
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,120
Okay.

222
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,880
And

223
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,920
There's a rack here.

224
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,520
Okay.

225
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,840
This isn't for brother and sister.

226
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,960
I think so.

227
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,040
Because they have to hide their relationship.

228
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,000
Put down your clothes first.

229
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,040
This smile is the key.

230
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,520
I haven't made a face all the time.

231
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,000
You suddenly have a face.

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,560
It's like I'll see how you act.

233
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,360
But maybe

234
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,160
girls are his type.

235
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,480
Hello.

236
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,760
What's your name?

237
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,320
Susu.

238
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,440
Susu.

239
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,040
Yes.

240
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:15,920
What about you?

241
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
Just call me Soup.

242
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,320
Soup. Okay.

243
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,520
Suzhou Soup Noodles.

244
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,600
We have the group name.

245
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,560
Foreigners?

246
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,200
I'm from Xinjiang.

247
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,120
You'll know later.

248
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,920
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,720
You can't ask.

250
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,560
You can read the rules.

251
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,160
Okay.

252
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,440
Is this the same as the one at the door?

253
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,480
Is there one at the door?

254
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,080
It's the gate.

255
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
I didn't see it.

256
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,880
I asked too much. Sorry.

257
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,200
I think their communication is quite natural.

258
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm already into it.

259
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000
He has OCD.

260
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,680
is quite awkward.

261
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,360
Not bad.

262
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,960
What can we talk about?

263
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,160
What's your MBTI?

264
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,120
Take a guess.

265
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,000
I guess.

266
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,560
Are you an introvert?

267
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,320
No.

268
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,360
You are E.

269
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,320
E.

270
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,720
You are an introvert.

271
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,680
OK.

272
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,680
I guess

273
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,520
INTP.

274
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,040
No.

275
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,160
How many mistakes?

276
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,920
Two mistakes.

277
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
But I already know.

278
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,320
ISFP.

279
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,520
ENTJ.

280
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,200
You are T (logical).

281
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,440
I really think

282
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,360
are not siblings.

283
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,080
No.

284
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,680
Right?

285
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,160
You're shy and shy.

286
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm thirsty.

287
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,800
I want some water.

288
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,400
Fridge.

289
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,160
Look.

290
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,200
There are

291
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,680
some

292
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I can drink.

293
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,840
Do you want to try it? Do you want it?

294
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
No, you drink.

295
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,720
No.

296
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,120
I'm not thirsty.

297
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,840
Thank you.

298
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Let me try.

299
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,920
It's okay.

300
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,280
Water.

301
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,200
I think

302
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,480
naive and cute.

303
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,800
Why do I feel that the soup

304
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,840
at first sight?

305
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,320
Wait.

306
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
I think boys have been observing her.

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,360
Yes. So affectionate.

308
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,160
And

309
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,120
he's very straightforward.

310
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,400
Yes.

311
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,080
He didn't hide himself.

312
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,240
He said I was curious about you.

313
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,680
I've been watching you.

314
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,280
But that girl is a little shy.

315
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:32,840
The second girl.

316
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Another girl.

317
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,520
Beautiful.

318
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,160
You can't tell anyone here.

319
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,640
who you are.

320
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,119
Please call each other by names.

321
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,200
The last day of love confession.

322
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,880
Okay.

323
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,880
Let's go.

324
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,319
Her personality is

325
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,520
very cheerful and straightforward.

326
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,079
Yes.

327
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,880
A fierce knocking sound.

328
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,840
It's quite loud.

329
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,880
Hello.

330
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,840
Okay, thank you.

331
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,800
Close the door.

332
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,880
Shoes.

333
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,280
Okay.

334
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,120
Here.

335
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,560
Why do I think

336
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,640
she might be her brother.

337
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,600
I'll take your luggage.

338
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,520
It's okay. Thank you.

339
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:57,760
Okay.

340
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,320
Look at that expression. Look.

341
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,880
Yes, I think it's (siblings).

342
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,200
You can hang it here.

343
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,880
Okay.

344
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,120
Do you want some water?

345
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,760
Okay, thank you.

346
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,720
Why don't you take a look?

347
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,120
Okay, I'll do it myself.

348
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,440
You're still avoiding it.

349
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes.

350
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Turn around.

351
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,760
as if you were very rude to him.

352
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,200
Right?

353
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,840
Yes.

354
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,880
And I think they are siblings.

355
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,280
Yes, maybe.

356
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,000
We've locked it.

357
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,680
I haven't asked your name yet.

358
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,680
Hua.

359
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,000
Hello, what's your name?

360
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,800
Susu.

361
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,680
Shu, which comb?

362
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,480
Susu.

363
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,960
Su from Suzhou.

364
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,240
Yes.

365
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,040
So REATFUN.

366
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm Soup.

367
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,080
Soup?

368
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,320
Which soup?

369
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,640
Soup for soup.

370
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,840
are all folded words.

371
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,120
Look, she asked him his name.

372
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,800
Then he smiled.

373
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,000
I think it must be sister and brother.

374
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,040
And sister's acting

375
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,120
Acting

376
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,560
Yes, better than the younger one.

377
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,280
Who will come in first?

378
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,480
I came in first.

379
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
Did you stay long?

380
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,720
It was awkward.

381
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,000
It should be okay to be alone.

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,760
I think there will be some when it's just the two of us.

383
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,040
No.

384
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,200
We just talked about MBTI.

385
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,600
What are you?

386
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,040
Guess.

387
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,600
I (introverted)

388
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,400
You are...

389
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
I (introverted)

390
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,280
E.

391
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,320
Yes, E.

392
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,360
I'm an ISFP.

393
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,320
It's totally different.

394
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,720
Yes.

395
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,720
ENTJ.

396
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,120
ISFP.

397
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,960
We have two different personalities.

398
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,800
E.

399
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,240
It's obvious.

400
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,840
It looks too obvious.

401
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,520
ENFP.

402
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,720
"Happy Puppy".

403
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,600
Me too.

404
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,280
It's quite similar.

405
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,480
Let me disguise myself.

406
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,280
I'm not actually...

407
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,400
I lied to you.

408
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Another guy.

409
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,640
Handsome man

410
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,080
This is quite handsome.

411
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,440
Rules of check-in.

412
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,320
You can't tell anyone who's your brother

413
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,960
or siblings here.

414
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,360
Can we judge

415
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,480
through his accent?

416
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,960
Just listen to his accent.

417
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,120
You want to open it?

418
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,480
Whose door is open?

419
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,840
What if I can't get in?

420
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm trapped.

421
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,040
Why didn't you knock?

422
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,920
You give up so soon?

423
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,520
Lazy.

424
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,280
Because I was thinking

425
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,400
No wonder no one opened the door

426
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,000
The one who studied Greek

427
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,160
Thinker

428
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,080
Make a pose.

429
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,280
So cute.

430
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,280
This door doesn't work, right?

431
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,480
You don't have the key

432
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,600
nor a password.

433
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,080
Why is the door not working?

434
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,920
It works well. I locked you outside.

435
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,760
Someone's here.

436
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,440
It sounds like a man.

437
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,040
Hello.

438
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,600
Come in.

439
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,560
Take off your shoes here?

440
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,160
Yes.

441
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,520
Yes.

442
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,120
Hello.

443
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,960
It's freezing.

444
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,440
Her lips are twitching.

445
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,760
Let's go inside.

446
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,440
What's your name?

447
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,160
Hua.

448
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,360
Susu.

449
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,160
Call me by my English name, Harry.

450
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,960
A Chinese boy who studied abroad.

451
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,160
Ten Men and Nine Harry.

452
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,120
He laughed.

453
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,320
I think his henchmen might be there.

454
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,720
My first impression of Harry was him.

455
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
The northeast smell is strong.

456
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,000
It smells northeast.

457
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,440
Take a small bag.

458
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,920
I was thinking about your luggage.

459
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,200
That's all I thought.

460
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,040
Just sit here, right?

461
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,160
Have a seat.

462
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,120
It's not that awkward to be less people.

463
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,040
It's not that awkward to have more people.

464
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,200
Really?

465
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,640
The four of us

466
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,200
What is MBTI?

467
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,560
I'll scare you to death if I tell you.

468
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
So cute.

469
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,640
INFJ.

470
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,080
Do you believe it?

471
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,120
He's an introvert.

472
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,240
I'm an introvert.

473
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm an introvert.

474
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,320
I feel so awkward.

475
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,880
So I kept talking.

476
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,640
Do you understand?

477
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,920
Really?

478
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,480
Yes.

479
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,200
That's a match.

480
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,680
One I (introverted) and E.

481
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
You are an introvert.

482
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,080
I'm INFJ.

483
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,680
I'm E.

484
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,520
Which one of us is E?

485
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,800
You've been talking all the time.

486
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,400
He didn't talk.

487
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,920
No, I'm embarrassed.

488
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,040
True or false E

489
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,360
Tell me. It’s fun.

490
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,760
We won't be embarrassed if I tell you.

491
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,880
It's fun.

492
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,720
I (introverted) is more interesting.

493
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,960
I (introverted) people are E (outgoing). Toys.

494
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,040
It's not that there's no I in the northeast.

495
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,080
Yes.

496
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,000
Northeast China is the most introverted.

497
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,440
That's it.

498
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,480
You're so introverted.

499
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,200
Close your eyes.

500
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay, I won't sit here.

501
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,040
I need to take a walk.

502
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,800
He doesn't want to be awkward sitting here.

503
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,160
The gym.

504
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,480
He's mumbling.

505
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,920
Yes.

506
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,560
Search.

507
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
A explosive type.

508
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,800
To a strange place

509
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,920
Basketball court.

510
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,680
I usually play badminton.

511
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,840
I looked outside.

512
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,320
There's a house that needs to be unlocked.

513
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
A date.

514
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,880
You should use it on a date.

515
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,160
and sand pit.

516
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,920
for long jumping.

517
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,000
badminton.

518
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,920
Basketball.

519
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,160
Do you play basketball?

520
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,960
You're so tall.

521
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,160
So tall

522
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,120
It's a pity not to play basketball.

523
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,200
What a pity.

524
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
A stereotype.

525
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,320
Not stereotype.

526
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,920
How tall are you?

527
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,640
I'm less than 1.9 meters.

528
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,560
I'm less than two meters.

529
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,680
I'm less than two meters. What a coincidence.

530
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm over 1 meter tall.

531
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,080
187 meters.

532
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,160
So tall.

533
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,640
I have a hunchback.

534
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,760
I'll buy you a back height.

535
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm hungry.

536
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,960
I'm very hungry now

537
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,160
I'm also hungry

538
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Very hungry

539
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,120
He hasn't eaten for six hours.

540
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,440
He talks so much.

541
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,600
This is a funny I (introvert).

542
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,200
Yeah.

543
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
He's so cute.

544
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,640
Can you cook?

545
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,280
A little.

546
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,040
But not much.

547
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,200
A little

548
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,920
It's edible.

549
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,560
Ramyeon.

550
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm not hungry.

551
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,960
Do you think Harry

552
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,200
He's natural.

553
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,120
He's relaxed.

554
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,080
Or a little nervous?

555
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,560
I'm nervous too.

556
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,760
I have the right to say that.

557
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,200
Because I also

558
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,840
InFJ.

559
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,360
In a occasion,

560
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,400
especially strange occasions.

561
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,280
We don't know each other.

562
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,640
I found that no one spoke.

563
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,760
I want to avoid it.

564
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,160
I want to avoid it.

565
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,440
No.

566
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,200
I want the stage to stay cool.

567
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,920
Yes. Although I'm an introvert,

568
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,440
But

569
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,360
Try your best.

570
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,200
Yes, I want to do my best.

571
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,920
to warm up this place.

572
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,880
But if we find

573
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,160
this place is already very hot,

574
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,520
I think I might not be needed.

575
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,840
I would step back.

576
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,800
So I quite like him.

577
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,600
I like Harry.

578
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,280
Yes.

579
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,440
Harry is actually nervous.

580
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,280
In psychology,

581
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,760
there is a thing called defense mechanism.

582
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,320
For example, Harry.

583
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,320
He expresses himself

584
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,080
in the way

585
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,560
emotions and ideas.

586
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,400
So far, you are more confident

587
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,760
who and who could be brothers.

588
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,520
I thought the soup and flowers

589
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,200
Right?

590
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,280
I think so.

591
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,520
I think soup and flowers

592
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,120
you still think

593
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,080
They... Yes.

594
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,800
They are sisters and younger brothers.

595
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,000
So Harry doesn't have

596
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,360
No.

597
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,920
Harry looks like an only child.

598
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,160
Let's see who's next.

599
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,800
One hand.

600
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,960
Hana was clapping the door just now.

601
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,960
We must be a family.

602
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,680
Boys.

603
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,120
Do you want to come with me?

604
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,840
It's so ritual.

605
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,480
When you came,

606
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,840
when you came here?

607
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,600
Of course.

608
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,440
You're so nice.

609
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,400
Let me do it.

610
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,760
Wait.

611
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,600
Welcome

612
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,800
Hello.

613
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,880
This is what you call chubby.

614
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,840
Just come in.

615
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,200
He doesn't even dare to look.

616
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,560
Do you want to change slippers?

617
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,360
Yes, you change.

618
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,360
Are you an I (introvert)?

619
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,000
or E?

620
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,120
E.

621
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,000
Bag E.

622
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,600
OK.

623
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
You can put your luggage here.

624
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,680
Okay.

625
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,640
He looks shy.

626
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,120
What should I call you?

627
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,760
They call me Fatty.

628
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,520
Fatty.

629
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,320
Fatty.

630
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,480
Fatty.

631
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,000
The fat we understand?

632
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,440
Yes.

633
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,920
Maybe I'm fat.

634
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,160
No.

635
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Why do I suddenly feel

636
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,280
he is a bit like Hua?

637
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,240
Yes, he looks away.

638
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,320
Aren't you cold?

639
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
I'm sweating.

640
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,400
It's freezing.

641
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,440
I'll get you a cup of hot water.

642
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,400
Yes, a cup of hot water for you.

643
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
Let's go.

644
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,560
Yeah, I don't know your name yet.

645
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
Let's introduce ourselves.

646
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,840
Just call me Soup.

647
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,600
Soup?

648
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,720
My name is Harry.

649
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,160
Harry.

650
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,560
What about you?

651
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,640
Susu.

652
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,840
Hua.

653
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,280
Okay.

654
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,760
Got it?

655
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,120
Do it.

656
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,480
You don't need to take the exam later, right?

657
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,000
You have to take it later.

658
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,120
Everyone comes in and asks.

659
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,720
Okay.

660
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,720
Got it?

661
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,960
I think I do.

662
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,960
He looks so awkward.

663
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,160
Why do I think Hua and Fatty are impossible?

664
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,720
I still insist on flowers and soup.

665
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,240
It's the same when they pat the door.

666
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,760
We're a family.

667
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,880
So we're waiting for them now.

668
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:10,840
Yes.

669
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,280
We can also talk.

670
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,120
But we don't know what to say.

671
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,760
We're always I (introverted).

672
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,880
He's guiding the rhythm to feel juice wine.

673
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,920
Isn't this I (introverted)?

674
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,720
I don't think you did it right.

675
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,440
Do it again.

676
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,200
Let me tell you.

677
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,920
I've tested it 20 times.

678
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,720
Joon

679
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,720
Another 2025 version

680
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,480
Okay.

681
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,200
Are you from Guangdong?

682
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
You can't guess

683
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,040
I didn't guess HAVEG I asked

684
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,600
I didn’t guess.

685
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,000
I asked you as soon as I came in.

686
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,760
You said you couldn't tell me.

687
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,160
I'm already on it.

688
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,120
Really.

689
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,840
The next one should be a girl.

690
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,880
It should be a girl.

691
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,440
Yes.

692
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,720
Soup.

693
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,160
High nose.

694
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,280
Sister or sister in the soup

695
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,120
They look so alike.

696
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,160
I feel so embarrassed.

697
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,400
What we said 20 minutes ago

698
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,560
I'm sure.

699
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,840
It looks exactly the same.

700
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,960
This is female version of soup.

701
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,000
Look at him.

702
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,920
Let's see how he acts.

703
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,720
This must be a girl.

704
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,520
Because of the sound of nails knocking on the door.

705
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,160
Girl hurry

706
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,560
Let's go.

707
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,040
I'm here.

708
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,520
Hello.

709
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,640
Come in

710
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,240
Come in.

711
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,080
Let me help you.

712
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,760
Hello.

713
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,360
Thank you.

714
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:49,880
Look.

715
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,960
I have a service.

716
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,200
Master, come.

717
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,320
Master, come.

718
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,800
The head of the family?

719
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,800
Yes.

720
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,120
Why are you laughing?

721
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,600
They really look alike.

722
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
Really

723
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,120
I can't help it.

724
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,320
I can't even hide them.

725
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,000
The show is over.

726
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,720
Have a seat.

727
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,720
They look alike.

728
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,960
They look so alike.

729
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:24,760
Come on.

730
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,560
Come on.

731
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:26,720
Okay.

732
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,360
Sit next to each other.

733
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,920
Thank you.

734
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
Excuse me.

735
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,360
Sit next to each other.

736
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,320
Is it crowded?

737
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,520
I'm Xiaoling.

738
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,160
It's so funny.

739
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,040
Hua.

740
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,720
Hello.

741
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,480
Hello, Hua.

742
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,880
Susu.

743
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,440
Okay.

744
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
My name is Harry.

745
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,040
Harry.

746
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,360
Yes.

747
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
Soup.

748
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,800
Okay.

749
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,280
His smile

750
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,640
He smiled.

751
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:49,880
His smile

752
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,960
The soup is smiling.

753
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,920
He's staring at them.

754
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,160
Fatty.

755
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,040
What?

756
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,680
Fatty.

757
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,600
My name is easier to remember.

758
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,080
Okay.

759
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,400
What should we do?

760
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,120
The Ming card is...

761
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,760
It's so obvious.

762
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,800
It's too obvious.

763
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,720
I want to laugh when Xiaoling comes in.

764
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,640
They look like a family.

765
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,680
I can tell at a glance.

766
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,360
Oh no.

767
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,840
I haven't started yet.

768
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,560
Hide.

769
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,520
Master, why don't you give me some?

770
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,600
What do you want to drink?

771
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,200
A few people want water

772
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,120
Take a look.

773
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,040
Okay.

774
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,160
Pour me a cup of hot water.

775
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,840
Here.

776
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,320
Well,

777
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,200
or don't...

778
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,000
Just take it.

779
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,720
Thank you.

780
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,320
Can everyone cook?

781
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,160
I don't know how.

782
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,240
Me neither.

783
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,520
Not really.

784
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,400
Can you?

785
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,920
Then I can only do it.

786
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
You can only...

787
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,000
Oh no.

788
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,880
Can you cook, Harry?

789
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,320
Did you cook well?

790
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,120
Very delicious.

791
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,280
I've never seen anyone who cooks better than me.

792
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,920
To be honest,

793
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,120
So you really know how to cook?

794
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,960
I really know how to cook.

795
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
Yes

796
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,480
That's a chef.

797
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,000
He doesn't know how to spin the spoon.

798
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,560
That's a spoon.

799
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,400
Okay.

800
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,920
I only know how to cook.

801
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,680
Rub hands.

802
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:30,760
No.

803
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,560
I only know how to cook.

804
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,800
Rub your hands.

805
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,360
Amazing.

806
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,360
Amazing.

807
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,880
Let's buy more frozen ones later.

808
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,680
Are you on a diet?

809
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,720
Here.

810
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,200
I'm here to lose weight.

811
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,840
Me too.

812
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,240
Me too.

813
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,120
Go out after you're done.

814
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,920
Really?

815
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,200
How much do you want to lose?

816
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,160
Try to be fat when you come in.

817
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
When you go out, it's called slim.

818
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,120
Someone is coming again.

819
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,800
Male University (Student)

820
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,840
I like it.

821
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,920
Youth University (Student)

822
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,840
Here.

823
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,880
Welcome

824
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,920
Coming

825
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,840
Hello

826
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,159
Hello.

827
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,840
It's like a close.

828
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,360
Really (alike).

829
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,760
Hello.

830
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,719
Hello.

831
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,560
E.

832
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,199
Guess.

833
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,480
E.

834
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,920
Why is it so quiet?

835
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,159
E.

836
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,880
He is definitely E.

837
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,600
You are I (introverted).

838
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,400
I'm E.

839
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,360
I knew it.

840
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,880
ENFP.

841
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,520
"Happy Puppy".

842
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,080
Yes.

843
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,800
You too?

844
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,520
Thank you.

845
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,120
Share the happy puppies with each other.

846
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,560
I think he and Susu are siblings.

847
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:09,960
Hello, everyone.

848
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,640
My name is Tu.

849
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,280
Tu?

850
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,840
Yes, everyone calls me Tu.

851
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,520
Which character?

852
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,160
The picture of the big ear.

853
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,600
It does look like it.

854
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,800
Yes. And...

855
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
I just said

856
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,680
I'm an ENFP.

857
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,160
And I'm

858
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,960
outgoing.

859
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,280
If you need any help,

860
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,880
you can come to me.

861
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,520
Okay.

862
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,280
Can you cook?

863
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,080
Can you cook?

864
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,480
Can I cook?

865
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,600
Not really.

866
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,920
Oh no.

867
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,600
Oh no.

868
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,760
Oh no.

869
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,280
Did you just talk about cooking?

870
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,880
No one knows how to cook.

871
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,480
No one can.

872
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,600
I (introverted) will...

873
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,720
OK.

874
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,560
Xiao Ling and soup.

875
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,640
They look like siblings or siblings.

876
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,320
I think Susu

877
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,160
a little shy.

878
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,920
Flower is a beautiful girl.

879
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,640
She's also very generous.

880
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,920
There are many details

881
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,560
I can't be sure yet.

882
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,720
Our girls are so pretty.

883
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,080
She's so hard to guess.

884
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,960
This is a little like

885
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,240
like a sister.

886
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Just knock on the door.

887
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,400
Let's go together.

888
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,040
Let's go.

889
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,880
Together.

890
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,120
Hello.

891
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,360
Can someone help me move the boxes?

892
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,800
Let me help you.

893
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,280
It's hard to move with high heels.

894
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,600
She's the first girl

895
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
to help carry the luggage.

896
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,200
ask for help.

897
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,400
and show weakness.

898
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,520
You're all here.

899
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,760
Hello.

900
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,160
Here.

901
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Come on.

902
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
So thin.

903
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,360
No.

904
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,480
You're all skinny.

905
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,120
Your clothes.

906
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,600
You can put it here if you want to take it off.

907
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,320
If you don't,

908
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,080
you don't have to.

909
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,800
Take it off.

910
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,800
So I'm the last one.

911
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,160
Yes.

912
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,920
You're the last one.

913
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,080
I guess there are only eight people.

914
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,920
There are only eight plates on the table.

915
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,680
What's your name?

916
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,080
Hello.

917
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,920
My name is Xinxin.

918
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,680
Esther.

919
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,320
Xinxin.

920
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,280
Okay, you're the only one. You're not folding, Xiaoling.

921
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,200
And me.

922
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,920
I didn't suspect you did it on purpose.

923
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,760
Hua.

924
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,640
Hello.

925
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,360
Susu.

926
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,040
Hello.

927
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm Harry.

928
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,800
Harry.

929
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,040
English name or Chinese?

930
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,600
English.

931
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,320
Are you shocked?

932
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,040
Soup.

933
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,080
Soup.

934
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,720
Fatty.

935
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,560
Map.

936
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,120
Yes.

937
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,240
Your ears are so cute.

938
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
Yes, the map of the big ear.

939
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,600
It's cute.

940
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,440
Yes.

941
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,520
And I'm Xiao Ling.

942
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,440
Xiao Ling.

943
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,720
I think the soup and Xiaoling

944
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,960
must be real brothers.

945
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,520
They could be twins.

946
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,720
They are so handsome.

947
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,680
I think Susu and the map are siblings.

948
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,760
or Xin.

949
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,400
Can you cook?

950
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,200
Excuse me.

951
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,760
A little.

952
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,840
What?

953
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,440
We can do it a little bit.

954
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,720
But we are humble.

955
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,960
In our team,

956
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,160
has a good cook

957
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,040
Hua.

958
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,000
Sit in the middle.

959
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,560
Hua.

960
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Right.

961
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,600
We all saw it.

962
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,720
Sit down.

963
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,440
You can't go out from today.

964
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,680
No one can eat.

965
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,640
I'll call and tell them I'm going out.

966
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,360
I'm going out.

967
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,160
I want to laugh when I see her.

968
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,760
Remember her name is Xiaoling.

969
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,480
Don't call her by her nickname.

970
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,920
Or call her sister.

971
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,400
Yes.

972
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,560
It's his sister.

973
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,240
I think my brothers and I

974
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,720
hid it well.

975
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,360
Because we didn't deliberately avoid each other,

976
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
or intentionally close.

977
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,080
She's a little restrained today.

978
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,600
I think we're good at acting.

979
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,240
Actually, I dare not talk to him.

980
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,080
I'm afraid

981
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,360
we were too close.

982
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,120
I don't want to talk to him.

983
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,840
I pretend I didn't hear him.

984
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,800
I think he's really relaxed.

985
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,560
I think he really enjoys it.

986
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,280
I tried my best today.

987
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,160
to hide our relationship.

988
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,360
Because when I entered,

989
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,520
I would subconsciously

990
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,320
I actually want to ask him for help.

991
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,240
I didn't look at him on purpose.

992
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,880
I don't want others to see it.

993
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,960
It's not that you can't

994
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,880
if we don't communicate.

995
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,920
I think

996
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,360
with everyone.

997
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,960
Nothing special.

998
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,640
is the best hiding.

999
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,920
Who and who are brothers?

1000
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,440
There's only one big card.

1001
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,320
Soup and Xiaoling.

1002
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,600
I think Susu and the map

1003
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,000
are also siblings.

1004
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,240
Susu's face shape and ears

1005
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,480
Her eyes are similar.

1006
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,120
I think Susu and Fatty

1007
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,000
Susu and Fatty.

1008
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,680
But Susu,

1009
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,280
didn't she say

1010
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
her brother was fat?

1011
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,040
Hua.

1012
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,480
Huahua said her brother is fat.

1013
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,120
He's so fair and fat. So cute.

1014
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,920
Did Hua say it?

1015
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,560
Yes, Hua.

1016
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,360
Chubby and Huahua.

1017
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,240
I'm pretty sure.

1018
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,960
I think she said the younger brother is chubby.

1019
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,320
I feel like a chubby little brother

1020
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,400
hasn't changed much.

1021
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm in the same family with Chubby.

1022
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,720
Because the door is similar.

1023
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,640
It's just a family.

1024
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,080
If your guess is right,

1025
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
because of this,

1026
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,320
I admire you.

1027
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,120
I think Harry and Xinxin

1028
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,840
might be a family.

1029
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,840
I also think

1030
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,640
are very close.

1031
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,760
Flowers and maps are definitely not siblings.

1032
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,320
Because they're not talking.

1033
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,040
I'm an ENFP.

1034
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,560
He said, "You too."

1035
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,440
ENFP.

1036
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:00,760
Both of us.

1037
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,280
ENFP.

1038
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,640
She asked me to give you some chips.

1039
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
Do you remember this scene?

1040
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,560
It's because you're not familiar with it.

1041
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,080
Yes.

1042
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,880
Someone you know.

1043
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,240
Unless they are so good at acting.

1044
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,160
Maybe she will.

1045
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,800
I think she's good at acting.

1046
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,880
Flower.

1047
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,880
I think she's an actress.

1048
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,080
I think we're confused.

1049
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,480
Yes, really confused.

1050
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,560
Look down?

1051
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,240
Let's see what happened to them.

1052
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,800
We can choose the room first.

1053
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,520
Let's go.

1054
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,720
Let's take a look.

1055
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,960
This is a boy's room.

1056
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,080
I'll sleep here.

1057
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,400
Okay, you sleep outside.

1058
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,680
This is really cool.

1059
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,120
It can shine.

1060
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,440
The view is great.

1061
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,160
So big.

1062
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,280
This is the second one for boys.

1063
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,120
This room is nice too.

1064
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,080
We'll stay here.

1065
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,480
So comfortable.

1066
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,440
This is for girls, right?

1067
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,160
This is the first girl's room.

1068
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,600
Let's choose this one.

1069
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,160
I think

1070
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,320
each room is quite comfortable.

1071
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,720
Not bad.

1072
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,000
There's a girl's room here.

1073
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,600
There's a living room here.

1074
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,800
I like it

1075
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,200
It's so comfortable.

1076
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,400
It feels like home.

1077
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
And the balcony.

1078
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,600
This is the closet room.

1079
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,920
This room is nice

1080
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,360
And the room with clothes

1081
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:41,800
This is

1082
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,600
where we can have some wine together.

1083
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,520
What a big wine.

1084
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,720
Slide is here.

1085
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,400
This house is so warm.

1086
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,720
I'm looking forward to the next 20 days.

1087
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,360
Yes.

1088
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,320
I feel comfortable here.

1089
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,080
And the piano.

1090
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,760
Can anyone play the piano?

1091
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,680
The soup party.

1092
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,520
Can you do it?

1093
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,480
A little.

1094
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:18,960
Show it.

1095
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,280
Show us.

1096
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,000
What do you want to hear?

1097
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,440
I want to listen to "Mid-Autumn Festival".

1098
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,800
I don't know how to play it even if you order a song.

1099
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,880
I only know how to play.

1100
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,920
Then play it.

1101
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,000
So can we listen to the performance now?

1102
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,560
Yes.

1103
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,400
Beethoven is online.

1104
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,040
I played randomly.

1105
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,080
Don't mind.

1106
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,800
You're modest again.

1107
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,680
It's like an idol drama.

1108
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,280
Yes.

1109
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,400
Where is the girl?

1110
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,680
Shouldn't you see it now?

1111
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,120
We can't miss this scene.

1112
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,960
So strong.

1113
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,760
When the brothers see the opponent's "opening screen",

1114
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,280
when they see each other.

1115
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,640
The King of Love Song, right?

1116
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,760
You really doted on your brother.

1117
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,120
Okay.

1118
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,000
Amazing.

1119
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,640
Awesome.

1120
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,960
Awesome.

1121
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,720
Really

1122
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,840
Player.

1123
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,840
No.

1124
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,880
You've become a fan.

1125
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,640
I think the soup is cool.

1126
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,200
I was shocked.

1127
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,440
It's really nice.

1128
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,640
When Soup plays the piano,

1129
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,240
I think he's glowing.

1130
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,720
He's really good.

1131
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,880
I was shocked.

1132
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,440
I hope my brothers

1133
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,520
with the soup.

1134
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,520
You may think

1135
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,400
or a boy who knows music?

1136
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,440
Will it be a bonus?

1137
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,600
It's all about looks.

1138
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,160
When my husband was young,

1139
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,720
I looked through his photo album when he was young

1140
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,840
Because the photos are really...

1141
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,000
It's hard to say

1142
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,240
he's glowing.

1143
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,920
The lung capacity is good.

1144
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,280
Yes.

1145
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,400
You practiced so hard.

1146
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,200
That's all.

1147
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,040
But I don't mean to discriminate.

1148
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,440
I just think

1149
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,680
a narrow perspective.

1150
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,440
Let me make it clear.

1151
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,520
I don't think there's

1152
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,480
elegant.

1153
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,320
Yes.

1154
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,840
The elegance of cello and violin.

1155
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,600
Then he...

1156
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,080
He was in pain.

1157
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,240
And he felt

1158
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,600
he was fat when he was young.

1159
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,120
He was blowing it himself.

1160
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,960
He felt it was very marginalized.

1161
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,760
It was already very marginal.

1162
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,200
The big one makes himself more edge.

1163
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,480
Then he stopped blowing.

1164
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,320
But I think as long as one person

1165
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,040
is doing something seriously.

1166
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,720
Focus.

1167
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,000
He's very charming.

1168
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,720
Yes, I think it's like this.

1169
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,160
When a girl does something,

1170
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,120
you'll get extra points.

1171
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:13,920
Do your homework.

1172
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,120
I'll tell you.

1173
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,600
Do your homework.

1174
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,480
Let me copy.

1175
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,600
I'm really touched

1176
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,760
with music.

1177
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,440
Because my wife

1178
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,080
went to her brother's house for the first time.

1179
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,000
And his sister was playing the piano there.

1180
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,160
I had five points for her.

1181
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,760
I suddenly got eight points after playing the piano.

1182
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,560
I think music can

1183
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,520
this kind of emotion.

1184
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,680
Yes.

1185
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,480
So I think music is really helpful.

1186
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,560
So charming.

1187
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:45,920
Yeah.

1188
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,840
It has to be a piano.

1189
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,040
If it's a large size,

1190
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,200
5 to 2.

1191
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,720
Sorry.

1192
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,640
I'm sorry.

1193
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,080
She can even play that song now.

1194
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,720
Sometimes you'll remember

1195
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,520
the old scene.

1196
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,360
My daughter can play that song too.

1197
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,760
I think she taught my daughter on purpose.

1198
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,200
so that my daughter can play it often.

1199
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,560
It reminds me of the first time we met.

1200
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,440
Yes.

1201
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,040
I just mentioned that there is a skill

1202
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,080
to attract people's attention.

1203
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,960
It reminds me of my original intention.

1204
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,040
I learned how to play guitar

1205
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,400
to attract girls's attention.

1206
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,360
Yes.

1207
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,440
When boys play the guitar,

1208
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,080
Because I was in middle school.

1209
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,840
There was an art performance in our school.

1210
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,440
I saw you forming a band

1211
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,640
Standing on the campus stage

1212
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,720
I saw the girls next to me

1213
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,400
Stars eyes, you know?

1214
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:33,920
I thought

1215
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,400
I must

1216
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,640
in my life.

1217
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,640
and stand on the stage

1218
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,480
like them.

1219
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,680
So in that situation,

1220
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,400
I learned the guitar by myself.

1221
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,920
Even the first song I learned

1222
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,920
I learned.

1223
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,760
It's called Girl.

1224
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,320
They look good together.

1225
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,160
Come on, play the guitar.

1226
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,480
Let's see

1227
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,360
what kind of instrument

1228
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,400
will attract you?

1229
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:54,920
Me too.

1230
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,160
If boys have music talent,

1231
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,320
he will attract me.

1232
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,640
For example,

1233
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,360
when I was very young,

1234
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,320
there was a boy

1235
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,840
went to the beach for a date.

1236
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,080
He wrote a song

1237
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,240
a song I really like.

1238
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,560
He rearranged it

1239
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,360
and wrote down

1240
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,640
in the lyrics.

1241
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,480
Expressed with lyrics.

1242
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,000
So attentive.

1243
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,160
At that time,

1244
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,760
we were at the beach.

1245
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,880
We used

1246
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,120
with wire earphones.

1247
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,120
Like this.

1248
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,440
Show us.

1249
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,320
Cooperate.

1250
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,040
One person

1251
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,200
One for each.

1252
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:24,800
And listen like this.

1253
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,960
And we were very close, you know?

1254
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,400
Then the deer was crashing.

1255
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,560
Were you together then?

1256
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,560
There was a chance.

1257
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,360
Yes, thanks.

1258
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,720
Rewrite lyrics?

1259
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,040
Yes.

1260
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,880
But I think some people

1261
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,480
who have a special sense of ritual.

1262
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,440
for you.

1263
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,920
It's kind of romantic allergic.

1264
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,880
Too much pressure.

1265
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,240
Yes.

1266
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,600
Someone is immersed in it.

1267
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,680
Here comes the mission.

1268
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,520
Here comes the mission.

1269
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,400
There's someone else.

1270
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,960
What?

1271
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,240
Here.

1272
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:11,760
Let's share it.

1273
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,720
Let's have a look.

1274
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,480
Members of the cabin, you're about to welcome

1275
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,000
Cupid's date.

1276
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,760
Girls, please think carefully.

1277
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,040
The person you want to date

1278
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,760
and write down the date content on the card.

1279
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,520
and give it to

1280
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,440
They might be the siblings of the date.

1281
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,160
I don't understand.

1282
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,600
For example, B and C are siblings.

1283
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,280
You're doing math problems now, right?

1284
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,160
If A likes B, she has to choose C.

1285
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,240
A and C are girls.

1286
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,160
B is a boy.

1287
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,960
If A likes B,

1288
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,320
A should give the letter to C.

1289
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,160
HAVE GREAT

1290
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,040
HAVE

1291
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,680
Do you understand?

1292
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,520
I guess

1293
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,000
For example,

1294
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,360
if I want to go on a date with him,

1295
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,200
I'll guess who is his family.

1296
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,160
Yes.

1297
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,120
And you have to give it to anyone.

1298
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,760
Yes.

1299
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:17,920
No, am I a template?

1300
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,720
Why are you pointing at me?

1301
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,680
I think my brothers like drawing.

1302
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,160
A clean big boy.

1303
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,400
That feeling.

1304
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,560
I think she wants to invite soup.

1305
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,080
My instincts and feelings.

1306
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,280
My brothers are interested in Harry.

1307
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,840
I think

1308
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,160
I don't know if I'm right.

1309
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,280
And the map.

1310
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,320
My brothers.

1311
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,440
She likes "puppy".

1312
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:43,840
And

1313
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,720
a happy and cheerful boy.

1314
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,400
Do you want to write?

1315
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,160
Let's go.

1316
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,160
Let me think about how to write it.

1317
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,800
This is hard.

1318
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,960
Because you have to choose two questions.

1319
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,120
You need to know

1320
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,880
who your brother is.

1321
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,280
They are fighting for

1322
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,680
to spend the first time with a man alone.

1323
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,360
Which boy will you choose?

1324
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,720
into a heart.

1325
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,320
I want to send a letter to Xiaoling Cupid.

1326
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,800
I think it's a destiny,

1327
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,840
not an unknown.

1328
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,480
I'm afraid of that unknown feeling.

1329
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,360
He said he wanted to experience the winter in Beijing with me.

1330
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,040
She even drew a heart.

1331
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,200
Because the soup and Xiaoling are siblings.

1332
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,280
She's a little shy.

1333
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,840
to admit that she likes soup.

1334
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,040
So she said I like the feeling of confirmation.

1335
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,120
There's a fixed number.

1336
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,760
Is it like this?

1337
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,960
I think

1338
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,800
I think

1339
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,760
she should have foresight.

1340
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,480
If she meets

1341
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,040
I don't want to get along with him.

1342
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,600
So I might as well give it to the known.

1343
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,680
Who is his brother?

1344
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,160
I think we get along well.

1345
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,080
We can get along.

1346
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,160
Hua has a good chat with him.

1347
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,200
She and soup.

1348
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,200
It must be soup.

1349
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,880
From what I observed today,

1350
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,040
I think they must be brothers.

1351
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,400
If we can go on a date together,

1352
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,520
we can be very happy.

1353
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,080
You can relax.

1354
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,040
Do you want soup too?

1355
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,040
Soup.

1356
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,320
I think he's more careful.

1357
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,760
And he is

1358
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,200
who cares about others.

1359
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,480
I'll give it to you.

1360
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,800
Su Su gave Xiao Ling

1361
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,040
in front of other girls.

1362
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,360
I love girls who play straight.

1363
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,960
Okay.

1364
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,640
Let's go down.

1365
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,920
Help them cook.

1366
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,840
Go down.

1367
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,560
Soup Harry.

1368
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,440
We should start cooking.

1369
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,160
When I take it out to thaw it,

1370
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,520
I can cut the chicken wings.

1371
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,640
No need.

1372
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,440
Just change the knife.

1373
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,960
Let's cut it first.

1374
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,800
and then change the knife.

1375
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,120
He can also change the knife.

1376
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,600
A boy who can cook.

1377
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,800
OK.

1378
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,280
Bro, you're great.

1379
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,720
I won't

1380
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,120
after I go out.

1381
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,480
I won't let you gain another 20 jin.

1382
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,240
Don't worry.

1383
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,560
Here?

1384
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,920
Change the knife here.

1385
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,280
No.

1386
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:53,920
Not now.

1387
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,200
Professional.

1388
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,840
There's always a cook in love variety show.

1389
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,200
Wash the vegetables directly.

1390
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,720
Ginger, cooking wine, green onion

1391
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,280
Professional.

1392
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,720
I've never tried it.

1393
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,160
I think I need to learn it first.

1394
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,320
I'll wash it wrongly.

1395
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,480
Professional.

1396
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,720
Let me observe it.

1397
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,320
Kang

1398
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,800
Harry is quite good at fighting.

1399
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,040
He went straight up.

1400
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,880
Harry is with me. The score is so high.

1401
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,200
It needs oil.

1402
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,320
What else is there?

1403
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,160
Someone doesn't eat green onions.

1404
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,720
Someone doesn't eat onions.

1405
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,720
It's Xinxin who doesn't eat onions or coriander, right?

1406
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,840
Read.

1407
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,920
Read the recipe?

1408
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,040
I have to do something.

1409
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,680
How can I thaw this quickly?

1410
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:54,840
It can't be thawed fast.

1411
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,840
Only

1412
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,360
Hot water.

1413
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,880
Put it in the basin and warm water.

1414
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,360
Can you open it?

1415
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:02,560
Yes.

1416
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,600
Very cold.

1417
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,240
What an ugly fish.

1418
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,080
"Shang Sword".

1419
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,400
As long as it's edible.

1420
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:08,920
I'm a little scared.

1421
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,800
I dare not.

1422
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,360
How ugly is it?

1423
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,160
No, I mean it's dirty.

1424
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,920
You're ugly.

1425
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,600
It's not ugly. It's just a little flat.

1426
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,520
It's not ugly.

1427
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,560
I've seen the evolution history of Dobo Fish.

1428
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,200
The two eyes were next to it

1429
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,360
They're different

1430
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,640
Look at this house

1431
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,520
Imagine this is at home.

1432
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,840
at home.

1433
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,480
Why do they feel familiar?

1434
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,040
Yeah.

1435
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,520
The way Harry talks to her

1436
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,080
is like

1437
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,080
Maybe her brother or brother.

1438
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,000
She didn't even look away.

1439
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,120
Not awkward at all.

1440
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,840
And they dared to criticize him.

1441
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,680
I thought they were brothers.

1442
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,440
Now look at this shy expression

1443
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:44,840
No.

1444
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,760
I think it might be

1445
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,920
Because they're siblings.

1446
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,600
Because they're together.

1447
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,600
I'm afraid I'll be exposed.

1448
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,560
and couldn't hide it.

1449
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,120
or you don't feel anything.

1450
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,720
You don't feel anything so soon?

1451
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,680
No I don't get up so soon

1452
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,880
We are just chefs

1453
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,520
It's impossible

1454
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,200
Yes.

1455
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,760
Harry is funny.

1456
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,040
About fish,

1457
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,480
First, he said my fish was ugly.

1458
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,600
Then,

1459
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,800
Then he told me

1460
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,720
the fish would remove the tail.

1461
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,080
All the organs

1462
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,080
The tail is gone

1463
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,000
You have to go to the organs.

1464
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,480
Are you going to the organs?

1465
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,200
You don't have to go to the organs.

1466
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,840
Are you going to use this?

1467
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,120
Just wash it.

1468
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,040
It has scales.

1469
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,480
I start to doubt myself.

1470
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,720
Well...

1471
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,240
Really?

1472
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,040
From that second on,

1473
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,120
he was very abstract.

1474
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,400
What do you mean by abstract?

1475
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,400
He's very specific.

1476
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,400
Come on.

1477
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,360
How much rice should we cook

1478
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,520
How many people

1479
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,320
Eight.

1480
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,120
One for each.

1481
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,520
One for each.

1482
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,520
A small pot.

1483
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,800
One for each.

1484
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,320
Yes.

1485
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,720
You pour it.

1486
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,240
Should we wash the rice first?

1487
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:52,960
You need to pour it first to wash it.

1488
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,160
That's called pouring rice.

1489
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,240
Poop rice?

1490
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,160
You're so strict.

1491
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,000
Come on.

1492
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,480
They look like siblings.

1493
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,600
Siblings should be siblings

1494
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,400
Yeah a little bit like a sister

1495
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,920
But Fatty looks like a younger brother

1496
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,120
Because he doesn't look like a brother taking care of him.

1497
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,040
Yes, control and care.

1498
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,440
I don't think we can finish it.

1499
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,480
How many days is this bag?

1500
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,800
The first day.

1501
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,880
One third of the day.

1502
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,000
Someone rang the doorbell.

1503
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,680
Mission.

1504
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,400
Let's go see the mission.

1505
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,200
Food.

1506
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,880
Food.

1507
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,080
and new letters.

1508
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,560
Take the food in.

1509
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Tell them there's food.

1510
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,600
Let's go

1511
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,000
Family stop first

1512
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,000
Stop first

1513
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,680
Food is ready.

1514
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,040
Food.

1515
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:49,920
And vegetables.

1516
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,000
Is it enough?

1517
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,240
The meal is here. What are we doing?

1518
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,920
Food

1519
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,320
The meal is here.

1520
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,000
Our parents prepared this in advance.

1521
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,240
hometown dishes.

1522
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,440
Really?

1523
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,800
Our parents feed us.

1524
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,840
Whose parents gave it to us?

1525
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,400
Let's have our first dinner

1526
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,120
Let's have our first dinner.

1527
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:22,880
Okay.

1528
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,520
There are three boxes in total.

1529
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,200
and a big bucket.

1530
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,480
Let me see what this is

1531
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,280
You can use the microwave

1532
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,600
This is not soup.

1533
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,920
This is a dish.

1534
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,400
What is stewed?

1535
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,480
This smells good.

1536
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,560
This group life

1537
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,120
is really happy.

1538
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,680
I want to eat hand grabbing rice.

1539
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,920
Hold on.

1540
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,000
You don't understand what I mean.

1541
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,320
It's a hint.

1542
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,360
No.

1543
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,240
What hint?

1544
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,160
I really want to eat.

1545
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,080
I want to eat it.

1546
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,560
What kind of dish is grabbing rice?

1547
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,240
I don't know.

1548
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,320
I want to eat fried noodles.

1549
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,480
They all think I'm from the northwest.

1550
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,640
You'll make me a big plate of chicken tomorrow.

1551
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,120
It'll be fun if you find it wrong.

1552
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,480
Isn't he?

1553
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,440
We need at least four dishes.

1554
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,200
Don't cut your hands.

1555
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,320
Your nails.

1556
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,320
your nails.

1557
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,680
Slowly.

1558
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,440
Okay.

1559
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,480
The next morning after eating this,

1560
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,040
Is it swollen?

1561
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:42,920
Because it's salty.

1562
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,400
You think too much

1563
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,440
I cut some sausages and steam it with rice.

1564
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,600
It feels like Sichuan.

1565
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,240
Guangdong should be fine too.

1566
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,000
Soup rice.

1567
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,520
Here, soup.

1568
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,120
I can tell you something.

1569
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:00,560
Here.

1570
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,680
I'll peel the garlic.

1571
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,960
Clean this up.

1572
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:04,800
This one?

1573
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,760
Let me do it.

1574
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,520
Okay.

1575
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,000
Come on bro

1576
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,480
Come on bro

1577
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,320
Yes, they made a joke.

1578
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:11,720
No.

1579
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,440
But I don't think it's you.

1580
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,560
It's you.

1581
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,240
Yes.

1582
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,040
Come on bro

1583
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:16,840
Clear what it is.

1584
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,120
In the trash can?

1585
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,000
Yes.

1586
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,760
Okay.

1587
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,120
Why don't you kiss me?

1588
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,120
I'll eat it.

1589
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:25,920
Clean it up.

1590
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:31,840
Let's eat.

1591
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,760
You...

1592
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,000
I must eat three bowls of rice.

1593
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,600
Okay.

1594
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:50,960
The fish is cooked.

1595
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,480
I'll go get the sauce.

1596
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,280
I'm coming.

1597
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,760
OK. Pour it.

1598
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,960
Shit.

1599
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,200
It's not.

1600
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,480
I think so.

1601
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,520
Okay, it's spilled.

1602
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,560
I think the dishes can be heated now.

1603
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,760
Smells good.

1604
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,800
Why do I smell mountain pepper

1605
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,240
Smells good

1606
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:15,920
Right

1607
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,880
It's the smell of mountain pepper

1608
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,840
You really know how to cook

1609
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,160
I can smell it.

1610
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,880
Fried pork with chili.

1611
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,360
This dish is really

1612
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,680
Smells good.

1613
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,040
Whose parents are they?

1614
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,040
This is so happy.

1615
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,040
I won't lose weight.

1616
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,000
What should I lose?

1617
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,240
It seems to be some kind of beef cubes.

1618
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,440
What tomato should I stew?

1619
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,960
I'm hungry.

1620
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,360
It looks delicious.

1621
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,680
I'm starving.

1622
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,320
My mom hasn't done anything recently

1623
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,520
When she was sharing her parents' cooking,

1624
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,880
they ate their parents' dishes here.

1625
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,120
In the environment of a group of strangers,

1626
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,960
I can feel the warmth of home.

1627
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,880
I have my brothers and I.

1628
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,600
I don't think

1629
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,720
if I didn't eat

1630
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,400
my parents cook today.

1631
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,600
I don't think so.

1632
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,680
Mom.

1633
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,880
Yes.

1634
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,520
No.

1635
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,160
Indeed.

1636
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,480
They are all cooking.

1637
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,120
Yes.

1638
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,600
I think I should set off

1639
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,800
at 11.

1640
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,520
Okay.

1641
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,200
I'm going to eat now.

1642
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:49,880
Bye.

1643
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,640
Time to eat.

1644
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,960
It feels like Xiao Ling is not in a good mood

1645
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,200
on the phone.

1646
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,200
If I were in a strange environment,

1647
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,320
in a strange environment.

1648
01:02:59,320 --> 01:02:59,800
Mom, I'm so nervous.

1649
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,560
Yes, and you haven't cooked for me yet.

1650
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:01,880
Yes.

1651
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,440
I'll tell them

1652
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,440
Mom, they're all cooking.

1653
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,520
I think her parents are all career-oriented.

1654
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,160
Her mom is reminding her about her work tomorrow.

1655
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:08,880
My schedule?

1656
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,720
My parents

1657
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,320
my parents don't know

1658
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,600
about my work.

1659
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,400
he won't tell you what to do tomorrow.

1660
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,120
So, are they quite close at work?

1661
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,920
That means their relationship

1662
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,200
a good parent-child relationship.

1663
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,480
and communicate.

1664
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,760
or her mother is the president.

1665
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,480
Family enterprise.

1666
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,360
Everyone thinks

1667
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,360
their parent-child relationship

1668
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,160
may not be very close.

1669
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,000
but because we have a common job.

1670
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,200
We lack

1671
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,840
this kind of need.

1672
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,640
She's rational.

1673
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,640
She doesn't have the mood to act cute.

1674
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,120
It also means

1675
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,720
in her original family,

1676
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,200
the way she gets along with her mother

1677
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:41,800
is like this.

1678
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,680
Mother may give her a lot

1679
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,800
It's like soup.

1680
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,240
Because in a family atmosphere,

1681
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,000
in a family atmosphere.

1682
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,680
Yes.

1683
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,520
It's confirmed in words.

1684
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,520
What should we drink?

1685
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,760
Let's drink fruit cubes.

1686
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,160
Yes.

1687
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:55,720
Drink fruit cubes.

1688
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,600
What flavor do you want? I'll make it for you.

1689
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,680
I want grapefruit.

1690
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,320
Pour half a bottle.

1691
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,640
Are you sure?

1692
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:07,720
Of course.

1693
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,320
It's good. It's really good with ice.

1694
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,200
This is good.

1695
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,960
Wait, we all drank wrong.

1696
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,200
Different MBTI

1697
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,080
It corresponds to the different flavors of Guoli.

1698
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,120
Who is I?

1699
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,480
I (introverted) want peach flavor.

1700
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,160
Me.

1701
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,400
And it has I, J, E, P.

1702
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,320
I’m P.

1703
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,120
You are a P.

1704
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,680
White grapes and peaches.

1705
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,000
What do you want?

1706
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,920
I'm an introvert.

1707
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,280
You have to choose.

1708
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,440
You are an introvert.

1709
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,520
I (introverted) is...

1710
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,480
This one.

1711
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,680
Peach.

1712
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,240
Peach with lemon.

1713
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,360
Can you drink it?

1714
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,280
He's a good drinker.

1715
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,800
He said he can drink a lot.

1716
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,040
I have to make one for him.

1717
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:42,720
Wait.

1718
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,160
Lemon flavor.

1719
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,240
It looks new.

1720
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,360
Try it.

1721
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,680
Take a seat.

1722
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,360
Take a photo.

1723
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,640
Do you want to say yes?

1724
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,280
This is our first meal.

1725
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,000
Come on, let's do it.

1726
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:01,960
Let me do it.

1727
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,520
Okay.

1728
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,080
Let's start.

1729
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,400
Let's celebrate our first meal today.

1730
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,000
Come on.

1731
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,440
Happy.

1732
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:19,960
Okay.

1733
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,080
Let's eat, everyone.

1734
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,720
Let's eat.

1735
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,800
Who is E?

1736
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,120
Celebrity.

1737
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,120
Zun Wu said I'm an artist.

1738
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,440
It has been tested as an ESFJ.

1739
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,480
It will change.

1740
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,840
I've never measured it.

1741
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,680
So there is no chance

1742
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,960
I (introverted) and E?

1743
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,760
Is there such a thing?

1744
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,160
Yes.

1745
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,040
You may be an introvert.

1746
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:49,560
or E.

1747
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,200
It's also possible.

1748
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,520
Both are impossible.

1749
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,400
No.

1750
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,080
You can't be introverted and outgoing.

1751
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:54,800
Yes.

1752
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,480
It's like we're in a new social occasion.

1753
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,440
The first side of the ice breaks

1754
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,320
It's very popular now.

1755
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,640
What MBTI

1756
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,120
What MBTI am

1757
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,160
to break the ice.

1758
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,600
Usually, the one who leads this part

1759
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,560
is E.

1760
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,160
So Dunhan,

1761
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,040
Just wait for E

1762
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,080
to break the ice for you.

1763
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:10,440
Yes.

1764
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,400
We can also make a mix drink.

1765
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,280
Maybe

1766
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,160
we'll get close.

1767
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,400
It's "Chairman".

1768
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:17,440
For you,

1769
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,760
We will get close.

1770
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,680
Yes, the grapefruit flavor with ice.

1771
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,520
It sounds delicious

1772
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,680
Let's try it next time.

1773
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,640
Let's try these four flavors.

1774
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,360
It's worth it.

1775
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,680
Our fruit wine

1776
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,720
for us.

1777
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,520
One by one.

1778
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,760
different flavors one by one.

1779
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,080
Time to eat.

1780
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,120
Smells good.

1781
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:36,760
Come on.

1782
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,120
Eat.

1783
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,680
Let's eat.

1784
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,720
Let's eat.

1785
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,080
Thank you.

1786
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,160
It means their food is really good.

1787
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,920
They don't talk much.

1788
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,840
What kind of meat is this?

1789
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,040
Duck.

1790
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,040
Isn't this blood duck?

1791
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,520
When I was young in my hometown,

1792
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,320
I went to Zhuhai

1793
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:05,680
during the Spring Festival.

1794
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,640
our family will definitely prepare this dish.

1795
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,520
Since we haven't lived together,

1796
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,680
So I ate less

1797
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,360
But mom will cook

1798
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,320
Then pack the vacuum immediately

1799
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,640
and send it to me the next day.

1800
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,760
So for me,

1801
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,040
to me.

1802
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,640
This is delicious.

1803
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,360
It's very tasty.

1804
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,080
This is a famous dish

1805
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,520
in my hometown in Jiangxi.

1806
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,440
When I ate that dish,

1807
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,280
I knew it must be my mom.

1808
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,680
Fried pork with chili.

1809
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,600
It's very common

1810
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,800
But mom's cooking has a unique taste

1811
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,280
Fried shredded meat

1812
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,400
and bring it to the whirlpool.

1813
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,160
Long time no see.

1814
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,440
Her favorite shredded pork with green pepper.

1815
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,280
This mom cares so much.

1816
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,319
I know my mom

1817
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,520
doesn't cook much.

1818
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,439
Yes.

1819
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:22,200
But when I ate

1820
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,640
the taste,

1821
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,040
when I saw

1822
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,560
when she cut it like that,

1823
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,439
I knew it must be her.

1824
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,279
I'll bring it to Yu Hua tomorrow.

1825
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,680
to Beijing.

1826
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:38,760
It smells familiar.

1827
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,040
I've been eating.

1828
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:46,319
Delicious

1829
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:47,840
It looks delicious.

1830
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,800
When you open that jar,

1831
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,920
I smelled it.

1832
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,880
I knew it must be my mom.

1833
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,359
Stewed tomato with beef brisket.

1834
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,439
First, I like beef very much.

1835
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,840
But I don't really like it.

1836
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,680
tomatoes.

1837
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:06,439
My mom wants me

1838
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:07,680
to nourish the nutrition of tomatoes.

1839
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,319
She will cook the beef badly

1840
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:10,920
and stew it with tomatoes.

1841
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,000
Then it can cover

1842
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,760
the taste of tomatoes.

1843
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,880
will be more nutritious and delicious.

1844
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:21,680
I remember this dish very much.

1845
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,800
Because it accompanied my whole high school.

1846
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:25,840
Yes.

1847
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,800
When she was preparing for the college entrance exam,

1848
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,920
she would always

1849
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,960
She also holds a pot of cans

1850
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,080
to keep it warm.

1851
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,359
and gave it to me.

1852
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:35,840
and send it to the school gate.

1853
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,560
Anyway, this can

1854
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,080
carries a memory

1855
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,080
of my high school.

1856
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,080
This is obviously from Northeast China.

1857
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,840
Braised ribs with pickles.

1858
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:49,279
I'm quite happy

1859
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,240
I haven't eaten that pickle for a long time.

1860
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,960
She used to cook this dish.

1861
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,360
My mom loved it.

1862
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,080
My grandpa likes it very much.

1863
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,240
I don't go home often when I go to college.

1864
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,800
And I haven't eaten this dish for a long time.

1865
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,240
At dinner,

1866
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,040
I can tell what my parents cook at a glance.

1867
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,080
But I didn't dare to say it.

1868
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,320
I was too shy to say it.

1869
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,280
It's the braised pork bone with pickles.

1870
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:18,880
I just finished it two days ago.

1871
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,440
I didn't eat that dish at all.

1872
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,160
He's too far away from me.

1873
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,720
I'm sorry to ask someone to help me.

1874
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,280
Northeasterner.

1875
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,320
Mixed blood from Northeast China.

1876
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,360
Are they really not siblings?

1877
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,200
What do you mean?

1878
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,400
They all chose that dish

1879
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,640
I thought it was made by my family

1880
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,920
I thought it was mom

1881
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,600
Who can sing better?

1882
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,600
Sing a song.

1883
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:43,760
I don't know how.

1884
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:44,880
Not good.

1885
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,960
I think the map should work.

1886
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,160
I can't.

1887
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:54,760
I'm not.

1888
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,880
I just look a bit alike.

1889
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,400
But...

1890
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,400
What does he look like?

1891
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,400
An artist.

1892
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,160
Yes, you are.

1893
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,040
I think you're like an announcer.

1894
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:04,640
Really?

1895
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,360
Yes.

1896
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,040
Anchor

1897
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,080
Mandarin is very standard.

1898
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,840
Actually, I cook.

1899
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,440
Do the dishes.

1900
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,840
What a coincidence.

1901
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,680
What a coincidence.

1902
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,280
I wash dishes too.

1903
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,400
It smells so good.

1904
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,840
I'm fat. I love delicious food.

1905
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:32,600
It's delicious.

1906
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,680
He kept saying it's delicious across my face.

1907
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,360
He's so emotional.

1908
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,400
I like this kind of people, to be honest.

1909
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,520
Why don't you eat?

1910
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,440
I'm full.

1911
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:01,760
No.

1912
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,080
You have to add rice.

1913
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,880
Or I'll feel embarrassed to add rice.

1914
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,480
Hurry up.

1915
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:07,880
And...

1916
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,760
I can't.

1917
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,760
I've added the soup.

1918
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,360
No.

1919
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,600
With such a standard figure,

1920
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,840
He won't add it.

1921
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:14,840
Eat it.

1922
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,560
That's a waste.

1923
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,560
I can't eat it tomorrow.

1924
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,200
Here.

1925
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,000
Give me your bowl.

1926
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,680
I'll add it for you.

1927
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:19,760
Really?

1928
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,800
Coming. As long as you're happy.

1929
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:22,840
Come on.

1930
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:23,920
Add some

1931
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,560
Add some.

1932
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,920
It's okay. You're thin.

1933
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,080
Me?

1934
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,840
I don't think my name is thin.

1935
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,160
No, I can't eat anymore.

1936
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,080
I want to leave the battlefield.

1937
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,600
Half a bowl.

1938
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,400
It's cute.

1939
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,560
Can you give me another chicken wing?

1940
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,240
Thank you.

1941
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,360
Okay.

1942
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,200
Harry smiles without saying a word.

1943
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,200
I've been listening.

1944
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,240
Can you give me a chicken wing?

1945
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,360
And she's very introverted.

1946
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,040
She just

1947
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,160
just said three sentences.

1948
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,040
Can I have a chicken wing

1949
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,160
That's too kind of you.

1950
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,160
You're really introverted.

1951
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:08,920
I think it's obvious.

1952
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,520
Because Harry made it.

1953
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,640
Harry made it

1954
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,360
So Harry was happy

1955
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,720
to analyze some new clues

1956
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,360
from the hometown cuisine.

1957
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,440
We almost thought

1958
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,000
Harry and the soup, right?

1959
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,200
I thought the dish

1960
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:20,960
It's IYI Psychology made by her mom.

1961
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:21,600
My mom made it

1962
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:21,960
My mom made it

1963
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:22,880
At that moment,

1964
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,160
they were brothers.

1965
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:26,680
In my place,

1966
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,160
Harry and Xinxin are a family.

1967
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,320
But Xin accepted Jiangxi cuisine.

1968
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:31,120
But Harry

1969
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,040
Harry is northeast cuisine.

1970
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:32,200
Yes

1971
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,080
He clearly acknowledged the stewed ribs with pickles.

1972
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,400
Maybe the northeasterner went to Jiangxi

1973
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,040
He loves making braised ribs with pickles.

1974
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,160
There's a kind of answer

1975
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,760
I think it's all wrong.

1976
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,840
I can't solve it.

1977
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,920
I don't want to accept this fact.

1978
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,080
Let's play a game.

1979
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,160
Do you know how to hit a car?

1980
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,440
No.

1981
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,440
"Hit a car."

1982
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,480
The eight of us grabbed seven numbers.

1983
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,440
We'll take seven.

1984
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,920
and call each other's name.

1985
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:02,960
OK?

1986
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,440
Yes.

1987
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:03,800
Okay.

1988
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:05,680
Let's do this.

1989
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,800
To get familiar with each other,

1990
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,280
to get familiar with each other

1991
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,280
The name of the people present.

1992
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:11,840
Okay.

1993
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,560
Okay.

1994
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,200
Like this. We'll get familiar after we shout a few times.

1995
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,600
Yes, that's it.

1996
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:16,880
Let's be fierce.

1997
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,920
Eight people grab six numbers.

1998
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:18,720
Okay.

1999
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,040
Let's name it first.

2000
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:20,680
Okay.

2001
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,240
Okay.

2002
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,160
Who goes first?

2003
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,200
It's a subtle name to choose.

2004
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,120
You go first.

2005
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:28,800
Choose one.

2006
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,120
Okay, I'll choose first.

2007
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,800
I'll call a difficult one.

2008
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,640
It's called soup.

2009
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,400
He's so happy.

2010
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,360
It's not that hard actually.

2011
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,000
Are these...

2012
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,080
I thought about it. I think it's easier for you to call them.

2013
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,640
My name is Xiaoling.

2014
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,320
Because you were called the least.

2015
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,040
I don't think anyone will call me.

2016
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,160
My name is Harry.

2017
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:06,400
Harry.

2018
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,320
Can I call my name?

2019
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,360
No.

2020
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,480
You can't call your name.

2021
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,200
Then I'll call you

2022
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:11,680
Call your name.

2023
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,280
Xinxin.

2024
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,640
Be careful.

2025
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:18,960
Don't "crash".

2026
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,480
My name is Tu.

2027
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,960
You chose the easiest one.

2028
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,160
My name is Hua.

2029
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,320
Then I have no choice.

2030
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,120
Then my name is Fatty.

2031
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,040
Your name is Susu. That's the only way.

2032
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,280
Yes, I have no choice.

2033
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:37,960
Yes.

2034
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,480
Three, two, one, start.

2035
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,120
Your name is...

2036
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,280
Soup.

2037
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,200
What was his name again?

2038
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,200
I can't remind him.

2039
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,920
Just give it a massage.

2040
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,000
Then you start. You say start.

2041
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,120
Three, two, one, start.

2042
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,360
Hurry up.

2043
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,880
Xiao Ling.

2044
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,120
I'm amazing.

2045
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,920
It's quite exciting.

2046
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,680
Three, two, one, start.

2047
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,400
What's your name? You're Xinxin.

2048
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,760
No, what's your name?

2049
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,840
What's his name?

2050
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,240
You, Harry.

2051
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:39,920
Harry.

2052
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,000
What's his name?

2053
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,320
Did you just rap?

2054
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,200
Magic attack.

2055
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:47,960
He won't let me talk.

2056
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,240
He won't let us talk.

2057
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,280
You can start.

2058
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,800
Three, two, one. Action.

2059
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,200
Flower and that...

2060
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,120
Map.

2061
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:07,760
She called out first.

2062
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:08,880
Yes.

2063
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,640
Let's drink.

2064
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,320
The soup man is stunned.

2065
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,640
I met "The best in the game".

2066
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,800
Two.

2067
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,560
I met two masters at once.

2068
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,680
We met experts.

2069
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,720
Three, two, one, start.

2070
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,200
Map.

2071
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,440
Yes.

2072
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,960
Yes.

2073
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,800
OK.

2074
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,520
Three, two, one. Start.

2075
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:38,560
Soup.

2076
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,000
Hua.

2077
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,400
Okay, I know your names.

2078
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,360
I know your name.

2079
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:45,920
Okay.

2080
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,000
I got it.

2081
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,200
Wash the dishes.

2082
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,360
I remember there are gloves.

2083
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,600
No gloves.

2084
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,920
I think I found it today. Do you have it?

2085
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,240
I have gloves.

2086
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,000
Can you do it?

2087
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,960
Of course I can.

2088
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,320
I'll keep one.

2089
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,200
That one.

2090
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,480
We don't have noodles tomorrow, right?

2091
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,680
Let's not starve

2092
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,600
Let's get ready.

2093
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,640
We can slack off.

2094
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,080
Don't worry, I'm here.

2095
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,400
I can go out and buy you food.

2096
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:12,800
Okay.

2097
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,080
Here's a plastic wrap.

2098
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,120
Here we go.

2099
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,040
Okay, put them in the sink.

2100
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:17,880
Throw them away.

2101
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:18,840
Here we go. Thank you.

2102
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:19,520
It's okay.

2103
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,120
Good job.

2104
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,520
Wipe it off.

2105
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,040
You can put it away after it's dry.

2106
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:29,920
I accepted it.

2107
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,120
This one?

2108
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:31,880
Yes.

2109
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,360
How do you usually wipe it?

2110
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,320
Yes, wipe it with this.

2111
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,240
Yes.

2112
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,800
What? This one?

2113
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,880
You can put it away after it's dry.

2114
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,120
You can accept it.

2115
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,520
I'm really inexperienced.

2116
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,400
Sorry.

2117
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,160
It's okay.

2118
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,480
You have the heart to wash dishes.

2119
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,640
You've defeated many people.

2120
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,200
How's your bath?

2121
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,040
What can you get from washing?

2122
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,240
Thank you for cleaning the table for me.

2123
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,840
No, thank you.

2124
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,840
I got the job to do the dishes today.

2125
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,640
It's okay.

2126
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,320
So virtuous.

2127
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,000
I think I saw my dad and my mom.

2128
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,880
Harry could be Hua's brother.

2129
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,440
He's trying to match her up with soup.

2130
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,080
Is it possible

2131
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,200
in secret?

2132
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,960
Let's take a photo together.

2133
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,240
Let me take one for you.

2134
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,760
Can I look better?

2135
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,120
Don't worry.

2136
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,120
Polaroid?

2137
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,600
Let's have a try.

2138
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:26,600
See if it looks good.

2139
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,200
Here.

2140
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,120
Let me take one for you.

2141
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,960
You're very professional.

2142
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,520
Three, two, one.

2143
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,440
Okay.

2144
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:40,880
Isn't it silly?

2145
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,080
Good.

2146
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,560
I haven't used this for a long time.

2147
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,360
for a long time.

2148
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,480
It can slowly recover.

2149
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,480
Here it comes.

2150
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,520
New cards.

2151
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,160
(Brothers and sisters are available.)

2152
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,640
We can talk

2153
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,600
we can talk without hesitation.

2154
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,760
I can finally

2155
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,600
with my brothers.

2156
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,800
I was afraid you would be nervous.

2157
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,880
You're the liveliest.

2158
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,200
Who do you think I like?

2159
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,680
It stands out.

2160
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,760
Take the soup down.

2161
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:10,560
Good luck. I trust you.

2162
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:28,160
