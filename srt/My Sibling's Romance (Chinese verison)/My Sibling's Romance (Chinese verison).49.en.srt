00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,720
Xiaoling
You

179
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,080
Xiaoling
Help me observe Tutu.

180
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,320
Then
Xiaoling

181
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,200
Xiaoling
Also help me ask him something.

182
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,800
But don't say that I asked you to ask.
Xiaoling

183
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,440
Xiaoling
Just ask him

184
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,600
How does he feel about getting along with me?
Xiaoling

185
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,919
Xiaoling, or what are his thoughts now?

186
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,960
Xiaoling, just ask from your perspective as a younger brother.

187
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,840
Exciting fruit wine

188
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,559
Xiaoling
What I talked about with Xin Xin last night was

189
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
Xiaoling
I can feel that

190
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,559
he might be interested in me.
Xiaoling

191
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,520
Xiaoling
But

192
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,280
I feel like I've made some
Xiaoling

193
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,640
Xiaoling
proactive responses,

194
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,360
or feedback.
Xiaoling

195
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,240
Xiaoling
I think I've given them.

196
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,480
But I feel like there are some issues he might
Xiaoling

197
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,320
For example
Xiaoling

198
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,800
Xiaoling.
Selective ignorance or something like that.

199
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,960
Because yesterday when we were out shopping,
Xiaoling.

200
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,800
Xiaoling.
I actually bought some crispy pork.

201
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
Xiaoling.
At this moment, Tutu said something.

202
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Then Xinxin said,
Xiaoling.

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
Xiaoling.
I thought you were going to say,

204
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,680
Xiaoling, I hope
Xiaoling.

205
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,320
Xiaoling.
you like me as much as you like crispy pork.

206
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
Then Tutu said,
Xiaoling.

207
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,000
Xiaoling.
No.

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,400
Then Tutu started changing the subject again.
Xiaoling.

209
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,600
Then Tutu started changing the subject again.

210
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,040
Exciting fruit wine.

211
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,840
Xiaoling, so now I don't know

212
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,880
Xiaoling, fruit wine, what he's thinking.

213
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,320
Xiaoling.
Xiaoling, just help me find out a bit, that's all.

214
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,280
just help me find out a bit, that's all.
Xiaoling.

215
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,840
just help me find out a bit, that's all.

216
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,040
Xiaoling.
No matter what his thoughts are,

217
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,800
Xiaoling, fruit wine, no matter what,

218
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,880
Xiaoling, I can accept whatever he thinks.

219
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,560
Xiaoling, but I don't know what he's thinking now.

220
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,160
Xiaoling, fruit wine, I'm quite confused.

221
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,440
Tangtang.
I'll ask for you.

222
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,520
But,
Tangtang.

223
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,160
Tangtang.
relax a bit.

224
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,680
Exciting fruit wine.

225
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,960
Wu Zun, sometimes when he should confess,

226
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,080
Wu Zun, he's playing dumb a bit.

227
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,360
Wu Zun.
he's playing dumb a bit.

228
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Zhu Dan.
Right, is it Tutu?

229
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,560
Right, didn't get that kind of response.
Wu Zun.

230
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,080
This kind of guessing is really tiring.
Zhu Dan.

231
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,760
This kind of guessing is really tiring.

232
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,480
Tangtang.
Because I've never really felt

233
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,000
Tangtang.
that he has that kind of intense liking for you.

234
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,200
Tangtang, fruit wine, when I'm with Susu,

235
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,480
Tangtang.
when I'm with Susu,

236
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,800
I worry that any of my actions
Tangtang.

237
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,520
Exciting fruit wine.

238
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,440
Tangtang, fruit wine, might make her unhappy.

239
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,000
Tangtang.
might make her unhappy.

240
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,880
Might cause aversion.
Tangtang.

241
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,680
Tangtang.
This kind of thing.

242
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,880
But when I see him interacting with you,
Tangtang.

243
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,320
Tangtang.
I don't feel

244
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,680
Exciting fruit wine.

245
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,480
Tangtang, fruit wine, he hasn't put himself in

246
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
Tangtang, fruit juice, the perspective of wanting to be with you.

247
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
Tangtang, fruit wine, to address this issue.

248
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,040
Xiaoling, fruit wine, so I'm a bit

249
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,770
Xiaoling, fruit wine, confused and a little sad.

250
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,720
Fruity cocktail.

251
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,360
Xiaoling,
Tonight,

252
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,000
aren't we girls having our own gathering?
Xiaoling,

253
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
Xiaoling,
I'll also ask Huahua

254
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,120
about her thoughts on this matter.
Xiaoling,

255
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,800
Xiaoling,
Because I think

256
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,960
she is Tutu's sister after all,
Xiaoling,

257
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,680
Xiaoling,
so she should know him better.

258
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,160
then I'm wondering if he is...
Xiaoling,

259
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,520
Fruity cocktail.

260
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,920
Xiaoling, whether she's unaware

261
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,120
or inexperienced,

262
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,040
Xiaoling, I also want to hear what Huahua has to say.

263
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,800
Tangtang,
We really need to see this issue clearly.

264
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,240
and then...
Tangtang,
We really need to see this issue clearly.

265
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,480
Xiaoling,
Yes,

266
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,400
Tangtang,
after all, it might be right before a confession.

267
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,260
you might need to make a decision.
Tangtang,

268
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,120
Tangtang,
Yes.

269
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,960
but I think you also
Tangtang,

270
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
Tangtang,
during the process of getting along,

271
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
don't put too much pressure on yourself.
Tangtang,

272
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,160
Tangtang,
We are just...

273
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
Xiaoling,
even if I knew his true thoughts,

274
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,320
he might...
Xiaoling,

275
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,040
Xiaoling, even if he's not that interested in me,

276
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,680
Xiaoling, if I still admire him

277
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,640
Xiaoling, if I want to get closer to him,

278
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,040
Xiaoling, if I want to get closer to him,

279
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,600
Xiaoling, I would still send him messages (expressing my feelings).

280
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,120
Fruity cocktail.

281
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,520
Xiaoling,
Yes.

282
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,920
Tangtang,
actually, many times...

283
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,720
Tangtang,
it's like what Pangpang said,

284
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,600
I think it's quite useful.
Tangtang,

285
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,640
Tangtang,
Don't just listen to what he says,

286
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,840
watch what he does.
and

287
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,160
Tangtang, then tonight you inquire on that side,

288
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Tangtang,
I'll inquire on this side.

289
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,800
Tangtang,
anyway, if it's different, then it's a lie.

290
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,280
Xiaoling,
It's okay if it's different,

291
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,560
I can also draw a conclusion.
Xiaoling,

292
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,040
Xiaoling,
That is,

293
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,640
maybe he's not that interested in me.
Xiaoling,

294
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,680
Xiaoling,
I know this result,

295
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,160
I can accept it too.
Xiaoling,

296
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,760
Xiaoling,
Yes.

297
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,360
Tangtang,
come sit here.

298
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
Xiaoling,
your sister is not sad anymore.

299
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,280
it's okay.
Tangtang,

300
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
Tangtang,
Let me lean on you for a while.

301
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,200
I don't usually let others lean on me.
Tangtang,

302
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,900
I don't usually let others lean on me.

303
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,000
Is this Susu's special privilege?
Xiaoling.

304
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,200
Tang Tang.
I didn't say that.

305
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,920
Now Tang Tang is getting better at expressing herself.
Yang Gen.

306
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,280
Jiang Dunhao.
Yes.

307
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,440
Yang Gen.
this kind of affection for her sister.

308
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,640
Jiang Dunhao.
She's able to express her love now.

309
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,720
Tang Tang.
The older sister is very self-consuming.

310
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,880
I can feel it.
Tang Tang.

311
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,680
Tang Tang.
she's acting tough verbally.

312
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,720
Maybe she's observing too.
Tang Tang.

313
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,760
Tang Tang.
But I feel she's falling for him.

314
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,040
Otherwise, she wouldn't care so much about
Tang Tang.

315
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,440
Tang Tang.
every action of Tutu.

316
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,040
Xiaoling.
She cares quite a bit about this person.

317
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,760
Xiaoling then also has a rather serious attitude.
Xiaoling.

318
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Xiaoling,
I hope that we two

319
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,800
will have deeper interactions.
Xiaoling,

320
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,560
Xiaoling,
So I hope Tutu can give me a

321
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,160
more clear
Xiaoling,

322
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,880
Xiaoling.
or rather, the most accurate answer.

323
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's go.
Tang Tang.

324
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,240
Pang Pang.
Mimi.

325
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,000
Let's go.
Harry.

326
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,280
Pang Pang.
We're different from them, right?

327
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,120
Terry.
Not together.

328
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,640
Tang Tang.
I'll sit here.

329
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,080
Okay.
Tutu.

330
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,040
Pang Pang.
Teacher Tu.

331
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Terry.
Teacher Tu.

332
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
Heart-to-heart session.
Harry.

333
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,200
Terry.
Focusing on sincerity.

334
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,240
I'm the most sincere one in the whole car.
Harry.

335
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,400
Pang Pang.
Where do you put me?

336
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,360
Tang Tang.
If I'm not sincere,

337
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,080
there won't be any sincere person in the world.
Tang Tang.

338
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,600
Yang Gen.
No wonder it's called a heart-to-heart party.

339
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,600
Yang Gen.
Everyone's going to ask the most sensitive questions.

340
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,840
Zhu Dan is helping her siblings gather information.

341
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,440
Yang Gen.
Yes.

342
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,120
Harry.
Let's go swimming.

343
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,320
Pang Pang.
Soak in this.

344
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,440
The key is, can this pool fit five people?
Pang Pang.

345
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
Harry.
Yes, it can.

346
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
This is not bad.
Harry.

347
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,160
So cozy.
Tutu.

348
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,800
Tangtang.
There's a changing room here.

349
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,000
Who's going to change first?
Tangtang.

350
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,720
I'll go change.
Tutu.

351
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,780
Okay, you go first.
Tangtang.

352
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,960
They're gone.
Tata.

353
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,040
Xiaoling.
I'm curious.

354
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
What's happening over there?
Xiaoling.

355
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,480
Tata.
They're happily playing in the water.

356
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,320
Xiaoling.
They're playing in the water and having a barbecue.

357
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,720
Xinxin.
Is it really nice to watch five guys playing in the water?

358
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,640
I want to ask about this scene.
Xinxin.

359
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,880
Huahua.
Tutu and Pangpang should be...

360
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,280
Must be the one having the most fun.
Huahua.

361
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,810
Must be the one having the most fun.

362
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,360
Xinxin.
Don't be like that.

363
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,560
Once Pangpang gets in the pool, the water will be gone.
Xinxin.

364
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,360
Once Pangpang gets in the pool, the water will be gone.

365
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,840
You're so mean.
Tata.

366
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,440
Xiaoling.
You're really his sister, aren't you?

367
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,360
Xinxin.
It'll turn into a dry pool.

368
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,960
Pangpang.
I'm here.

369
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Tutu.
Is it cold?

370
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,920
Harry.
You need to go over there.

371
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Harry.
No, I have to go down.

372
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Pangpang.
You two need to come sit over here.

373
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,360
Pangpang.
Let's chat.

374
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,640
It feels so good.
Tutu.

375
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,560
It can't be released, right?
Tutu.

376
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,360
Terry.
It can be released.

377
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,600
It is being released.
Terry.

378
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,400
Terry.
This is for eating breakfast.

379
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,730
And there's this floating afternoon tea.
Meina.

380
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,640
Pangpang.
Don't you have anything...

381
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,080
...you want to ask on behalf of your siblings?
Pangpang.

382
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,920
Yes, I do.
Harry.

383
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,880
Then let me do it.
Tangtang.

384
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,760
Tangtang.
My sister is very self-consuming.

385
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,080
So she's in a lot of pain.
Tangtang.

386
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
Tangtang.
She came to me.

387
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,040
She asked me to find out...
Tangtang.

388
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,520
Tangtang.
...to observe Tutu.

389
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,320
To ask Tutu.
Tangtang.

390
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
Tangtang.
So I wanted to be the first to ask.

391
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,800
Tangtang came with a mission.
Muchun.

392
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,880
Ready to strike.
Yang Geng.

393
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Pang Pang.
Let's start with Tang Tang.

394
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,400
Tang Tang.
The first question.

395
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,520
How many girls in the cabin
Tang Tang.

396
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,880
Tang Tang.
have you sent heartfelt messages to?

397
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,120
Tu Tu.
Three.

398
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,560
Tu Tu.
First was Xin Xin.

399
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,000
Then it was Ta Ta that day.
Tu Tu.

400
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,520
And later, Xiao Ling.
Tu Tu.

401
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,320
Tang Tang.

402
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,380
Was she your second choice for a date?
Tang Tang.

403
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,840
This is very important.
Jiang Dunhao.

404
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Wu Zun.
Because he's very sensitive.

405
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,970
He knows what to ask.
Wu Zun.

406
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,520
You mean the one from the Secret Mirror House?
Tu Tu.

407
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,200
You mean the one from the Secret Mirror House?

408
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,280
Tu Tu.
And that day, I was thinking,

409
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,440
because I felt that after a whole day,
Tu Tu.

410
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,840
Tu Tu.
I had more interaction with Ta Ta after all.

411
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,000
Because that day I was with her,
Tu Tu.

412
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,760
Tu Tu.
we were (sports day) partners.

413
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,080
Then later in the evening,
Tu Tu.

414
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,400
Tu Tu.
when we went home,

415
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
I had more interaction with Xiao Ling.
Tu Tu.

416
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,520
Tu Tu.
So at that time, I was thinking,

417
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,080
I had interacted with these two people.
Tu Tu.

418
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,800
Tang Tang.
I'm asking if Xiao Ling knows, you know?

419
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,480
Zhang Zining.
He's good at grasping the key points.

420
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,360
Tang Tang is really good at asking questions.
Zhu Dan.

421
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,010
Tang Tang is really good at asking questions.

422
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,000
She doesn't know, right?
Tu Tu.

423
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,480
Tang Tang.
Do you feel you were sincere with Xiao Ling?

424
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,680
Straight to the point.
Zhu Dan.

425
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,840
Mei Na.
It should be straight to the point, actually.

426
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,960
Xiao Lu.
Harry's got such a strong bystander vibe.

427
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,840
Terry.
So sharp.

428
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,480
Zhu Dan.
The scrutinizing look from little brother.

429
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,410
Getting heated.
Zhang Zining.

430
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,940
I think I was very sincere.
Tu Tu.

431
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,760
It's from
Tu Tu.

432
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,160
Tu Tu.
the first day when we both

433
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,400
started sending each other (heartfelt) messages.
Tu Tu.

434
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
Tu Tu.
That's when we started interacting.

435
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,640
Then including playing together,
Tu Tu.

436
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,160
Tu Tu.
and later going on trips.

437
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,920
It was all very
Tu Tu.

438
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,160
Sincere.
Tang Tang.

439
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,720
Yes.
Tu Tu.

440
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,480
Tang Tang,
He said he was sincere towards Xiaoling.

441
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,400
what I can understand is that
Tang Tang,

442
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,000
Tang Tang,
he failed in competing for Tata,

443
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,720
he immediately
Tang Tang,

444
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,040
Tang Tang,
devoted himself completely to Xiaoling.

445
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,400
Tang Tang, if that's what he means by sincerity,

446
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,880
I think it might be a bit difficult.
Tang Tang,

447
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,330
I think it might be a bit difficult.

448
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,720
Tutu,
When he asked me if I was sincere,

449
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,280
I was actually a bit angry,
Tutu,

450
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,360
Tutu,
but I didn't express it.

451
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,160
I feel
Tutu,

452
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm very upset
Tutu,

453
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,960
Tutu,
because I think my sincerity

454
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,480
is completely obvious to everyone.
Tutu,

455
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,320
Tutu,
There might be some doubts later on,

456
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,800
some thoughts
Tutu,

457
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,880
Tutu,
in front of me,

458
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,080
there might be some
Tutu,

459
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,920
Tutu,
hesitation,

460
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,120
but my heart is definitely sincere.
Tutu,

461
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,320
Tang Tang,
What do you think your sincere behavior

462
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,800
is reflected in?
Tang Tang,

463
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,400
Jiang Dunhao.
Pressing step by step,

464
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Wu Zun,
So you need to target this kind of person.

465
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,200
do you want to be in a relationship with her?
Wu Zun,

466
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,240
these three are watching the show,
Zhu Dan,

467
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,200
Zhang Zining,
eating melon.

468
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,440
Tutu,
I think my sincere behavior

469
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,600
is reflected in
Tutu,

470
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,440
I didn't say
Tutu,

471
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,480
Tutu, that I was getting to know others while getting to know her.

472
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,560
Tutu,
At first, I was getting to know Xinxin,

473
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,640
then when Tata came the next day,
Tutu,

474
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,680
Tutu,
I was also forced to be with her

475
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,079
because we had to form a team.
Tutu,

476
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,119
Tutu, I didn't have the initiative to choose others,

477
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,480
Tutu,
so I was paired with her.

478
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,319
And even until the end,
Tutu,

479
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,400
Tutu,
I didn't try to get to know Tata or anyone else.

480
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,960
I was always with Xiaoling,
Tutu,

481
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,040
Tutu,
constantly trying to understand and communicate with her.

482
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,119
what you said is also right,
Meina,

483
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,920
Zhang Zining,
but it didn't answer the key point.

484
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,760
during those two days of travel,
Tang Tang,

485
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,240
Tang Tang,
Xiaoling's feeling was that

486
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,720
Tang Tang,
sometimes she took the initiative,

487
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,040
but you seemed a bit avoidant.
Tang Tang,

488
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,160
Zhu Dan,
He's being straightforward now.

489
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,960
I think Tutu didn't perceive it.
Zhang Zining,

490
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,840
Tang Tang,
Many times when she might be

491
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,600
sharing things with you,
Tang Tang,

492
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,560
Tang Tang,
you might change the subject.

493
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,200
or rather,
Tang Tang,

494
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,880
Tang Tang,
it's just relationship issues.

495
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,720
continue to discuss it in depth.
Tang Tang,

496
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,920
Tang Tang,
You would change the subject.

497
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Tu Tu,
did she tell you specifically

498
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,360
what you talked about?
Tu Tu,

499
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,320
Tang Tang,
No,

500
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,720
Tang Tang,

501
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,360
Tang Tang,
she was very upset.

502
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,520
Tu Tu,
Really?

503
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,080
but I really don't have any impression of this.
Tu Tu,

504
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,200
Tu Tu,
Because at that time,

505
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,600
Tu Tu,
I was just playing around.

506
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,760
I remember that day we
Tu Tu,

507
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,160
Pang Pang,
Think carefully,

508
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,920
let me think about it.
Tu Tu,

509
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,680
Pang Pang,
When a girl raises this kind of doubt about you,

510
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,400
there must be some basis for it.
Pang Pang,

511
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,560
they must have their reasons.
Harry,

512
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,160
Pang Pang,
Yes,

513
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,720
Pang Pang,
think back if you might have overlooked

514
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,560
when others were chatting with you,
Pang Pang,

515
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,480
Pang Pang,
you went off to play.

516
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,840
Tu Tu,
I think

517
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,280
actually, both of us
Tu Tu,

518
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,440
Tu Tu,
were mutually proactive.

519
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,800
Maybe in Xiaoling's view,
Tu Tu,

520
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,880
Tu Tu,
she might have some

521
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,720
initiatives from her side
Tu Tu,

522
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,520
Tu Tu,
to test me.

523
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,120
Maybe these tests were mistaken for
Tu Tu,

524
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,560
Tu Tu,
some of our regular communication points.

525
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,600
It got confused,
Tu Tu,

526
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,920
Tu Tu,
not particularly clear.

527
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,400
It caused some misunderstandings for her.
Tu Tu,

528
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,120
Tu Tu,
She might feel that I rejected her

529
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,680
this kind of probing.
Tu Tu,

530
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,160
Tang Tang,
Last question,

531
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,080
okay.
Tu Tu,

532
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,240
Tang Tang,
When I saw your letter,

533
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,120
your letter was full of your own feelings.
Tang Tang,

534
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,600
It didn't mention much about Xiaoling.
Tang Tang,

535
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,080
Tang Tang,
Let me look at your

536
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,920
Tang Tang,
Tu Tu, the whole letter might

537
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,800
focus more on your own feelings.
Tang Tang,

538
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,560
Tang Tang,
It actually didn't write about sister.

539
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,040
Tutu
Actually, that day I

540
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,080
When I knew I had to write this letter
Tutu

541
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,960
Tutu
I immediately started writing.

542
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,160
Because at that time
Tutu

543
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,320
Tutu
she was the first one to actively comfort me.

544
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,200
Besides my sister,
Tutu

545
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,440
Tutu
she was the one who came to comfort me.

546
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,500
I was actually very touched that day.
Tutu

547
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,840
Tutu
So I might write more about

548
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,000
why I was
Tutu

549
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,480
Tutu
upset because of that incident,

550
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,320
sad and heartbroken,
Tutu

551
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,240
Tutu
and how touched I was when she came to comfort me.

552
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,640
Then I might add some
Tutu

553
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,760
Tutu
previous experiences of our interaction

554
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,320
and some feelings about it.
Tutu

555
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,200
Zhu Dan
Looking at Tutu's answers, there's always a kind of

556
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,840
standard response.
Zhu Dan

557
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,280
Zhang Zining
He doesn't get to the point.

558
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,480
Tangtang

559
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,210
From a brother's perspective,
Tangtang

560
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,560
Tangtang,
I want to tell you

561
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,240
before you act, think clearly about
Tangtang,

562
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,040
Tangtang,
whether you

563
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,080
just feel comfortable
Tangtang,

564
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,800
Tangtang,
being with Xiaoling,

565
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,600
she knows how to take care of people,
Tangtang,

566
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,320
Tangtang,
or

567
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,320
you really have feelings for her.
Tangtang,

568
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,080
Zhang Zining
Right,

569
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,280
I think this is good.
Zhang Zining

570
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,200
Jiang Dunhao
Yes,

571
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,760
Tangtang, I also advise him to examine his true self

572
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,880
Tangtang,
and what his real thoughts are.

573
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,920
because I don't want my sister
Tangtang,

574
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,360
Tangtang,
to get hurt in this relationship.

575
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,560
sad and unhappy.
Tangtang,

576
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,920
Pangpang,
Pangpang, this question is just an inquiry for you,

577
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,360
but you do need to think deeply about it.
Pangpang,

578
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,080
Tutu
Yes, I know.

579
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,640
He asked this question,
Tutu

580
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,760
Tutu
and I'm actually thinking about it too.

581
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,600
Being with Xiaoling
Tutu

582
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,680
Tutu
is very comfortable.

583
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,680
But I'm not sure if this comfort
Tutu

584
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,560
Tutu
is the kind between friends

585
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,520
or the feeling of love.
Tutu

586
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,000
Wu Zun
Right?

587
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,560
He doesn't even know.
Wu Zun

588
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,400
This sounds a bit harsh to the younger brother.
Zhu Dan.

589
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,600
How do you feel about it in your own heart?
Pangpang.

590
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,440
this is what I can't distinguish now.
Tutu.

591
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,840
Pangpang.
You still haven't figured it out.

592
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,920
between friendship and love?
Pangpang.

593
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,500
between friendship and love?

594
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,000
If you had to choose, would you confess your feelings?
Harry.

595
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,480
If you had to choose, would you confess your feelings?

596
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,680
Zhu Dan.
The three people beside couldn't bear to listen anymore.

597
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,080
They all started to press for answers.
Zhu Dan.

598
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,040
Meina.
Tutu was about to cry.

599
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,160
I think if we ask him again...
Meina.

600
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,880
Xiaolu.
Mom, this love question is so difficult.

601
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,720
That's why I'm so...
Tutu.

602
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,160
Pangpang.
conflicted.

603
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,280
Tutu.
Conflicted and hesitant.

604
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,680
Because I think...
Tutu.
Conflicted and hesitant.

605
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,960
Tutu.
Confessing one's feelings is a...

606
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,160
rather serious matter.
Tutu.

607
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,800
Pangpang.
I still haven't figured it out.

608
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,920
Whether or not you should confess your feelings?
Pangpang.

609
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,530
Whether or not you should confess your feelings?

610
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,400
Tutu, I think my biggest feeling tonight...

611
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,240
Tutu.
is actually quite contradictory.

612
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,320
They don't really understand...
Tutu.

613
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,880
Tutu.
why I'm so hesitant now.

614
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,080
Tutu, what concerns or thoughts do you have?
Tutu.

615
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,320
Tutu.
So maybe in others' eyes...

616
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,850
I would be someone who is...
Tutu.

617
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,760
Tutu.
not proactive,

618
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,840
doesn't communicate,
Tutu.

619
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,120
Tutu.
and doesn't express themselves.

620
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,000
Including some of the questions he asked me...
Tutu.

621
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,080
they make me feel very uncomfortable.
Tutu.

622
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,800
Tangtang.
Tangtang, I don't actually have much ill will towards Tutu.

623
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,080
It's just that Xiaoling feels upset.
Tangtang.

624
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,680
I think Tutu should...
Tangtang.

625
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,560
Tangtang.
Whether it's positive...

626
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,360
or negative,
Tangtang.

627
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,680
Tangtang.
he needs to give a response.

628
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,440
And indeed,
Tangtang.

629
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,280
Tangtang.
you only have two days left.

630
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,400
Now you still don't know...
Tangtang.

631
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,760
Tangtang.
what your true feelings are.

632
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,160
Maybe he's just a slow-to-warm-up person.
Tangtang.

633
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,600
Tang Tang would feel very sorry for his sister.
Zhu Dan.

634
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,040
I think there's no love.
Wu Zun.

635
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
There's no inner drive.
Mu Chun.

636
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,520
Wu Zun.
Right.

637
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,360
Otherwise, why would you feel bad?
Wu Zun.

638
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,880
Xiao Lu.
What you can't distinguish is actually friendship.

639
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,840
I think so too.
Zhang Zining.

640
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,960
Mu Chun.
Tutu was very nervous just now.

641
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,680
Xiao Lu.
Yes.

642
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,360
Mu Chun.
Swallowing and pursing his lips.

643
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,120
Swaying slightly back and forth continuously.
Mu Chun.

644
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,880
His body is frantically secreting cortisol.
Yi Mu Chun.

645
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,560
Right, he doesn't dare to look at him.
Wu Zun.

646
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,600
Mu Chun.
Maybe Tutu has little experience in love.

647
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,720
Or even none at all.
Mu Chun.

648
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,680
Mu Chun.
So that kind of heart flutter,

649
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,240
he might have never experienced before.
Mu Chun.

650
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,880
Mu Chun.
The feeling of liking someone,

651
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,160
Mu Chun, it's actually easy to distinguish from friendship.

652
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,040
Right.
Wu Zun.

653
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,880
Your heart rate increases.
Zhang Zining.

654
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,360
Mu Chun.
Yes, I'm constantly thinking about this person,

655
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,240
I'm always thinking about this person.
Mu Chun.

656
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,640
Zhu Dan.
Yes.

657
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,520
You'll be concerned about
Zhu Dan.

658
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,320
Mu Chun.
their every move.

659
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
Everything will affect my emotions.
Mu Chun.

660
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,080
Everything will affect my emotions.

661
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,240
Mu Chun.
If you really like someone,

662
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,160
your inner drive
Mu Chun.

663
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,640
will make you do this.
Mu Chun.

664
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,840
Right, not enough love.
Wu Zun.

665
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,040
Xiao Lu.
Yes, and as for friendship,

666
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
it's the kind where you're just happy to see each other.
Xiao Lu.

667
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,560
Xiao Lu.
No one would

668
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,800
think about their friends
Xiao Lu.

669
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,360
This is very strange.
Xiao Lu.

670
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,280
Yang Gen.
It's actually a bit misplaced.

671
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,240
You see, Tutu is already at a very late stage,
Yang Gen.

672
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,080
Yang Gen.
Tang Tang asked him so directly,

673
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,640
only then did he start to think about it.
Yang Gen.

674
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,360
Yang Gen.
Have you ever had this experience where someone points it out,

675
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,920
and only then you realize it's a problem?
Yang Gen.

676
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,280
Xiao Lu.
I've recently become aware

677
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,520
For example, I often use
Xiao Lu.

678
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,960
Xiao Lu, I often use jokes to complain about things.

679
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,800
Xiao Lu.
Then one time, a friend

680
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,640
asked me a question,
Xiao Lu.

681
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,840
Xiao Lu.
Do you guys ever argue?

682
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,240
Then I said we don't seem to argue.
Xiao Lu.

683
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,700
Then I said we don't seem to argue.

684
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,720
Xiaolu,
Then they said,

685
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,560
how can couples not argue?
Xiaolu,

686
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,880
Xiaolu,
Then he meant that

687
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
not arguing is a problem.
Xiaolu,

688
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,720
Xiaolu,
But my understanding of arguing is like

689
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,200
Xiaolu,
maybe I can't tolerate losing control of myself.

690
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,880
that feeling.
Xiaolu,

691
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,800
Xiaolu, because I've seen my mom and dad argue since I was little.

692
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,440
Xiaolu,
That's their way of dealing with problems.

693
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,040
my mom would never raise her voice.
Xiaolu,

694
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,320
Xiaolu,
Like this.

695
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,800
my mom would just ignore and internalize it.
Xiaolu,

696
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
Xiaolu,
Then I probably

697
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,160
wouldn't have big arguments like that either.
Xiaolu,

698
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,120
Xiaolu, so my understanding is that we don't argue.

699
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,760
Xiaolu,
But my friends say you can't not argue.

700
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,520
I still feel like
Xiaolu,

701
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,760
Xiaolu,
Xiaolu, should I find an opportunity to have a big argument?

702
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,800
Zhu Dan,
small arguments are good for the relationship.

703
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,920
Zhu Dan,
but you must have clashes of opinions.

704
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,720
Xiaolu,
yes, we communicate.

705
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,160
sometimes there's emotional communication.
Xiaolu,

706
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,360
Xiaolu,
But it's not the kind with swearing.

707
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,440
Right, we can't really argue either.
Xiaolu,

708
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,570
My husband's Chinese is not very good,
Xiaolu,

709
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,680
Zhu Dan,
he can't argue with you.

710
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,760
Xiaolu,
once he might have said something.

711
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,880
then I just ignored him.
Xiaolu,

712
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,040
Then I was like,
Xiaolu,

713
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,440
Xiaolu,
with that kind of ugly expression.

714
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,360
then he said,
Xiaolu,

715
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,720
Xiaolu.
Why is your expression so disgusting?

716
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,960
Zhang Zining
So adorable.

717
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,480
burst into laughter immediately.
Zhu Dan

718
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,200
Then I just stood there laughing.
Xiaolu

719
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,880
Wu Zun
Can you please not get angry?

720
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,680
Xiaolu
Yes.

721
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,480
This is indeed hard to argue about.
Zhang Zining

722
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,600
Meina
It's a new type of argument mode.

723
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,680
Xiaolu
Right.

724
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,840
Wu Zun
I used to be that type.

725
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,480
Because I'm very energetic,
Wu Zun

726
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,360
Wu Zun
I just want to say we should go there.

727
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,320
But my wife, she's more
Wu Zun

728
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,880
Wu Zun
easily tired than I am.

729
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,200
Sometimes I see them looking very tired,
Wu Zun

730
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,280
Wu Zun
she sometimes says,

731
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,560
It would be better if we hadn't come.
Wu Zun

732
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,280
It would be better if we hadn't come.

733
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,760
Wu Zun
Yes.

734
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,680
So I gradually realized that
Wu Zun

735
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,520
maybe I've scheduled too much.
Wu Zun

736
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,240
Wu Zun
So now I schedule things,

737
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,400
but whether we go or not,
Wu Zun

738
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,360
Wu Zun
it doesn't matter anymore.

739
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,760
Because not everyone is like me,
Wu Zun

740
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,040
so energetic.
Wu Zun

741
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,920
Zhang Zining
Right.

742
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,160
Wu Zun
So we need to be a bit more sensitive about this.

743
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,320
Yes,
Wu Zun

744
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,520
Zhu Dan
I've become gentler.

745
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,440
Zhu Dan
I used to think that gentleness

746
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,920
had nothing to do with me.
Zhu Dan

747
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,000
Zhu Dan
I was always so energetic and busy,

748
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,560
including when I used to do variety shows and such.
Zhu Dan

749
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,080
I was someone who liked to control the stage and all that.

750
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,960
Zhu Dan
But it seems after having a child,

751
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
after getting married,
Zhu Dan

752
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,720
Zhu Dan
people kept telling me about this.

753
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,480
At first, I thought
Zhu Dan

754
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,000
Zhu Dan
everyone was just joking or something.

755
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,320
Zhu Dan.
later I realized,

756
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,080
then I went to see for myself,
Zhu Dan.

757
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,480
Zhu Dan.
I only realized when watching my show.

758
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,000
it seems my expression now compared to before,
Zhu Dan.

759
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,720
Zhu Dan.
really has undergone significant changes.

760
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,200
I've become less like a Leo.
Zhu Dan.

761
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,520
Meina.
the little woman side is well protected.

762
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,360
Zhu Dan.
I didn't even realize it myself.

763
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,880
it's the people around me who keep saying,
Zhu Dan.

764
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,200
matured, more mature.
Wu Zun.

765
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,960
Zhu Dan.
matured.

766
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,400
yes.
Wu Zun.

767
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,800
Meina.
love is nurturing.

768
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,080
I think Mr. Zhou is nurturing enough.
Meina.

769
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,600
Zhu Dan.
yes.

770
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,400
whether it's family life,
Zhu Dan.

771
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,920
Zhu Dan.
or the role of being a mother,

772
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,200
it will make you change.
Zhu Dan.

773
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,480
Zhu Dan.
I also realized after others reminded me,

774
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,600
I only then realized.
Zhu Dan.

775
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,960
Jiang Dunhao.
I don't need others to point it out.

776
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,120
Yang Gen.
you are the self-reflective type.

777
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,640
Jiang Dunhao.
even when you just 'tsk' there, I can,

778
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,560
think for a long time,
Zhang Zining.

779
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,240
Jiang Dunhao.
what does he mean.

780
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,920
Jiang Dunhao.
yes.

781
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,600
crazy internal consumption.
Jiang Dunhao.

782
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,880
Jiang Dunhao.
and I'm the kind of person,

783
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,480
who quickly admits defeat.
Jiang Dunhao.

784
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,240
Jiang Dunhao.
even if I did something wrong,

785
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,440
I would immediately kneel and slide,
Jiang Dunhao.

786
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,080
Jiang Dunhao.
and move on.

787
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,640
sorry.
Jiang Dunhao.

788
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,760
Jiang Dunhao, have you realized,
Zhu Dan.

789
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,680
Zhu Dan, that you are actually quite a dry humor person?

790
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,320
Jiang Dunhao.
I also learned from others.

791
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,040
this matter.
Jiang Dunhao.

792
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,360
Zhu Dan.
someone also asked if you are,

793
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,720
Jiang Dunhao.
yes.

794
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,680
a few short sentences can be very cute and humorous.
Zhu Dan.

795
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Jiang Dunhao.
yes, sometimes for example,

796
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,240
some jokes that Sister Xiaolu says,
Jiang Dunhao.

797
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Jiang Dunhao.
I just,

798
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,880
Jiang Dunhao.
would be like this.

799
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,680
Xiaolu.
Sneers.

800
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,840
Jiang Dunhao.
Then realizes after laughing,

801
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,240
when no one else is laughing.
Jiang Dunhao.

802
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,440
Jiang Dunhao.
Feels embarrassed.

803
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,840
Yang Gen.
Many of his reactions are quite adorable.

804
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,040
Zhu Dan.
Yes, very cute.

805
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,480
Terry.
Did Huahua tell you?

806
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,680
When you were in the Siblings' House,
Terry.

807
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,280
Terry.
did she tell you?

808
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,840
About her impression of me,
Terry.

809
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,280
Tutu.
I can only say it's very positive.

810
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,200
It's very comfortable being with him.
Tutu.

811
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,320
Tutu.
I feel you're very considerate.

812
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,960
And then,
Tutu.

813
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,040
Tutu.
Tutu, the thing that impressed me the most is

814
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,440
The first time you went out,
Tutu.

815
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,800
Tutu.
you kept taking photos for her.

816
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,560
And documenting.
Tutu.

817
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,400
Before that, she might have been someone
Tutu.

818
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,280
Terry.
Yes, she mentioned it to me.

819
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,160
who hadn't been documented much.
Tutu.

820
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,320
Terry.
Yes, she told me about that.

821
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,760
So later, including when we went to Tianjin,
Terry.

822
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Terry.
and then to the beach,

823
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,280
I kept taking photos for her.
Terry.

824
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,960
Terry.
I think she was quite happy.

825
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,680
Since we've reached this point,
Tutu.

826
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,000
Terry.
go ahead.

827
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,060
Let me ask you then.
Tutu.

828
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
What do you think,
Tutu.

829
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,520
Tutu.
how do you feel about her (Huahua) now?

830
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,360
What exactly are your feelings?
Tutu.

831
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,040
Terry,
From the very first time I went on a date with her,

832
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,720
I thought that
Terry,

833
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Terry,
Huahua was such an easygoing person,

834
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,240
we should be able to talk about a lot of things.
Terry,

835
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,000
Terry,
But honestly,

836
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,520
I was quite nervous on our first date.
Terry,

837
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,400
Terry,
At that time,

838
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,360
the awkwardness and unease,
Tutu,

839
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,440
Terry,
it was real awkwardness and unease.

840
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
this wasn't fake at all.
Terry,

841
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,600
This was real.
Terry,

842
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,200
Terry,
But then later in the old town,

843
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,760
we walked around the old town together,
Terry,

844
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,520
Terry,
and took photos.

845
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,400
gradually,
Terry,

846
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,000
Terry,
anyway, whether it was in the old town,

847
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,800
or later when we went to Tianjin,
Terry,

848
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,560
Terry,
and then to the Ferris wheel,

849
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,800
a lot of things happened.
Terry,

850
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,240
Terry,
Together with her,

851
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,800
I was basically always with her.
Terry,

852
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,840
Terry,
My feelings for her

853
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,360
were definitely getting better and better.
Terry,

854
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,680
Terry,
Now, my feelings for her,

855
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,720
as my brother, you should be able to sense it.
Terry,

856
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,440
as my brother, you should be able to sense it.

857
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,640
Terry,
Do you remember during 'Full House of Romance,'

858
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,840
the score I gave her?
Terry,

859
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,880
Terry,
Actually, that score

860
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,040
was exactly what I thought in my heart.
Terry,

861
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,320
Terry,
I gave her a seven to eight out of ten.

862
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,280
Because I
Terry,

863
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,320
Terry,
actually rely more on feelings when it comes to relationships.

864
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,560
Terry, when I feel it, I'll be with her.
Terry,

865
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,760
Terry,
I feel that now, with Huahua, it's

866
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,840
getting better and better.
Terry,

867
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,290
getting better and better.

868
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,440
Pangpang.
Let me ask a question,

869
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,080
Terry.
Go ahead,

870
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,200
Pangpang,
How do you feel about Huahua after your date,

871
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
Pangpang,
and then when she and I

872
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,920
after Pangpang clarified things in 'Full House of Romance,'

873
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,000
Pangpang,
she wrote the dating letter to me?

874
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,760
This matter.
Pangpang,

875
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,200
Terry,
Yes, I was actually quite disappointed at that time.

876
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,440
but Huahua took the initiative to come and talk to me about
Terry,

877
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,280
Terry,
this matter.

878
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,480
because before I came to the cabin,
Terry,

879
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,800
Terry,
she had contact with Pangpang.

880
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,400
there might have been some misunderstandings with you before.
Terry,

881
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,200
Terry,
Actually, that letter date,

882
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,040
I don't quite understand it.
Terry,

883
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,560
Terry,
Because the next day,

884
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,800
it was indeed a date I had with Huahua.
Terry,

885
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,840
Terry,
We went to assemble that bean.

886
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,080
Pangpang,
yes, because I refused.

887
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,200
Terry,
is that so?

888
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,200
Terry,
so if you didn't refuse,

889
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,520
she would have dated you, right?
Terry,

890
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:21,800
Pangpang,
Yes.

891
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,840
she would date both of you.
Harry,

892
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,680
Tutu,
She would date both.

893
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,360
Terry,
that's right.

894
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,960
Pangpang,
yes.

895
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,240
Terry,
Pangpang told me

896
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,680
he actually didn't write to Huahua.
Terry,

897
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,040
Terry,
I was quite shocked at that time.

898
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,560
but actually, after a few days of interaction,
Terry,

899
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,640
Terry,
there might be some misunderstanding between her and Pangpang.

900
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,040
they need to use a handwritten letter to clear up this misunderstanding.
Terry,

901
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,720
Terry,
After sorting out the sequence of events,

902
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,640
I actually still think
Terry,

903
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,600
I figured it out myself.
Terry,

904
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,960
Pangpang,
The kind of relationship you can accept is,

905
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,240
at first, the feeling towards you is just,
Pangpang,

906
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,640
Pangpang,
the first impression is

907
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,720
Terry,
I know what you mean.

908
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,800
Pangpang,
to gradually warming up.

909
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,400
can you accept this?
Pangpang,

910
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,240
Terry,
I can accept it.

911
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,560
this is why I
Terry,

912
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,480
Terry,
have such a long observation period before entering a relationship.

913
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,920
Pangpang,
so you think my

914
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,040
some behaviors during the outing
Pangpang,

915
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,440
Pangpang,
and some initiatives I took

916
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,400
do you think it would cause some
Pangpang,

917
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,000
Pangpang,
do you think it would cause some
Pangpang,

918
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,680
Terry,
sense of crisis for you?

919
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,600
Pangpang,
would it put pressure on you?

920
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,680
Terry,
to be honest, I really don't.

921
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,760
Pangpang,
okay.

922
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,000
Terry.
Why?

923
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,440
Because,
Terry.
Why?

924
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,640
Terry.
Hua Hua has been giving me a signal,

925
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,480
that is to say,
Terry.

926
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,680
Terry.
after that, every message she sent was to me,

927
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,940
and all the dates after that were with me.
Terry.

928
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,320
Terry.
Let me put it this way,

929
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,680
when we went on a trip,
Terry.

930
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,160
Terry.
if I had been a bit more proactive,

931
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,560
Hua Hua would definitely have sat with me.
Terry.

932
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,160
Pang Pang.
Okay.

933
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,040
That hit hard.
Zhang Zining.

934
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,680
Meina.
Terry's move was a 'killer'.

935
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,760
Jiang Dunhao.
What you care about, I don't.

936
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,120
So exciting.
Tutu.

937
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,200
Terry.
No, it's a free chat for everyone, right?

938
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
I think we should say what's on our minds.
Terry.

939
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,160
Pang Pang.
Because to be honest,

940
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,760
my relationship with Terry,
Pang Pang.

941
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Pang Pang.
should be competitive,

942
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
but during our interactions,
Pang Pang.

943
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,760
Pang Pang.
I never felt he had any,

944
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,680
that (rival) feeling towards me.
Pang Pang.

945
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,040
Pang Pang.
It won't affect our,

946
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
good brotherly relationship.
Pang Pang.

947
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,160
Terry.
I think so too.

948
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,640
Pang Pang.
His reaction to me,

949
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,680
was indeed sincere enough.
Pang Pang.

950
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,520
Pang Pang.
And now that this matter is out in the open,

951
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,480
everyone feels comfortable.
Pang Pang.

952
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,180
everyone feels comfortable.

953
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,080
Zhu Dan.
I think he doesn't want that behavior,

954
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Zhu Dan, to affect the matters between the two men.

955
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,320
So they just laid it all out.
Zhu Dan.

956
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,160
Made it clear.
Wu Zun.

957
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,560
Zhu Dan.
Right?

958
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,960
And then everyone shouldn't keep it in their hearts.
Wu Zun.

959
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,480
Zhu Dan.
Yes.

960
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,040
I think this is quite mature.
Xiaolu.

961
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,080
Pang Pang.
Next round is yours.

962
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,120
Terry.
It's your turn.

963
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,880
Harry,
So, do you think you are

964
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,680
the love at first sight type
Harry,

965
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,600
or the type that falls in love over time?
Harry,

966
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,240
Tang Tang,
I'm the love at first sight type.

967
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,640
Harry,
why?

968
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,560
Tang Tang,
it's just when I see a girl,

969
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,720
and I feel something at first sight,
Tang Tang,

970
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
Tang Tang,
I just really want to get close to her.

971
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,680
approach her.
Tang Tang,

972
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,880
Harry,
Is your feeling referring to a physical attraction

973
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,440
or
Harry,

974
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,680
Tang Tang,
love at first sight?

975
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,360
Terry,
it's a bit shallow.

976
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,120
it's definitely
Tang Tang,

977
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,400
Pangpang,
about appearance.

978
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,480
Tang Tang,
people are always attracted to beautiful things.

979
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,600
I agree.
Terry,

980
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,640
Pangpang,
That's reasonable.

981
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,480
Harry,
then I want to ask,

982
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,760
can you have a relationship if your values don't align?
Harry,

983
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,540
can you have a relationship if your values don't align?

984
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,440
Tang Tang,
I think they seem to align pretty well at the moment.

985
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,960
whether it's possible or not,
Tang Tang,

986
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,280
Tang Tang,
if they don't align, can you still date?

987
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,810
I'm not really sure either.
Tang Tang,

988
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,040
Harry,
Money, career, love, and family,

989
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,120
if you had to choose one, which would you pick?
Harry,

990
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,840
if you had to choose one, which would you pick?

991
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,480
are we eliminating one or ranking them?
Tang Tang,

992
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,320
rank them.
Harry,

993
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,400
Tang Tang,
For me, family should be first.

994
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,040
love and career.
Tang Tang,

995
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,800
Tang Tang,
If I'm with someone

996
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,760
for a while,
Tang Tang,

997
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,920
Tang Tang,
then love might move up in the ranking.

998
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,840
But for now, career is second,
Tang Tang,

999
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
love is third, and money is fourth.
Tang Tang,

1000
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,960
Meina,
All the answers are perfect.

1001
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,760
Jiang Dunhao,
awesome.

1002
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,720
Harry,
so the two are together,

1003
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,080
both don't like to communicate and then give each other the cold shoulder.
Harry,

1004
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,680
Harry,
Including these issues,

1005
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,800
Harry, can you really always go against your nature
Harry,

1006
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,760
Harry,
and not be a silent type

1007
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,600
to communicate about this?
Harry,

1008
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,290
to communicate about this?

1009
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,240
Tang Tang,
i now feel that actively reaching out to communicate with others,

1010
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,760
is not a difficult thing.
Tang Tang,

1011
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,440
Tang Tang,
previously, i thought,

1012
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,880
whether the other party might not want to communicate,
Tang Tang,

1013
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,680
that's one point.
Tang Tang,

1014
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,000
Tang Tang, second, whether doing this is cheap,

1015
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
Tang Tang,
that's the second point.

1016
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,080
and third, whether i am worth it.
Tang Tang,

1017
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,720
Tang Tang,
i think the initiative in communication,

1018
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,920
is not an issue,
Tang Tang,

1019
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,560
Harry,
for you now,

1020
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,080
actively communicating,
Harry,

1021
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,280
Harry,
is not considered difficult.

1022
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,240
but actively communicating,
Harry,

1023
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,920
Harry,
and when communicating,

1024
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,560
being able to accurately express,
Harry,

1025
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,080
Harry,
the emotions my sister needs,

1026
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,520
and the emotional value that needs to be provided,
Harry,

1027
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,640
Tang Tang,
it's just that i feel,

1028
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,440
i can't quite accurately capture,
Tang Tang,

1029
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,400
Tang Tang,
your sister,

1030
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,680
Su Su's points of unhappiness,
Tang Tang,

1031
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,320
Tang Tang,
or whatever it is.

1032
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,320
Tang Tang,
because i don't know her well enough now.

1033
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,720
to be honest,
Tang Tang,

1034
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,760
Tang Tang,
it's in the everyday life,

1035
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,080
in every little thing.
Tang Tang,

1036
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,600
Tang Tang,
but i think i can,

1037
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,360
express my unhappiness,
Tang Tang,

1038
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,840
Tang Tang,
or happiness,

1039
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,640
i express them all to her,
Tang Tang,

1040
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,240
i express them all to her,

1041
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,260
Tang Tang, because she is straightforward.

1042
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,720
Zhu Dan,
Tang Tang is very sincere.

1043
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,160
directly answer your question,
Zhu Dan,

1044
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,240
Zhu Dan,
i don't avoid it at all.

1045
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,000
i know what you care about.
Xiao Lu,

1046
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,560
Tang Tang,
perhaps i am inherently a,

1047
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,160
person who fears communication.
Tang Tang,

1048
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,720
Tang Tang,
here, i might repeatedly,

1049
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,320
step out of my comfort zone,
Tang Tang,

1050
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,040
Tang Tang,
break the protective layer i set for myself.

1051
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,000
i go to find Su Su,
Tang Tang,

1052
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,400
Tang Tang,
i go to chat with her,

1053
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,840
go to interact with her,
Tang Tang,

1054
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,480
Tang Tang,
fight for what i like.

1055
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,800
Terry,
as Tata's 'brother',

1056
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,200
let's use an analogy,
Terry,

1057
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,760
Terry,
if the confession succeeds,

1058
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,200
isn't she going to Japan afterwards,
Terry,

1059
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,600
Terry,
you need to go back to study.

1060
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,440
and then?
Terry,

1061
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,120
Either I'll be a bit more tired,
Harry.

1062
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,840
Harry.

1063
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,440
Then we can arrange the time.
Harry.

1064
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,160
Harry.
That's all.

1065
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,080
There's no good solution.
Harry.

1066
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,800
Harry.
Because of this idea,

1067
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,440
I worry about it for a long time every night.
Harry.

1068
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,200
I worry about it for a long time every night.

1069
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,760
Harry.
I've done a lot of research,

1070
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,920
including visas.
Harry.

1071
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,520
Harry.
The visa application can't be submitted.

1072
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
And this and that,
Harry.

1073
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,880
Harry.
just two or three months.

1074
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,040
It'll pass, it'll pass.
Harry.

1075
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,840
Harry.
Where there's a will, there's a way.

1076
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,570
Things will work out in the end.
Harry.

1077
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,760
Terry,
When you're in a long-distance relationship,

1078
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,120
what would you do if you had a fight?
Terry,

1079
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,690
what would you do if you had a fight?

1080
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,360
Harry.
Comfort her.

1081
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Terry,
What if you can't comfort her?

1082
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,400
Harry.
I can comfort her well.

1083
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,600
Terry,
Okay.

1084
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:34,880
Terry,
I can comfort her well.

1085
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,000
I think I can comfort her well.
Harry.

1086
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,960
you're so confident.
Terry,

1087
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,600
Harry.
Because I'm not the type to reason things out right away.

1088
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,400
I'll comfort someone first,
Harry.

1089
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,200
Harry.
then talk about reason.

1090
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,960
Comfort first, then reason.
Harry.

1091
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,040
If I can't comfort her, I won't try to reason.
Harry.

1092
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
If I can't comfort her, I won't try to reason.

1093
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,920
Harry.
If there's really no other way, I'll fly over there.

1094
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,600
Yes,
Harry.

1095
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,000
Terry,
I think that's a good point.

1096
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,960
Harry.
actually, fighting online

1097
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,080
is really pointless.
Harry.

1098
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,640
Harry.
First,

1099
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,680
you can only see cold words,
Harry.

1100
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,320
Harry.
unable to feel the other person's emotions.

1101
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,800
Second,
Harry.

1102
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,360
Harry.
you can't catch any small details either.

1103
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:56,840
Terry,
Right.

1104
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,760
the text and
Terry,

1105
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,080
Terry,
the words typed are different from spoken words.

1106
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,840
It's really different.
Terry,

1107
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,640
Harry.
Different.

1108
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,280
So what's in your heart
Harry.

1109
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,080
Harry.
and what you type

1110
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,640
are still different.
Harry.

1111
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,280
are still different.

1112
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,920
let's open a blind box, okay?
Pangpang,

1113
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,880
Pangpang
I'll draw one first.

1114
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,139
What a scary question.
Tutu

1115
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,159
What's the question?
Tutu

1116
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,000
Tangtang
The first question.

1117
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,120
To how many people have you sent heartfelt messages?
Tangtang

1118
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,929
To how many people have you sent heartfelt messages?

1119
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,760
Pangpang
I've sent them to three people.

1120
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,040
Tutu
Which three?

1121
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,239
Pangpang
Huahua, Xiaoling,

1122
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,639
and Tata because it was her first day here.
Pangpang

1123
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,719
Pangpang
I sent a welcome message.

1124
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,840
Pangpang
How do you define a heartfelt message?

1125
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,360
I think a heartfelt message
Pangpang

1126
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,000
Pangpang
in my eyes is one that expresses sincere feelings.

1127
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,040
Tutu
Expressing sincere feelings.

1128
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,120
So when you welcome someone on their first day,
Tutu

1129
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,280
sending them a welcome message,
Tutu

1130
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,600
Pangpang
yes, it's like a friend has arrived.

1131
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,840
Isn't that a heartfelt gesture?
Pangpang

1132
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,400
Isn't that a heartfelt gesture?

1133
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
He's quite good at this.
Meina

1134
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,120
Terry
Tutu's laugh

1135
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,920
Then comforting him is also her sincere intention.
Tutu

1136
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,280
Pangpang
It's different in the early and later stages.

1137
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,239
Alright, you can justify it any way.
Jiang Dunhao

1138
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,600
Mu Chun
it's different in the early and later stages.

1139
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,120
Pangpang
After you know the other person's intentions,

1140
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,200
Pangpang, the meaning of these heartfelt messages changes.

1141
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,330
Okay, I understand.
Tutu

1142
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,240
Pangpang
Then, in the life in the cabin,

1143
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,600
at what moment did you feel a sense of crisis?
Pangpang

1144
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,840
Pangpang
Terry is a very good person.

1145
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,360
So I didn't feel any sense of crisis.
Pangpang

1146
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,840
So I didn't feel any sense of crisis.

1147
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,600
Pangpang
The last two days.

1148
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,640
Would I help my siblings in their romantic pursuits?
Pangpang

1149
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,920
Pangpang
This is not something I would do.

1150
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,480
Pangpang, but if my siblings have a romantic storyline,
Pangpang

1151
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,840
Pangpang
I probably would.

1152
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,160
Let me.
Tu

1153
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,640
Tutu
To how many people have I sent heartfelt messages?

1154
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,160
As I just said, it's also three people.
Tutu

1155
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,560
Tutu
Xinxin at the very beginning,

1156
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,520
then Tata that day,
Tutu

1157
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,880
Tutu
and then Xiaoling.

1158
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,360
Tutu, then how do I define a heartfelt message?
Tutu

1159
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,280
Tutu
It's a

1160
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,640
After you've interacted with that person,
Tutu

1161
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,400
Tutu
you feel that towards her

1162
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,130
you want to know more about her.
Tutu

1163
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,120
Tutu
It's meant to express some of your current

1164
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,360
thoughts you want to say to her.
Tutu

1165
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,960
You can send them through a heartfelt message.
Tutu

1166
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,680
Tutu
At what moment did I feel a sense of crisis?

1167
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,400
Tutu
Tutu, that day after we were together in the Romantic House

1168
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,720
because my sister has never
Tutu

1169
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,800
had such a big conflict with me.
Tutu

1170
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,160
This should be a crisis in your relationship, right?
Pangpang

1171
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,720
Jiang Dunhao
What we're talking about has nothing to do with Xiaoling.

1172
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,240
Tutu
No, it's just feeling a sense of crisis.

1173
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,040
Zhu Dan
He's avoiding it again.

1174
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,800
Xiaolu
He's talking about a family crisis.

1175
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,400
Tutu
At that moment, I felt there would be

1176
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,720
some gaps appearing between me and my siblings.
Tutu

1177
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,560
Wu Zun
He wants to avoid talking about love.

1178
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,290
Zhang Zining
Yes.

1179
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,080
Tangtang
Does he really care about Xiaoling?

1180
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,400
Tangtang
Many times when chatting with Tutu

1181
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,640
I feel quite confused.
Tangtang

1182
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,560
Tangtang
Just

1183
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,800
Tangtang
I don't know what he's really thinking.

1184
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,000
Tutu
In the last two days

1185
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,120
Will I still help my siblings?
Tutu

1186
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,800
Tutu
I don't need any help.

1187
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,880
It depends on her.
Tutu

1188
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,120
Tangtang
Have you sent heartfelt messages to several people?

1189
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,160
I've sent one to one person.
Tangtang

1190
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,080
Susu
Tangtang

1191
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,960
Zhang Zining
Staying loyal from beginning to end.

1192
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,040
Tangtang
How do I define a heartfelt message?

1193
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,920
Tangtang
My definition of a heartfelt message is

1194
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,720
Tangtang
I want to get to know the person I like.

1195
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,880
Tangtang
In the house

1196
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,080
At what moment did you feel a sense of crisis?
Tangtang

1197
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,480
Tangtang
When Terry came.

1198
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,800
Tutu
Really?

1199
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,760
Just that
Tutu

1200
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,120
That day
Tutu

1201
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,080
Tangtang
Tangtang, because Susu sent you a heartfelt message

1202
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,960
Tangtang, I was actually quite devastated that night.

1203
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,240
Tangtang
I felt at that time that maybe

1204
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,800
Tangtang
the affection was stripped away.

1205
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
Tangtang
In the last two days

1206
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Will I help my siblings?
Tangtang

1207
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,920
Tangtang
I won't.

1208
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,560
Harry.
Question one.

1209
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,760
I've sent three.
Harry.

1210
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,800
Tutu.
Which three?

1211
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,600
Harry.
Xinxin wanted to approach her at first.

1212
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,680
Then the second one was Xiaoling.
Harry.

1213
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,460
Then the second one was Xiaoling.

1214
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,400
Harry.
I sent it to her on the day of the Cupid date.

1215
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,080
I made it very clear.
Harry.

1216
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,240
I said we should interact as friends.
Harry.

1217
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,960
Harry.
Then it was Tata.

1218
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,280
After that, I kept sending messages to Tata.
Harry.

1219
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,000
That's all.
Harry.

1220
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,000
Harry.
During the cabin life,

1221
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,360
at what moment did you feel a sense of crisis?
Harry.

1222
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,760
Harry.
A sense of crisis?

1223
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,080
I feel like every day,
Harry.

1224
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,520
Harry.
I have a constant sense of crisis.

1225
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,160
Because actually, for me,
Harry.

1226
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,320
Harry.
the sense of crisis doesn't come from others.

1227
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,120
It's something I create for myself.
Harry.

1228
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,680
Harry, I tend to overthink about things that haven't happened yet.

1229
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,760
I tend to overthink about things that haven't happened yet,
Harry.

1230
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,520
Harry.
or things that have happened or similar situations.

1231
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,880
I always imagine these scenarios.
Harry.

1232
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,280
What if it happens?
Harry.

1233
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,880
Harry, will you still help your teammates in the last two days?

1234
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,560
Harry.
As long as she needs me or

1235
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
Harry.
Tom.

1236
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,960
If Tom needs me to speak for him,
Harry.

1237
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,760
Harry.
to help him express,

1238
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,040
to help him convey some things,
Harry.

1239
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,280
Harry.
I will do it.

1240
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,560
If neither of them needs me,
Harry.

1241
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,120
Harry.
then I definitely won't do it.

1242
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,760
I'll just step back.
Harry.

1243
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,250
I'll just step back.

1244
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,520
Terry.
To how many people have you sent messages expressing your feelings?

1245
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,850
I've also sent to three.
Terry.

1246
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,040
Terry.
Terry, the first one I sent a message to was Susu.

1247
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,440
Because at that time, we four guys were having a meal.
Terry.

1248
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,120
Terry, everyone asked me who I had the best first impression of.

1249
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,650
Terry, the second message was sent to Xinxin.

1250
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,800
Terry.
Yes, I sent it to Xinxin.

1251
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,080
Because that day, we
Terry.

1252
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,960
Terry.
after the ice sports ended,

1253
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,800
I had just finished a date with Susu at that time.
Terry.

1254
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,760
Terry.
I felt that Susu and I might be quite similar.

1255
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,560
I thought we might be more suitable as friends.
Terry.

1256
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,040
Terry.
So I thought,

1257
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,960
I should try to interact with other girls.
Terry.

1258
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,560
Terry.
Then after returning to the cabin that day,

1259
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,440
I probably
Terry.

1260
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,800
had more interactions with Xinxin.
Terry.

1261
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,440
had more interactions with Xinxin.

1262
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,000
Terry.
After that, it's Huahua.

1263
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,120
They were all sent to Huahua.
Terry.

1264
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,600
They were all sent to Huahua.

1265
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,920
Terry.
So, the heartfelt messages...

1266
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,440
I think it's a daily...
Terry.

1267
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,360
Terry.
...expression of one's inner feelings.

1268
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,240
To tell the other person.
Terry.

1269
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,760
To tell the other person.

1270
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,200
Terry.
Then, in the life in the cabin...

1271
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,080
At what moment did you feel a sense of crisis?
Terry.

1272
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,660
At what moment did you feel a sense of crisis?

1273
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,040
Terry.
The moment Huahua wrote a letter to Pangpang.

1274
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,920
I indeed did.
Terry.

1275
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,280
Jiang Dunhao.
To be honest.

1276
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,360
Terry.
Yes, indeed there was.

1277
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,080
Terry.
It was at that moment.

1278
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,520
Terry.
The last two days.

1279
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,960
Would you still help your siblings in their romantic pursuits?
Terry.

1280
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,120
Terry.
I don't have any siblings (here).

1281
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,280
Help Tata and Harry.
Terry.

1282
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,720
Terry.
I don't think it's necessary anymore.

1283
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,080
These two are always stuck together.
Terry.

1284
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,780
These two are always stuck together.

1285
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,080
Terry.
Next.

1286
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,880
Why don't you open it?
Terry.

1287
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,920
Tangtang.
Let's open it.

1288
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,960
Harry.
At this stage...

1289
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,920
...siblings and romantic interests...
Harry.

1290
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,080
...what proportion do they occupy in your heart?
Harry.

1291
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,650
...what proportion do they occupy in your heart?

1292
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,560
This is the most difficult question.
Pangpang.

1293
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,920
This is very sharp.
Terry.

1294
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,120
Terry.
I'll go first.

1295
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,680
I might be a bit simpler.
Terry.

1296
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,360
Terry.
To be honest...

1297
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,280
Even if my sister were here...
Terry.

1298
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,240
Terry.
I would say without hesitation...

1299
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
The romantic interest occupies...
Terry.

1300
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,560
Terry.
...one hundred percent.

1301
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,160
Terry.
Really.

1302
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm a bit love-brained because...
Terry.

1303
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,090
I'm a bit love-brained because...

1304
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,920
Harry: Actually, Tata occupies more in my heart.

1305
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,560
Terry.
There is a proportion.

1306
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,400
What's the proportion?
Terry.

1307
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,440
Ten thousand percent.
Harry.

1308
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,080
Terry.

1309
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,640
Harry
Because I'm really a

1310
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,080
very love-obsessed person.
Harry

1311
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,640
Pangpang
Actually, I've been dealing with my crush

1312
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,280
and my siblings' relationship as fifty-fifty.
Pangpang

1313
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,520
Tangtang
My proportion

1314
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,280
Actually, siblings are sixty
Tangtang

1315
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,760
Tangtang
and my crush is forty.

1316
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,800
Actually, we've only been in the cabin for about ten days.
Tangtang

1317
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,640
Tangtang
I think at this stage,

1318
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,160
Tangtang, a crush can't compare to siblings.

1319
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,880
Tangtang
But I want to give my crush

1320
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,280
the happiest times.
Tangtang

1321
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,640
Tangtang
It might be

1322
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,720
when my siblings don't need me,
Tangtang

1323
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,520
Tangtang
I'll spend more time with my crush.

1324
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,760
Tutu
I think I should be the same as Tangtang.

1325
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,720
It's sixty-forty.
Tutu

1326
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,080
Tutu
That time I cried, I felt like

1327
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,560
it made me realize
Tutu

1328
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,280
how important my siblings are to me.
Tutu

1329
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,440
Tutu
Let's clean up

1330
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,560
and then let's go for barbecue.
Tutu

1331
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:40,880
Pangpang
Barbecue

1332
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,480
Then we'll ask the next two questions.
Pangpang

1333
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,400
Let's go for barbecue.
Harry

1334
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:43,930
Pangpang
Okay.

1335
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,880
Xiaoling
It's so beautiful.

1336
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,520
Tata
Back to the starting point again.

1337
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,440
On my first day in the cabin,
Tata

1338
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,320
Tata
I had dates with every guy right here.

1339
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,520
Really?
Xiaoling

1340
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,760
Xiaoling
You've been to this place before?

1341
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,480
Yes.
Tata

1342
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,280
Zhu Dan
I always feel that between girls,

1343
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,840
they would share their own feelings
Zhu Dan

1344
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,520
Zhu Dan
a bit more.

1345
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,040
Meina
Yes.

1346
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,600
Zhu Dan
I think Xiaoling

1347
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,880
will definitely share her doubts.
Zhu Dan

1348
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,530
will definitely share her doubts.

1349
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,600
Xiaoling
Let's play a cocktail relay game.

1350
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,320
And mix in a Fruit Cube at the end.
Xiaoling

1351
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,160
Tata
Okay.

1352
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,600
Huahua
What?

1353
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,720
You're just relying on Fruit Cube
Huahua

1354
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,360
Huahua
because it tastes good no matter how you mix it.

1355
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,760
Starting to get creative, huh?
Huahua

1356
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,080
Come on, let's do it.
Tata

1357
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,000
I'll add half a glass.
Tata

1358
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,320
How about you do a blind selection of a fruit cube?
Xiaoling.

1359
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:38,920
Okay.
Huahua.

1360
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,960
Come on, let's blindfold her.
Xiaoling.

1361
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,580
Come on, let's blindfold her.

1362
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,360
Xiaoling.
I'll take your hand.

1363
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,480
Starting from here, this is the first one.
Xiaoling.

1364
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,320
Xiaoling.
two, three, four.

1365
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,080
Xiaoling.
You choose.

1366
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,640
Huahua.

1367
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,370
White grape.
Tata.

1368
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,600
Tata.
This one looks amazing.

1369
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,800
Let's take a picture.
Tata.

1370
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,400
Huahua.
I can't wait.

1371
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,480
Hurry up and take it.
Huahua.

1372
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,320
Right away.
Tata.

1373
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,200
Xiaoling.
The color is so beautiful.

1374
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,880
Try it.
Xiaoling.

1375
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,920
Huahua.
Cheers.

1376
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,560
Here.
Xiaoling.

1377
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,680
Huahua.
It's good, isn't it?

1378
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,920
Xiaoling.
It's delicious.

1379
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,680
Huahua.
It's really good.

1380
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,880
Tata.
Can we mix a few more drinks later?

1381
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,400
Xiaoling.
Eat as much as you like.

1382
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,260
Tata, I had a plate of snacks like this on my date too.

1383
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,600
Tata.
Last time, Harry just came in and...

1384
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,280
So full.
Tata.

1385
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,960
Tata.
He came in like this.

1386
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,880
Susu.
I heard about it.

1387
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,520
He said he was completely unprepared that day.
Susu.

1388
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,160
Susu.
And he had no baggage at all.

1389
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,480
Tata.
He kept rubbing his belly there.

1390
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,560
I thought for a moment.
Tata.

1391
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,480
Tata.
He was trying to give me some hint for conversation.

1392
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,520
Huahua.
They came in turns like this.

1393
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,560
Didn't they know who should go in first?
Huahua.

1394
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,620
Tata, each of them said they were going to the bathroom.

1395
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,840
Tata.
And each person...

1396
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,600
chatted with me for different lengths of time.
Tata.

1397
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,440
chatted with me for different lengths of time.

1398
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,600
Tata.
Because it was up to me to decide.

1399
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,320
Huahua.
You decide to chat with this person for five minutes.

1400
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,640
And that person for ten minutes.
Huahua.

1401
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,040
Tata.
Anyway, you can extend the time when it's up.

1402
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,520
Tata
It can also be terminated.

1403
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,680
Did you renew it then?
Xiaoling

1404
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,760
Susu
Yes, Harry did.

1405
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,840
Zhu Dan
Harry was the only one who added time.

1406
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,560
Yang Gen
That's right.

1407
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,360
Indeed, I hit it off with him the most on the first day.
Tata

1408
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,400
Susu
Because he was relaxed.

1409
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,200
Because his stomach was too full.
Susu

1410
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,120
Tata
He was super relaxed.

1411
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,600
extremely relaxed.
Tata

1412
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,480
Tata, actually, the boys in the cabin are all very young.
Tata

1413
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,650
Tata, actually, the boys in the cabin are all very young.

1414
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,920
Huahua
Yes.

1415
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,960
Inside the cabin,
Huahua

1416
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,440
Huahua
there aren't actually many who are very proactive.

1417
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,360
Harry is considered quite proactive.
Huahua

1418
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,240
Xiaoling
Harry is very proactive.

1419
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,000
Huahua
Really very proactive.

1420
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,240
Tata
But when I took the initiative, he ignored me.

1421
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,200
Susu
Rejected three times.

1422
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,760
Still bravely charging forward.
Susu

1423
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,680
Susu
Luo Tata

1424
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,920
Xiaoling
So,

1425
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,520
Huahua
has it already started?

1426
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,400
It's so scary when she's like this.
Huahua

1427
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:38,920
Huahua
So,

1428
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,480
Xinxin
you ask.

1429
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,600
You're across from her, it's convenient for you.
Xinxin

1430
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,960
Susu
Mimi's burning gaze.

1431
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,160
Burning big eyes.
Susu

1432
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,720
We're going to ask Tutu, right?
Yang Gen

1433
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,320
Let's see if Huahua is lying.
Tata

1434
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,120
Xiaoling
I'm more curious about

1435
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,120
whether Tutu has ever told you
Xiaoling

1436
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,680
Xiaoling
what impression he has of me,

1437
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,520
or how he feels about me,
Xiaoling

1438
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,010
or how he feels about me,

1439
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,960
Huahua
from the very beginning.

1440
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,040
I might have paid more attention to his emotions,
Huahua

1441
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,040
Huahua
a bit more.

1442
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,560
But at that time, it was early on,
Huahua

1443
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,120
Huahua
I would think

1444
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,800
when he was spending more time with Xinxin.
Huahua

1445
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,520
when he was spending more time with Xinxin.

1446
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,200
At that time, I would ask him more questions.
Huahua

1447
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,960
Huahua
After I had my own things to deal with later,

1448
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,160
I didn't pay much attention anymore.
Huahua

1449
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,720
Huahua
But I

1450
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,520
Huahua
I think his interaction with you

1451
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,320
is very comfortable and at ease.
Huahua

1452
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,040
Xiaoling
But I

1453
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,560
I feel like he
Xiaoling

1454
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,400
Xiaoling
isn't very proactive.

1455
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,360
So I'm thinking
Xiaoling

1456
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,320
Huahua
he's not taking the initiative with you.

1457
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,600
Xiaoling
I thought I was being proactive with him.

1458
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,160
Then
Xiaoling

1459
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,600
Huahua
from my perspective,

1460
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,920
I don't think you've been proactive with him,
Huahua

1461
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,360
Huahua
but I think he's been very proactive with you.

1462
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,680
Xinxin
Elaborate on that.

1463
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,360
Susu
Your lack of initiative.

1464
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,040
What do you mean by lack of initiative?
Susu

1465
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,280
Susu
Quick, I want to compare.

1466
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,600
Yang Gen
I think this might actually make Xiaoling

1467
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,730
get confused again.
Yang Gen

1468
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,640
Xiaoling
Because I remember, isn't he

1469
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,080
that photographer who won first place?
Xiaoling

1470
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,840
Xiaoling
Then he could switch with someone of the opposite sex.

1471
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,640
The next day in the car,
Xiaoling

1472
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,760
Xiaoling
I was actually quite happy to see him.

1473
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,080
But he said,
Xiaoling

1474
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Xiaoling
'If I had known this was the reward,

1475
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,000
I wouldn't have wanted it.'
Xiaoling

1476
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,610
I wouldn't have wanted it.'

1477
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,360
Xinxin
Tutu wanted to win.

1478
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,640
Was it to have this privilege?
Xinxin

1479
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,240
Xinxin
Was it?

1480
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:55,800
Tutu
No,

1481
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,280
actually, if I had known this was the reward,
Tutu

1482
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,480
I wouldn't have wanted to win.
Tutu

1483
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:58,940
I wouldn't have wanted to win.

1484
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,640
Xiaoling
He doesn't want to be with me, I know.

1485
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,200
Tata
He said this.

1486
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,440
And then I just
Xiaoling

1487
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,240
Huahua, his first reaction was definitely wanting to be in a group with you.

1488
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,520
Huahua
And that's why he wanted

1489
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,960
this opportunity to switch.
Huahua

1490
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Huahua
His chance to switch was constantly

1491
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,040
hesitating between me and Xinxin.
Huahua

1492
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,840
hesitating between me and Xinxin.

1493
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,960
Huahua, in the end, his choice might still be wanting
Huahua

1494
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,770
Huahua, in the end, his choice might still be wanting

1495
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,080
Huahua
me to interact more with the two guys.

1496
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,960
Then I told him,
Huahua

1497
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,880
Huahua
I said, 'You're making me feel very'

1498
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,160
Xiaoling
Yes, so I was confused.

1499
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
Then I didn't
Xiaoling

1500
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,360
Xiaoling

1501
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,080
want to talk to him.
Xiaoling

1502
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,200
But I didn't have the courage.
Xiaoling

1503
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,000
Xiaoling, so I said I'd come today to ask his sister.
Xiaoling

1504
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,520
Xiaoling, so I said I'd come today to ask his sister.

1505
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,600
Huahua,
Why don't you ask him?

1506
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,520
just confront him directly.
Huahua,

1507
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
Huahua,
What do you mean?

1508
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,280
are you unsatisfied with the current outcome?
Huahua,

1509
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,320
Susu,
If it were me, I wouldn't dare to ask either.

1510
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,280
it's so awkward.
Susu,

1511
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,960
Susu,
If I heard the answer I expected,

1512
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,040
it would be too embarrassing.
Susu,

1513
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,620
it would be too embarrassing.

1514
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,360
Xiaoling,
I tend to overthink things.

1515
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,000
Huahua,
then don't think about it.

1516
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,730
this is completely unfounded.
Huahua,

1517
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,280
Xiaoling,
Okay.

1518
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,920
Huahua,
I didn't realize Xiaoling was such a

1519
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,840
emotionally sensitive person.
Huahua,

1520
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,760
Huahua,
I never would have guessed.

1521
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,480
Tata,
Xiaoling is a

1522
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,000
person with a lot of inner thoughts.
Tata,

1523
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Xiaoling,
And sometimes I feel

1524
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,560
I might have been too forward.
Xiaoling,

1525
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,760
Huahua,
What kind of

1526
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,440
things do you think you did that were forward?
Huahua,

1527
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,290
things do you think you did that were forward?

1528
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,240
Xiaoling,
When we were at the beach,

1529
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,200
I wasn't really cold at the time.
Xiaoling,

1530
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:11,840
Xiaoling,
Then I saw Tutu,

1531
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,360
and I said, 'Why don't you wear mine?'
Xiaoling,

1532
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,480
Xiaoling,
So he put on my clothes.

1533
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,160
then I was holding
Xiaoling,

1534
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,720
Xiaoling,
then you asked me, right?

1535
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,080
you asked why I was holding his clothes
Xiaoling,

1536
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,720
Xiaoling,
while he was wearing mine.

1537
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,580
I said, 'Maybe because I want to.'
Xiaoling,

1538
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,760
Xiaoling,
I think this was

1539
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,600
a very forward thing for me to do.
Xiaoling,

1540
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,000
Xiaolu,
That's right.

1541
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,240
Susu,
I think so too.

1542
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,840
Xinxin,
if I did something like that, it would mean I really like

1543
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,480
that's the only reason I would do it.
Xinxin,

1544
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,240
Xiaoling,
I am indeed quite interested in him.

1545
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,080
Xiaoling,
I might hope that

1546
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,240
whether it's about this particular thing
Xiaoling,

1547
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:37,880
or something else,
Xiaoling,

1548
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,160
Susu,
he would respond.

1549
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,560
Xiaoling,
maybe he could take the initiative too.

1550
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,080
Huahua.
I see.

1551
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,000
Huahua
Based on my previous observations, I thought

1552
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Tutu was the proactive one.
Huahua

1553
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,960
Huahua
But after tonight's dinner,

1554
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,960
Huahua, I feel that Xiaoling is quite proactive too.

1555
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,280
Yang Gen
For Xiaoling to be able to, in front of these girls,

1556
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,600
bravely express
Yang Gen

1557
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,360
her direct feelings for Tutu,
Yang Gen

1558
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,160
that's already very brave.
Xiaolu

1559
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,800
Yang Gen,
It's a big step forward.

1560
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,960
Huahua
what's been the most memorable day for you

1561
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,160
in the little house?
Huahua

1562
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,320
Huahua
Out of all these days,

1563
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,120
it's definitely the day I celebrated my birthday.
Tata,

1564
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:07,680
it's definitely the day I celebrated my birthday.

1565
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,720
Huahua,
You planned it, right?

1566
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,880
can you describe it?
Huahua,

1567
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,520
Tata,
We went out in the afternoon and had a meal first.

1568
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,200
but during the meal, he just
Tata,

1569
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,520
Tata, he kept taking out some

1570
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,600
Tata,
gifts he had prepared, one after another.

1571
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,240
Susu,
one after another, again and again.

1572
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,880
Huahua,
what do you mean by 'one after another'?

1573
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,600
Tata,
it means he didn't take them out all at once.

1574
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,160
you know,
Tata,

1575
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,560
Tata
he

1576
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:23,960
cake
Huahua

1577
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,040
Tata,
he gave one thing at a time.

1578
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,960
one at a time.
Tata,

1579
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,680
Huahua,
What did he give?

1580
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,000
Tata,
well, he first gave me

1581
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,330
he bought me a bracelet.
Tata,

1582
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,200
Tata
He went to Yonghegong very early in the morning

1583
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,330
to buy me a bracelet.
Tata

1584
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,800
then later he gave me flowers.
Tata,

1585
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,720
Tata,
He did it all step by step like this.

1586
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,280
Susu
I'm really impressed.

1587
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,840
Tata,
Actually, at that time, wasn't there that...

1588
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,360
it was only after the interview that he came to me.
Tata,

1589
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,520
Tata,
And had a date with me.

1590
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,680
actually, after the interview,
Tata,

1591
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,640
Tata,
he had a date with me the next day.

1592
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,040
the time was very brief.
Tata,

1593
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:55,640
Tata,
You know?

1594
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,640
Tata, but in that short time,

1595
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,440
Tata,
he prepared so much.

1596
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,680
I just feel...
Tata,

1597
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,000
Susu,
What?

1598
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,760
was it your brother's online
Susu,

1599
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,160
Susu,
Mirror House interview?

1600
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:03,800
or what?
Susu,

1601
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,600
Tata,
Anyway, my brother was involved.

1602
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,280
Huahua,
the interview your brother conducted.

1603
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,480
Tata,
I was actually there too.

1604
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,800
but 80% of the questions
Tata,

1605
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,400
were thought up by him for me.
Tata,

1606
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,080
Tata,
Then, at that time, Tutu and Harry,

1607
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,720
their answers were very
Tata,

1608
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,000
Tata,
different from each other.

1609
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,860
the two of them,
Tata,

1610
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,560
their personalities are also very different.
Tata,

1611
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,640
their personalities are also very different.

1612
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,720
Huahua,
One is more mature,

1613
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,160
and the other is more...
Huahua,
One is more mature,

1614
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,720
and the other is more...

1615
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,400
Tata,
No,

1616
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,720
Tutu was also very mature that day.
Tata,

1617
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,320
Huahua,
Really?

1618
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,440
Xiaoling,
did Tutu also go to your interview?

1619
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,680
Huahua,
okay, stop talking.

1620
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,200
no, that day he
Tata,

1621
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:34,720
Huahua,
he didn't go.

1622
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,680
Tata,
it was just purely...

1623
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,000
Huahua,
right, he just communicated a bit.

1624
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,720
Tata,
he didn't have any interest in me at all.

1625
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,520
so I didn't choose him.
Tata,

1626
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,920
Huahua,
Stop talking, Xiaoling's expression has changed.

1627
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,400
Tata,
no,

1628
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:41,840
he didn't.
Tata,
no,

1629
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,160
Tata,
He really had no interest at all.

1630
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:43,760
really.
Tata,

1631
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,000
Zhang Zining,
If we keep talking, the sky will leak.

1632
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,120
Yang Gen,
Xiaoling has already tuned out.

1633
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,520
Yang Gen,
she's just thinking about the logic of that thing.

1634
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:48,760
Xiaolu,
right.

1635
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,600
she can't hear anything anymore.
Xiaolu,

1636
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,620
she can't hear anything anymore.

1637
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,880
Xiaoling,
Tutu went there too.

1638
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,160
Xiaoling,
today I found out

1639
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,080
Xiaoling,
it turns out he went on a date with me because

1640
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,160
he was rejected by Tata's siblings.
Xiaoling,

1641
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,160
Xiaoling,
And when I learned

1642
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,400
this news, I was
Xiaoling,

1643
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,000
Xiaoling,
completely thunderstruck.

1644
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,360
but I feel like
Xiaoling,

1645
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,040
Xiaoling,
am I the backup plan?

1646
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,160
am I just an alternative?
Xiaoling,

1647
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,200
Xiaoling,
I have this feeling

1648
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,880
Jiang Dunhao,
like the sky is falling.

1649
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,720
Huahua,
I'm really starting to feel embarrassed.

1650
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,880
Tata,
stop, I shouldn't have said anything.

1651
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,040
really, he really doesn't
Tata,

1652
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,520
Tata,
want to date me at all.

1653
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,920
really.
Tata,

1654
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,720
Xiaoling,
It's okay.

1655
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,780
it's not a big deal.
Xiaoling,

1656
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,200
Tata,
My brother and I both think

1657
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,130
Tutu might not be very interested.
Tata,

1658
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,700
what about my brother?
Susu,

1659
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,480
Tata,
He really wants to.

1660
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,440
Tata,
he really wants to.

1661
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,440
Susu,
I'm really impressed.

1662
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,120
Xiaoling,
I'm thinking now

1663
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,160
is he
Xiaoling,

1664
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,680
Xiaoling,
was he

1665
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,760
rejected by your side
Xiaoling,

1666
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,720
Xiaoling,
so he came to me?

1667
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:45,920
Tata,
really?

1668
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,600
can it be like this?
Tata,

1669
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,120
Xiaoling,
I don't know.

1670
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,240
but from what you're saying,
Xiaoling,

1671
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,160
Xiaoling,
because Tutu told me that day

1672
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,040
he was interviewed.
Xiaoling,

1673
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,360
Xiaoling,
But you also said Tutu was at your place.

1674
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,880
Xiaoling,
because I ended up dating Tutu,

1675
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,960
which means before me,
Xiaoling,

1676
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,160
Xiaoling,
he was rejected by someone else.

1677
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,520
I see.
Tata,

1678
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,760
Xiaoling,
So he must have gone to your place first.

1679
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,200
I think
Xiaoling,
So he must have gone to your place first.

1680
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,280
Tata,
Because during the interview, I asked a question.

1681
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,880
I said, 'If you don't date me,'
Tata,

1682
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,560
Tata,
what would you do?'

1683
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,560
then Tutu said,
Tata,

1684
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,800
Tata,
'I respect and wish you well,' something like that.

1685
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,280
then Harry said,
Tata,

1686
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,800
Tata,
he said if he couldn't date me,

1687
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,800
if I rejected him,
Tata,

1688
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,600
Tata,
he said he would leave.

1689
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,160
