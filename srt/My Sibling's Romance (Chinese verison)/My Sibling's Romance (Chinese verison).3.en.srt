1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,560
Here we go.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,080
I'm professional.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
Nice shot!

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,040
Drawing.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,680
Map.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,000
What a pity.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,920
Pirate Captain!

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,960
I did it!

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,160
You're late. That ship has gone.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,200
What my brothers are most interested in

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,000
might be Hua.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,040
I'm not sure.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,120
You don't have to say the soup is cool at first sight.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,400
I voted for my sister the most handsome one.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,640
Do you like

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,000
or what you like?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,480
I like it.

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,240
Double love.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,080
Dear friends,

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,280
(Welcome to "Love Siblings")

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,960
"Love Sisters".

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,640
We're lovers' family members.

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,520
Now let's move on to

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,479
of this episode.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,039
Finally.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,880
I can't wait.

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,600
I guess there are only eight people.

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,480
There are only eight plates on the table.

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,320
Each of us has a skill.

30
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
What skill?

31
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,040
Cooking.

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,200
Play the piano.

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,800
I can drive.

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,040
You said you can't guess.

35
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,880
Skills? Why not?

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,240
There's a text message.

37
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
How many words should I reply?

38
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,120
Just a few names.

39
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,560
I think Esther

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,480
is the type my brother likes.

41
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,240
A big wave with high nose.

42
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,720
What my brothers are most interested in

43
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,280
might be Hua.

44
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,720
I'm not sure.

45
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,720
Have you all replied?

46
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,400
Yes.

47
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
It's already done.

48
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,360
There's news again.

49
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm quite happy.

50
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,360
I got a text.

51
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,560
I'm the most votes among girls.

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,840
Two more votes.

53
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,680
Two votes.

54
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,640
She looks very charismatic.

55
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,840
She's more mature.

56
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,000
who has her own ideas.

57
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,840
I vote for Hua.

58
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,200
Because she's outgoing.

59
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,560
And she has a distinctive personality.

60
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,240
and unique.

61
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,040
She is

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,560
After watching it,

63
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,280
I might have a deep impression.

64
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,720
and I won't forget it soon.

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,760
That type.

66
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,920
I voted for a picture.

67
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,600
Because my sister said she likes puppies.

68
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
and happy

69
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,360
and cheerful.

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,800
I actually think

71
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,760
I invested in each other.

72
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,480
Because I think

73
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,160
my brothers like drawing.

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
A clean big boy.

75
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,840
That feeling.

76
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,480
I think my brothers

77
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,840
in soup.

78
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,400
Objectively, the soup is really cool.

79
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Very handsome.

80
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
He is also

81
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,200
with a little sense of humor.

82
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,600
I think he should be my brother.

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,080
I like him.

84
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,159
You don't have to say the soup is cool at first sight.

85
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,720
I voted for my sister the most handsome one.

86
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
It's not a loss to vote for a handsome one for you.

87
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,640
Choose Xiao Ling.

88
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,200
They communicate a lot.

89
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,520
And their emotional values

90
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,960
each other.

91
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,640
Are you hungry?

92
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,640
Shall we finish dinner?

93
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,200
We're starving now.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,240
Yeah.

95
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,760
Let's talk about the taboo.

96
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
Something like that

97
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,160
Like coriander, green onion and ginger

98
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,480
and mutton.

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,800
Chiyojin or something

100
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,640
I don't eat onions and coriander.

101
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,840
but I can pick them out.

102
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,840
Okay.

103
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,720
I don't.

104
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't eat sheep.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,040
I don't eat fish.

106
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,480
No fish.

107
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,800
Yes.

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,360
What kind of pork? Chicken. Beef.

109
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,680
Like pigeons, do you eat them?

110
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,840
Pigeon?

111
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
That's a good question.

112
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,640
I don't think

113
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,720
make pigeons here.

114
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,320
I don't eat beans.

115
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,640
Excuse me.

116
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,480
Tofu.

117
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,960
For example, tofu.

118
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
Is fish tofu considered tofu?

119
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,920
She doesn't eat fish or tofu.

120
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,520
Can we eat fish tofu?

121
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,640
No pig brain.

122
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,120
Pig brain.

123
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,840
Oh no.

124
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,800
No wonder my name is Fatty.

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll eat them all.

126
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,840
It's so funny.

127
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,640
Is there anything you don't want to eat?

128
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,440
Not too spicy.

129
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,760
Have you started ordering?

130
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,360
Less spicy.

131
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,800
less spicy.

132
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,360
Less oil, less spicy, less oil, less salt.

133
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,640
I'll eat whatever they don't eat.

134
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,000
OK. All of them?

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
No.

136
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,800
Okay.

137
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,560
What about you?

138
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,640
I don't.

139
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,480
You don't have a taboo.

140
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,240
Yes.

141
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,280
Shouldn't you remember the taste?

142
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,840
It's not too salty or too light.

143
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,440
You write this down.

144
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,280
Because

145
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,400
I don't eat salty food.

146
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,360
No, you do it.

147
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,159
You don't have to introduce yourself.

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,159
I can learn from you.

149
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,560
I'll graduate in 21 days.

150
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,520
We learn how to make soup.

151
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
Boys who are ambitious

152
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,280
will do a little.

153
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,600
I won't leave you alone.

154
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,400
Yes, don't worry.

155
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't worry.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,600
You come in the first 15 days.

157
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,240
Okay.

158
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,160
In the next 15 days,

159
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,360
The disciples will come when they graduate.

160
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,680
Everyone attends classes one by one every day.

161
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,960
Actually we can choose a room.

162
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
We'll choose black and white.

163
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,800
Come on.

164
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,560
Black and white.

165
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,720
Okay, I'll stay in one room.

166
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,240
Here.

167
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,680
Black and white.

168
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,240
They are very introverted.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,800
How about we live in one room?

170
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,840
E (outgoing) people live in one room.

171
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,760
Last time.

172
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,160
If it doesn't work,

173
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,640
we can automatically E.

174
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,320
Black and white.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,760
Okay.

176
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,520
Xiao Ling.

177
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,840
We live together.

178
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,320
Don't be so funny.

179
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,799
You play rock-paper-scissors.

180
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,919
Choose whoever you want.

181
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,200
I'm bad at rock-paper-scissors.

182
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
I always lose.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,480
It's okay.

184
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,920
Choose whoever you want.

185
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,320
Which one do you want?

186
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,480
Me?

187
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,320
I'm fine with anything.

188
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,840
Do you two want to choose?

189
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,600
Rock, paper, scissors.

190
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Rock, paper, scissors.

191
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,480
Who?

192
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Please.

193
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,680
Let me guess with her.

194
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,320
Pack scissors.

195
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,840
One plate.

196
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,400
Okay.

197
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

198
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,840
I choose first, right?

199
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,480
We choose this one.

200
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,880
OK.

201
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,480
Okay.

202
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,320
Let's go to...

203
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,960
Okay.

204
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,160
You're awesome.

205
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,600
She won in one game.

206
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,760
She said she's good at rock-paper-scissors.

207
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,640
I'm bad at rock-paper-scissors.

208
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
They are so happy.

209
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,840
They blended so fast.

210
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,000
Three E people.

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,160
Two girls are introverted.

212
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,000
Two E.

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
Four E boys.

214
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,400
Three.

215
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,280
Three boys.

216
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,200
What do you mean?

217
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
We have to

218
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,440
for more than 20 days.

219
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,240
Introduce yourself later.

220
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
Hello, I’m E.

221
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,720
Hello, I'm an introvert.

222
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm a con artist.

223
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,320
So awkward. I won't cook for you.

224
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,680
You're threatening me.

225
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,600
Have you chosen a room?

226
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,520
Yes.

227
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
The four of us live together.

228
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,080
Maybe when there are more people,

229
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll be quiet.

230
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,560
If the atmosphere is a bit awkward,

231
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,640
I'll find you something to do.

232
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,800
What's outside?

233
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,840
Look.

234
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,000
There's a basketball court outside.

235
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,600
The badminton court, the house.

236
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,720
Barbecue.

237
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,680
So comfortable.

238
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,640
Aren't you cold?

239
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,560
I'm fine.

240
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Comfort is the most important.

241
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,800
As for badminton,

242
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,720
If it doesn't have a badminton, stand in the middle.

243
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,400
No.

244
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,120
No basketball.

245
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,480
There's a shed.

246
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,920
Is that a shed?

247
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,320
Someone went out.

248
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,000
They're all out.

249
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,280
You're really not afraid of the cold.

250
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,760
I'm not afraid of the cold.

251
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,360
Hello.

252
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,600
They're upstairs.

253
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,680
I'll go in first.

254
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,560
It's really cold.

255
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,200
Okay.

256
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,640
Let's pack up.

257
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,600
Let's go.

258
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,680
Come on.

259
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,920
Let's each carry two up.

260
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,720
Okay.

261
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,520
Don't mention two each.

262
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,160
My box is heavy.

263
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,920
Give me the heavy one.

264
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,080
I'll be stronger.

265
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Thank you, Map.

266
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,560
Where are you going?

267
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Give it to me.

268
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,200
Okay.

269
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,320
Thank you.

270
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,720
You're welcome.

271
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,200
Thank you.

272
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
This one.

273
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,640
Two people.

274
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,760
I'll take it.

275
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,640
I think I need to move mine at once.

276
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,680
It's okay.

277
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,520
Really?

278
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,360
Thank you.

279
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,120
The soup looks weird.

280
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,240
But it's okay.

281
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,640
Okay, thank you.

282
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,480
Thank you.

283
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,000
This is Xin's suitcase.

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,120
Thank you.

285
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,360
Which bed do you sleep on?

286
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm fine with anything.

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
You choose.

288
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,280
Me too.

289
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
Then you can.

290
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,680
I'll sleep here.

291
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,640
Okay, you sleep outside.

292
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
Are you busy recently?

293
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,960
Will you go out often?

294
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,000
I think I will.

295
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,360
Can you speak English?

296
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,200
You can.

297
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,440
I will.

298
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,720
So your English

299
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,240
My English is pretty good.

300
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,840
Not bad.

301
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,400
You have a strong northeast smell.

302
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,240
Yes, I have a strong northeast flavor.

303
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,920
I'll speak English.

304
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,120
It doesn't taste like northeast food.

305
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,800
Indeed.

306
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,520
It's actually quite comfortable.

307
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,480
It's actually very comfortable.

308
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,560
No.

309
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,600
This is warm.

310
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,000
You sleep inside and sleep outside.

311
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,160
I'll sleep.

312
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,640
You sleep inside.

313
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,320
Anything.

314
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,200
I'll protect you.

315
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,000
Sure.

316
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,920
find a big brother.

317
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,200
Can any of you play the piano?

318
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,800
The soup party.

319
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,560
Show us.

320
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,200
It's like an idol drama.

321
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,440
Yes.

322
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,040
Amazing.

323
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,080
Awesome!

324
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,960
Awesome.

325
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,760
Really

326
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,400
This soup is great.

327
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,120
It's very charming when playing the piano.

328
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,560
Someone rushed to you

329
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,680
and sang the story

330
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,560
and the story that I started to like you.

331
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,400
how will you react?

332
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm sure you'll be touched before you get married.

333
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,600
All girls will be touched.

334
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,440
Yes. But I don't think YI should be too public.

335
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,040
Yeah.

336
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,920
Yeah, too much pressure in public, IYI.

337
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,480
I used to have

338
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,000
a girl in my dorm.

339
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,320
The boy played the guitar

340
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,360
and set the candles everywhere.

341
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,600
So awkward.

342
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:39,840
Yeah.

343
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,600
But then I could only say yes to IYI.

344
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,920
But then I could only say yes.

345
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,960
Because everyone around me

346
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,720
are unrelated to everything.

347
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,640
Say yes.

348
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,520
Just say yes to him, IYI, right?

349
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,160
Yes.

350
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,720
Yes. This will put a lot of pressure on girls, YI.

351
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
What stage?

352
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,040
So today the soup

353
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,440
is just right.

354
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,080
Yeah, he didn't say

355
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,520
that he wanted to show.

356
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,080
But I played IYI quietly.

357
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,960
Just for fun.

358
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,120
Yes, and then

359
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,760
to the girls upstairs.

360
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,000
again.

361
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,320
Yes.

362
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,680
Right? A little.

363
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,680
That guy is good.

364
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,920
Harry.

365
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,560
Yes.

366
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,160
He showed his talent

367
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
his talent.

368
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,800
I remember

369
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
my wife's brother

370
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,920
instigated his sister to play.

371
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,720
So it's very important

372
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,880
is very important

373
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,040
Family stop first

374
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,040
Stop first

375
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,720
Food is ready.

376
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,080
Food.

377
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,960
and vegetables.

378
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,760
Our parents prepared this in advance.

379
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,000
hometown dishes.

380
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,960
Let's have our first dinner

381
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,680
to have our first dinner.

382
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,440
Okay.

383
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,240
I think the dishes can be heated now.

384
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,440
Smells good.

385
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,800
Smells good.

386
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,480
Right

387
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,400
Yes this is the smell of mountain pepper

388
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,880
Fried pork with chili

389
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,880
It looks like some kind of beef

390
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,720
What tomato should I stew?

391
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
I'm hungry.

392
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,640
It looks delicious.

393
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,960
I'm hungry.

394
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Let's eat.

395
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,240
Let's eat.

396
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,600
Thank you.

397
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,680
It means their food is really good.

398
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,400
They don't talk much.

399
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,760
What's your mom's specialty

400
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,880
Will she make it?

401
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,160
My mom can cook a dish.

402
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,800
She created it herself.

403
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,160
She made potatoes with tomatoes.

404
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,760
It sounds very strange

405
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,720
But it's very delicious.

406
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,800
My mom is good at cooking.

407
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,200
The dish she made

408
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,400
She developed it herself.

409
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,520
No one else has done it.

410
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,000
When you eat,

411
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,960
you can taste your mom's dish.

412
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Yes, your saliva is coming out

413
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,760
Yes, me too.

414
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm swallowing too.

415
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,560
Because I thought

416
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,800
my mom made fried tofu and braised pork.

417
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,520
Braised pork.

418
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,320
Soy soy sauce.

419
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
Yes, soy sauce.

420
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,880
But my mom made it so delicious.

421
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,480
And no one else can make that taste.

422
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,120
And it's better to cool it down

423
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,760
Freeze

424
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,280
IYI is frozen with meat.

425
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,160
Then bibibibimbap and QIYI.

426
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,360
I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

427
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,960
If this is the dish,

428
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,120
Miss Dan will immediately acknowledge it.

429
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,280
Because I really don't think others can make it.

430
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,040
The color and soy sauce

431
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,280
is totally unique to my mom.

432
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,040
Yes.

433
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,840
Like myself.

434
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,880
My mom likes taro.

435
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,600
That also caused me

436
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,920
like taro too.

437
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,560
And she cut the taro very thin.

438
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,240
with the shrimp.

439
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,880
It's crispy and fragrant.

440
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,400
Taro shrimp cake.

441
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,560
Yes.

442
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,800
Because I'm from Xinjiang.

443
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,360
My mom would cook fried chicken

444
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,080
I'll do it at home.

445
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,200
Under a large plate of chicken, you need to put a pad.

446
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,840
My mom is not good at cooking.

447
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,320
But we have a traditional soup.

448
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,960
My dad is from Hong Kong, China.

449
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,320
our family would like bone soup.

450
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,720
This soup

451
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,120
our family

452
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,200
have to drink it every now and then.

453
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,480
When we serve these dishes,

454
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,640
Really, this meal

455
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,600
Yes.

456
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,040
Add some fruit cubes.

457
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,440
Just imagine.

458
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,760
The dishes are on the table.

459
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,480
We can play "crash".

460
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Really?

461
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,599
No.

462
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,240
The eight of us grab seven numbers.

463
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,720
Let's just call each other's name.

464
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,319
Let's change our names.

465
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,160
I just remembered it and changed it.

466
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,600
Let's add something.

467
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Fruit.

468
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,520
Add some fruit.

469
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,600
Yes, you add fruit.

470
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,440
It's harder. Yes.

471
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,480
This is too hard.

472
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,760
You can add more moves later.

473
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,240
You can play until twelve o'clock.

474
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,520
Add some fruit.

475
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,760
You choose first.

476
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,480
Me?

477
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,320
Xiao Ling loves it.

478
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,160
It's her favourite.

479
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,800
Xiao Ling loves apples.

480
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,040
This is too hard.

481
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,080
It's really hard.

482
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Harry likes grapes.

483
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
Harry said I don't like it.

484
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,200
Soup loves drinking.

485
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
Isn't this a bit short?

486
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,400
Not short. Not bad.

487
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,120
I like fruit cubes.

488
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,360
The soup loves fruit-based.

489
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,080
Fatty loves kiwi.

490
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,840
This is too hard.

491
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,200
Susu loves durian.

492
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
I love durian.

493
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,320
My name is

494
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
My name is Huahua. I love Yangtao.

495
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,680
Tu.

496
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,160
Love.

497
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,960
What else?

498
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,040
Tu doesn't like eating.

499
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,720
To be autistic

500
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,400
Tu loves eating tangerines.

501
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,080
Okay.

502
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,960
Do you like it?

503
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,280
Yes, I do.

504
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,920
Xin loves mushrooms.

505
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,320
Mushroom.

506
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,400
It's a mushroom. It's a mushroom. It's a mushroom.

507
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,320
What is mushroom?

508
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,680
There's a leaf in the northeast.

509
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920
The middle is yellow.

510
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,320
Very small.

511
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,000
Mushroom Mother.

512
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,280
I don't like it.

513
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,080
You'll know when you eat it.

514
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,160
I can't remember.

515
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,280
Three, two, one. Action.

516
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,600
Hua.

517
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,400
I love soup.

518
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,600
I love the soup.

519
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,360
What does Hua like to do?

520
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,840
Huahua loves fruit cubes.

521
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,640
No.

522
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,040
I just remembered it was Hua.

523
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,360
What was Hua doing?

524
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,920
What does Hua like to do?

525
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,480
It impressed me.

526
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
The first picture may be impressive.

527
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
Because he's good at playing games.

528
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,200
He's good.

529
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,640
He's controlling the scene.

530
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,760
Three, two, one. Action.

531
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,240
Two.

532
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,520
Two.

533
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,640
Oh no, you are...

534
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,800
What are you?

535
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,280
You're Harry's favorite.

536
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,320
You're not.

537
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,040
You like grapes.

538
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,320
I'll tell you slowly.

539
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,560
What are you?

540
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,160
I don't know.

541
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,200
you like Yangtao.

542
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,520
No.

543
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,880
I like mushrooms.

544
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,440
You...

545
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,320
He is...

546
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,280
He's a mushroom woman.

547
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,600
No.

548
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,920
Don't mention me.

549
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,720
Three, two, one, go.

550
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,240
Tu likes oranges.

551
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,960
Stop calling one.

552
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,040
Now everyone knows Tu likes oranges.

553
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,920
Do you like tangerines that much?

554
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,080
Yes.

555
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,280
We can change a game.

556
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,800
Another game?

557
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,640
I know a game.

558
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,720
For example,

559
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,480
Pirate captain.

560
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,120
I know.

561
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,480
Pirate Captain!

562
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,160
Speak separately.

563
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,640
For example, I say the sea.

564
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,920
pirates,

565
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,800
Ship!

566
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,680
Long.

567
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,680
And the one who was pointed at is...

568
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,320
He said, "Pirate Captain."

569
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,600
That's it.

570
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,360
The captain should raise his hand.

571
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,400
Is it so funny?

572
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
The people on both sides

573
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
The person next to you.

574
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,480
For example, if it's him,

575
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,960
I should go this way.

576
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,000
He's going this way.

577
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,360
I have a question.

578
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,440
I'll count on her.

579
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,600
Me.

580
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,360
I'll start now.

581
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:02,880
The sea.

582
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,560
Pirate!

583
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,280
Boat.

584
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,840
Long.

585
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,880
Sea.

586
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,840
Thief.

587
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,280
Why did you make the sound first?

588
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,800
I don't know how to play pirate captain.

589
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,120
Su Su pointed at me.

590
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,080
Sea.

591
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,600
Pirate!

592
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,040
Boat.

593
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,760
Long.

594
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,400
You didn't lift it.

595
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,440
You didn't either.

596
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,040
You still want to lie to me?

597
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,960
I was shocked.

598
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,720
I've never seen anyone

599
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,280
lifting a rock on my feet.

600
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,680
You know?

601
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,400
The...

602
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,320
Pirate Captain!

603
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,160
Two.

604
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
I did it.

605
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,600
I did it.

606
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,120
You're slow. The ship has gone.

607
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,640
I don't know what to do

608
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,400
Roommate

609
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,880
Focus completely

610
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
You might be the next one.

611
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,640
The sea.

612
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,840
Boat.

613
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Sir.

614
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
Okay, you'll flip the boat.

615
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,040
The pirate captain playing behind.

616
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,320
It's my first time.

617
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,680
I was slow.

618
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,600
I can't keep up with the beat.

619
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,240
Yeah.

620
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,560
I think

621
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,680
I can't tell right from wrong.

622
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,640
It's a black hole.

623
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,800
The real black hole of the game.

624
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,720
Sea.

625
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,280
Pirate ship.

626
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,680
Long!

627
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,520
It's so cute! It's so cute!

628
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
You're fast!

629
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,080
Pirate Captain!

630
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,480
That game really impressed me.

631
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,760
Actually, everyone is very funny.

632
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,880
You can have fun.

633
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,480
Got it.

634
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,920
He's good at it.

635
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,200
The computer is not turned on.

636
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,080
This is over.

637
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,640
I've driven it away.

638
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Map.

639
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,280
Let's go up and have a look.

640
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,520
Did you do it?

641
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,680
I want Slide.

642
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,960
Can you slide down?

643
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,440
Yes.

644
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,640
I really want to see you slide down.

645
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,560
Take a look.

646
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,680
What is this place?

647
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,920
Really?

648
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,760
My pants are very suitable now.

649
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,240
You won't get stuck on it.

650
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,640
Slow down.

651
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,280
My butt is hot.

652
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,200
My butt is scalded.

653
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,160
You're so cute.

654
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,280
But it's really fun.

655
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,960
Try skating.

656
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,480
I'll get stuck there.

657
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,000
No.

658
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,560
I made it.

659
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,320
Just lift your butt.

660
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,520
I'll get stuck in the middle.

661
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,000
I need someone to save me.

662
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,480
No, I'll save you.

663
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,840
You skate. I'll save you.

664
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,480
It's fun.

665
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,880
Don't. It's embarrassing if I get stuck in the middle.

666
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,000
Awesome. You brought snacks.

667
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,400
I also brought chocolate.

668
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,360
I'll bring it to you later.

669
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,080
It was crushed.

670
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,360
Why do you bring so much food?

671
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,440
Like a refugee.

672
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,680
This is fun.

673
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,600
Do you want to play?

674
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,800
What?

675
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,560
Do you want to play?

676
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,440
What is it?

677
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,520
Stress relief ball.

678
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,200
I have another "pinch".

679
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Is it the same?

680
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,440
No.

681
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,960
Puppy.

682
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,800
This stress relief ball belongs to my brother.

683
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
We need to discuss tomorrow.

684
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,920
How about we buy a basketball?

685
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,080
Soccer

686
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,680
or basketball.

687
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
What else do you want to buy tomorrow

688
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,880
I thought you were in the kitchen

689
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,480
It seems nothing

690
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,720
Do you want a disposable glove?

691
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,560
Yes.

692
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,000
No disposable gloves.

693
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,320
There are gloves.

694
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,560
Not yet.

695
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,200
at first sight.

696
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,440
No.

697
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,880
Because I don't fall in love at first sight.

698
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,640
Neither am I.

699
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,560
Yes, I have to stay in touch for a while.

700
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,360
Then I'll look at it.

701
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,640
What do you think about the first feeling of a man?

702
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,880
You think this boy is good.

703
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,000
you can continue to understand him.

704
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,480
Yes.

705
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,080
Even if he is your friend,

706
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,600
you'll be the first one

707
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,960
to know more about him, right?

708
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
I think

709
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,360
Tu and Fatty.

710
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,120
I think they are

711
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,640
You like lively people.

712
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,000
So you're a perfect match for me.

713
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,800
Look.

714
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,520
We kept guessing.

715
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,600
We lived together in the last round.

716
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,120
We're a perfect match.

717
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,040
You are...

718
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,480
You should be popular with E.

719
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,920
I (introverted) is

720
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,520
E?

721
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,160
Xiaoling, do you want to get up?

722
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,640
Do you have shoes?

723
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,120
There's a white pair.

724
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,240
But it shouldn't be in this box.

725
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,080
Isn't this white?

726
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,680
It's over there.

727
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,040
No.

728
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,960
Good.

729
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,400
Stop the loss in time.

730
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,040
Luckily, I didn't open the next one.

731
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,920
Let's go.

732
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,480
Let's go.

733
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,560
It's sunny.

734
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,360
I can sit in the back.

735
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,720
I'll sit.

736
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,440
Let's go.

737
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,280
Let's go.

738
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,000
Go!

739
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,280
I'm hungry.

740
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,840
I really want to buy ten buckets of instant noodles.

741
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,000
Eat it secretly at night.

742
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Ten buckets. I want to buy 20 buckets.

743
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,040
I was starving last night.

744
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,760
Me too.

745
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,280
Right?

746
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,880
I slept last night.

747
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,680
I just couldn't sleep.

748
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,440
I'm just a little hungry.

749
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,200
organize an event.

750
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,040
Let's eat Will Pan's instant noodles.

751
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,960
One pot for each.

752
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,880
Will Pan.

753
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,760
Yes.

754
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,160
Don't you know how he makes instant noodles?

755
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,280
I know. I've brushed it.

756
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,840
It smells so good.

757
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,160
Can you do it?

758
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,760
That's easy.

759
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,200
Who doesn't know how to make instant noodles?

760
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,880
Can you cook it for me, Fatty?

761
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,240
Okay.

762
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Can you cook for me? Thank you.

763
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,600
But I can't eat it when it's cooked

764
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,560
Thank you.

765
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,600
Thank you.

766
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,080
When we purchase,

767
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,520
we'll carry a box and come out.

768
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,000
There are many different flavors in one box.

769
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,040
I bought some buckwheat noodles and didn't get stuck.

770
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,440
And hang noodles.

771
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Yes, you have to buy it.

772
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,520
I think there must be

773
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,400
in that car.

774
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,680
Really?

775
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,280
I think we're in a hurry.

776
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,840
I know they're on a diet. So many.

777
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,840
They're...

778
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,040
Me too.

779
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,720
Doesn't it look like you?

780
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Where are you going to lose weight?

781
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,800
Are you on a diet?

782
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,800
Yes.

783
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,200
Are you going to lose weight?

784
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,600
I'm the fattest

785
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,320
among the four girls.

786
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,560
No.

787
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,600
You look skinny.

788
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,360
Weight doesn't matter.

789
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,320
Just look thin.

790
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,240
Okay.

791
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,560
You're so sweet.

792
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,720
It's a bonus.

793
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,840
I'll pack ten pearls.

794
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,080
Eat it in ice.

795
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,600
I want to drink black sugar pop milk tea.

796
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,560
See if there's milk tea nearby.

797
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,160
Do you want some?

798
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,960
Yes.

799
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,400
Me too.

800
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,680
I've been craving it for a long time.

801
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,120
Coffee is good.

802
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,560
I want latte.

803
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,760
Can't they order by themselves?

804
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,240
Can't we order together?

805
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,360
Did you tell Hua

806
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,760
you must drink milk tea today?

807
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,000
I want lemon tea.

808
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,640
I love lemon tea.

809
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,160
Look.

810
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,920
Really?

811
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,200
I think milk tea is easy to get heaty.

812
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,560
You drink lemon tea.

813
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,640
Do you want 7% sugar or 5% sugar?

814
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,400
I'll drink 3% sugar or no sugar.

815
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,720
Sanfen is sour.

816
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,800
It's not sour.

817
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,160
I like sour food.

818
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,560
I can also drink sugar-free.

819
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,440
Sugar free?

820
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,000
Yes.

821
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,960
Then drink lemon.

822
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,720
I'll eat lemon.

823
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,480
Sure.

824
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,120
You're a lemon girl.

825
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,720
Lemon girl.

826
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,040
Come on, we're here.

827
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,600
Let's go.

828
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,800
Let's go.

829
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,640
Let's split up.

830
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,080
Let's split into two teams.

831
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,280
Is this garlic seedling?

832
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,240
Fried eggs with minced garlic taste good

833
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Fried eggs with chives

834
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,400
All I think about now is my milk tea.

835
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,640
Lemon tea.

836
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,760
Me too.

837
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,520
Shall we go buy lemon tea?

838
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,600
Now

839
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,480
Now.

840
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,000
Go.

841
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,080
Now?

842
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,800
Fourth floor.

843
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,320
Lemon tea

844
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,200
But we also have milk tea.

845
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,480
But we don't know what they want to drink.

846
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,640
It's okay. Just buy them all.

847
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,480
Light up the popular ones.

848
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Okay.

849
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,280
Hello, please order here.

850
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,160
Okay, thank you.

851
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,800
Let's go.

852
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
Give it to me.

853
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,920
Let's split up.

854
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,680
Boys take these things to the car.

855
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,640
Let's go buy some milk tea.

856
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,280
Let's go.

857
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,840
Push two each.

858
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,400
You push that one and I push this one.

859
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,320
Let's go.

860
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,800
Soup. This car is hard to control.

861
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,000
Put it together.

862
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,440
it's really hard to control the car.

863
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,840
We need to cooperate.

864
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,080
Push the car down first.

865
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,920
and pick up the car over there.

866
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
In fact, it can

867
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,040
It can get stuck.

868
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,920
Let's buy four cups of milk tea.

869
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,480
Four cups of coffee.

870
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,120
Choose one.

871
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,920
Sure.

872
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,880
Two Americanos, please.

873
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,160
Two cups of latte.

874
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,000
A big cup.

875
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Let's go.

876
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,640
Anything else?

877
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,600
Put it in the back seat.

878
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,520
Slow down.

879
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,560
Are we going to find them?

880
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,800
Let's go for a walk.

881
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Is there any girl you like

882
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,040
buy something for them?

883
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,920
Ask them to give you some advice.

884
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,200
Do you have one?

885
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,400
Do you?

886
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,720
Just say yes or no.

887
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,000
It's a bit slow.

888
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,640
No hurry. We need to observe.

889
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
Do you like him?

890
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,200
I think I like everyone.

891
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,160
especially you.

892
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,360
Because you put me

893
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,160
Because you left me behind your phone.

894
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,440
Take a photo for you.

895
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,400
One for each.

896
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,040
Come on.

897
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,640
Let's take a photo together.

898
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,720
You two come together.

899
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,200
Smile. Three, two, one.

900
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,600
Where is the photo?

901
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,320
This is too detailed.

902
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,680
If I were a girl, I would pursue you now.

903
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,600
Bro

904
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,840
I finally got you.

905
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,480
I'm glad I didn't give up.

906
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,160
We bought a lot too.

907
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,320
We also bought a large plate of chicken.

908
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,360
Did you buy milk tea

909
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,760
We bought a lot too.

910
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,200
I also bought you lemon tea.

911
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,720
I bought you milk tea.

912
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,320
No.

913
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,280
I bought coffee and bought everything.

914
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,440
I bought a large plate of chicken and meat bun.

915
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,400
Okay.

916
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,720
Eight meat buns.

917
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,360
Great.

918
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,200
Meat bun.

919
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,320
Where are you from?

920
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,600
I’m from Shaanxi

921
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,560
You two from Xi’an

922
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,640
Under the city wall of Xi'an, there's a train from Xi'an.

923
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,680
You two look alike.

924
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,760
Let's go.

925
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,960
Let's go.

926
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,040
Let's go home.

927
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,520
Bring these shabby things in first.

928
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,120
Basketball.

929
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,080
Shoot.

930
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,840
I forgot again.

931
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,840
Good, map.

932
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,040
Do we need two against two?

933
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,080
Two against two.

934
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,640
Okay.

935
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,000
Come on.

936
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,160
Let's

937
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,320
Dormitory 1 against Dormitory 2.

938
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,800
What should we pick?

939
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,280
A picture of fatty.

940
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,800
They are called Harry Soup.

941
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,760
Five points in total.

942
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,280
Five points.

943
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,080
Okay.

944
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,640
Start.

945
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,080
I'm professional.

946
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,360
Okay.

947
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,680
One blood.

948
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,440
I can't stop him.

949
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,560
He runs too fast.

950
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,640
This hand is really cold

951
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,920
It's really cold.

952
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,840
He blocks me.

953
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,480
I have no choice.

954
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,520
Okay.

955
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,080
One to one.

956
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,800
Hurry.

957
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,440
Two to one.

958
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,920
It's really exciting.

959
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,760
Tu.

960
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,000
Nice shot!

961
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,760
Defend him.

962
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,000
We're going to win.

963
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,040
You can't win.

964
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,920
So serious.

965
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,440
There are professional ones.

966
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,520
Very professional.

967
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,880
Nice shot!

968
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,320
Okay, you don't have a chance.

969
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,640
A man is getting serious.

970
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,880
Map.

971
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,040
So cool.

972
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,679
No.

973
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,360
Four to four.

974
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,920
No!

975
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,639
Defence!

976
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,800
The last one.

977
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,320
What's wrong?

978
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,840
You're like a big bug.

979
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,840
I'm sorry.

980
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Our...

981
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,199
What a pity.

982
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,639
It's over.

983
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,360
I can't move.

984
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,760
Divorce.

985
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,080
It's cold.

986
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,000
Put your shoes here.

987
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,560
I think we can play some brand games.

988
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,240
What?

989
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,320
A fraud bar.

990
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,720
What is this?

991
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,800
For example,

992
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,720
everyone will get a certain card.

993
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,040
For example, three, three,

994
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,160
or the same tiles.

995
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,400
and take turns.

996
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,480
Actually, I didn't choose this three.

997
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,600
But I said I got three.

998
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,480
or two three.

999
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,080
It depends on your buyer.

1000
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,680
The three with the least cards.

1001
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,960
The three with the most punishment cards.

1002
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,200
Okay.

1003
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,960
What punishment?

1004
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Truth or Dare.

1005
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,400
Yes.

1006
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,360
If you jump and lose, take it away.

1007
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,400
Make a carrot squat

1008
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,120
Make a radish squat.

1009
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,800
Draw a leather strip.

1010
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,760
Yes, strip.

1011
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,920
Draw some strips every few times.

1012
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,520
Yes.

1013
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,520
I'm coming.

1014
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,640
You pay.

1015
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,440
Three.

1016
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,840
Do you believe me?

1017
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,200
Come on, squat.

1018
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,320
Draw.

1019
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,360
Come on, draw it.

1020
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,080
Excuse me.

1021
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,480
It seems that he hit me.

1022
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,000
In fact,

1023
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,240
It was her.

1024
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,160
Three six

1025
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,920
Four sixes.

1026
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,840
You want to lie again?

1027
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,000
You don't have six. You're lying.

1028
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,800
The hit in the middle

1029
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,720
You...

1030
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,560
You're too...

1031
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,080
Did you hit him?

1032
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Three six.

1033
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Two.

1034
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,960
Six.

1035
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,280
Six.

1036
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,440
Two cards already.

1037
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,080
I have to open it.

1038
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,720
I'll open it.

1039
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
He has it.

1040
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,200
Okay, two two.

1041
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,160
He's the first to leave.

1042
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,320
Then his next buyer will play first.

1043
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,360
Go ahead.

1044
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,640
Three five.

1045
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,840
I still need three more.

1046
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,600
Three seven.

1047
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,760
The second one.

1048
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,760
Four Q.

1049
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,840
One.

1050
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,640
Pass.

1051
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,240
Four.

1052
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,000
Four.

1053
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,800
One.

1054
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,560
It's time to register.

1055
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,280
Why is he so fast?

1056
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,600
Go ahead.

1057
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,760
It's over if he wins.

1058
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,800
This one, right?

1059
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,600
No one watches it.

1060
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
The three of us lost.

1061
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,640
Yes.

1062
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,120
Do you choose Truth or Dare?

1063
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,040
You choose.

1064
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,360
I mean it.

1065
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,880
You dare.

1066
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,400
I won't go out to take the responsibility.

1067
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Dare is tiring.

1068
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,120
Dare starts mopping the floor now.

1069
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,000
Start mopping now.

1070
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,320
If you play like this,

1071
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,160
I choose Truth.

1072
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,720
I thought you were going to say something.

1073
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,080
Do you like what you like or what you like?

1074
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,520
I like it.

1075
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,440
I like someone I like.

1076
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,960
Who do you like?

1077
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,240
The second question will be charged.

1078
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,320
I like those who like me.

1079
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,920
I like those who like me first.

1080
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,560
And what I like

1081
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,840
I can feel that he likes me.

1082
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,480
That's why I took the initiative.

1083
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,200
Sure.

1084
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,600
You will take the initiative.

1085
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,280
Of course.

1086
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,160
But the condition is

1087
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,080
if he's not interested in me,

1088
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,280
why would I take the initiative?

1089
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,320
I never take the initiative.

1090
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,520
I'm always passive.

1091
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,920
Yes, she will never take the initiative.

1092
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,520
Hello.

1093
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,880
They've gone too far, Xin.

1094
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,200
Help me.

1095
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,160
I wanted to take a nap for half an hour.

1096
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,520
Your laughter was too loud.

1097
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,240
Really.

1098
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,880
Your happiness has disturbed me.

1099
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,560
Whose voice is the loudest?

1100
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,120
A flower.

1101
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,080
It's okay. It's loud. Okay.

1102
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,240
Let me sweep the floor.

1103
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,080
You've been sitting for so long.

1104
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,760
Do something.

1105
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,960
Cleaning.

1106
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,520
I think we should divide our work.

1107
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,320
Let's not make trouble.

1108
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,000
We'll come tomorrow.

1109
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,680
Okay.

1110
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,600
Don't make trouble.

1111
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,040
Have a seat.

1112
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,640
What did you ask just now?

1113
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,160
Do you like what you like or what you like?

1114
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,560
Mutual.

1115
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,400
Mutual.

1116
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,960
I like the girl I like.

1117
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,080
Then I pursued that girl.

1118
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
After she likes me,

1119
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,000
after she likes me.

1120
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,240
If a girl takes the initiative to you,

1121
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,080
will you be scared?

1122
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,800
No.

1123
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,760
He'll call the police.

1124
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,680
He'll hold it tightly.

1125
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,840
Yeah, jump and hold tight.

1126
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,800
I'll be moved by her.

1127
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,000
Really?

1128
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,080
Really?

1129
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,320
I think it's hard for boys to be touched.

1130
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,080
Look at sincerity

1131
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,760
I'll cook for you

1132
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,400
No.

1133
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,520
Should I find a mom or a boyfriend?

1134
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,360
Roommate.

1135
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,920
What?

1136
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,120
Do you like what you like or what you like?

1137
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,040
It's dirty. It's all black water.

1138
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
It's really dirty.

1139
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,080
I'm exploring this question.

1140
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,520
I used to like what I like.

1141
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,440
But I think

1142
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,600
that might not be the most important thing.

1143
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,760
Now,

1144
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,440
I feel

1145
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,920
No matter what,

1146
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,480
I like you more than you like me.

1147
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:35,960
But

1148
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,320
what you can't get is the most.

1149
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,600
No.

1150
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,120
But the proportion will change.

1151
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,640
Sixty forty.

1152
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,600
Maybe now.

1153
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,480
I used to be 20.

1154
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,200
75, 25.

1155
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,560
The feeling of unrequited love.

1156
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,160
Actually, it's also thrilling.

1157
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,320
Yeah, anyway.

1158
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,760
I'm not happy when we're apart.

1159
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,200

Hello.

1168
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,600
He looks like

1169
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,560
a bossy CEO.

1170
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,760
I had a high first impression of him.

1171
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,000
He makes me feel threatened.

1172
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,360
and hostile.

1173
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,960
This boy will make my brothers

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,400
