1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,280
Xin applied for today's siblings' room.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,760
I'm a very complicated person.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,520
We haven't talked in private these days.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,000
We

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,280
have a lot to say to each other.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:11,920
Many times,

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,720
subconsciously I say, look, look.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,960
I want to be like this.

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,160
But I can't.

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,640
I felt like I was putting up with it and he was putting up with it.

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,200
So today I opened

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,320
the house of siblings.

13
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,880
I have to talk to him.

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
It's like we're going to the canteen.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,159
You look fat.

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,200
Xin.

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,280
What were you doing?

18
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,280
Washing the dishes?

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,920
Yes, do the dishes.

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,040
I'm fine today.

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,080
There aren't many bowls today.

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,960
Did you get the text?

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
I got a text.

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,640
How many?

25
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,040
Do you trust me so much?

26
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,080
How many?

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,160
One.

28
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,680
Is he on a date with you?

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,240
Yes.

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,240
Because the text we sent

31
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,600
quite...

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,800
ambiguous.

33
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,760
No.

34
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,680
I can tell it from one glance.

35
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,480
Who sent it to me?

36
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
I just talked to her.

37
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,240
She said you were the one

38
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
when you were dating.

39
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,200
So she felt very secure.

40
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,680
She said you brought her along.

41
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,280
I led her

42
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,480
she was a little nervous when we were dating.

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
I don't think she'll be nervous.

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,160
She will.

45
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,640
We're on a date.

46
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,640
She's folding the paper crane opposite me.

47
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,160
She kept folding it.

48
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,440
But she was really nervous.

49
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,400
She was too nervous.

50
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,120
I asked her if she was nervous.

51
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,640
She said no.

52
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
Do you think she's cute?

53
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Yes.

54
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,039
You will start the next date

55
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,200
with her.

56
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:41,960
A date.

57
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,840
Because I think I haven't finished

58
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,759
Because girls

59
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,320
I've talked a lot today.

60
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,280
I've already started.

61
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,160
Me too.

62
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,560
My brothers are so happy today.

63
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,080
He's already setting off fireworks in his heart.

64
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,160
Fireworks?

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,240
He's smiling.

66
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,880
The corners of his mouth keep rising today.

67
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm in a dilemma today.

68
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,840
I'm very torn today.

69
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,520
Why?

70
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,600
Because today,

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,200
After receiving that message,

72
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,960
it will say how many messages

73
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,320
have received.

74
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Then I looked at Hua.

75
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,960
Then I could feel the flowers.

76
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,160
What does that mean?

77
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,560
Why?

78
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,800
Because I think

79
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,880
I didn't send it to the map.

80
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,800
I think it's normal.

81
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,760
So you think I won't send it to Map?

82
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,280
I don't think so.

83
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,480
It's mainly about your date.

84
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,360
I had a great date today.

85
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,240
The picture is very eloquent.

86
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,240
He's also very talkative.

87
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,040
He's like a happy puppy.

88
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,280
He makes me feel like a younger brother.

89
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,760
I'm not familiar with

90
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,800
with Hua these days.

91
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,480
I have a similar personality with Hua.

92
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,080
So I put myself

93
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,600
I put myself

94
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,760
like a sister.

95
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,360
Later,

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,880
when I asked him,

97
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,600
like this.

98
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,280
Will you like her?

99
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,880
Will you accept that?

100
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,560
I don't think

101
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,440
between me and him.

102
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,560
So do you think

103
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,360
what you did today hurt the map?

104
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,760
I think there might be.

105
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,680
I'll keep thinking about it.

106
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,079
Because if you go on a date today,

107
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,480
you didn't receive

108
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,000
I received so many texts,

109
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,280
I might visit you

110
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,240
and see your date.

111
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,520
And I'll think a lot.

112
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,360
if you think

113
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,640
if I'm not good enough.

114
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,079
But you won't.

115
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Yes.

116
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,400
If I don't receive a text

117
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,360
after my date today,

118
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,800
(I'll go back to my room.) Okay.

119
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,520
Come on. Come on.

120
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,880
and cried all night.

121
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

122
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,200
Then I thought

123
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
if the map would say the same.

124
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,440
He's actually very carefully prepared.

125
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,480
But mainly,

126
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,079
I think this is mutual.

127
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,160
If I can feel

128
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,440
the drawing's feelings for me,

129
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:57,840
I can do it too.

130
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,640
Can you feel it?

131
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,240
No.

132
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,000
If not,

133
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,640
you don't have to worry about it.

134
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,280
You didn't feel it.

135
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,480
I think

136
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,360
love can't be forced.

137
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,680
Just get to know more about it.

138
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,280
Even if I'm a little disappointed today,

139
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,760
I think it's normal.

140
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,519
It's not a problem.

141
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,519
Because we came here

142
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,840
to explore better people.

143
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,760
He just advised me

144
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,880
It's okay. Just follow your heart.

145
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,520
You can tell him

146
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,000
You can text him.

147
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,880
But later, you need to know how you feel.

148
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,960
It's not a problem to get to know first.

149
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,360
We can't make people make mistakes.

150
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,760
Right?

151
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,400
Yes.

152
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Who did you send it to?

153
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,640
Who do you think I sent it to?

154
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,080
I think Harry is the only option.

155
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Did he send it to you?

156
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,480
He sent it to me yesterday.

157
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,120
What did he send?

158
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,720
Something like having a crush on him.

159
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,280
So,

160
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,760
he might receive two today.

161
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,360
You can't guess this.

162
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,040
How many messages did he receive?

163
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,160
You sent them to him.

164
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,040
He sent you a good impression yesterday.

165
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
He went on a date today.

166
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,480
So his date today

167
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,960
is another one.

168
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,720
And he wants to know another one today.

169
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,080
Let's get to know each other.

170
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,280
I think it's okay.

171
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,720
I think because we just moved in,

172
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,520
to get to know everyone.

173
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,920
And then...

174
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,800
He went on a date today.

175
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,680
He didn't talk after the date.

176
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,680
We get to know each other slowly.

177
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,200
I think this is a sequence.

178
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,159
right?

179
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,480
But I need to be firm

180
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,120
to like.

181
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,280
It's still early.

182
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,560
Yes, I know.

183
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,880
I'm a person

184
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm not worried

185
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,120
I'm not worried.

186
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,960
I think we should at least

187
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,160
until the end.

188
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,120
I think...

189
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,200
Let's stop talking.

190
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,920
Okay.

191
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,560
Let's go.

192
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,120
I suddenly feel

193
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,120
he was relaxed to see all this.

194
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,560
He solved most of

195
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,280
in my heart.

196
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,000
After talking to him,

197
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,320
after talking to him.

198
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,280
Xinxin still trusts her brother.

199
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
We're close.

200
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

201
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,040
It's like a bossy president.

202
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,400
It's very logical.

203
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,320
Very charming.

204
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,840
You took over the house of siblings.

205
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,840
You took it, right?

206
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,120
You're going too?

207
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,880
I wanted to.

208
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,360
I brought you some medicine upstairs.

209
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,640
What medicine?

210
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,360
It's at your bedside.

211
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,240
You'll see it when you get there.

212
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
Do you want some melatonin?

213
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,560
Yes.

214
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,720
I'll wait for you to come back.

215
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,840
Okay, wait for me, okay?

216
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,280
Okay.

217
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,720
What they said is like a signal.

218
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,440
and the map are like an interview.

219
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,080
I'll wait for you.

220
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,480
Yes.

221
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,160
I brought you some medicine.

222
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,120
Look, this is fate.

223
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,320
Here.

224
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,040
Two.

225
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,800
Thank you so much.

226
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,280
Did you have a good date today?

227
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,920
Come in and talk.

228
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,400
Okay.

229
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,720
Wait, I need to talk.

230
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,040
Fatty, go away. Fatty.

231
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,560
How is your date today?

232
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,840
It's my first date today.

233
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,800
But I'm happy.

234
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,880
If this weekend

235
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,440
let you choose a girl,

236
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,800
would you choose her?

237
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
or someone else?

238
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,240
I have to know everything.

239
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,800
Can't you?

240
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,840
He's testing him.

241
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,520
Test him?

242
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,960
He's testing him.

243
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,480
Wait. No.

244
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,880
You won't.

245
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,640
Are you sure that

246
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,560
the end?

247
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,120
If you know one,

248
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,640
you won't understand the next one?

249
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,880
I don't know her by dating.

250
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,480
I can understand her

251
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,560
I can understand her.

252
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,120
No.

253
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,360
Dating is very attractive.

254
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,880
Because today,

255
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,080
I saw a different person.

256
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,520
Really?

257
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes.

258
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,760
But Xiao Ling and I

259
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,560
a very good friend today.

260
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,960
There's nothing

261
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,200
Love

262
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,920
Cool.

263
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,520
Good.

264
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,320
Seriously.

265
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,240
I'll write my diary.

266
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,880
I'll write my diary.

267
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,800
He left right after his mission was completed.

268
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,120
Good boy.

269
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,720
He's so nice.

270
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I'll leave right after the mission is done.

271
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,960
Yes.

272
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,760
When this party is organized,

273
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,640
there's no purpose.

274
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
We talk about every day.

275
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,560
When I knew that

276
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,360
after his date today,

277
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,240
after the date today.

278
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
I was happy.

279
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,240
When did you...

280
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,520
When did you bring me cold medicine?

281
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,800
After that,

282
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,120
I went to get it.

283
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,000
Come in.

284
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,760
Present the medicine.

285
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,240
Ten.

286
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,240
Three packets for Xinxin.

287
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,200
She caught a cold.

288
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,160
Do you want some?

289
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,880
I'll give you one.

290
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,800
Thank you.

291
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,040
There are three packs of love.

292
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,120
Only one pack of friendship.

293
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,280
Bye.

294
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,200
Thank you.

295
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,720
I'll give you medicine.

296
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,960
One pack of cold medicine for each.

297
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,160
Drink it today

298
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,520
Drink it when you catch a cold.

299
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,840
Thank you. You're so sweet.

300
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,120
You're welcome.

301
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,000
No.

302
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,920
One, two, three, four, five, six.

303
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,960
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

304
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,920
Ten, twelve.

305
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,840
12 packets.

306
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,440
Come in.

307
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
I found that there are twelve packs. I'll give you two more.

308
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,720
Favorite.

309
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
Really.

310
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,960
It's hilarious.

311
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,680
I'll give you two more.

312
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,320
Okay.

313
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,720
You're a good person.

314
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
But you gave me five packets.

315
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,280
and each gave me one.

316
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Here's the thing.

317
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,040
I left a pack for myself.

318
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,000
He left a bag for soup.

319
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,560
Look at his eyes.

320
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,400
Harry.

321
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,240
They're good friends.

322
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,920
So you got two today, right?

323
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,880
Are you happy?

324
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,280
Didn't you see that I was afraid to look at my phone?

325
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,040
Guolifang.

326
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,760
Why?

327
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Guoli.

328
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,240
I thought about it.

329
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,800
I thought about it before.

330
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,200
Because I'm very consuming.

331
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,040
I'm afraid that if there's a misunderstanding,

332
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,880
or two, I'm afraid that you'll say your choice.

333
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Good answer.

334
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,960
Let's cut to the chase.

335
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,000
But I think

336
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,640
you texted me fast.

337
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,600
I don't have to think today.

338
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,080
Well,

339
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,800
Maybe I thought too much.

340
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,080
I'm going on a date with Xiaoling today

341
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,440
It's just...

342
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,360
Friend.

343
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,480
Nice straight shot.

344
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,920
Great.

345
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,160
You don't have to tell me.

346
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,720
It's fun anyway.

347
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,000
“Guoli”.

348
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,520
But I think

349
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,240
I want to know more about everyone's personality.

350
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,360
Guoli.

351
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
But I still think

352
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,040
I think I know more

353
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,640
I know more.

354
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,440
When it's alone,

355
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,800
Unless you like someone

356
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,160
or someone you like,

357
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,240
to know more.

358
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,760
But I don't know much

359
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't know much.

360
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,680
What an efficient conversation.

361
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,840
She still wants to know more before making a decision.

362
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,600
So efficient.

363
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,520
Xinxin is quite rational.

364
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,040
“Guoli”.

365
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
I really want to know a question.

366
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
If you have someone

367
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,600
in the room,

368
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,560
“Guoli”.

369
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,960
You chose it

370
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,320
because you're here?

371
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,840
Or

372
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,680
whether in reality

373
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,640
in reality,

374
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,160
You will choose too.

375
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,000
Of course. We can't be so hasty.

376
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,080
It must be

377
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,760
if I don't go on this show,

378
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,800
if I meet my friends in real life,

379
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,160
70 to 80,

380
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,640
I also think this girl is good.

381
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,680
And I chose her.

382
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,760
Yes.

383
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,960
But here,

384
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,080
we might spend time together

385
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,960
and more interactions

386
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,280
more quickly.

387
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,760
Yes, maybe the advantage will be bigger.

388
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,920
Yes, but...

389
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,600
But not necessarily.

390
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,120
Because there are

391
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,640
We don't spend much time together.

392
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,400
We didn't get along today.

393
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,640
Including you, Hua,

394
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,320
including Susu.

395
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
You're good at talking.

396
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,920
She's testing me.

397
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,160
I think the core meaning of his sentence

398
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,440
is

399
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,400
Come on, keep sending it to me.

400
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,240
Send it to me tomorrow.

401
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,040
Send it to me the day after tomorrow.

402
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,320
I'm still here.

403
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,520
Let's talk later.

404
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,880
Wait.

405
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,200
Come on.

406
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,120
What are you talking about?

407
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,720
So funny.

408
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,480
He came as soon as Hua came.

409
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,760
I have a lot to tell you.

410
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,520
But we don't have that.

411
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,280
To be honest,

412
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,920
I don't really want to write a diary.

413
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,360
I want to ask if there's anyone you want to know more.

414
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,720
I want everyone to know the truth.

415
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,400
Who else do you want to know?

416
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,640
I know about girls.

417
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,240
I want to know more about boys.

418
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,640
I think

419
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,760
Harry received the most today.

420
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
So, Harry, have you made any progress?

421
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,160
You're so gossipy.

422
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,280
He's done.

423
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm going to the bathroom.

424
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,120
Do you think you took a step forward?

425
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,640
Anyway, I did.

426
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,040
We were talking about today.

427
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,960
We took a step of friendship today.

428
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,480
I see.

429
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,760
I got it.

430
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,800
I haven't been in contact with him before,

431
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,640
So I asked him directly.

432
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,600
The feedback I got

433
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,280
maybe he and Xinxin will be more connected.

434
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,880
He said he took a step yesterday.

435
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,400
I might not be able to

436
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,040
Harry, I want to try again.

437
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,000
Sometimes, when you say you like someone,

438
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,280
is not necessarily about love.

439
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,720
Maybe it's about friendship.

440
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,320
Yes.

441
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,600
The definition of this message

442
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,160
is not necessarily right.

443
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,720
So what I received was friendship?

444
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,840
Because text doesn't count.

445
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,200
To be honest, I'm more proactive than you.

446
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,440
I'm a person who I'll try my best

447
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
I will try my best.

448
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,120
But don't you think three days are too fast?

449
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,760
I think three days are a bit fast.

450
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,600
Then I can't...

451
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,000
Bro,

452
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
I can't understand her a little bit today.

453
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,720
Then tomorrow I'll get to know

454
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,600
another little bit.

455
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,160
I'll come back the day after tomorrow to understand her a little bit.

456
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,640
Why not?

457
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,680
You advised me to

458
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,200
to get to know everyone first.

459
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,760
Then...

460
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,320
Yeah, I think

461
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,400
I'm just alone.

462
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,160
I think I will be like this.

463
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,360
So you think

464
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm too...

465
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,560
because I want to lock you up too much?

466
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,800
I don't want to lock it.

467
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,600
I just don't think

468
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,880
It's just a little flashy.

469
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,840
I think

470
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,560
Flower has no sense of security.

471
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,360
No sense of security.

472
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
Really.

473
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,800
I haven't shown it yet.

474
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,640
I want to know what others mean.

475
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,680
Is that what it means?

476
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,400
In your feeling.

477
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,240
Yes.

478
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,800
Not really.

479
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I think you might get an A on your first day.

480
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,360
The next day and the third day, maybe B.

481
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,960
So I think you can do CD

482
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,560
Not necessarily DC

483
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,880
How do you know my first day is A?

484
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,920
The next day is B.

485
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,000
How come you don't know I'm B every three days?

486
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,640
I'll try my best to understand.

487
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,440
But my personal opinion is

488
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,520
I won't say I know one today

489
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,000
and get to know the other one tomorrow.

490
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I might

491
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,680
spend two or three days to get to know one first.

492
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,240
Actually, I wanted to remind him.

493
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,360
But I can't tell him directly.

494
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,200
Do you want to know more about me

495
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,760
and be nice to me?

496
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,480
Because

497
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,920
I think we just got along.

498
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,040
for such a short time.

499
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,000
in such a short time.

500
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
to me.

501
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,040
I might be a little scared.

502
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,840
I want to accept

503
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,080
your kindness to me.

504
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,400
But I think your kindness

505
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,120
You can treat anyone.

506
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
Because it's only three days.

507
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,320
That's why I want to go further.

508
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,160
and observe him slowly.

509
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,800
or wait for him to get along with others.

510
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,320
I want to see

511
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,160
if he's like me.

512
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,920
What I fear the most is

513
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
that his outfit is the same for everyone.

514
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,200
Yes.

515
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,000
Flower will think

516
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,960
I hope there won't be any changes.

517
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,320
Yes.

518
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,360
She's afraid that if she gets serious,

519
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,960
but you'll be in trouble again.

520
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,360
Yes

521
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,600
So you should go out first.

522
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,640
Look at the outside world first.

523
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
If you're sure it's me, then come back to me,

524
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,880
she will feel more secure.

525
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,240
I think this hint is good.

526
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,080
She clearly told her what she needs.

527
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,120
She's afraid of losing.

528
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,480
Hua has no sense of security.

529
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,360
No sense of security.

530
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,040
Really.

531
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,360
Because she had some experiences.

532
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,920
right?

533
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Yes.

534
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,760
The idea Hua gave me is

535
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,240
if you want to know more about others,

536
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,120
as soon as possible.

537
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,040
If you want to know me,

538
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,080
please continue to understand me.

539
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,360
and understand me.

540
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,800
Please be more determined and continue.

541
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,960
Don't say you know me for a few days,

542
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,800
or after a few days.

543
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,480
She doesn't accept it.

544
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,720
I can feel it.

545
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,160
He understood it.

546
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,760
Fatty is good.

547
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,240
Are you still chatting?

548
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,000
chatting?

549
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,839
Let me join.

550
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,760
Will you be moved?

551
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,280
You'll be moved by love after a long time.

552
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,680
Yes.

553
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,319
I will.

554
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,400
I don't fall in love at first sight.

555
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,319
My love grows gradually.

556
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,520
Love can grow as time goes by.

557
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,480
But I think the touching love

558
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,000
is that I love him

559
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,440
Yes.

560
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,079
Then I won't.

561
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,000
Right? I won't be touched either.

562
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,440
Yes.

563
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,680
Not at all. Of course not.

564
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,880
But if he likes you more,

565
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,600
and treats you well,

566
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,560
and you'll be moved.

567
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,280
I think this possibility

568
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,320
Yes, I think so too.

569
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,760
why I let him succeed.

570
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
You're the only good person.

571
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,080
He's getting confused again.

572
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
I can understand.

573
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm absorbing experience.

574
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,720
Are you observing girls' thoughts?

575
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,960
Actually, these thoughts are very normal.

576
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,480
But I remember yesterday,

577
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,960
Harry said he would be touched.

578
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,040
Yes, he will.

579
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
Even if you don't

580
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,200
for this girl,

581
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
No.

582
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,080
I think it's OK.

583
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,480
If you think she's okay,

584
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,200
I'll look around with you first.

585
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,680
No.

586
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,320
I don't have a place to look at this.

587
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,800
As long as I'm sure that girls like me,

588
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,320
I'll take the initiative.

589
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,240
What if someone else in your WeChat

590
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,320
suddenly pops out

591
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,400
Delete.

592
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Will you take the initiative to delete it?

593
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,680
You can delete it.

594
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:27,840
Awesome.

595
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,000
You delete it when you're in a relationship.

596
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,280
If you need it, delete it.

597
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
When she comes to you,

598
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,360
you said I have a girlfriend.

599
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,200
Delete it.

600
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,120
Three women interrogate one man.

601
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,000
I deleted them all before.

602
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,080
What was I thinking?

603
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,880
I thought

604
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,600
as long as I want to invite my boyfriend

605
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,160
to do something,

606
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,320
I have to do this first

607
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
to invite my boyfriend to do this.

608
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,120
You also ask your boyfriend to delete it.

609
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,040
A big part. Yes.

610
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,680
Most?

611
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,640
Are you a control freak?

612
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,720
I used to be a little...

613
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,920
You've grown up.

614
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,520
It's quite controlling.

615
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,080
Yes.

616
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,520
Are you a control freak?

617
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm fine.

618
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,800
What about you?

619
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,760
I'm fine.

620
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,400
I'm the kind of person

621
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,560
If he asks me to do something,

622
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,160
I'll ask him to do the same thing.

623
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,440
That's what I thought.

624
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
Harry is the first person

625
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,440
for a long time.

626
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,720
But I think he's more like a friend.

627
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,240
Xin and Harry.

628
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,120
They did the dishes together yesterday.

629
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,400
And they gave each other medicine today.

630
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,800
So I think it's interesting.

631
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,360
I think we all need

632
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,720
people in the same frequency.

633
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,840
with the same frequency.

634
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,560
will be more synchronized.

635
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,040
and get along better.

636
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,080
The situation just now

637
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,720
is really amazing.

638
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,680
Because these three girls

639
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
used to be

640
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,440
in the small house

641
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,280
expressed his feelings for Harry.

642
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,400
Or he said Harry was good.

643
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,080
I had the idea of developing.

644
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,840
All three girls

645
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,280
trying Harry out.

646
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,800
Yes.

647
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,240
Do you think

648
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
why a guy like Harry

649
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,800
would choose

650
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,600
or consideration,

651
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,160
to get more choices.

652
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,680
He's humorous and good at cooking.

653
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,200
and also gives emotional value.

654
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,680
He will give out some ambiguous signals.

655
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,320
Yes.

656
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,960
Right?

657
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,480
If you can feel

658
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,400
you have an ambiguous relationship,

659
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,320
they will bump into each other.

660
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,120
If you're not flirting,

661
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
you'll find it interesting.

662
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
You can wipe it.

663
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,520
Yes.

664
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,320
So I think he will

665
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,760
by him unconsciously.

666
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,960
But a man like him is dangerous.

667
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,880
He suddenly thought you were no fun.

668
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,840
or you're not his boyfriend,

669
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,360
he'll leave.

670
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,160
Leave that girl behind.

671
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,240
is so lonely.

672
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,800
Maybe he doesn't understand what's going on.

673
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,280
And he would say I didn't.

674
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,920
He might think

675
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,160
I didn't do anything.

676
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,200
I didn't make it clear to you.

677
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,800
So I'm actually worried about this.

678
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,240
But Harry is quite attractive now.

679
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,160
Will Lu be attracted to such a guy?

680
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,000
No.

681
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,840
So determined.

682
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,040
I don't like men with mouths.

683
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,080
I like men who talk less.

684
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,560
Soup soup.

685
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,680
Because I talk too much.

686
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,960
Because my job is language work.

687
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,760
Then I say boys are funny.

688
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,720
I'm funny too.

689
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,240
So I won't overdo it.

690
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,920
Of course, your humor is good.

691
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,640
Everyone goes back and forth.

692
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,480
But

693
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,800
I've been with a funny guy.

694
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,560
I often make a fool of myself.

695
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,440
Yes, we appreciate each other's talent.

696
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,600
Like this.

697
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,440
I know your point.

698
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,000
Bye.

699
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,560
Like this.

700
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,320
I'm sure she'll like this kind of boy.

701
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,160
He's humorous.

702
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,640
I liked him when I was young.

703
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,960
How old were you when you were young?

704
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,920
When you were young,

705
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,560
about three or four years old.

706
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,520
I like such an uncle.

707
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,040
When I was eighteen and nineteen,

708
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,320
I thought it was funny.

709
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,160
It's fun and valuable.

710
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,280
And it seems to be a little pulling.

711
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,680
Yes.

712
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,400
It's unstable, right?

713
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,680
I would like it then.

714
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,840
I don't really like

715
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,120
a routine.

716
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,680
Yes, a little tired.

717
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,840
More sincere and straightforward.

718
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,200
Yes.

719
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm so busy at work.

720
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,720
It's tiring to play tricks every day.

721
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,520
Yes, so tired.

722
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
So tired.

723
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,840
So this is a double-edged sword.

724
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,320
This will release signals.

725
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,760
But Harry only

726
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,040
only look at Xinxin.

727
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,200
When he was dating Xiaoling,

728
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,440
he kept his head down

729
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,680
and honest eyes.

730
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,200
When I touch Xinxin,

731
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,960
I feel the magnetic field has changed.

732
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,720
The magnetic field has changed.

733
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Just look at it like this.

734
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,480
I think both of them are good at dating.

735
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,120
Can you see this?

736
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,800
Let's go.

737
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,040
What do you need

738
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,480
Cucumber bread

739
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,640
Tomato sauce

740
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,800
Brush a pan.

741
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,120
There should be a pan.

742
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,720
to cook for the first time

743
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,920
to make up for the sandwich incident.

744
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,000
He's making sandwiches, right?

745
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,680
Compensate?

746
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,720
I'm a man of my word.

747
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,680
Great.

748
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,160
It's a good show.

749
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,440
Turn on the smoke engine first.

750
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,680
Right.

751
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,280
And the third one.

752
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,800
I was scared by high-tech.

753
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,080
So scary?

754
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,280
Is this oil This is oil

755
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,000
It's oil

756
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,920
Touch it first.

757
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,520
Pour it directly. It's quite hot.

758
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,320
How much?

759
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,000
Enough.

760
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
How many people do you make?

761
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,880
Two.

762
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,600
You eat.

763
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,480
Then you make one.

764
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,040
There are four of us in total.

765
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,440
Pull my roommate up.

766
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,720
I said you were watching

767
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,480
and guide me every step.

768
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll do it myself.

769
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,200
I want to make one for Xiaoling.

770
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,840
There's an egg shell.

771
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,760
It's okay.

772
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
Stir-fry the eggs first.

773
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,720
Let me learn.

774
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,680
Just take the shovel.

775
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,000
Do it yourself.

776
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,360
What happened just now?

777
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,000
I finished it while he wasn't careful.

778
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,200
Help!

779
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,920
Why is it so hard to cook

780
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,680
How much strength do you usually use?

781
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,800
Medium strength.

782
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,600
Why is my egg shell falling again?

783
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,680
It's okay.

784
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,200
How to break it

785
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,920
Just keep stirring it.

786
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,800
Okay.

787
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,960
Why is it uglier than yours?

788
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,560
Dude.

789
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,720
Did you fire?

790
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

791
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,600
I thought you opened it for me.

792
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,000
He didn't fire.

793
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,240
Unbelievable.

794
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,000
"The Man Who Do Homework"?

795
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,120
No.

796
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,960
The more I think about it, the more I want to laugh.

797
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
I haven't fired for half a day.

798
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,160
Why are you laughing? You just learned how to fry eggs yesterday.

799
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,280
You're a talent even if you didn't cook it for half a day.

800
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,000
I stir-fry it.

801
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,120
What should I put

802
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,800
Oh-Ee needs to

803
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,960
Do I need to wash them all

804
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,400
You need to wash your hands.

805
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,240
Let me do it.

806
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,720
Rub it. Rub it in the middle.

807
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,120
Come on, cut one first.

808
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,000
Let me see how big each piece is.

809
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,480
That's it.

810
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,040
Okay.

811
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,760
Almost this big.

812
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,280
Okay, I'll try.

813
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,160
What's next?

814
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,760
Tomato.

815
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,000
No tomatoes.

816
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,280
I have no choice. Put more ketchup.

817
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,000
Is it enough?

818
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,240
No.

819
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,880
Again.

820
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,560
Don't ask me why.

821
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,680
Others may put less.

822
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,520
She must put more.

823
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,760
How do you know?

824
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,480
I guessed.

825
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,040
Harry knows his sister well.

826
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,400
Yes.

827
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,760
My brother-in-law teaches me personally.

828
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,440
Help him in person.

829
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,120
Yes, the plug is on.

830
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,200
It's almost done.

831
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,120
What should we put after the ketchup?

832
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,440
Eggs.

833
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
Be careful.

834
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,040
It looks good.

835
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,960
It looks good

836
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,480
This cheese is quite delicious.

837
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
Susu, do you want cheese?

838
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,800
Yes.

839
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,480
Well, I can put some

840
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,640
and one without.

841
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,880
She can eat whatever she wants.

842
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,920
So sweet.

843
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,840
A piece and a half.

844
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,720
Like this.

845
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,960
Let's cut it from the middle

846
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,280
and wrap it with plastic wrap.

847
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,320
Okay.

848
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,440
Check it.

849
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,920
How do you use plastic wrap for sandwiches?

850
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,120
Okay, got it.

851
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,960
No, bro.

852
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,560
How many layers do you want to wrap?

853
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,200
Are you going to keep it for tomorrow?

854
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,360
I think it's full in teaching.

855
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,280
Okay, I'll do it too.

856
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,560
Or it'll be leaked.

857
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,640
I'll do whatever it says.

858
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,840
You're right.

859
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,600
I'll do whatever you do.

860
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,720
After all, nothing will go wrong following Tsinghua.

861
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,080
Don't put a hat on me.

862
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,320
No.

863
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,760
How did you cut it with a plastic wrap?

864
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,840
Like this.

865
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,040
Okay.

866
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,800
Yours is so honest. Your sandwich.

867
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,240
My first success.

868
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,200
Very good.

869
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,080
Learning?

870
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,240
Sure.

871
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,400
That's all. I'll clean up later.

872
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,040
I'm tired.

873
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,680
I'm tired.

874
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,440
Take a break for two minutes.

875
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,680
He dragged my brother-in-law up early in the morning.

876
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,360
I don't think he's awake yet.

877
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,320
Yes.

878
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,360
Sit here and think.

879
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,960
Should I eat it?

880
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,800
Are you crazy?

881
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,880
I'm hungry.

882
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,480
Then why do we get up early?

883
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,760
Get up early and work on our own.

884
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,960
We're the benchmark.

885
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,480
We have to get up early.

886
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,360
We got up early for an hour and a half.

887
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,400
and ate it ourselves.

888
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,000
Do it.

889
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,560
They are really

890
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,960
only for the people they like.

891
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,040
I don't care about others.

892
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,280
Yes.

893
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,680
I'm going upstairs to the bathroom.

894
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,560
Okay.

895
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,880
Xinxin.

896
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,440
Coming.

897
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:16,960
Xinxin is here.

898
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,000
Someone you like is here.

899
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,440
Hello.

900
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,400
Eat that.

901
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,320
It's all your fault.

902
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,880
No, that was made for someone.

903
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,520
I'll make another one.

904
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,760
Because Xiaoling is going out.

905
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
I want to make one too.

906
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,560
I'll make you a dumpling.

907
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,080
I'll get one for her.

908
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,840
Where is Xiaoling going?

909
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,200
She went to class this morning.

910
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,160
It's already broken.

911
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,400
It's not finished.

912
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Not enough. Dig another one for me.

913
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,200
Okay.

914
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,480
Let's dig it.

915
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,160
Okay.

916
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,640
I'll make another one.

917
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,760
Because Xiaoling has a class.

918
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,200
I thought she could eat it at school.

919
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,920
Harry got me some butter there.

920
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,480
Smash it

921
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,200
He even cooked eggs for me.

922
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,000
Actually he made it.

923
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,520
Do you need to wash this plate?

924
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,760
Yes.

925
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,960
I look so ugly.

926
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,200
Is it too ugly?

927
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,640
As long as it's delicious.

928
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,760
Cut it like this.

929
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,040
Yes.

930
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,720
Do it yourself.

931
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,120
What's wrong?

932
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
It's not my fault.

933
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,640
You can cut it well.

934
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
It means you're skillful.

935
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,040
Because I didn't cut it well just now.

936
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,840
I think it's dry.

937
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,120
It won't taste good.

938
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,440
It's okay.

939
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,360
Even if it doesn't taste good,

940
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,800
she'll say it's delicious.

941
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,000
Just wait to be praised.

942
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,080
The two of them

943
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,480
are really excited.

944
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,680
Is this social distance

945
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,600
is reasonable?

946
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,640
We've made a breakthrough.

947
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
a very safe distance.

948
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,000
to a very safe distance.

949
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,680
Harry is actually

950
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,560
subconsciously.

951
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,840
we call it

952
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,800
approaching behavior.

953
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,160
comes from your instinct.

954
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,040
dopamine

955
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,960
or hormones.

956
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,720
The social distance

957
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,640
a very intimate distance.

958
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Esther can catch these.

959
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,200
Yes.

960
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,680
Shoot.

961
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,800
She won't feel embarrassed.

962
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,680
She won't bounce.

963
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,360
or allergy.

964
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,680
Yes.

965
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
She accepted it naturally.

966
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,600
Good.

967
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,160
It's so shocking.

968
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,240
Did Xiaoling leave?

969
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Has Xiaoling left?

970
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,080
How would I know?

971
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,800
Go take a look.

972
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,880
This is the breakfast I made for her.

973
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,640
I need to make sure she's still here.

974
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,760
I'll ask her.

975
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,520
Xin made breakfast for you.

976
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,880
Don't forget to eat.

977
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,280
Is it too late?

978
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,880
You finished it in five minutes.

979
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,240
You know what?

980
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,560
You're lucky.

981
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,360
Lucky?

982
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:44,720
Right.

983
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,840
Who's lucky and I'm lucky?

984
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,960
Yes, the one who gives is happy.

985
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,720
Right?

986
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,480
Who are you trying to trick?

987
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,640
When you put in effort,

988
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,640
you're full of yourself.

989
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,040
I heard someone made me breakfast.

990
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,720
Yes.

991
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,920
But

992
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,880
it may not be delicious.

993
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,920
It looks good

994
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,560
Eat now

995
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,760
Thank you.

996
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,120
I want to hear the truth.

997
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,600
Sometimes,

998
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,760
he said it's not good.

999
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
You're so annoying.

1000
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,920
Is it good?

1001
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,400
It smells good.

1002
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,160
Don't lie to me.

1003
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
I'll be sad.

1004
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,680
Try it yourself.

1005
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,640
Leave it to Hua.

1006
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,600
She wants to eat what he cooks.

1007
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,240
She gave everything she made to someone else.

1008
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,920
She made the soup for Xiaoling.

1009
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,320
but I didn't tell her.

1010
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,400
She's finished. Look.

1011
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,880
This is delicious.

1012
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,120
It's not bad.

1013
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,280
You're acting cute.

1014
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,640
Are you two competing?

1015
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,360
No, I think you're too kind.

1016
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,840
Are you coming back for dinner tonight?

1017
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,760
I should be back at 6 p.m.

1018
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,600
You can eat it when you come back.

1019
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,280
Okay.

1020
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,800
Who told you that?

1021
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,840
You ran away and asked you to eat directly.

1022
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,400
Make a radish squat and eat one

1023
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,960
One radish squat and one squat.

1024
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,240
I want to sew his mouth.

1025
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,640
He's really annoying, you know?

1026
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,360
Who's annoying?

1027
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,640
The early sign of love.

1028
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,280
Annoying.

1029
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,920
Bye.

1030
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,040
Do you want to drink this coconut?

1031
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,760
I'll drink it if you don't.

1032
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,880
You drink.

1033
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,400
No.

1034
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,480
I want to know if it's in.

1035
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,720
It's not open.

1036
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,200
But I can't do it.

1037
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,920
What should I do?

1038
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,840
Can I drink it?

1039
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,200
As long as they are together,

1040
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,640
Why do I feel hormones

1041
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,440
is fluttering?

1042
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,240
Give it to me.

1043
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,080
Can't you just cut it?

1044
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,320
Both of them are ambiguous.

1045
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,840
I just want to ask you if I can drink it.

1046
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Am I swollen? My eyes are fine.

1047
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,760
I'm very swollen this morning.

1048
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,560
Do you want pumpkin juice?

1049
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,760
To reduce swelling?

1050
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,360
Yes.

1051
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,400
Do you want pumpkin juice?

1052
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,719
Yes, one of the cuteness.

1053
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,040
The secret to my small face every day

1054
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
You have to drink it secretly.

1055
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,239
Don't let others find out.

1056
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,239
your exclusive.

1057
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't tell anyone.

1058
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,600
Because I don't have

1059
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,800
When we get closer,

1060
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,080
We have our own secrets.

1061
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,679
Let's make a deal.

1062
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,560
They're about to touch hands.

1063
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,640
It's going too fast.

1064
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,360
Or are we too rare?

1065
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,400
We haven't been in a relationship for a long time

1066
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,040
An an really

1067
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,960
You're so ugly. I'm speechless.

1068
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,160
Bro, do you know that?

1069
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
This is the ugliest coconut I've ever had.

1070
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,600
Do you know how difficult it is?

1071
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,720
Susu is wearing a mask.

1072
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,560
Why is there a butterfly mask?

1073
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,840
No one can look at me.

1074
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,000
She was seen

1075
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,800
she's ugly.

1076
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,440
So funny.

1077
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,080
Butterfly Su.

1078
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,840
Why did it become a corn?

1079
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,440
The missing sandwich again.

1080
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,840
I ate it.

1081
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,040
Morning.

1082
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,120
Is this edible?

1083
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,280
No.

1084
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,520
No.

1085
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,840
Is this mine?

1086
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,800
No.

1087
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,800
It's not mine.

1088
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,880
Your smile is mine and not mine.

1089
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,600
Why are you jumping?

1090
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,160
I'll do it myself.

1091
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Dude, do it yourself.

1092
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,600
Are you down there?

1093
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,040
Yes.

1094
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,840
Who's there?

1095
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,200
Me, Fatty.

1096
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,480
Harry is doing his hair.

1097
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,440
I'm coming.

1098
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,280
Who?

1099
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,320
Hua.

1100
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,360
or Xinxin.

1101
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,720
Or...

1102
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,680
Can't you tell who it is by the sound?

1103
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,560
You can.

1104
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,840
Of course.

1105
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,000
Tell me now.

1106
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,800
Susu.

1107
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,360
You guessed wrong.

1108
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,320
Sister.

1109
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,760
It's okay.

1110
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,280
I was too gentle.

1111
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,680
It's me.

1112
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,600
Talk nicely.

1113
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,920
I'll speak very slowly today.

1114
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,600
What? Blood pressure?

1115
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,640
I'll start talking slowly today.

1116
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,720
Why?

1117
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,240
She bit her tongue last night.

1118
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,120
Because I'm very gentle.

1119
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,320
I'm hungry. I want to eat something.

1120
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,600
Whose is this?

1121
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,640
This is for Hua.

1122
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,160
It's taken.

1123
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,640
Why do I feel like the soup is sitting here

1124
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,760
just looking at the sandwich?

1125
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,360
as a "security".

1126
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,240
He's waiting for the other half.

1127
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,360
This should be made by Harry for Susu.

1128
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,200
Harry for Susu.

1129
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,880
No.

1130
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,800
Didn't he make it?

1131
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,360
I made it for Susu.

1132
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,680
Did you really make this

1133
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,040
You cut the cucumber yourself

1134
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,360
Yes

1135
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,000
The other half.

1136
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,920
I don't know who changed it to corn.

1137
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,080
I don't know.

1138
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,320
Maybe later

1139
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,800
two corns later.

1140
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,560
When I first came down,

1141
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,760
half of it was gone.

1142
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,600
Hurry up, Susu.

1143
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,040
Your breakfast has turned into two corns.

1144
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,120
I can tell from the footsteps.

1145
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,840
Someone is learning from me.

1146
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,080
This one.

1147
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,600
It's good.

1148
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,080
Someone is learning from someone.

1149
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,080
Love is everything.

1150
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,360
He woke up early to make sandwiches for me today.

1151
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,360
because he mentioned

1152
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,000
he said

1153
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,360
he'll go with Harry Potter tomorrow.

1154
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,360
to learn how to make sandwiches.

1155
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,160
It's good

1156
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,400
I can do what I say.

1157
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,200
So sweet.

1158
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,040
She's done eating.

1159
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,640
The soup is still there.

1160
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,920
I was afraid she didn't eat it.

1161
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,640
I think

1162
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,080
the sandwich he made

1163
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,120
is a little better

1164
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,560
than Harry Potter.

1165
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,800
So sad.

1166
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,320
The chef who was defeated

1167
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,560
Xinxin is hungry.

1168
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,640
Xinxin is hungry.

1169
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,200
Who did you give this sandwich to?

1170
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,040
Why not?

1171
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,200
She wanted to do it with me.

1172
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,520
For Xiao Ling.

1173
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,120
Is the sandwich good?

1174
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
Did you eat it yourself?

1175
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,240
No.

1176
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,400
You dare not eat?

1177
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,240
I left it for Hua. I dare to eat anything.

1178
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,960
Xiao Ling said it's delicious.

1179
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,600
Xiao Ling said it's delicious.

1180
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,840
It's okay. I'll feed it now.

1181
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,640
You eat it.

1182
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,080
They have unique tension.

1183
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,880
You eat.

1184
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,240
flirting with each other.

1185
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,360
I wish I could see you eat.

1186
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,000
I've never seen him eat.

1187
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,000
He's a bulb again.

1188
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,240
I just ate some rice this morning.

1189
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,760
When did he eat anything?

1190
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,800
This morning.

1191
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,960
Have you seen it?

1192
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,880
I don't remember much.

1193
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,120
Yes, it's just vague.

1194
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,760
No.

1195
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,400
Who knows how to gain 6 kilos in eight days?

1196
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,800
You've gained 6 kilos.

1197
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:19,920
Why?

1198
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,160
What did you eat so delicious?

1199
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,000
Who knows?

1200
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,920
I eat and drink every day.

1201
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,320
Take a bite and it'll turn dark.

1202
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,240
You eat it.

1203
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,400
He ate the flowers.

1204
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,320
Is it good?

1205
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,960
A little salty.

1206
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,040
Is it bad?

1207
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,760
No, a little salty.

1208
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,640
Why is it salty?

1209
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
My taste is light.

1210
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,560
I can't. Let me have a bite.

1211
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:51,880
I don't believe it.

1212
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,280
Will they eat one?

1213
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Could it be...

1214
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,520
I'll eat this side.

1215
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,760
Add a sausage

1216
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,520
Why are they still eating next to each other?

1217
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,440
Have one

1218
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,800
It's not salty.

1219
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,920
It doesn't taste at all.

1220
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,000
What's wrong with you?

1221
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,400
You just want to eat what I've eaten.

1222
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,840
It's really salty.

1223
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,840
It's too salty.

1224
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,200
It's very ambiguous.

1225
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,000
Hello.

1226
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,440
Hua.

1227
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,360
Hello.

1228
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,680
Ask Harry to make breakfast for you.

1229
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,040
It's okay.

1230
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,040
Harry, go.

1231
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,000
You ate someone else's food.

1232
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,120
Whom did you eat?

1233
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,080
Eat her.

1234
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,200
Go help.

1235
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,320
What are you doing?

1236
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,360
Nothing.

1237
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,200
I'll just drink yogurt.

1238
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,520
Hua, do you want an egg?

1239
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,080
What?

1240
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,080
Eggs. Okay, put it there.

1241
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,720
I'll eat it.

1242
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,800
Whose breakfast is this?

1243
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,000
They all made it for Susu.

1244
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,840
Whose is this?

1245
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,680
Susu's.

1246
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,520
It's Susu's again.

1247
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,960
Come and eat your breakfast.

1248
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,840
You're so happy.

1249
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,120
This is soup for you.

1250
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,560
Harry made this for you.

1251
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,360
Eat.

1252
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Do you want it?

1253
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
No.

1254
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,680
It's not for me. I don't want it.

1255
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,560
I can't eat it.

1256
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,120
I ate half of it.

1257
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,760
Don't waste it.

1258
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,000
I think girls like favourite.

1259
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,520
So I think

1260
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,160
a little bit disappointed.

1261
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,880
Hua still wants everyone.

1262
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,200
We all consider her.

1263
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,040
No one made it for her.

1264
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,800
Because she focuses on the girl she likes.

1265
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,160
Where is Fatty?

1266
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,480
Fatty should cook for her.

1267
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,160
Susu has a lot of food.

1268
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,720
You got up so late.

1269
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,920
I got up early.

1270
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,600
I ate half.

1271
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,640
I thought someone took it.

1272
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,280
I ate it. I ate it upstairs.

1273
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,680
That's good.

1274
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,200
Eat up.

1275
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,240
All sandwiches.

1276
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,080
Someone's coming.

1277
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,720
Hurry!

1278
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,160
Someone is coming.

1279
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,840
Who's here?

1280
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,240
Who's here

1281
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,960
A tough one.

1282
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,520
He looks stylish.

1283
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,680
So tall.

1284
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,160
He's so handsome up close.

1285
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:24,960
I'm Tae-seo.

1286
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,080
I'm a model.

1287
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,200
A model

1288
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,560
Cool

1289
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,920
Hello

1290
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,800
Hello.

1291
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,400
Who is it?

1292
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,800
New guest. Signation.

1293
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,560
We have a new guest.

1294
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,400
Hello.

1295
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,120
Let's go in.

1296
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,440
As soon as he came in,

1297
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
at a distance.

1298
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,320
Because I like tall guys.

1299
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,440
If it's his first look,

1300
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,400
I couldn't control myself.

1301
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,080
I couldn't control myself.

1302
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,240
I'm too excited.

1303
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,240
Sit down.

1304
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,640
Sit.

1305
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,000
It's time to make up.

1306
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,080
Let me introduce myself.

1307
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,280
Hello, I'm Terri.

1308
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,080
Hello, I'm Susu.

1309
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,880
Hello, Susu.

1310
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,760
Xinxin.

1311
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,600
Hua.

1312
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,520
Fatty.

1313
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,840
Soup.

1314
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,640
Soup.

1315
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,480
A different one.

1316
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,640
Everyone is watching.

1317
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,320
I never thought there would be a rookie.

1318
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,760
I had a high first impression of him.

1319
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,000
He should be a model.

1320
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,240
Because the other boys

1321
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,000
other boys may still be in school.

1322
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,200
So after he came in,

1323
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,800
his aura is different.

1324
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,120
He looks mature.

1325
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,040
and similar.

1326
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,320
who acts as a bossy president.

1327
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,840
I think Terri

1328
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,360
should be Xiao Ling's type.

1329
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,480
Handsome.

1330
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,120
Of course he's handsome.

1331
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,720
But I'm happy too.

1332
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,120
Because this boy may make my sister

1333
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,720
a better way

1334
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,680
or she has more choices.

1335
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,520
I know Xinxin might like this.

1336
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,840
What's MBTI?

1337
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,400
ENFP.

1338
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,800
But I'm a little introverted.

1339
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,080
ENFP.

1340
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,720
Okay.

1341
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,840
I understand.

1342
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,040
There's an ENFP.

1343
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,040
He's not back yet.

1344
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,240
Aren't you also an ENFP? No.

1345
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,840
Three.

1346
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,200
Yes.

1347
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,160
Okay.

1348
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:56,880
So sudden.

1349
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,040
Harry, you're so happy.

1350
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,200
What's your smile?

1351
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,040
Can you tell me?

1352
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,760
Harry, your smile is that you're happy with a boy.

1353
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,600
No.

1354
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,160
Although our names are similar, I think.

1355
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,600
No.

1356
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,480
He's already looking forward to new girls.

1357
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,400
Guolifang.

1358
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,640
So a new friend will come today.

1359
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,160
One?

1360
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,120
Two Guoli.

1361
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,760
Two, but she can't.

1362
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,960
Together?

1363
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,760
I can't do it.

1364
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,360
I've already started calculating.

1365
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,280
So one of us

1366
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,720
one of us will come.

1367
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,600
Yes, we can have brothers.

1368
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,400
Three.

1369
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,600
Three Guoli.

1370
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,520
Is it possible that Terri and Harry are a family?

1371
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:46,800
No way.

1372
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,120
They have the same name.

1373
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,680
Who's younger brother got caught by Marcel?

1374
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,440
In a childhood photo,

1375
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,400
a little boy was controlled by Marcel.

1376
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,480
So he is one of them.

1377
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,960
Maybe.

1378
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,320
Do you both know

1379
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,560
each other's occupation?

1380
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,400
Okay.

1381
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,480
Can we tell him everything?

1382
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,920
Isn't it fun not to tell him?

1383
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:13,720
Okay.

1384
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,840
I have a guess.

1385
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:19,760
Colleague.

1386
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,240
I'll...

1387
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,800
I think I can say it out loud.

1388
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,120
Me too.

1389
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,080
Two words.

1390
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,960
I think I know.

1391
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,880
Two words, right?

1392
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,120
MT?

1393
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,160
You said that.

1394
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,200
MIT, right?

1395
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,040
Yes.

1396
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,960
I’m MiT.

1397
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,360
Yes.

1398
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,800
Yes, I'm from MIT.

1399
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,240
Do you all have pets?

1400
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:46,800
Do you have one?

1401
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,600
I have two cats.

1402
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,160
And mine has two dogs.

1403
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,400
Yours has two.

1404
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,200
Your brother has two dogs.

1405
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,360
Yes.

1406
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,320
When are your brothers coming?

1407
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,720
Or are they already here?

1408
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,000
I can't tell you.

1409
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,120
Someone's here again.

1410
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,760
It must be his brother.

1411
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,120
Hurry up.

1412
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,680
Why are you so excited?

1413
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,880
You go. You are the most excited.

1414
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,320
He said something wrong. I really...

1415
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,440
No.

1416
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,680
Guess if it's a man or a woman.

1417
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,160
A girl.

1418
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,840
Three, two, one.

1419
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,360
It's also the peak of beauty.

1420
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,280
What a brother.

1421
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,800
Boys' Chat Party.

1422
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:33,720
Boys' Chat Party?

1423
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,760
Who do you like?

1424
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,440
who you like.

1425
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,080
Let's ask what type do you like.

1426
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:40,800
Susu.

1427
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,120
Oh no.

1428
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,600
I didn't see it.

1429
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,520
Fair competition.

1430
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,200
declared war.

1431
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,320
Okay, no problem.

1432
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,000
I agree.

1433
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,000
I've never seen before.

1434
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,440
A new girl.

1435
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,440
Hello.

1436
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,640
