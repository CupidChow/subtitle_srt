1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
A small party.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
It's fluffy like a head.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

5
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
It feels like we'll have some wild wine right away.

6
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,800
It's fluffy.

7
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,680
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

8
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,200
will watch Love Sisters first.

9
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,000

Let love double.

13
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Welcome.

14
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,160
(Brothers intervene in relationships.)

15
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,800
"Love Sisters".

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,720
This show is called "Little Wild Wine",

17
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,080
I feel there will be a fruit immediately.

18
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,160
exclusively sponsored.

19
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,600
We're a dating family member.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,960
A week has passed in a blink of an eye.

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,640
Do you remember

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,960
what happened in the second week?

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
A Cupid date?

24
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,800
Yes.

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,120
There are two couples who haven't dated yet.

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,759
Yes.

27
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,520
Only Susu and Xiaoling

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,040
have completed

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
their date with boys.

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,079
There are two more groups.

31
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,280
our romantic Cupid date

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,880
hasn't been announced yet.

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,840
Yes.

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,240
At the same time,

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,520
we have released the album of life.

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,560
and our brothers.

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,480
I know them better.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,760
What will their love and family

39
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,520
their love and family?

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,680
We're going to

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
the update of this episode.

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
My face and heart are just starting.

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm falling for it.

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Xinxin.

45
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,160
I hope so.

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,600
A map.

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,240
She hopes it's a map.

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,720
She likes Harry.

49
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,560
Let's watch them date first.

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,720
My first impression

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,360
He is "Happy Puppy".

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,400
He is very good at organizing games.

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,240
and interactions with everyone.

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,720
It won't make the atmosphere awkward.

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,079
This should be the first day.

56
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,160
It's the first day.

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,800
If we can go on a date together,

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
we can be very happy.

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,079
You can relax.

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,520
It's really the map.

61
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,280
Actually, when I received

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
when I received

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,600
I was very happy.

64
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,560
So I'm looking forward to

65
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,160
Who are you going on a date with?

66
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,600
Hello.

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,160
Hello.

68
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,320
Xinxin is so happy.

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,440
The first second I saw the map,

70
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
I felt

71
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
put down the stone in my heart.

72
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,520
He walked in like a rabbit.

73
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,240
He looks energetic.

74
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,920
Did you guess it was me?

75
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,040
Guess if I knew it was you.

76
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,600
I think you are so smart.

77
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,399
you should be able to guess.

78
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,120
A little bit.

79
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,839
Okay.

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,240
The first time I saw her,

81
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,560
I was very happy and surprised.

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,400
Because she basically has curly hair in front of her.

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,280
She has a smooth straight hair today.

84
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,800
There are some contrast.

85
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
The drawing is very detailed.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,600
He noticed some changes about Xinxin.

87
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,159
If it were you,

88
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,760
choose one,

89
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,920
who do you want to be with?

90
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,320
When I first came in,

91
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,120
I...

92
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,400
you were the last one to come in.

93
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,200
You suddenly said

94
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
your ears were so big.

95
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,320
You suddenly called me.

96
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Your ears were too obvious.

97
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,040
I can't move my eyes

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,960
I can't take my eyes away.

99
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
because of my ears.

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,840
I was shocked.

101
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,280
I said,

102
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,480
Esther can

103
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,120
such a reaction.

104
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,200
At that time,

105
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,360
impression and favourite.

106
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,360
So when I compliment your ears,

107
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,480
when I compliment your ears.

108
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,080
No.

109
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,320
It's about that.

110
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,520
I understand.

111
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,440
Many people

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

113
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,920
Thank you.

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,400
This is huge.

115
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,480
You start first.

116
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,320
I also want to eat this dish first.

117
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
Because I know you like it.

118
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,920
It's really spicy.

119
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
This is a dough twist.

120
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,040
I love spicy food.

121
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,400
Sure.

122
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,760
I like Sichuan cuisine. Hunan cuisine.

123
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,320
Me too.

124
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Sichuan cuisine. Hunan cuisine.

125
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
Guizhou cuisine is also delicious.

126
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,640
Guizhou cuisine

127
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,720
It's delicious.

128
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Especially that potato.

129
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,520
Well

130
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Chicken stewed with potatoes

131
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,000
The rotten potato

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,600
Yes.

133
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
Don't you want this ice cream?

134
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,080
Let me try it for you.

135
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,320
Is it good?

136
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,360
But greasy.

137
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
But it's not ice cream.

138
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,240
They always feel like siblings.

139
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,400
They have a strong sense of younger brother.

140
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,480
Is it possible that

141
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,920
we saw the picture on TV

142
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,120
might be different

143
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,640
from what they saw.

144
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,360
We work hard.

145
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,240
If you...

146
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,200
if

147
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,000
have such a crush,

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
would you talk to her?

149
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,840
I'm actually

150
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,520
a person who depends on the feeling.

151
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,120
But I think

152
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,760
more importantly, when we get along

153
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,680
or chatting,

154
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,400
I think

155
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,040
you and I

156
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,120
we are quite compatible.

157
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,080
Or our daily routine and hobbies

158
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,120
are very compatible.

159
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
and daily routine.

160
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,600
So you sleep early and get up early?

161
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,240
No.

162
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,120
Sleep and wake up late.

163
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,080
Something like that.

164
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,960
What if...

165
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,920
If...

166
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,960
if you have

167
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,159
you have a crush on,

168
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,640
But your siblings

169
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,160
doesn't suit you.

170
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,400
or let you see it again.

171
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,080
Will you listen to her

172
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
or move forward bravely?

173
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,840
I think I'll listen to it.

174
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,800
Listen

175
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,520
I do.

176
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,040
But I don't think you can change my mind.

177
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,720
Like this.

178
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,880
It's up to you.

179
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,360
But you will listen to her

180
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
and then think about it yourself.

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,920
Right.

182
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
To be rational.

183
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm not that kind of person.

184
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,480
A brother.

185
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,360
Yes.

186
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,320
You can replace him.

187
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Got it.

188
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,640
He's a little awkward.

189
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,720
So he used food to resolve the embarrassment.

190
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,800
You want to be with the person you like.

191
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,880
You're very determined.

192
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,400
Or is there a girl who likes you?

193
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,840
You'll be moved too.

194
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,320
You really asked me.

195
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,080
Because there were few cases

196
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,880
in the past.

197
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,000
Case.

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,560
Yes.

199
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,840
That means you have no relationship experience.

200
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,920
Yes.

201
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
He has never been in a relationship.

202
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,640
He keeps eating.

203
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,240
You can think about

204
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,400
what I like.

205
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,440
Right?

206
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,160
I really can't think of it.

207
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,120
I might have to experience it again.

208
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,080
After that,

209
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,600
you may think

210
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,360
what kind of person

211
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,840
when you're with someone.

212
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,560
He's avoiding her eyes.

213
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,360
I'm really nervous.

214
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,880
I feel like my sister is here with you.

215
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,520
I don't want to be a teacher.

216
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,320
Actually, these things are...

217
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,039
I can understand these things.

218
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,720
And why did I

219
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,720
at the beginning?

220
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,280
Because I think you are very similar to my sister.

221
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Oh no.

222
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,560
I'm like a brother to Map.

223
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,280
Because I feel like

224
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,800
from his brother's perspective.

225
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
what kind of girl you like.

226
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,160
It's okay.

227
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,720
I feel that

228
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,520
I don't know why

229
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,600
It's very similar.

230
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,240
and open-minded.

231
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,400
Have you ever liked a girl older than you?

232
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,160
Yes.

233
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,520
Actually, I think

234
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,720
I don't have a specific type.

235
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
I think you are the right person.

236
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,840
or I feel comfortable with you.

237
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,120
I think that's me.

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,320
I can contact.

239
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,920
It's like this.

240
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,640
It depends on the feeling.

241
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,400
Yes.

242
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,520
If you're cute,

243
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
you can...

244
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,160
Yes.

245
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,680
Indeed.

246
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,480
Kill you.

247
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,160
Got it.

248
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,640
And I think

249
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,040
you are a very detailed person.

250
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,120
You will remember many details.

251
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,640
Like you said,

252
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,960
I don't remember

253
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
your sister cooked for you.

254
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
I remember everything.

255
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,480
If I had to remember one thing,

256
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,760
I will definitely

257
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,080
For example, what clothes are you wearing today

258
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,840
or

259
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,520
necklace or something.

260
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:54,880
I can remember it.

261
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
The exam is tomorrow.

262
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,200
Okay.

263
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,280
In a few days,

264
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,520
Next week.

265
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,760
Yellow powder dust.

266
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,600
Okay.

267
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,960
So,

268
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,760
you don't care about the girl you like.

269
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,120
You're a person who cares a lot.

270
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,640
Yes, I am.

271
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm not saying

272
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
I want to show everyone my charm.

273
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,720
And

274
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,280
I want to be the central air conditioner.

275
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,760
What do I want?

276
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,280
"Three-timing"?

277
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,920
I really didn't.

278
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,760
I just...

279
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,600
You got me.

280
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,040
You must be scared.

281
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,840
We were just joking.

282
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,720
Because you have a good personality.

283
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
and you're good at expressing emotions.

284
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,560
Yes.

285
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,440
I know you're joking.

286
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,680
I had a good chat with Tu today.

287
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,200
I feel that

288
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,880
at first,

289
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,520
the first time we met

290
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,440
comes from his liveliness.

291
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,520
After getting to know him,

292
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,840
I feel this kind of relationship is like a good friend.

293
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
Like sister and brother.

294
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,880
Here's your card.

295
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Yes.

296
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,520
Through today's date,

297
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,360
makes my heart flutter.

298
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,760
Really?

299
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,280
Because I think

300
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,960
she is a very generous person.

301
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,240
She can joke with you,

302
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,320
she can also keep it.

303
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,160
She also expresses

304
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,760
in this way

305
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,360
her feelings.

306
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,120
So,

307
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,040
I will give her some feedback.

308
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,680
In the future,

309
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,880
I will pay more attention

310
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,320
the habits of our life

311
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,640
or hobbies.

312
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,280
We're almost the same.

313
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,720
Okay, let's go.

314
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,800
When a girl says we're almost done,

315
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,000
it's really a failed date.

316
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,080
Tu Tu said he was moved and I was surprised.

317
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,840
It's actually an instinct

318
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,920
that is driven by instinct.

319
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,080
Yes.

320
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,600
So he will make you

321
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,120
your usual state.

322
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,000
Like expression, right?

323
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But the problem is when we eat,

324
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,720
he didn't even

325
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,280
in his eyes.

326
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,520
And he doesn't have

327
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,720
about Xinxin.

328
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,960
I didn't ask any questions.

329
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,640
In fact, the topic has been surrounding him.

330
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,320
Yes.

331
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,680
So this heart flutters more

332
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,320
The picture just feels comfortable.

333
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
Or it's his first time

334
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,400
He's trying to be friendly.

335
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,800
Because he said he has never been in a relationship.

336
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,040
Yes.

337
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,680
He doesn't know how to express love.

338
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,000
But if a girl

339
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,520
guiding him,

340
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,640
he suddenly thought it was good.

341
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,760
So this is how it feels

342
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,040
is like this.

343
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
He drew a dot

344
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,400
on this white paper.

345
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,520
He didn't care about that.

346
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,320
what it should be like.

347
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,640
He thinks I have a point.

348
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,680
I think my heart started to flutter.

349
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,280
So maybe

350
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,120
is not a picture of love.

351
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,640
It's just a dot.

352
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,360
His heartbeat may be

353
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,040
people's hearts are always beating.

354
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,520
Hua.

355
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,240
Only fat is left.

356
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,920
Yes.

357
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,920
Cupid's invitation card.

358
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,360
I filled in Harry.

359
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,000
She wanted to give it to Harry.

360
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,600
The reason I gave her

361
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,680
I thought Harry was her brother.

362
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,560
This is beautiful.

363
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,840
So beautiful.

364
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,400
Before leaving today,

365
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,760
I did my hair.

366
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
I chose a suit for myself.

367
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,760
Hello.

368
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,560
Hello.

369
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,000
The result is the same as I expected.

370
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,760
The first person I wanted to date

371
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,200
is Hua.

372
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,520
Order something.

373
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,440
What do you want to eat?

374
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,960
Take a look.

375
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,440
You look different

376
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,520
It's different.

377
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,600
He's nervous.

378
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,520
Yes.

379
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,640
Let's order a mousse.

380
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,920
and Swiss rolls.

381
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,720
Which one do you want, mousse? Sea salt.

382
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,520
Butter.

383
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,280
Sea salt.

384
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,120
I want to ask you a question.

385
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,560
You asked me a question as soon as you came.

386
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
Soul torture.

387
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,040
The moment you gave me my brother,

388
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,880
you knew it was me?

389
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,120
Did you guess one thing?

390
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,280
So accurate?

391
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,480
So awkward.

392
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,600
Should I be honest?

393
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,680
Because I saw her in front of the restaurant.

394
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Then I laughed.

395
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,200
When I saw her, she was smiling too.

396
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,840
And I think

397
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,080
I don't think it'll be rude.

398
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,280
So I asked this question at the beginning.

399
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
When we first entered,

400
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,240
Harry took over

401
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,360
the whole housework.

402
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,120
When we are cooking,

403
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,080
Then we need to write

404
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,160
"Pitt's Heart Card".

405
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,720
Actually, I thought...

406
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,320
Explain.

407
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,760
Xinxin.

408
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,080
It's Harry's sister.

409
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,000
So you thought it was Harry at first

410
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,520
Yes.

411
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,560
On the first day, I thought

412
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,800
But yesterday

413
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,400
my mind might have changed.

414
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,880
I guessed it again.

415
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,880
I got fat and broke my heart.

416
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,720
She said she thought

417
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,280
she wrote Harry first.

418
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,880
I was a little disappointed.

419
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
At that moment,

420
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,520
I thought my "Cupid" cut

421
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,440
is not because of the first sight,

422
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
It might be wrong.

423
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,280
I think, OK.

424
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,480
Yes, you'll be disappointed.

425
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,880
On the first day,

426
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
I didn't know anything about my siblings.

427
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,760
Harry and that...

428
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,400
Yes, Susu or me?

429
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm thinking about it too.

430
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,640
Can you confirm it now?

431
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
I can confirm it now.

432
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,320
Can you confirm it?

433
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,400
100 percent?

434
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
I looked at the map behind you.

435
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,960
It looks quite similar.

436
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,200
I thought it was too late.

437
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,280
that I look like the map.

438
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,040
When I first came in,

439
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,520
when I just came in?

440
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,840
Because on the first day,

441
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,640
he and Susu had a tacit understanding.

442
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,040
The map and Susu have a tacit understanding.

443
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,880
Didn't we play games?

444
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,280
Because we have a tacit understanding.

445
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,080
Can you tell?

446
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,360
Not at all.

447
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,920
Not at all.

448
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,560
I don't even think

449
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,680
quite honest.

450
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,800
I thought you and Susu

451
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,880
Because both of you

452
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,240
are taller.

453
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
Harry and Xinxin

454
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,040
are short.

455
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,800
I thought if the genetic probability

456
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,640
it should be you and Susu.

457
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,160
Yes.

458
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,680
I was completely sure on the first day.

459
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
I'm really confident that

460
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,520
you and Susu are siblings.

461
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,680
So you gave the wrong one.

462
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,480
It's not wrong.

463
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,320
Now sitting here, you...

464
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,400
She said it well.

465
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,360
Because it's not wrong.

466
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,600
Yes.

467
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,960
Because you're sitting here now.

468
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,280
Because on the first day,

469
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,200
I didn't have much contact with Fatty.

470
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,760
Later,

471
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,600
we didn't go shopping at the supermarket.

472
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,840
and communicate more with Fatty.

473
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,640
I want to know more about Fatty.

474
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,000
So after yesterday's contact,

475
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,680
I'll do it today.

476
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,359
After meeting yesterday,

477
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,760
I think this afternoon tea is right.

478
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,599
Not at all.

479
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,480
It's not a loss.

480
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,119
Yuanyuan is back.

481
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,839
I went to the supermarket yesterday.

482
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,920
I said I wanted to eat this.

483
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,119
You said you wanted to buy it.

484
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,880
You were at the supermarket too.

485
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,880
What do you want to buy?

486
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,680
Just tell me.

487
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,440
He walked through the curls first.

488
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,480
He said,

489
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,600
Curls should be good at making breakfast.

490
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,520
No one cares about him.

491
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,680
I thought he would take it himself.

492
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,560
But the second time,

493
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,120
we went to that circle together.

494
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,720
He said,

495
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,440
I think breakfast

496
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,280
eat this breakfast.

497
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
I know he wants it.

498
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,960
but no one responded.

499
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,200
I said take it.

500
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,040
But I am

501
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,640
When I'm hesitating,

502
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,280
when I was hesitating.

503
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,520
Because I'm not very independent.

504
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,120
I want to be recognized.

505
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,240
When I doubted it,

506
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,600
I asked if I wanted this.

507
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,880
Then you said you wanted it right away.

508
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,800
So...

509
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,600
In the past,

510
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,280
basically we can get the map.

511
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,440
No one will say

512
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,200
Hua, you can take whatever you want.

513
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,240
Did you buy too much chili sauce?

514
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,880
No everyone likes it

515
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,520
One more.

516
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,040
Take it.

517
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Just follow her.

518
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,600
So adorable.

519
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,240
When he said I could take it,

520
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,440
I think it's a kind of recognition for me.

521
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,560
I think it's very warm.

522
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,080
What Hua wants is preference.

523
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,760
Yes.

524
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,440
I saw Susu there.

525
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,960
take whatever she wants.

526
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,400
Yes.

527
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,080
I think you're a girl too.

528
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,720
You can take it too.

529
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,520
I'm so happy.

530
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,160
It's nothing. Just take it.

531
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,960
According to the day we went to the supermarket,

532
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,600
she said she didn't make the wrong appointment.

533
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,440
I was happy at that moment.

534
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,880
That means

535
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
I bought her

536
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,640
was the right choice.

537
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,680
Cheers.

538
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,200
You can drink this.

539
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,160
Why not?

540
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,440
With a cup

541
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,720
Natural match.

542
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,280
Yes.

543
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,040
When the three of us

544
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,240
sitting there together yesterday,

545
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,960
we asked you about the black mask.

546
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,000
Your black mask scared me.

547
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,360
Can I have one?

548
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,040
No.

549
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,880
You just said you can only be biased.

550
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,040
You didn't apply it for the three of us.

551
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,040
Xiao Ling wasn't there.

552
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,840
not for Xiaoling.

553
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,240
The three of us asked if you could.

554
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,440
You said you could only be biased.

555
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,760
And you refused to give us three.

556
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,000
Only Xiaoling is not here.

557
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,880
You think I can't say it?

558
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,720
I want to give it to Xiaoling.

559
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,840
She doesn't need that face.

560
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,800
So we need her, right?

561
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,080
You're really...

562
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,680
No.

563
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,800
I mean she's not here.

564
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
I won't leave it to her.

565
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,040
So what I said

566
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,120
I want to give someone

567
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,760
But you didn't answer the next one.

568
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,160
Because the three of us knew it.

569
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,360
So I dropped my words.

570
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,360
When you came to my room,

571
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,920
I asked you

572
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,360
Susu said one thing.

573
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,880
Then I asked you

574
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,520
if you want to

575
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,640
Fatty.

576
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,640
Look at your black mask.

577
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,840
What? Do you want to try?

578
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,000
You didn't understand my point.

579
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,200
"Pure Love Warrior" Fatty.

580
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,720
Do you want some?

581
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,680
Yes.

582
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
We'll go back later.

583
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,960
We should have dinner together.

584
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,520
We can eat more tonight.

585
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,480
Why can we eat more tonight

586
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,360
Because the chef is good at cooking, right?

587
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,520
Yes it's their turn to cook tonight

588
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,040
Yes.

589
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,960
Who did the dishes today?

590
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,400
It might be you or the drawing today.

591
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,760
Can you come over and check?

592
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,960
Yes.

593
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,680
Can you help me?

594
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,520
No need.

595
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,320
We can enjoy ourselves today.

596
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,240
Sit there and watch.

597
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,560
It's them today.

598
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,480
So are you someone who worries?

599
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,160
I won't worry if someone is here.

600
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,320
In love,

601
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,800
in love?

602
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,440
I don't know.

603
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,640
You know it yourself.

604
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,040
Let me tell you.

605
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,840
I'll tell you everything.

606
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,280
Can we have a chat?

607
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,920
I like their direct expression.

608
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,000
They make everything clear.

609
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,720
Because I think Harry will be there today.

610
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,320
I don't have to worry at all.

611
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,320
So you wanted to observe

612
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,520
Harry and...

613
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,120
Me?

614
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,120
Yes.

615
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,280
This is your first impression.

616
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,160
Yes.

617
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,880
Because

618
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,240
The soup is my first impression.

619
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,960
Very handsome and tall.

620
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,000
But the soup

621
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,360
He doesn't talk.

622
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,320
So you like to talk more with you.

623
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,160
Be cheerful.

624
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,920
Favorite.

625
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,440
What do you mean?

626
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,560
I think

627
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,920
Really.

628
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll go back for dinner later.

629
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,480
Okay.

630
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,600
Save some belly.

631
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,840
Harry will say we don't give him face.

632
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,960
He eats so much outside.

633
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,080
Harry again. Don't mention Harry, okay?

634
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,200
At this moment,

635
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,800
Let's go.

636
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,560
Did you drive?

637
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,480
I drove.

638
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,400
You can take my car.

639
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,920
Okay.

640
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,600
If you grade this date today,

641
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,440
you can get 95 points.

642
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
So high.

643
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,200
Because usually,

644
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,840
I'm the one who speaks.

645
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,080
Yes.

646
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,960
But today I feel Fatty is leading me.

647
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm grateful to him too.

648
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,040
She feels grateful

649
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,000
she's grateful.

650
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,640
Yes.

651
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,360
When we were on a date,

652
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,040
Fatty told Hua

653
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,680
He said you're a girl too.

654
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,640
so you can take it.

655
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,360
I feel like that sentence is poking me.

656
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,560
The point that Hua really needs

657
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,000
is that she wants to be favored.

658
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,560
It seems to be her childhood experience.

659
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,640
because she's a girl.

660
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,400
She was ignored.

661
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,680
Yes.

662
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,560
She said in her environment,

663
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,200
some elders value men over women.

664
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,360
But at that time,

665
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
they didn't read the letter.

666
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,240
So at that time,

667
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,800
Fatty didn't know that

668
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,920
Unconsciously hit

669
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,560
Yes, unintentionally.

670
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,320
It's warm now.

671
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,800
The most empty place.

672
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,880
The first snow.

673
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,120
So romantic.

674
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,720
Really.

675
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,360
In K-dramas,

676
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,680
you should go see the first snow right away

677
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,120
and meet love.

678
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,840
The snow is so romantic.

679
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,400
I want to know who's watching it.

680
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,560
Love will definitely warm up.

681
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,960
It's a special occasion.

682
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,240
Okay.

683
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,040
Soup, Susu, Susu.

684
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,680
Aren't you coming down?

685
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,760
You're going down.

686
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,160
Go down and have a look.

687
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Let's go down.

688
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,720
Let's go down and have a look.

689
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,720
You...

690
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,400
Good evening.

691
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Do you want to take a photo?

692
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,760
Let me take a photo for you.

693
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,800
I'll take two for you.

694
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,400
My phone is really nice.

695
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,920
It's like...

696
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,400
Why don't you wear more?

697
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
It's okay.

698
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,320
Really?

699
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,040
I'm really fine.

700
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,000
Cold legs.

701
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,960
Watch out!

702
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,400
Let me take a photo for you.

703
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,360
I'll take two for you.

704
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,040
Let me see.

705
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,080
Okay.

706
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,640
Okay.

707
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,480
Go over there.

708
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,720
I'll find it for you.

709
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,240
Okay.

710
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,760
Nice height.

711
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,200
A little bit to the side. Don't move.

712
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,800
Just move slowly.

713
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,240
My phone is a bit old.

714
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,160
Why don't we just take a few photos?

715
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,840
I'll take it for you.

716
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,760
Put your chin in.

717
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,560
A little bit.

718
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,280
That's it.

719
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,480
I'll find the light.

720
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Don't laugh.

721
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
You look like a stiff robot.

722
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,000
Don't move.

723
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,600
Stand here.

724
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:37,840
Okay.

725
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,200
In front of the light.

726
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,320
in front of the light?

727
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,000
Are you cold, Susu?

728
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,160
Let me get you a coat.

729
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,320
Where is it?

730
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,760
It's in the jacket.

731
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,640
Is it white

732
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,360
White down jacket

733
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,440
It's snowing heavily.

734
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,200
You need to put on your clothes.

735
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,040
One more?

736
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,680
It's okay. I don't wear it when I take photos.

737
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,120
I'll take it for you.

738
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,000
I'll hold it for you.

739
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,080
Thank you.

740
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,440
Then you can finish it.

741
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:15,840
Wait.

742
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,640
It's huge.

743
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,760
What?

744
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,680
No, I think it's fun.

745
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,880
I feel happy.

746
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,800
It's snowing heavily.

747
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,320
It's really on my face.

748
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,720
Look up.

749
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,200
This is so romantic.

750
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,360
This is a romance show.

751
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,200
It's snowing heavily.

752
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,680
He's filming her.

753
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,000
Turn around.

754
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,800
But my left face is pretty.

755
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,880
I couldn't hold it.

756
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,440
Sorry.

757
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,360
It's okay.

758
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,240
When I took a picture of her,

759
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,200
in the snow,

760
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,360
in the snow.

761
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,640
Is it stiff?

762
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,320
Maybe she's pretty.

763
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,600
It might not look good.

764
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,000
What?

765
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,640
Take a photo for me.

766
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,680
They should take selfies.

767
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,240
But they are shy.

768
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,640
It's too stiff.

769
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,880
What should I do?

770
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,240
Stand here.

771
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,720
I'll go around you.

772
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,920
That's it.

773
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,600
MV.

774
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
You like MV, right?

775
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,080
No.

776
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,360
Give it back.

777
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,360
The way we get along

778
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,960
more relaxed.

779
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,520
He keeps asking me if I'm cold.

780
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,480
Should I wear something?

781
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,360
He even took my phone.

782
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,160
and took my clothes.

783
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,280
That's it.

784
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,560
is a bonus to me.

785
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,160
I need a heart.

786
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,720
I'm so jealous.

787
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,920
It's like a drama.

788
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,840
watching the snow together,

789
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,960
I felt they were standing there.

790
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,880
They look great together.

791
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
I envy you.

792
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,240
Fatty is out.

793
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,000
Fatty, come out.

794
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,080
Go find Hua.

795
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,640
It's too cold.

796
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,280
I can't stand it.

797
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,880
I'm going up.

798
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,920
That straight man.

799
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,800
He's too cold when he's so romantic.

800
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,360
Are you still wearing it?

801
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,240
Let's go inside.

802
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,000
Let's go.

803
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,560
I'll put this phone on.

804
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,640
Okay.

805
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,480
They have each other's

806
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,000
in each other's phone.

807
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,000
She's secretly taking pictures of him.

808
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,160
Isn't this what a girlfriend looks like?

809
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,200
I wanted to learn

810
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,160
the sound of snowfall.

811
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,720
I was going to say,

812
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,280
but I failed.

813
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,040
Is it hard to learn?

814
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,720
No.

815
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,560
It doesn't look like this.

816
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,200
I love him.

817
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,480
Yes.

818
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,920
I want to record this moment.

819
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,720
Don't be nervous. It's okay.

820
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,760
I don't feel right.

821
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,400
Let me take a photo for you.

822
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,920
Take a photo.

823
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,000
She's smiling when she's filming.

824
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,720
We all look at her smiling.

825
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,800
So charming

826
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,480
It never stops.

827
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,800
Great.

828
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Who can play the piano so well?

829
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,640
Who is so talented?

830
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,880
Amazing.

831
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,240
The emotional value is too great.

832
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,000
Amazing.

833
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,360
Why did you button it?

834
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,880
Are you done playing today?

835
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,480
This is love.

836
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,960
Little spotted dog.

837
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,320
Little Love Dog.

838
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Good.

839
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,840
Too many talents.

840
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,680
Please keep it.

841
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,480
Thank you.

842
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,000
Doesn't it look good?

843
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,840
Yes.

844
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,440
Will you play it?

845
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,320
I don't know how.

846
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,240
Didn't you learn

847
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,600
When I was young,

848
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,920
I forgot.

849
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,240
You can take a photo if you can't.

850
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,600
No.

851
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,720
That's too pretentious.

852
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,840
They really match each other.

853
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,680
And their personalities complement each other.

854
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,280
And Susu

855
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,360
to express her thoughts.

856
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:40,920
Very outgoing.

857
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,280
Yes.

858
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,920
If she's with the soup,

859
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,120
it might affect the soup.

860
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,760
Take him.

861
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,120
Yes.

862
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,480
express

863
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,120
in your heart.

864
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,600
Great.

865
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,520
The Chosen One.

866
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,640
Put your phone on the clip.

867
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,200
This operation is so interesting.

868
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,760
When you were playing,

869
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,960
Do you know I was up there?

870
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,240
Yes.

871
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,840
I wanted to keep it down.

872
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,720
But

873
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,440
The louder you step on it,

874
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,360
Then I gave up.

875
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,280
Anything.

876
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,440
Show your charm.

877
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,760
Show.

878
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,800
and charming.

879
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,120
I can't play.

880
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,080
I can't play.

881
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,960
Yes.

882
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,640
Someone said he couldn't play the piano.

883
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,200
Someone said he couldn't play the piano.

884
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,160
Then less than half an hour later,

885
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,800
the performance begins.

886
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,080
A package is at the door.

887
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,200
You can look inside.

888
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,720
You can't ask.

889
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,440
What is this?

890
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,800
It's like

891
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,120
Why does it look like space sand?

892
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,800
Truth or Dare.

893
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,760
Truth or Dare.

894
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,560
What can you play?

895
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,680
A game other than rock, paper, scissors?

896
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,360
Say one.

897
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,600
The one I play is... The one I play is...

898
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,720
The winner

899
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,320
will win.

900
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:03,960
I don't understand.

901
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm playing

902
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,440
advanced version, a group of smart people.

903
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,440
You're bullying me.

904
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,880
Because you don't know how to play.

905
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,080
Let's play rock paper scissors.

906
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,440
Rock, paper, scissors.

907
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,720
Scissors.

908
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,840
They are really...

909
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,320
Her leadership is obvious.

910
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,160
This is a good way

911
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,320
a way to get close.

912
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,640
without considering money.

913
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,280
What do you want to do the most?

914
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,840
is actually quite a lot.

915
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,400
Dessert chef.

916
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,480
You want to be a dessert chef?

917
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,520
Although I don't know how to make dessert,

918
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,560
but it's an open kitchen

919
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,600
Then the chef cooks

920
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,440
You squeeze cream next to him

921
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,680
You squeeze each part.

922
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,120
It feels very relaxing.

923
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,120
It's very healing.

924
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,840
Yours.

925
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,080
What?

926
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,320
Let me see.

927
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,679
Let me see.

928
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,080
If your friend

929
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,560
No.

930
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,920
No.

931
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,159
Then do you think the relationship will become strange?

932
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,120
No.

933
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,280
The first time we met,

934
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,000
I would introduce my friends

935
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
and people

936
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,239
I can tell clearly.

937
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,040
If we have become friends,

938
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,600
it means in my heart,

939
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,239
in my heart.

940
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,400
It will never change.

941
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,239
If you can't be with someone,

942
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,400
can we be friends?

943
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,080
What a profound question.

944
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,960
But if I like him,

945
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,080
I might not be able to be friends.

946
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,920
That's why

947
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,800
I don't like him anymore,

948
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,960
I think we can be friends.

949
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,400
Okay.

950
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,120
It makes sense.

951
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
When you like someone,

952
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,880
how can you be friends with him?

953
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,680
It's hard to control this level.

954
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,240
So I think

955
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,080
friends are friends.

956
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,680
That's impossible.

957
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,840
we've been friends for a long time.

958
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,600
Then one day, we were together.

959
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,480
In my world,

960
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,880
in my world.

961
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,360
She has a sense of boundary.

962
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,800
Or we knew each other before.

963
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,440
But we weren't close.

964
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,360
After we got to know each other,

965
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,840
it's quite suitable.

966
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,880
Or I like it.

967
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,880
I can date or something.

968
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,640
But if I

969
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
as a friend,

970
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,120
I can't.

971
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,760
Never.

972
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,520
Impossible.

973
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,880
The bottom line is very high.

974
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,520
I actually felt it at first sight.

975
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,840
I did feel it at first sight.

976
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,560
But I don't take the initiative.

977
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,600
I may not be able to

978
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,640
to give her emotional value.

979
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,960
I will consider many aspects.

980
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,280
But I think love is emotional.

981
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,920
It's not rational.

982
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,440
Maybe sometimes you don't have to think too much.

983
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,560
I should make some changes.

984
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,480
He's willing to change.

985
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,360
It's the best time for love.

986
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,880
They love each other.

987
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
But it seems that the soup

988
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,240
is a little bit careful.

989
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,320
Luckily, Susu is leading.

990
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,160
Susu is very sure.

991
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,880
Yes.

992
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,840
How do you understand that?

993
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,920
At my age,

994
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,600
I still think it's a very reliable way

995
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,080
is a very reliable way.

996
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,360
As friends, you know each other well.

997
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,960
Yes.

998
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,080
There must be a lot of things that resonate.

999
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,440
Just a little bit

1000
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,360
some parts.

1001
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,400
I want...

1002
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,360
I think it should be

1003
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,000
One day, I suddenly felt

1004
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,920
something happened.

1005
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,200
I was a little strange to you.

1006
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,840
My heart suddenly flutters.

1007
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,560
Yes, it is.

1008
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
You must have that feeling of heartbeat.

1009
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,160
You must have the foundation.

1010
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
You must have love.

1011
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,880
Yes, you must have the feeling of love.

1012
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,920
The feeling of heartbeat.

1013
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,160
This is very important.

1014
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,200
Speaking of liking,

1015
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,640
I think liking someone

1016
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,120
to me.

1017
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,880
Because I think

1018
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,960
can develop into love.

1019
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,400
I fell in love at first sight.

1020
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,880
For example,

1021
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,760
the girl I just met.

1022
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,960
Maybe at first sight,

1023
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,120
can be divided into liking and appreciation.

1024
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,960
For example, we take soup

1025
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,800
If he can play the piano,

1026
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,840
he might be playing the piano there.

1027
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,880
If I were a girl,

1028
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,480
the first time I saw him,

1029
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,240
I thought he was so cool.

1030
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
It can be divided into two situations.

1031
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,440
First, I admire

1032
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,480
when he plays the piano.

1033
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,640
not that I like him.

1034
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,560
Love makes your heart beat faster.

1035
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,040
Yes.

1036
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,320
How do you know what you like?

1037
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,680
I want to stick to her more.

1038
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,360
I want to be with her.

1039
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,520
I also fell in love at first sight.

1040
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,480
I'm not sure.

1041
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,320
After spending a long time with someone,

1042
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,480
you may fall in love again.

1043
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,920
How do you feel

1044
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,760
at first sight?

1045
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,000
I think this person is good. It's you.

1046
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,440
VE GREA is

1047
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:48,520
E GREAT

1048
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,000
GREA hit me.

1049
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,080
EGREA is you

1050
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,760
It’s you.

1051
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,160
EGREA 10 ring

1052
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,520
EGREA sauce ten ring.

1053
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,800
Actually, I'm kind of like Susu.

1054
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,920
I play straight.

1055
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,040
And

1056
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,440
I had some confessions.

1057
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,000
but they all failed.

1058
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,120
You failed.

1059
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,800
When I was young.

1060
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,360
I used to write letters when I was young.

1061
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,800
A love letter to you.

1062
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,000
I love you.

1063
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,120
Let's do it together. Hurry up. Don't waste time.

1064
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,360
He saw it and ran away.

1065
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,880
and put it in his desk.

1066
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,000
If you like me,

1067
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,760
there is a huge blackboard

1068
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,720
in front of our school.

1069
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,000
Promise me.

1070
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,560
If you don't like it, I'll make a cross.

1071
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,960
I'll check a big fork during class.

1072
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
That's too much.

1073
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,000
He has no EQ.

1074
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,120
Yes, when I saw it,

1075
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,080
It can be an idol drama.

1076
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,640
Yes.

1077
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,600
It's a story that no one believes.

1078
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,160
Yes.

1079
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,120
Let's go.

1080
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,200
Will you get off from me?

1081
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,840
Yes.

1082
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,600
Okay, let's go.

1083
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,200
He's not a gentleman.

1084
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,800
So cold.

1085
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,480
Why is there no snow here?

1086
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,160
I just wanted to say

1087
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,680
Can you stop stealing my lines?

1088
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,440
Right?

1089
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,160
Why isn't it snowing at all?

1090
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,000
Yes.

1091
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,880
He even left the door.

1092
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,440
Who is so sweet?

1093
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,240
So sweet.

1094
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,920
Yes.

1095
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,640
We're back.

1096
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,720
No one is talking to you.

1097
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,040
Shut up!

1098
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,080
When will Tu come back?

1099
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,120
He has something to do today.

1100
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,480
I'm leaving, Hua.

1101
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,960
Bye.

1102
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,640
Bye.

1103
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm leaving.

1104
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,920
Really?

1105
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,960
See you tomorrow.

1106
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,400
Bye.

1107
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,960
Come back early.

1108
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,720
Bye.

1109
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,880
See you tomorrow.

1110
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,680
It's ten o'clock.

1111
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,120
I'm texting you again.

1112
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,480
Will it change?

1113
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,640
Today is important.

1114
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,600
They're on a date.

1115
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,280
I know someone better.

1116
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,560
It used to be double arrows.

1117
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,880
In each episode,

1118
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
will be based on

1119
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,760
based on the content of our show.

1120
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,040
Free groups are divided into two teams.

1121
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,840
After the discussion,

1122
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,960
after discussion.

1123
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,640
The team with the most correct guess

1124
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,640
can get one

1125
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,840
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

1126
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,040
In the last episode,

1127
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,200
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

1128
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,000
The guests with the most votes

1129
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,440
will receive a mysterious award

1130
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,920
provided by Yuwo.

1131
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,160
Our deduction for this episode is

1132
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,920
Please guess the direction of the message.

1133
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,000
Let's get into

1134
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,800
of "Love Sisters".

1135
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,320
We need to regroup.

1136
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,360
and answer the questions.

1137
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,200
Black and white?

1138
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,760
Black and white.

1139
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,080
Black and white.

1140
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,800
You deserve it.

1141
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,840
I'm white.

1142
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,560
I'm black.

1143
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,440
The four of us.

1144
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,120
The three of us.

1145
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,520
Come on.

1146
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,920
Yang Gen, come here.

1147
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,720
Right?

1148
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,120
There's no controversy.

1149
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,680
Fatty will definitely give flowers.

1150
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,640
This or this?

1151
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,560
I'm sure.

1152
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,440
Yes.

1153
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,560
This won't change.

1154
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,760
Susu gives soup.

1155
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,880
But will Harry give it to Xiao Ling?

1156
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,000
But today they seem

1157
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,520
become friends today.

1158
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,280
But I think

1159
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,480
you're like Harry.

1160
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,440
Is he just doing what he's doing today?

1161
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,080
For example, happy.

1162
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,000
He might vote for Xiaoling.

1163
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,240
I think she might still

1164
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,440
still wants to keep the map.

1165
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,120
I think he still likes her.

1166
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,360
The map must be Xin.

1167
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,640
He's tempted.

1168
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,960
Zun is in a dilemma.

1169
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,840
Yes.

1170
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,760
Okay.

1171
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,880
Okay.

1172
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,840
So many people give Harry.

1173
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,080
I won't show you now.

1174
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,560
They are more complicated than ours.

1175
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,320
I think the plot is more interesting.

1176
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,800
Yes, ours is very complicated.

1177
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,640
Three, two, one. Come on.

1178
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,000
Please show the board.

1179
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
I don't think Su Su has any arguments.

1180
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,960
Harry got two votes.

1181
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,480
Xin got two votes too.

1182
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,600
We think Xiaoling gave Tu

1183
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,640
They think that's the only disagreement

1184
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,400
that Xiao Ling gave Harry.

1185
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,040
Next, we're going to

1186
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,560
the "Love Sisters".

1187
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,840
we'll have wild wine at the party.

1188
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,840
It's time to reveal the truth.

1189
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,840
Harry Potter is studying hard.

1190
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,240
I was just kidding.

1191
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,800
Soup.

1192
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,760
Can you hear more piano songs

1193
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,680
more piano songs next time?

1194
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,000
Why did I send it to him today?

1195
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,160
We had a date today.

1196
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,040
After our date,

1197
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,880
and get to know more about each other.

1198
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,440
Turn around.

1199
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,400
But my left face is pretty.

1200
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,240
I think some of his parts

1201
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,160
he's very careful.

1202
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,800
So I will send this message

1203
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,560
to him.

1204
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,440
I can't smile.

1205
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,080
The soup is in front of her.

1206
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,200
Let's order the song.

1207
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,240
I have to guess.

1208
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,640
I want to listen to more piano songs in the future.

1209
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,360
It's kind of like a forced song.

1210
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,200
Maybe I want to listen to "My Tears Smashed".

1211
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,360
Maybe

1212
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,080
I want to try it with you.

1213
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,360
Maybe.

1214
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,880
But I think you've sent me your messages.

1215
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,200
Isn't this what it means?

1216
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,440
It's still different.

1217
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,560
I think it may change in this moment.

1218
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,520
It's so hard.

1219
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,600
Only in this idol drama

1220
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,360
He's handsome and sensitive.

1221
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,840
(I had a great date today.)

1222
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,440
It's obvious who sent it.

1223
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,560
It must be Fatty.

1224
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,240
To Fatty.

1225
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,080
I hope we can have more contact and communication.

1226
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,080
It means we want to go further.

1227
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,600
I think it's Hua's message.

1228
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,120
I'm happy to see this message.

1229
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,240
Because I think

1230
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,960
is the same as mine.

1231
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,560
To Xiao Ling

1232
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,440
Thank you.

1233
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,720
A friend who makes me feel not awkward.

1234
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,320
I think it's probably from Harry.

1235
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,160
Because when we were eating,

1236
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,520
when we were eating.

1237
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,240
I'm not embarrassed to eat with you.

1238
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,080
That's the topic.

1239
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,120
We also talked about

1240
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,800
Look, Harry sent it to someone.

1241
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,120
to Xiao Ling.

1242
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,480
I texted her.

1243
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,920
I figured it out.

1244
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,800
Although it's a good impression,

1245
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,400
but there are many kinds of feelings.

1246
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,440
I think I can be

1247
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,040
with Xiaoling.

1248
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,000
So after the text I wrote,

1249
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,120
my friend.

1250
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:44,960
A very good friend.

1251
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,440
He always talks about friends.

1252
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,440
You're a very careful girl.

1253
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,520
I guess it might be a map.

1254
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,200
from Tu Tu.

1255
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,080
During our date today,

1256
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,320
we might have shared some things about me.

1257
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,880
The map is sensitive.

1258
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,360
So in his summary,

1259
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,320
maybe I'm a careful girl.

1260
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,360
Did he receive another message?

1261
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,960
When the message was sent,

1262
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,880
I didn't check my phone.

1263
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,920
I was thinking about something.

1264
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,520
What if it's about the guy from yesterday

1265
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,440
and the date today,

1266
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,560
Text me at the same time.

1267
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,320
What should I do?

1268
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,480
So I didn't dare to look.

1269
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,400
I didn't dare to look.

1270
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,200
What's wrong, Potter?

1271
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,400
You're thinking.

1272
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,400
But I don't know how to deal with it.

1273
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,280
He said Potter was actually talking to Susu.

1274
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,680
He said he's Harry Potter.

1275
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,440
So good.

1276
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,720
Two introverted people

1277
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,680
can talk a lot.

1278
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,320
I sent my message to Harry today.

1279
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,240
We had a good chat today.

1280
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,240
and relaxed today.

1281
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,520
And I want to express

1282
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,000
the feeling of today's experience.

1283
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,040
Why isn't my sandwich here today?

1284
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,480
Harry received the second message.

1285
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,040
I thought about it for a long time.

1286
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,720
I was a very tangled person.

1287
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,680
Later I thought

1288
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,320
Follow my heart.

1289
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,080
It's a text message that I understand.

1290
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,000
The person

1291
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,360
the guy who likes girls and boys.

1292
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:40,920
I think both of us

1293
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,080
are very sensitive.

1294
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,960
If his little head is smart,

1295
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,240
he should know it's me.

1296
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,000
When I saw it,

1297
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,160
I think it's the person from yesterday.

1298
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,640
sent it to me.

1299
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,320
I was happier subconsciously.

1300
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
She sent me this message.

1301
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,320
I feel a little disappointed.

1302
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,600
I'll try my best to make it up to you tomorrow.

1303
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,120
If it doesn't work,

1304
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,480
make ten sandwiches for her.

1305
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,720
I wondered why he was so charming.

1306
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,200
I don't understand.

1307
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,000
What are you doing?

1308
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,440
I'm quite unhappy.

1309
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,520
I thought

1310
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,040
if my brother hadn't received the text,

1311
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,520
I would laugh at him.

1312
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,760
But when he texted me,

1313
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,920
and told me

1314
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,680
We're brothers today.

1315
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,840
When I didn't receive the text,

1316
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,040
I felt quite uncomfortable.

1317
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,120
Maybe his shining point

1318
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,600
hasn't been discovered yet.

1319
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,600
At that time, I looked up at flowers.

1320
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,040
I felt that

1321
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,160
feel lonely.

1322
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,680
I can feel it right away.

1323
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,960
Maybe the map didn't receive the message.

1324
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,760
Today's message

1325
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,400
zero votes for the first time.

1326
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,760
We didn't receive the map this time.

1327
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,720
Harry received two votes.

1328
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,600
Let's see the answer between the two teams.

1329
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,640
Hello.

1330
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,520
You're all right.

1331
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,720
We're all right.

1332
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,640
right?

1333
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:37,600
Hua.

1334
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,720
We got one wrong.

1335
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,440
Each of us got

1336
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,440
the Wild Crest of Guoli.

1337
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,720
The biggest variable this time is

1338
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,640
Xin

1339
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,480

1340
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,320
I gave him

1341
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:54,960
I still gave it to him.

1342
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,760
I texted Harry.

1343
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,000
Huan Huan.

1344
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yes.

1345
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,560
It's good to play straight.

1346
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,600
Xin applied for today's siblings' room.
