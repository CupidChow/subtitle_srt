1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,160
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
It feels like there's a wild wine right away.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,080
It's as fluffy as a skull. It's refreshing and breathing.

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,200
Meixin battle.

5
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
I feel there's some wild wine right away.

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
It's as fluffy as a skull. The scalp will breathe.

7
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,840
Take part in it on Weibo #Love and Siblings

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
Go on Weibo. Participant #Love & Sister Sincere Protection Chart #exclusive game. You'll get a surprise reward.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is ours.

10
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,039
Come on. Come on.

11
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
Fatty.

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,720
Look.

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,840
Who will write for us?

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,440
Can one person write a lot?

15
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,759
Sit down.

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,280
I don't understand.

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
To Fatty, this is an invitation to a date.

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,240
I still think

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,640
between us.

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,000
So I hope there is another chance

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,960
to face each other.

22
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,080
I'm thinking about how I feel right now.

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,320
So I want to use this chance to forget it.

24
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,040
Whether it's happy or unhappy,

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,600
I have a chance

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,639
to measure my thoughts again.

27
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,800
I might be a little selfish.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
But this date

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,600
this date.

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,760
So I'll see you then.

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,720
I don't understand.

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,680
They don't know

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,800
their real feelings.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,280
Yes.

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,000
When I read this letter,

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
I was totally confused.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,840
She's still struggling.

38
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,280
She still wants to know more about Fatty.

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,640
and date Fatty.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,079
This behavior makes me confused.

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,360
Because one hour ago,

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,800
a very clear conversation.

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,400
In five minutes,

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,880
in five minutes.

45
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,960
I don't understand.

46
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,400
Let's go.

47
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,200
I don't think there's anything to talk about.

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,560
Neither of them can understand

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
They are still immersed

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,640
in the mood of the romantic house.

51
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,880
How did this happen?

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,920
I didn't expect that.

53
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,520
We are confused now.

54
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,600
Because our feelings

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,320
they didn't talk to each other last time.

56
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,840
Yes.

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,880
What we regret is

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,560
they shouldn't be

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:10,920
Yes.

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,080
So Hua means

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,200
to get rid of her brothers.

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,520
Let's talk face to face.

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,160
Actually, this is

64
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,640
a positive solution.

65
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,120
It means they have

66
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,280
between them.

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,960
Fatty and Xinxin.

68
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
They thought Hua

69
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,360
Hua has clearly rejected him.

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,560
But from Hua's point of view,

71
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,079
there are still many misunderstandings between me and Fatty.

72
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,160
haven't been resolved.

73
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,160
I'm looking for a chance to solve it again.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,120
Solo.

75
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,040
So Fatty

76
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,920
he thought

77
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,520
you rejected me last time.

78
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,320
This time, you wrote to me

79
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,200
to talk again.

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,160
I feel like I'm going back on my word.

81
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,320
You're ambiguous.

82
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,520
So he said he didn't understand.

83
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,079
Why is communication so complicated?

84
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,280
You're back.

85
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
You haven't eaten yet?

86
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,520
Let's eat.

87
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,160
Let's eat. I left some for you.

88
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,280
Tae-seo and Hwa-hwa are doing the dishes together.

89
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
She cried too.

90
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,160
It's not worth it for Fatty.

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,680
We are sincerely

92
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,880
with sincerity.

93
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,760
because there may be some misunderstandings,

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,240
Hua and I are also good friends.

95
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,040
I think good friends should play straight.

96
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,680
and talk to each other.

97
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,560
If she could tell me,

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,520
I wouldn't have such emotions.

99
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,360
You're back.

100
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,680
What's wrong?

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Xiao Ling has been

102
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,040
to comfort the crying.

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,920
and make them a tree hole.

104
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,880
I don't understand.

105
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,680
Let's go to Romantic House.

106
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,000
Hua has made it clear.

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,560
she's in contact with Tae-seo.

108
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,480
It also means

109
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,880
she doesn't care about Fatty anymore.

110
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
She's really getting to know Tae-ri now.

111
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,000
And the misunderstanding has been cleared.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
It means we've made things clear.

113
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,080
She wrote this letter to Fatty.

114
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,680
Date.

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
They must have different ideas.

116
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,400
But I don't understand.

117
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,160
I thought I was unnecessary.

118
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
I was still thinking when I came back,

119
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,240
because she cried at the map.

120
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,720
she must be very upset.

121
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,960
So I was wondering

122
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,080
if we were too harsh.

123
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,159
Because it's like three-on-one.

124
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,480
I'm afraid

125
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,159
what she would think.

126
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,680
So emotions

127
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,920
will change

128
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,640
will change.

129
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,440
Yes.

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,720
She said

131
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,400
I think I'm still thinking about my feelings.

132
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,520
Let's go on a date.

133
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,040
So let's have a good chat.

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
First,

135
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,400
you did show that you like flowers.

136
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,280
And Hua clearly said

137
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,960
she knew Fatty likes her.

138
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,520
But she said

139
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,240
she's talking to Tae-seo right now.

140
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,440
That means

141
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,080
I don't like you.

142
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,280
Stop texting me how you feel.

143
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,000
I didn't say anything else.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
That means you said it directly.

145
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,720
It means no.

146
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
And the end of our chat is refusing.

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,160
Then what did you write this letter for?

148
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,080
I'll get you some paper.

149
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,760
Don't cry.

150
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm so sad.

151
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,640
That's...

152
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,560
It's...

153
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,880
If

154
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,800
you are...

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
For example, when the four of us

156
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,200
sitting there and chatting,

157
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,120
you did say

158
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,640
you know Fatty likes you.

159
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,920
and you have feelings for Fatty.

160
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,240
And you do have feelings for Tae-ri now.

161
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,920
Can you explain your feelings?

162
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,280
How about consolation?

163
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,880
You are

164
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
You are

165
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
a reserved state.

166
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,280
Then you write this letter. Everything makes sense.

167
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,800
I can understand that you're in contact with her.

168
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,520
I don't think she likes Tae-ri either.

169
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,640
You know what?

170
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,840
But

171
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,520
she changed so fast.

172
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,880
I did have

173
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm not saying what to do.

174
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,680
Don't cry.

175
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,120
My eyes are swollen.

176
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,159
Why am I delusional?

177
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,240
Because she believed

178
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,000
the result of the conversation

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,120
you already refused.

180
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,200
She just said,

181
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,720
It's true that I'm meeting Tae-seo now.

182
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,520
But it sounds like

183
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,680
Yes, I like Tae-seo.

184
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,640
You're too sensitive.

185
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,080
This is your subjective cover.

186
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,840
You always want to

187
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
to express one thing

188
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,400
according to your own will.

189
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:51,880
Yes.

190
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,640
I find it's always like this when writing a paragraph.

191
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,760
When we're writing,

192
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,240
you always have to stand

193
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,200
a criticist.

194
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,640
Yes.

195
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880
It's not about others.

196
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,480
And

197
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,400
I remember once when I was

198
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,560
with my husband,

199
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
I said you're not

200
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,600
Well...

201
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,560
You didn't do so many things.

202
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,200
He said

203
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,480
don't believe your story.

204
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:07,840
Okay?

205
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Actually, he did a lot.

206
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,360
Don't believe in your own stories.

207
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
Yes.

208
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,400
Don't write so much and believe it yourself.

209
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,280
Your husband is amazing.

210
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,360
So funny.

211
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
He can tell.

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,760
Other husbands will be angry.

213
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,520
Cover it subjectively.

214
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,640
What are you doing?

215
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,960
What are you doing?

216
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,000
Rest.

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,400
What's wrong?

218
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,360
I have something to tell you.

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
The atmosphere between them is very happy.

220
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,679
Yes, look at that.

221
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,360
Look at this. Sweet.

222
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,559
Because when we were in the House of Feelings,

223
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,000
Harry suddenly told me

224
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,320
he received two letters yesterday.

225
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,680
He didn't know which one was yours.

226
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,720
When I went back,

227
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I wanted to say,

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,800
if you don't understand,

229
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,400
I'll explain it to you.

230
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,560
Do you know

231
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,640
that texted you yesterday?

232
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,280
I guessed for a while.

233
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,960
You guessed for a while.

234
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,640
And then?

235
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,680
You didn't guess it.

236
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,280
Yes.

237
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,200
I think so.

238
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,240
something to add.

239
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,920
Su Zihao guessed it for you.

240
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,720
You can't tell it at all.

241
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,920
I can see it.

242
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,480
But let me confirm with him.

243
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,800
Do you know what I mean?

244
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,280
Yes.

245
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,840
You do.

246
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,800
You don't even know which one I sent.

247
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,840
Can you understand?

248
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,040
I guessed it.

249
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,960
I'm scared. Let's go.

250
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:22,920
Fine.

251
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,440
Are you happy?

252
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,840
Are you happy to receive two letters?

253
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,560
No.

254
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,360
I just went to the siblings' house.

255
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,400
Because you read my letter.

256
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,040
No.

257
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
So sweet.

258
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,080
Okay.

259
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,880
Are you happy to receive two?

260
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,280
No, I'm sad.

261
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,960
Why?

262
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,600
Why are you so sad?

263
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,120
I don't know if I'm happy or sad.

264
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,600
Then you are happy.

265
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,760
Okay, it's okay.

266
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm fine.

267
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,280
No.

268
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,600
This is warm.

269
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,720
I think you can't understand

270
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,520
you don't understand what I mean.

271
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,720
Right? You didn't ask me.

272
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,880
I thought you wouldn't let me ask.

273
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,680
Really?

274
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,560
I'm afraid you won't understand.

275
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,200
So I'm here to tell you.

276
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,880
It's okay. I understand.

277
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,760
You understand everything.

278
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,680
I understand everything.

279
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,240
I think it was easy to understand the previous one.

280
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,800
I was very careless just now.

281
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,680
I wanted to see if I could take the letter.

282
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,160
I saw three letters from you.

283
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,240
So I came to ask you.

284
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,760
I really didn't mean it.

285
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,200
I took a look.

286
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,400
It's okay.

287
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,000
Maybe

288
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,400
my brothers are more popular.

289
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,280
I explained.

290
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,520
It's very natural.

291
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,600
Really?

292
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,080
Did you receive a letter?

293
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:31,960
Yes.

294
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,400
You only received one letter.

295
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,760
You received several.

296
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
No.

297
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,000
I received a letter.

298
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,920
Okay.

299
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,760
Okay, let's go.

300
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,920
Flower is very important.

301
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,480
This text...

302
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,760
Yes.

303
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,680
I'm observing both of them.

304
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,840
As for being friends,

305
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,520
I may not know how I feel.

306
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,480
I'm not feeling better.

307
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm still thinking about my feelings.

308
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,840
if I can contact her again.

309
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,200
I don't know who to send it to. Can I not send it?

310
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,120
She really has no choice.

311
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,080
Yes, because she

312
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,320
She's always sending messages.

313
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,280
You're so sneaky, Harry.

314
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,600
I don't date anyone.

315
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,640
I laughed

316
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,800
I feel secure.

317
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,080
The moment I received her text,

318
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
I was happy.

319
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,520
I still sent the message to Harry.

320
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,520
In the letter today,

321
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,280
in the letter today.

322
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,880
So in today's message,

323
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,120
I criticized

324
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,160
I mocked his letter.

325
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,880
I said

326
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,360
Even kindergarten is better than yours.

327
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,680
In the letter he wrote to me, he said

328
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,600
he wanted me to only receive his letter.

329
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,000
He didn't want anyone to go on a date with me.

330
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,160
So I texted him

331
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
in that text message.

332
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,200
I said I only received your letter.

333
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,640
That's why I don't date anyone.

334
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,200
It's like giving him an answer.

335
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,680
He really wrote an essay about his childhood friend.

336
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,400
I know Tata.

337
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,760
I'm very happy to receive the text today.

338
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,160
Since the night of siblings,

339
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,920
my text messages are very long.

340
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,880
I promised her

341
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,080
I'll write an essay to her friend.

342
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,800
I'll definitely keep my promise.

343
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,440
I think as long as she is happy.

344
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,640
I received

345
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
from him.

346
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,120
The day before yesterday, I told him

347
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,280
he wasn't emotionless.

348
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,640
And today,

349
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,160
a lot today.

350
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,360
And the emotions are good.

351
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,240
Very thoughtful.

352
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,720
He must be recording

353
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,560
all day.

354
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,200
What we've been through together.

355
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,520
Today, I sent my message to soup.

356
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,280
The first sentence I sent was

357
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,840
is from

358
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,440
a line

359
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,360
a line from a drama.

360
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,120
When I run to the moon,

361
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,240
I hope the moon is running towards me.

362
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,480
What I want to say is

363
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm trying to overcome my personality

364
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,640
and trying to get close to you.

365
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,520
I hope you can give me the same feedback.

366
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,920
In my opinion,

367
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,840
when I'm approaching you,

368
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,600
even if

369
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,560
who doesn't approach others,

370
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,480
I hope you'll be different from me.

371
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,760
One more thing.

372
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,640
I like flowers.

373
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,600
I prefer white roses.

374
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,360
I think she might be saying

375
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,680
the letter I wrote to her.

376
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,440
In his letter,

377
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,760
I'm like a white rose.

378
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,080
Because on our date,

379
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,520
he did give me white roses.

380
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,440
She likes white roses.

381
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,640
It means

382
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,920
the flowers I chose

383
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,240
has different meanings.

384
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,200
So similar.

385
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,720
soulmate.

386
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,640
And he knows her.

387
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,160
Yeah.

388
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,120
I'll keep working hard.

389
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,480
I won't give up easily.

390
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,240
Thank you for your encouragement and support.

391
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,640
I'm willing to

392
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,680
with you in this winter.

393
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,880
The soup is going to write an essay.

394
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,520
A successful leading lover.

395
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,840
Yes.

396
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,440
Because I read her letter.

397
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,960
I wanted to give her a good response.

398
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,800
I don't want her to think her letter was written in vain.

399
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:01,920
After reading it,

400
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,000
I couldn't help laughing.

401
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,720
Actually,

402
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,200
I just came out of the siblings' house.

403
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,280
I'm just shy.

404
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,440
I can't calm myself down.

405
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,480
So in bed

406
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,000
listening to the song.

407
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,400
I think it's quite cute.

408
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,200
His message today

409
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,360
as a feedback for the letter.

410
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,560
I'm quite happy.

411
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,200
I did work hard.

412
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,640
work hard.

413
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,760
It feels like I got the correct feedback.

414
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,960
Two warriors of pure love.

415
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,600
received

416
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,040
Xiaoling sent it to me.

417
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
The person I sent is the map.

418
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,079
I added a fake number.

419
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,000
The expression of Big D.

420
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,880
Like this.

421
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,560
Just send him a message.

422
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,880
Tell him I'm here.

423
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,440
I want to send him this kind of message.

424
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,319
I was worried

425
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,079
I was afraid that people would see my sad side.

426
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,720
But after she came,

427
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,680
I can let go of myself.

428
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,079
my sense of security and shame.

429
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,000
to share

430
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,760
my feelings and process.

431
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,120
After I told her,

432
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,320
I felt much relieved.

433
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,600
I think Xiaoling

434
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,160
is the only one

435
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,400
who can let my guard down

436
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,080
who can communicate

437
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,840
who can communicate with.

438
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,720
I wrote a lot of words in the letter.

439
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,680
Remember to read it repeatedly.

440
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,520
The text is quite obvious.

441
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,280
It's just a picture.

442
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,680
He said I would comfort him when he was crying.

443
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,520
He said he would be touched.

444
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,680
Then he said,

445
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,240
although his piano talent is average,

446
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,120
I can't beat him in five-piece chess.

447
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,880
How many rounds did we play?

448
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,760
I didn't beat him.

449
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,520
Then he became proud of it.

450
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,800
That's why I said this is the map.

451
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,840
I sent it to Xiaoling today.

452
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,400
I think

453
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,920
the way I get along with Xiaoling

454
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
understand each other

455
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,120
and understand each other's emotions.

456
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,320
Just like family.

457
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,720
Am I fat?

458
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,280
Fatty.

459
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,960
I'm surprised. Two letters.

460
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,840
I guess it's Fatty.

461
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,720
Because I lost to him

462
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,480
I lost to him.

463
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,920
So I think Fatty sent it.

464
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,000
I think Fatty sent me this message.

465
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,480
Maybe he and Hua

466
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,000
are not going well.

467
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,080
Maybe he doesn't know who to send it to.

468
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
I sent my message to Xiaoling.

469
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,440
It's about ping pong.

470
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,120
Just kidding. If you win her,

471
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,520
Tell her to keep up the good work.

472
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,160
We're just friends.

473
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,080
My feelings.

474
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,520
It's called friendship.

475
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,920
Is this Terri style?

476
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,400
I texted Hwa today.

477
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,200
I sent you to take care of your health and Guoli.

478
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,080
I'm texting "Take care of yourself."

479
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,600
I know she's not feeling well these days.

480
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,040
I want to express my concern for her.

481
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,800
Hua, this is very important.

482
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,640
Fatty, I guess so.

483
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,680
I'm hesitant

484
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,560
between the two boys.

485
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,880
I follow my heart.

486
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,840
I only respect my own choice.

487
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,960
Fatty.

488
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,000
She follows her heart.

489
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,240
I was very confident.

490
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
Hana did give me

491
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,560
a lot.

492
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,000
between the two,

493
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,160
her real expression

494
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,560
whether she wants to be someone

495
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,040
or someone who can explain.

496
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,360
I think it makes sense.

497
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,440
The remote control

498
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,600
is in the girl's hands.

499
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,440
it's fine.

500
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,000
She gave it to Tae-ri again.

501
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,400
I've been getting to know you these days.

502
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,800
I talked to Fatty this afternoon.

503
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
It seems that the misunderstanding hasn't been resolved.

504
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,120
So I wrote it to him.

505
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,320
I hesitated.

506
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,640
So I want to

507
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,440
alone for one more day.

508
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,960
and confirm your feelings.

509
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,320
This may be a bit selfish,

510
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,720
but I still want to tell you honestly.

511
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,000
she's being sincere.

512
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,520
Really.

513
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,160
I'm not hiding anything.

514
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,720
Obviously, it's blossomed.

515
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,560
This is the longest text

516
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,720
for so many days.

517
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,120
Because she explained

518
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,400
why I didn't

519
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,800
I didn't go to the romantic house.

520
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,920
and why they didn't give me the letter.

521
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,880
Maybe before I came here,

522
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,440
before I came here.

523
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,560
There might be

524
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,880
between them.

525
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,960
When you see it,

526
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,200
Please understand.

527
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,720
I sent my message to Tae-seo.

528
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,600
It says clearly in the message.

529
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,360
Before he came in,

530
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,880
I've been in touch with Fatty.

531
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,800
with Fatty.

532
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,160
But there was a misunderstanding between me and Fatty.

533
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,400
So I told Terri

534
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,920
my current state

535
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,760
I'm observing both of them.

536
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,880
No problem.

537
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,640
Very honest.

538
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,000
That's good.

539
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,280
So I think I can be sure

540
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,120
I can be sure

541
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,440
what I really want.

542
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,040
Since you want to write to me,

543
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,680
and go on a date with me,

544
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,480
Text me how you feel.

545
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,440
You're so good at apologizing.

546
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,320
Please apologize to me.

547
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,880
No.

548
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,320
She kept sending it to Tae-seo.

549
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,480
She didn't send a message to express her feelings.

550
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,080
Take it to apologize

551
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,520
You don't use it to express your love.

552
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,560
Give me an explanation.

553
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,680
This is Hua.

554
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,800
I wrote this message.

555
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,560
I didn't care about Fatty.

556
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,840
whether Fatty or not.

557
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,560
I hope one more time

558
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,600
with Tarri and Fatty

559
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,720
each of you

560
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,200
for each other.

561
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,840
so that I can understand my feelings.

562
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,360
Because I think both of them

563
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,640
haven't released

564
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,480
to me.

565
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,000
I have to find it myself.

566
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
How much

567
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,880
my feelings for them?

568
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,640
They are so different now.

569
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,200
Too much.

570
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,520
Not the wrong position at the beginning.

571
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,400
It's completely off.

572
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,480
My brother didn't receive any message from you.

573
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Our ignorance has reached the top.

574
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,360
After talking,

575
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,880
Then write a letter

576
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,240
Then send a message.

577
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,640
I feel like I'm getting along with three girls.

578
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,600
Well,

579
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,400
I don't understand.

580
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,920
What are you doing?

581
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,040
I want to talk to Tae-seo.

582
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,120
Talk to him.

583
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,640
Did you know

584
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,040
I was in contact with Fatty?

585
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,080
Didn't you tell me?

586
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,560
Fragrant juice wine.

587
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
I didn't contact Fatty on the first day.

588
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,040
I only met Fatty the next day.

589
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,960
We went to the supermarket together.

590
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,080
Then we got along.

591
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,800
And we had our first date.

592
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,280
After the first date,

593
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,560
the two of us

594
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,440
still have feelings for each other.

595
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,040
The feelings and texts

596
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,440
to each other.

597
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,680
Maybe we think we get along too fast.

598
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,800
We had a chat.

599
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,920
We said we hope we can

600
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,680
to get to know more about other girls.

601
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,120
He said OK.

602
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,840
That's what I told him.

603
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,120
and he listened.

604
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,280
That morning,

605
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,320
he got the letter.

606
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,560
He gave it to Xiao Ling.

607
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,080
After the sports day,

608
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,920
he also sent it to Xiao Ling.

609
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,440
That's normal.

610
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,720
Because he stays with her every day.

611
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,080
Yes.

612
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,360
They went on a date too.

613
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
When he came back, he said

614
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,400
he made something for Xiaoling.

615
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,200
Then I thought

616
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,600
Maybe, right?

617
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,320
Then you came in.

618
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
We came in by accident.

619
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,240
I came in again.

620
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,840
I played all day.

621
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,360
Because we

622
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,640
had a day of fun.

623
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:13,960
right?

624
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,720
I think it's good.

625
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,840
And he said

626
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,280
He said he liked his first date.

627
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,240
or the second date?

628
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,320
So sharp.

629
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,600
They communicate well.

630
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,720
She's very sincere.

631
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,800
You're really...

632
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,240
My answer is the same.

633
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,520
I said I liked the second date.

634
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,480
That day,

635
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,720
when we watched the footage together,

636
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,640
I asked him who he sent it to today.

637
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,080
He said you didn't know?

638
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,880
I said, "How do I know?"

639
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,920
Then I didn't answer.

640
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,240
The text I sent you that day was...

641
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,520
I know. I remember.

642
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,560
Then I saw

643
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,040
Fatty didn't receive my message,

644
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,200
before he got my message.

645
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,680
I'm Tu Tu to comfort him.

646
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,920
because I gave him a signal.

647
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,600
he thought

648
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,760
I'm texting you about my feelings.

649
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,960
Then I asked Tu to chase him.

650
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,320
Both sides.

651
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,400
Yes, he has a point.

652
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:58,760
So I think

653
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,840
I should tell you today.

654
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,120
I think you wrote a letter to me.

655
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,880
But

656
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,800
I didn't reply.

657
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,120
I'm sorry.

658
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,600
It's okay.

659
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,680
But I know

660
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,360
Through this lesson,

661
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,680
I think we need to make it clear.

662
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,480
She doesn't want the bad information anymore.

663
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,440
If she's sincere, I'll tell her everything.

664
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,040
Yes.

665
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,880
When you didn't receive my letter,

666
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,920
You mean

667
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,880
when I didn't receive your letter?

668
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,640
when I didn't receive your letter?

669
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,520
Are you?

670
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,400
A little.

671
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,560
I went to see

672
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,160
Because

673
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,720
you're the only one who can give it to me.

674
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,880
I got it when I went to get it.

675
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,920
Then I came out.

676
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,640
What else can I do?

677
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,320
What should I do?

678
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,520
But you still chose

679
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,760
to send me your message.

680
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,400
Yes.

681
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
Good job.

682
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,600
Tae-seo is still nice and pure.

683
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,680
This is preference.

684
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,360
Maybe Tae-ri

685
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,880
a little bit.

686
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,080
I was disappointed.

687
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,680
Because I didn't receive the letter.

688
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,760
I wanted the atmosphere to be happier.

689
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,320
Relax.

690
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,800
I don't want him

691
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,440
not to be unhappy after receiving my letter.

692
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,160
But in my opinion,

693
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,280
I might be a little overwhelmed.

694
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,000
But maybe

695
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
he's a mature man.

696
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,680
Maybe...

697
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,440
It's good.

698
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,520
I won't burden you.

699
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:08,880
Yes.

700
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,600
Hua asked me to explain this alone.

701
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,640
About the romantic house and the envelope.

702
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm quite surprised.

703
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,960
But I'm definitely happy inside.

704
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,640
I have to tell you what I think.

705
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,680
And you can also

706
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,000
change yourself according to my thoughts.

707
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,600
You want me to contact other girls again?

708
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,240
I didn't.

709
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,680
Yes.

710
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
I don't.

711
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,600
Yes.

712
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,960
I didn't say that.

713
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,240
Then why

714
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,600
what did you tell me

715
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,200
What did you say?

716
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,480
You won't get a chance if you don't contact him now.

717
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,840
Because time is almost over.

718
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,400
It's been so many days.

719
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,840
That's true.

720
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,880
I don't want to touch anything.

721
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,080
I would have done it sooner.

722
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,480
Let's go.

723
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,200
Let's go.

724
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,160
I think Tae-seo digests it well too.

725
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,720
I gave her enough sense of security.

726
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,240
I want some honey.

727
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,520
What do you want to drink? I'll make it for you.

728
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,640
What do you want to drink?

729
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,960
What do you want to drink, Yinbo?

730
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,280
They are sweet.

731
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,000
Yes, they are transparent.

732
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,640
What do you want to drink?

733
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,600
No need. I just want some water.

734
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,400
Drink some water. I'll get it for you.

735
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,240
What are you doing?

736
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,640
I'll get you some water.

737
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,720
You want hot or cold?

738
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,760
or honey water?

739
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,360
Honey lemon

740
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,800
You really ordered

741
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,640
Make some.

742
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,440
Since you said so,

743
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,520
Why should I be polite to you?

744
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,280
Don't mention it.

745
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,240
Okay.

746
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,440
Are you really going to Beijing?

747
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,720
So you really want to come to Beijing?

748
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,760
Shanghai?

749
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,800
Really?

750
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,600
Sure.

751
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,760
The bag is here to pick you up.

752
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,360
Okay.

753
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,040
Look, I feel so secure.

754
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,840
Let me help you.

755
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,160
I'm not used to it.

756
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,360
I'm afraid you'll be agitated and nervous.

757
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,680
More. It’s not that sweet.

758
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,360
Let me help you, Yinbo.

759
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,680
What are you doing?

760
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,840
I kept chasing him and shouting.

761
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,040
Yinbo.

762
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,800
Pour him some water.

763
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,000
To make him happy,

764
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,520
I’ll do something I can do.

765
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,320
Can I beat you, Yinbo?

766
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,080
Say something if you win.

767
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,240
What if I win?

768
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,760
Let's make a bet.

769
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,680
Do whatever you say.

770
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,280
I promise.

771
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,080
They're so relaxed.

772
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,320
Sweet.

773
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,840
What are you two doing?

774
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
I walked five steps.

775
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,040
I won the five-piece game.

776
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,640
I'll set up the formation.

777
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,080
Just tell me if you want me to make a request.

778
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,040
You don't have to.

779
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,800
No, do it again.

780
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,040
I'm going to laugh to death.

781
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,480
I didn't.

782
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,200
I just set up the formation.

783
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,840
Set up the formation?

784
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,080
I'm really setting up the formation.

785
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,760
Do you want me to...

786
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,600
Of course not.

787
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,840
Yinbo.

788
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,680
Yinbo.

789
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,360
Bobo, be cute.

790
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,440
Why did you lose?

791
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,040
Okay, go ahead.

792
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,320
There's no water.

793
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,360
I'm thirsty.

794
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,080
Add some honey

795
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,080
Okay.

796
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,880
I feel

797
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,840
They gave me the good mood.

798
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,040
So sweet.

799
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,360
I will pour it for you whether I lose or not.

800
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,120
You lost on purpose.

801
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,680
Thank you.

802
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,200
Yes.

803
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,360
I knew you were going to add water.

804
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,680
I saw it.

805
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,040
Because I was playing a game.

806
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,520
I lost. Pour him some water.

807
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,080
I think the atmosphere

808
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,400
we get along.

809
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,120
Yinbo.

810
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,600
This...

811
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,040
What else do you want to eat?

812
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,720
I'll use mine first.

813
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,280
What do you want to eat?

814
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,360
This one.

815
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,280
Come on.

816
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,480
The process of playing five-piece chess

817
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,200
our relationship

818
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,120
for us.

819
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,920
Flowers too.

820
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,560
Yeah.

821
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,280
OK, Yinbo.

822
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,120
Let me get you some water.

823
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,280
How is it?

824
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,240
I feel relaxed and happy.

825
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,280
I almost stepped on you.

826
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,080
It's okay, Yinbo.

827
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,960
I won’t blame you even if you step on me.

828
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,880
In this way,

829
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,160
give them a relaxing environment.

830
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,680
Great.

831
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,000
Good night, Yinbo.

832
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,480
See you tomorrow.

833
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,920
Good night.

834
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,720
In fact,

835
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,440
because she's afraid that others will be unhappy.

836
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:50,960
Yes.

837
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,880
So she keeps trying to find Terri, Fatty,

838
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,560
to explain the whole story.

839
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,880
Hua is

840
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,120
to Bobo.

841
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,680
Because

842
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,080
even if I didn't write you the letter,

843
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
even if

844
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,320
I had feelings for you and didn't choose you.

845
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,560
You chose me firmly.

846
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,960
Yes, you've been choosing me.

847
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,040
But in the process,

848
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,320
I was unfair to you.

849
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,440
I feel guilty.

850
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,000
Yes.

851
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
So you have the right to know

852
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,520
what happened to me.

853
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,120
I need to tell you this.

854
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,040
so that you won't misunderstand or get hurt.

855
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,080
But look.

856
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,680
Flower versus Fatty may be

857
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,120
resistance mechanism.

858
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,880
Their chemistry is different.

859
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,760
Yes, because she felt that

860
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,240
more theoretically.

861
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,320
I've walked two steps forward.

862
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,040
Why aren't you going?

863
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,320
This kind of request

864
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,360
Question.

865
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,760
Yes.

866
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,480
Tarri.

867
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,560
Every time Hua talks,

868
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,880
he would listen carefully.

869
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,400
Yes.

870
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,480
She and Fatty

871
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,640
are really going to fight.

872
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,600
Really

873
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,680
It's like I'm trying to make it quick.

874
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,360
It's a secret text again.

875
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,960
Please keep it a secret.

876
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,720
Tomorrow, you will go on a date

877
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
with the person you love.

878
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,160
But the two siblings

879
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,120
can only have one date.

880
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,960
Please make your choice now.

881
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,440
Should I go on a date or not?

882
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,280
and reply.

883
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,600
Don't discuss with your brothers during the process.

884
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,800
Don't tell your brother about your choice.

885
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,720
So this is what it means.

886
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,480
He used a letter

887
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,960
with a sincere letter.

888
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,480
and confirmed his feelings.

889
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,520
If you have a date,

890
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,720
you have to complete

891
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,840
the second choice of love and family.

892
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,520
It's easy to vote for each other.

893
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:24,800
Yes.

894
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,520
So it depends on how they balance each other.

895
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,920
Should I ask my brothers to go on a date?

896
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,080
Or do I have to go on a date?

897
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,320
When I saw that text,

898
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,040
I felt that

899
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,720
I may have another chance

900
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,840
to have more contact with Hua.

901
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,680
more.

902
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,320
So I chose this date.

903
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
With this confidence.

904
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,320
I can only choose whether I go on a date.

905
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,680
And I chose

906
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,440
to go on a date.

907
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,560
I'll think

908
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,719
Harry will go on a date too.

909
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,360
If you decide to go on a date alone,

910
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,840
you can choose again.

911
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,800
Of course.

912
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,480
Definitely send it once.

913
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,360
I'll send it to a date.

914
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,320
That text said

915
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,120
if both of them choose not to go on dates at the same time,

916
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,840
neither of them will go on a date.

917
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,920
But if both of them choose to go,

918
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,400
there's still a chance to choose again.

919
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,120
Then I choose to

920
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,480
Right?

921
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,719
At least I'll see if she's going.

922
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,800
If she doesn't, I'll go directly.

923
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,560
Isn't that better?

924
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,840
Susu and Harry are difficult.

925
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,120
Yes.

926
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,480
Because both of them are sweet.

927
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,000
They both want to go.

928
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,920
I think Harry and Tata

929
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,239
have had a deep conversation.

930
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,840
And I think

931
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,360
I don't talk to soup

932
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,560
with soup soup.

933
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,360
So I thought

934
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,280
I should fight for this chance.

935
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,000
We're all going.

936
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,440
No.

937
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,600
I thought about the second text.

938
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,960
I thought a lot.

939
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,800
Tata has no siblings.

940
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,760
So she will definitely go.

941
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,440
She must go.

942
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,120
I don't think she'll be with Tae-seo.

943
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,560
I'll think about

944
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,760
How should I explain to Tata?

945
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,680
Will Tata be mad at me?

946
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,400
I was in a dilemma.

947
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,680
In a relationship,

948
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,880
I don't like people who are indecisive.

949
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,320
I like you for choosing someone firmly.

950
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,880
And the Tata letter also mentioned

951
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,040
what I said.

952
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,080
Then I chose to go.

953
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,800
Although I know

954
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,840
my brothers

955
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,240
fight for this chance.

956
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,680
But I just...

957
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,280
Okay, you try. I'll try too.

958
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,480
and see who will get it.

959
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,360
If it doesn't work, then don't go.

960
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,160
They are quite interesting.

961
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,760
So annoying.

962
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,720
I really...

963
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,040
I want to kill Su Ziyi now.

964
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
She smiles like a killer.

965
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,840
We bumped into each other.

966
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,440
I'm speechless!

967
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,640
I'm speechless.

968
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,960
You are really

969
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,800
I really...

970
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,880
So cute.

971
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,640
I love watching love-hate

972
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,400
So cute.

973
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,240
Seriously.

974
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,400
So funny

975
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,760
Who knows family

976
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Really

977
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,560
I haven't had a date for a long time.

978
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,520
I want to go on a date.

979
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,000
Let's order.

980
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,640
Shut up.

981
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,040
I haven't been on a date for a long time.

982
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,320
I'm so tired.

983
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
I hesitated for the third time.

984
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,840
whether I should go

985
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,200
give this opportunity to him.

986
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,000
I think Harry and Tata

987
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,640
Maybe after they

988
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,600
after they left the house

989
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,120
after leaving the house.

990
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,160
The soup and I are stuffy and slow to warm up.

991
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,040
I should fight for this chance.

992
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,480
I think my brother will give way.

993
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,640
I thought about it.

994
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,400
I think our relationship

995
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,920
is a step closer

996
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,520
than my sister and soup.

997
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:33,960
I said,

998
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,440
Fine.

999
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,840
Give my sister a chance.

1000
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,160
Great.

1001
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,560
Good boy.

1002
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Look, he gave way.

1003
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,200
Applaud for Harry.

1004
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,160
It depends on them.

1005
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,440
I think sister will let him go.

1006
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,920
I think so too.

1007
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,800
My first reaction is

1008
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,560
I want to make Tom happy.

1009
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:53,960
I think

1010
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,320
he should spend more time with Susu.

1011
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,200
because they had a quarrel two days ago.

1012
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
But when I said

1013
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,200
when I didn't go on a date,

1014
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,600
I deleted it again.

1015
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,920
To be honest, I really want to go on a date with Tu.

1016
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,080
I think...

1017
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,400
But after thinking about it,

1018
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,920
I still

1019
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,680
I'm not going on a date.

1020
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,200
I feel a little sad.

1021
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,080
But I still pressed it.

1022
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,520
Because

1023
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,760
I think when I choose between the two,

1024
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,160
I think I will put Tom

1025
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,320
in the first place.

1026
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,640
No way.

1027
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,680
To me,

1028
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,320
no one is more important than Tom.

1029
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,040
He should be able to guess.

1030
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,560
Don't give up at the same time.

1031
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,400
Think for others.

1032
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,320
I want her to go.

1033
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,800
But I don't think she'll choose her.

1034
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,240
She knows it so well.

1035
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,560
I do think she will choose me. I don't want to go.

1036
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,600
And I think

1037
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,760
I don't want both my sister and I to choose. I don't want to go.

1038
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,400
So I chose I want to go.

1039
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,120
He knows you too well.

1040
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,000
Yes, he knows each other well.

1041
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
What?

1042
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,880
Are you going on a date?

1043
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,600
Go.

1044
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,720
Okay?

1045
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,040
I'm going to wash my hair again.

1046
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,040
That's bad.

1047
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,120
I'm going to be a sinner forever.

1048
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,680
But it's okay.

1049
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,800
Maybe she understands.

1050
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,480
I think you can explain to her.

1051
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,600
Because I know

1052
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,360
he must have had a huge psychological fight.

1053
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,880
Because he has to think about what Tata will think.

1054
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,760
So I'm very grateful

1055
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,160
Harry gave me this chance.

1056
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,200
My choice is to let my sister go.

1057
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,520
I think she needs this chance

1058
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,400
more than me.

1059
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,440
This is so touching.

1060
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,480
In this part,

1061
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,920
we have such a tacit understanding.

1062
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,160
I think he will let me...

1063
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,680
She's not here?

1064
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,160
He just went there.

1065
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,760
When I saw that brother choosing between the two,

1066
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,480
I knew Xinxin wouldn't go.

1067
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,360
Actually,

1068
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,400
Whether I go or not is in my hands.

1069
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,280
I choose not to go.

1070
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,320
Hua asked him out.

1071
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,440
He refused to communicate directly.

1072
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,280
He chose me

1073
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,200
and chose me to go on a date.

1074
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,720
I texted Tae-seo when I came back.

1075
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,480
I'm more angry than I like him now.

1076
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,040
I know Fatty very well.

1077
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,920
If he wants to go on a date,

1078
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
I chose not to go on a date

1079
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,320
I chose not to go on a date.

1080
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,480
his date will be a success.

1081
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,760
What are you doing?

1082
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,800
Who is it?

1083
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,320
Me.

1084
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,080
Don't you have anything to tell me?

1085
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,760
I want to know.

1086
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,520
I want to tell you

1087
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,560
I'm the only one who's going on a date.

1088
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,320
Really?

1089
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,880
Then what?

1090
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,000
Because I chose not to go on a date,

1091
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,480
so you two can go on a date.

1092
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,240
Is it possible?

1093
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,240
Am I not important?

1094
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,360
I gave up my happiness.

1095
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,760
Indeed, I'm a man.

1096
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,120
But I want to know

1097
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,000
how many letters

1098
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,320
How many letters did you receive today?

1099
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,520
One.

1100
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,480
Liar.

1101
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,360
Swear.

1102
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,520
I swear.

1103
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,160
Okay.

1104
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
I swear.

1105
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,120
Okay.

1106
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,280
Bye.

1107
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,320
Let's go.

1108
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,440
Just enjoy it secretly.

1109
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,440
Yes.

1110
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,040
Harry gave up.

1111
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,400
She cried.

1112
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,880
Tata.

1113
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:00,920
What's wrong, Guolifang?

1114
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
I don't know.

1115
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:02,920
Why are you crying?

1116
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,280
What's wrong?

1117
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
What?

1118
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Just because my brother is not here,

1119
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,160
It's okay.

1120
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,120
Look.

1121
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,800
Yes, because her siblings are not here.

1122
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,440
No.

1123
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,520
It's okay.

1124
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,560
In the end,

1125
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,240
I could only be chosen or given up by Harry.

1126
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,640
And I don't have the initiative.

1127
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,720
So I cried

1128
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,040
The bigger reason is

1129
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,840
my own siblings were not around.

1130
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,200
I was alone

1131
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,360
alone.

1132
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,200
Anyway, I felt wronged at that time.

1133
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,840
Don't cry.

1134
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,920
Harry is with her at home.

1135
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,840
Yes, don't be so fragile.

1136
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,320
Zun, you...

1137
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,000
Dirty.

1138
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,800
When I saw her,

1139
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,720
her state and her eyes.

1140
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,880
I feel a little sad and guilty.

1141
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,640
I don't know why

1142
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,920
if I can go.

1143
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,120
We quarreled.

1144
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,080
We've been here for a long time.

1145
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,960
Yeah, I don't know what you're doing.

1146
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,240
I didn't know

1147
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,080
this would happen.

1148
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,920
But crying has nothing to do with Harry.

1149
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,520
It's because of his siblings.

1150
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,040
Yes, I feel lonely.

1151
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,040
No.

1152
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,040
We should need Harry to hold us now.

1153
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,800
There are wrinkles.

1154
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,040
The more you cry, the more like Molly.

1155
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,080
It's swollen.

1156
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,160
I feel so wronged.

1157
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,840
Go up.

1158
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,800
Oh no.

1159
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,200
She's ignoring you, Harry.

1160
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,320
Why is she ignoring me?

1161
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,160
She's crying.

1162
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,440
His mouth is pouting to the sky.

1163
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,480
What are you doing?

1164
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,280
So cute.

1165
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,600
We feel so wronged.

1166
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,360
Sorry.

1167
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,560
It's not your fault.

1168
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,760
I'm sorry.

1169
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,560
Don't be angry.

1170
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,760
I'm not mad at you.

1171
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,640
Because the rule is

1172
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,360
I posted the first two times

1173
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,840
that I'm going on a date.

1174
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,320
I'm not mad at you.

1175
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,040
I know.

1176
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,000
If I post the last time

1177
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,520
I'm going on a date,

1178
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,040
we can't go on a date.

1179
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,480
See? I knew it.

1180
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,600
And I think my sister

1181
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,200
won't change.

1182
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,680
Because...

1183
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,320
You don't have to explain.

1184
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,280
They didn't do that.

1185
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,360
That's the reason.

1186
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,640
I know I'm not mad at you.

1187
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,600
Normally,

1188
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,240
I'll give this date to my sister.

1189
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,160
Because I think our relationship

1190
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,040
between us.

1191
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:25,840
Right?

1192
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,680
What are you doing?

1193
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,280
What?

1194
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,880
Are you unhappy?

1195
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,280
No.

1196
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,840
It's not your problem.

1197
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,840
Is it my problem?

1198
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,160
I have to explain it to you.

1199
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,200
Let me tell you.

1200
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,600
Why are you so unhappy?

1201
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,160
So unhappy?

1202
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,120
No.

1203
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,120
I feel like I'm going to cry.

1204
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,400
I did.

1205
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,560
Really?

1206
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,360
Where did you cry?

1207
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,440
Crying in front of others makes me

1208
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,160
in your sister's arms.

1209
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,920
and cry in front of others.

1210
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,240
It's like I'm bullying you.

1211
00:46:59,240 --> 00:46:59,840
You know?

1212
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,720
Why?

1213
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,120
Because I'm helping her.

1214
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,000
She's the "sinner".

1215
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,320
OK?

1216
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,360
I'm not...

1217
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,960
I don't think

1218
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,000
this choice.

1219
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,520
I think there's something wrong.

1220
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,520
Are you telling her not to go?

1221
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,520
No way.

1222
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,480
If I was in a hurry,

1223
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,840
I told you not to go.

1224
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,000
Keep choosing.

1225
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,600
Don't go.

1226
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,680
Don't even think about it.

1227
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,840
They communicate well.

1228
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,680
Wear a coat and go out for a while.

1229
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,680
Kiss.

1230
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,120
Is this what we can see?

1231
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,080
I paid. Why can't I see it?

1232
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,640
What can't my members see?

1233
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,640
They really want to go

1234
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,840
where there are no cameras.

1235
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,120
Right now.

1236
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,240
when he came to talk to us,

1237
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,240
I didn't think he wanted to go on this date.

1238
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,680
I don't understand.

1239
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,440
I don't think he came at that time.

1240
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,520
in front of my room.

1241
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,240
Yes, aren't you in my room?

1242
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,680
He doesn't really want to go on this date.

1243
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,520
Don't you think so?

1244
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,480
I don't think so.

1245
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,520
You think too much.

1246
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,440
What do you mean?

1247
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,960
Just now, we chose one from the two.

1248
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,040
the members of the cabin

1249
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,400
by their actions.

1250
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,360
the importance of brothers in their hearts.

1251
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,000
I think communication is still important.

1252
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,560
In the whole episode,

1253
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,760
after the whole episode.

1254
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,840
We have a lot to talk about.

1255
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,680
Yes.

1256
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,240
The communication between couples

1257
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,000
the communication between brothers

1258
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,320
seem to communicate smoothly.

1259
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,000
Actually, nothing is a problem.

1260
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,440
Because both sides are facing it together.

1261
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,280
But if the communication is not smooth,

1262
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,560
no matter how excited you are,

1263
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,920
it may stop the communication

1264
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,400
due to the obstruction of communication.

1265
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,200
So I found that

1266
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,520
it's really hard

1267
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,600
to become a character.

1268
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,480
Because you have to

1269
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,320
to be tied.

1270
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,520
Then you can

1271
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,840
and even more.

1272
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,920
Because the rhythm is the same.

1273
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:42,880
Yes.

1274
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,920
So I hope we can understand

1275
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,080
the importance of communication.

1276
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,280
Here

1277
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,320
I really found the flow of the house is faster.

1278
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,040
Yes.

1279
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,280
continuously

1280
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,120
The so-called conflict and progress

1281
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,000
From the perspective of the bystander,

1282
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,800
we really hope the members

1283
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,280
we can think about

1284
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,080
face your heart.

1285
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,320
Don't miss it

1286
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,080
because of

1287
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,160
that could have been created.

1288
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:05,760
Yes.

1289
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,320
The confidence of our next show

1290
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,240
is about to start.

1291
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,720
What happened

1292
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,760
What happened?

1293
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,040
And the relationship between

1294
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,440
and Tarri,

1295
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,240
with Tae-seo?

1296
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
Let's look forward to next week's show.

1297
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,120
Let's

1298
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,120
Love Sisters

1299
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,160
Double the love.

1300
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,960
Have you thought of going on a date with me today?

1301
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,680
Yes.

1302
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,160
Xiao'er wants to be happy forever.

1303
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,320
Okay.

1304
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,360
OK, Yinbo.

1305
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,120
Make yourself for me.

1306
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,480
Stay with you for me.

1307
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,600
You're back.

1308
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,800
How did it go, Tom?

1309
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,560
Great!

1310
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,240
Okay.

1311
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,320
I didn't feel it.

1312
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,560
He didn't say much in total.

1313
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,480
and took a photo for you.

1314
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,080
No.

1315
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,920
He's playing with him.

1316
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,680
I'm a little upset.

1317
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,440
I think he doesn't want to continue.

1318
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,400
Hush.

1319
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,560
Susu, are you eating?

1320
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,240
Is it that serious?

1321
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:17,040
Every Thursday at 18:00, Members enjoy the reproduction of "Sibling Defense Diaries".
