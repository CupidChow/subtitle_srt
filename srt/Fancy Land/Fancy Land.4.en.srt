1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,200
You were the one who sent me to the mental hospital back then.

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,040
Have you forgotten?

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,080
Shut up.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,560
Shut up.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,400
What are you afraid of?

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,560
I've already told her everything.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,400
She has the right to know the truth.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
You have no right to control her life.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
I'm begging you.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,480
Please, stop talking.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,600
Mom.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
You really haven't changed at all.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,480
Do you think running away and hiding things will solve the problem?

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,440
Coward.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,080
Don't you think you owe me a lot?

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,400
I have no idea what you're talking about.

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,640
You're crazy.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,440
You ruined me, Li Xiulan.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,600
Will you let me explain?

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,600
Please, listen to my explanation.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,960
What's the point of listening to your explanation?

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,480
No, it's not what you think.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,960
It's not like what you think.

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Not like what I think?

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,960
You have to understand,

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,280
this is my first time being a mother too.

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,960
I didn't know what I should do back then.

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
I didn't know what to do.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,960
You didn't know what to do as a first-time mom,

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,360
so you hurt me?

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,720
No, no, no.

32
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,080
It's easy for you to say.

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,720
You're just selfish.

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,320
You only care about yourself.

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,920
No, no, that's not true.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,120
Do you think she's selfish?

37
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,640
She watches you every day like you're a criminal.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,280
She doesn't want you to grow up.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,560
She keeps you tightly in her grasp.

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,960
How is this any different from me being locked in a mental hospital

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
What's the difference?

42
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,440
And those pills you take every day,

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,760
do you even know what they're for?

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,360
Epilepsy.

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Mom says if I don't take them, I'll get anxious,

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,320
tremble,

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,040
and bite my own tongue.

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
She's lying to you.

49
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,720
You're the only one who believes her nonsense.

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,920
Come on.

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,000
Take your medicine.

52
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,360
It's time, you need to take your medicine.

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,640
Take it.

54
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,520
You have to take your medicine.

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,080
Good girl.

56
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,280
Good girl.

57
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,080
Take your medicine.

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,360
Take it.

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,080
Open your mouth.

60
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm fine now, I don't want to take it anymore.

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,920
Be good.

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,800
You have to take your medicine every day.

63
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,440
Why should I listen?

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,560
I don't want to take it.

65
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,360
I'm sleepy.

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,560
Let's go, Yanyan.

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,920
Tonight I'll sleep with you.

68
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,880
Follow-up news on the case investigation

69
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,920
Zhang was found inside the auto repair shop

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
and had been dead for some time when discovered

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,160
The body was found by an employee of the shop

72
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
After receiving the report

73
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,360
the police arrived at the scene immediately

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,160
and began their investigation

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,160
Currently

76
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,800
the police are conducting an in-depth investigation into the case

77
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,560
The exact cause of death

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,160
and details of the case have not yet been released

79
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,000
However, it is understood that

80
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,440
the police have questioned the employees of the auto repair shop

81
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
as well as people in the surrounding area

82
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,280
to look for clues. What's wrong?

83
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
to find leads

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,360
It's nothing

85
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,160
Come

86
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,080
Lean forward

87
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
We will continue to follow the progress of this case

88
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,200
and bring you the latest updates

89
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,280
Come

90
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,360
Sit down

91
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,000
It's okay now, Mom

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,000
The clothes are washed

93
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,600
I'll go hang them up

94
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,560
I'll go hang them up

95
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
You go sit in the living room

96
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,560
Your hands can't touch water

97
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,480
Come

98
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,200
How is it? Is your hand okay?

99
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,200
It's fine

100
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,600
Take your medicine

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,600
Drink up, it's time for work.

102
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,720
What are you looking for?

103
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm just tidying up a bit.

104
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,040
Are you looking for this?

105
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,880
It fell into the gap by the washing machine.

106
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,880
How did you manage this?

107
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,080
Please

108
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,560
don't come looking for me again.

109
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,000
Aunt Lan

110
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,640
If your daughter is like you

111
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,200
and can't remember anything,

112
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,040
then I'll have to tell her about the past.

113
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,040
Don't push me.

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,600
I'm capable of anything.

115
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,640
It's none of your business.

116
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,000
You've made a mess of everything.

117
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,360
I really can't feel at ease.

118
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,080
You don't need to worry about it.

119
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,560
Useless coward.

120
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,480
Please leave my house.

121
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,000
This is my house too.

122
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,280
Mom.

123
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,320
Alright, that's it for today.

124
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,920
Okay.

125
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,200
Please confirm.

126
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,360
Captain Qin.

127
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,600
Gu Nan is here.

128
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,720
He says he has information about the crime scene to report.

129
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,480
Let's go.

130
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,200
August 1st.

131
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,440
Did you go to Shuntu Auto Repair Shop?

132
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,640
That was several days ago.

133
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
I don't really remember.

134
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
What, is fixing a car a crime now?

135
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,200
What time did you go?

136
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,600
What time did you leave the scene?

137
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
A little after eight, I think.

138
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,480
I left right after I finished the maintenance.

139
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,440
Did you know Zhang Xiaochuan is dead?

140
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
I saw it on the news.

141
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,240
You left Wucheng on the 2nd. Where did you go?

142
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,680
My mom wasn't feeling well.

143
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,920
So I went home to check on her.

144
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,720
But I knew you were looking for me.

145
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,240
That's why I came over right away.

146
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,000
As far as we know,

147
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,360
you go to Shuntu Auto Repair Shop every week.

148
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,720
What kind of car needs maintenance every week?

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,600
What was your relationship with Zhang Xiaochuan?

150
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,480
Oh, that's what you're asking about?

151
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes, it's exactly the kind of relationship you're thinking of.

152
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,120
Don't laugh.

153
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,560
Just answer the question.

154
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,680
I did answer.

155
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,040
Officer Qin, do you have to be so harsh?

156
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,160
I came here just to tell you

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,680
I really don't know how Zhang Xiaochuan died.

158
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,360
I didn't see anything.

159
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240
He was fine when I left.

160
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,240
Was there a third person at the repair shop that day?

161
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,160
No.

162
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,280
Is that all?

163
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,160
Recently, some parents have raised concerns.

164
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,160
During the observation of the choir class,

165
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,280
your performance in class was not good.

166
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,960
Why aren't you saying anything?

167
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
I'll pay attention.

168
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,080
Our cultural center

169
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,960
is now actively transitioning towards commercialization.

170
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Look at all the different classes out there nowadays.

171
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,160
They're not big in scale,

172
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,040
but they have plenty of students.

173
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,720
And they charge high fees.

174
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
It's tough for me too.

175
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,480
If your class

176
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,040
has fewer than eight students,

177
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,720
I think we shouldn't run it.

178
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,200
The fees collected aren't even enough to cover the electricity bill.

179
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,160
What happened to your hand?

180
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,400
It's nothing, it'll be fine tomorrow.

181
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,720
If it's nothing, come here.

182
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,360
Play something for me.

183
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,360
Come on.

184
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
Play a piece.

185
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
How about this instead?

186
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,040
Let's play together.

187
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,960
You use one hand, I'll use the other.

188
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,960
I'll coordinate with you.

189
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,040
How about it?

190
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,920
Look at you.

191
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,160
You're really careless.

192
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,280
The performance is coming up soon.

193
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
With your hand injured,

194
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
you won't be able to play then.

195
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,080
Are you saying

196
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,160
I should go on stage with you?

197
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,400
Honey, I'm on my way home.

198
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,520
Tell Xiaobao that Daddy will be home soon.

199
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,400
Get up.

200
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,640
Come here.

201
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,040
Were you bullied?

202
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,040
No.

203
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,520
So you weren't bullied.

204
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,840
What's the use of crying?

205
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,400
Can crying solve the problem?

206
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,040
You put up with everything all day long.

207
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,080
Who feels sorry for you?

208
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,960
Li Yan.

209
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,920
You have to learn to grow up on your own.

210
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,800
You have to protect yourself.

211
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,040
Do you understand?

212
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,960
It's okay now.

213
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,600
Captain Qin, you didn't go home last night?

214
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,280
I'll open the window for you.

215
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,160
What's wrong?

216
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,400
Come here first, you—

217
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,040
Help me, help me—

218
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,280
Put the medicated patch on for me, come on.

219
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,720
Be gentle.

220
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,840
Sorry, sorry.

221
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,800
Seriously.

222
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,720
Captain Qin.

223
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,840
I carefully went over it last night.

224
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
The details of the case.

225
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,360
Can you listen and see if I got it right?

226
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,720
Okay, go ahead.

227
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,600
So, Gu Nan—

228
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,960
She knows Lin Yi killed someone.

229
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,960
She sensed

230
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,400
Lin Yi's anger at being cheated on.

231
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,160
She was worried she'd be the next to be killed.

232
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,600
That's why she ran away overnight, right?

233
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,840
Then why did she come back?

234
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,960
She must have something on Lin Yi.

235
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,280
Sorry.

236
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,600
Are you done?

237
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,280
Yes, yes.

238
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,960
Right, what was I saying?

239
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,840
She must have something on Lin Yi.

240
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,480
Their marriage is already like this.

241
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,160
There's no need to keep going.

242
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,840
But Lin Yi has money.

243
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,040
If Lin Yi really did the killing,

244
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,600
she could blackmail him.

245
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,040
And Lin Yi totally seems like

246
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,600
someone with a huge ego,

247
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,920
maybe even

248
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,520
a bit of a pathological type.

249
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,720
Not bad.

250
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,160
You're making progress.

251
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,400
But Lin Yi has an alibi.

252
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,400
So...

253
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,400
Then why did she do all this?

254
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Is she trying to cover for someone?

255
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,520
Didn't you tell me last time

256
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
that you wanted to learn something?

257
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,160
Let me tell you,

258
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,800
you can't learn just by being taught by others.

259
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,840
Experience is the best teacher—once is enough.

260
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,600
Captain Qin, what's up?

261
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,400
There's a case from the traffic police.

262
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,160
They want us to take a look.

263
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,400
What's going on?

264
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,960
Aunt Lan.

265
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,000
Long time no see.
