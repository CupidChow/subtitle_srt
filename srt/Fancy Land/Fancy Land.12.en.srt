1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,800
The sky is dark, it's going to rain.

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,200
Grandpa lifts his hoe to dig for taro.

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,520
Digging and digging.

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,520
He digs up a swirling drum.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,440
Oh, summer is truly fun.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,760
Mom.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,800
You'll always stay by my side, right?

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,080
That's right.

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
What's wrong, sweetie?

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,720
Tell Mommy.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,920
Is someone bullying you at kindergarten?

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,240
Sweetie.

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,440
Mommy will always protect you.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,040
No matter what happens,

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,680
Mommy will always be by your side.

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,000
The sky is dark, it's going to rain.

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:34,320
Grandpa lifts his hoe to dig for taro.

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Is that Wang Guocheng?

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,560
Run!

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,960
Wang Guocheng, stop right there!

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,280
Stop!

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,040
Stop running, do you hear me? Still running?

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,920
Stop running!

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,400
Stop!

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,680
Still running?

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,760
Why are you running?

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,680
Officer.

28
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,600
You were chasing me, of course I ran.

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,400
If you have nothing to hide, why run?

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm fishing legally.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,160
All my documents are in order.

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,320
Why are you chasing me?

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,040
Where is Li Xiulan?

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,400
You mean Li Xiulan from the market?

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
Go look for her at the market.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Wang Guocheng, are you playing dumb with me?

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Still pretending not to know.

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,400
Let me tell you,

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,680
We already know about your relationship.

40
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,240
Your vehicle information—

41
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,240
we've already checked it.

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,120
Who did you buy these things for?

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,240
I'll ask you one last time.

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,760
Where is Li Xiulan?

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,400
Captain Qin.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,480
There's nothing.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,880
Officer.

48
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,760
I really don't know where Li Xiulan is.

49
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,760
I don't know either.

50
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,400
Why are you looking for Li Xiulan?

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
But what I can say for sure is

52
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,880
her whole family are good people.

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,680
They're just unfortunate.

54
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,240
They've never done anything

55
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,600
against conscience or morality.

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,400
You absolutely can't wrongly accuse any good person.

57
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,760
Wang Guocheng.

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,680
It's not up to you to decide who's good.

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
Nor is it up to me.

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,120
Where's the car?

61
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
Where is your car?

62
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,120
Police notice: looking for license plate number

63
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,960
Wu A7N636.

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,520
You must be tired. Get some rest first.

65
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,880
Once we leave the city in a bit,

66
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,960
let's find a place to rest properly.

67
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,320
Mom.

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,960
Am I a burden?

69
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Why would you ask that?

70
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,040
My mind isn't good.

71
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,880
I always forget things.

72
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,320
You're so busy and still have to take care of me.

73
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,680
You've never been a burden to me.

74
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
If I watch over you a lot,

75
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,680
it's not because I don't trust you.

76
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,160
You've already done very well.

77
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,600
As a mother,

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,840
there's always endless worry about her child.

79
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,040
You'll understand in the future.

80
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,720
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,120
Hello

82
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
All the roads out of Wucheng

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,320
have been blocked by the police.

84
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,000
If you don't want to get caught, don't leave the city.

85
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Who are you, really?

86
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,720
Who is it, Mom?

87
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,400
You, wait for me in the car.

88
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll be back soon.

89
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,560
Yanyan

90
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,440
Yanyan

91
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,040
Yanyan

92
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,720
Yanyan

93
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,240
Yanyan

94
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,400
Li Yan

95
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,120
Mom

96
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,720
Where did you go?

97
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,240
I just went to buy some food.

98
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,600
Let's go.

99
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,520
Mom

100
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,160
Come with me.

101
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,720
Mom

102
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,600
Are you angry?

103
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,040
Mom's not angry.

104
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,400
You must be hungry.

105
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,160
Come, sit.

106
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,040
Let's see what we should eat.

107
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,320
Let's get this and this, that's enough.

108
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,320
Wait a moment.

109
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,520
Boss, this one.

110
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,280
And this one.

111
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,840
That's enough, Mom, we can't finish it all.

112
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,960
It's okay.

113
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Let's order a bit more.

114
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,600
Mom is hungry too.

115
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,280
Boss, this one.

116
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,160
Alright.

117
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,320
Thank you.

118
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
You don't have any dietary restrictions, right?

119
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,240
No, I don't.

120
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,840
Alright.

121
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Please hurry up.

122
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,960
If you're hungry, have some meat.

123
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,480
Vegetables.

124
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Mom, you eat too.

125
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,640
Delicious.

126
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,360
You know,

127
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,960
you don't need to be rich and powerful.

128
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,080
As long as you're safe and happy, that's enough.

129
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,480
Remember to lock the doors and windows before you go to bed at night.

130
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,360
And make sure to take your medicine on time.

131
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,160
If it's hard to get your prescription,

132
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,600
remember to ask Uncle Wang for help.

133
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,360
Oh, right.

134
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
If you're not happy working at the youth center,

135
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,600
then just quit.

136
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,480
Come here.

137
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
And don't go selling fish either.

138
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,360
That job is messy and not suitable for you.

139
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,280
Let's just wait for now.

140
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm here, I won't run away.

141
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
I want to turn myself in.

142
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,280
Yanyan.

143
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,920
Mom saved two hundred thousand for you.

144
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,720
Didn't you say you wanted to open a music store?

145
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Use all of it to open your shop.

146
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,640
What do you mean, Mom?

147
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,600
Listen to me.

148
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,720
This is Mom's bank card.

149
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,160
The password is your birthday.

150
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,360
Oh, and

151
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
your insurance policy is in there too.

152
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,360
I put everything together.

153
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,520
Take it out when it's about to mature.

154
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,280
Otherwise, the interest won't be worth it.

155
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,160
Did you remember all that?

156
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
What's the password?

157
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,720
My birthday.

158
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,040
Okay.

159
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,360
Okay.

160
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,480
Remember to take out the insurance.

161
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,800
Come.

162
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,360
Have some soup.

163
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,920
Li Xiulan.

164
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,360
You are suspected of killing Bai Tao.

165
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,360
And kidnapping Bai Fan.

166
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,000
We are now placing you under criminal detention according to the law.

167
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,400
Please come with us.

168
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,840
Mom.

169
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,800
Wait, Mom!

170
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,280
Boss, the bill please.

171
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,600
Alright.

172
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,160
No.

173
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,520
Why are you putting her in handcuffs?

174
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,520
Mom, they must have made a mistake.

175
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,080
Let's go.

176
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,280
Mom.

177
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,280
Li Yan.

178
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,040
You also need to come with us to the station.

179
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,920
She doesn't know anything.

180
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,080
Please cooperate with our investigation.

181
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,360
I'll go with you.

182
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,080
Okay.

183
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,800
Mom, Mom

184
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,200
Foot

185
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,200
My mom

186
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,400
I haven't had the chance to buy shoes for my mom yet

187
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,160
My mom's shoes are coming apart

188
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,960
Mom

189
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
Calm down, Mom

190
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Mom, calm down, don't get worked up

191
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,400
Calm down

192
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,840
Mom

193
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,600
Don't get upset, Mom

194
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,960
Mom, you took my shoes

195
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,640
Mom, the shoes

196
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,280
Yanyan, Yanyan, don't make a fuss

197
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,600
Mom is fine

198
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Mom, walk slowly

199
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,640
You won't fall

200
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,480
Mom promises you

201
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,040
Walk slowly

202
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,040
From 7 to 9 p.m. on August 9th

203
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,040
Where were you?

204
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,520
I was probably on my way home.

205
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,360
I had finished work at that time.

206
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,160
Did you have any contact with Li Xiulan during that time?

207
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,040
I was the one who tied her up.

208
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,200
Why did you kidnap Bai Fan?

209
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,280
What was your motive?

210
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Personal grudge.

211
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,360
Where is she now?

212
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,280
Do you know that Bai Tao is dead?

213
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,720
Li Xiulan, you need to understand

214
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,480
we won't arrest you without evidence.

215
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,080
Under Bai Tao's fingernails

216
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,840
we found human skin tissue.

217
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,200
We need to take a sample from you for testing.

218
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,400
Come in.

219
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,520
Captain Qin.

220
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,920
Li Xiulan's attorney is here.

221
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,040
Captain Qin.

222
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,320
Long time no see.
