1
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,560
Five little monkeys jumping on the bed

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,360
One fell off and bumped his head

3
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,200
Mama called the doctor

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,280
The doctor said

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,120
No more monkeys jumping on the bed

6
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,880
Four little monkeys jumping on the bed

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,720
One fell off and bumped his head

8
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,560
Mama called the doctor

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,560
The doctor said

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,400
No more monkeys jumping on the bed

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,960
Three little monkeys jumping on the bed

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,600
You really didn't have to come

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm here to watch my child perform

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,320
Do I need your permission for that?

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,800
Mama called the doctor

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,920
The doctor said

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
No more monkeys jumping on the bed

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,560
Two little monkeys jumping on the bed

19
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,320
One fell off and bumped his head

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,120
Mama called the doctor

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,240
The doctor said

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,280
No more monkeys jumping on the bed

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,760
I never noticed before

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
This teacher is actually quite pretty

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,600
One little monkey jumping on the bed

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,960
I knew it

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,920
Why did you take on

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,400
such a thankless case

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,400
So you had another motive

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,960
Once our divorce is finalized

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,280
we'll have nothing to do with each other

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,320
So I hope you take care of yourself

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,360
Don't push your luck, okay?

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
I'm starting to regret it

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,560
This divorce happened way too quickly

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,240
If I'd known, I would have waited

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
and made you suffer a bit more

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,680
Really?

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,840
It's this teacher.

40
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,960
Yeah, yeah, the one whose mom killed someone.

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,480
Come on, come on.

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,520
Come.

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,840
Look, that's the one.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,960
Come on, her mom is a murderer.

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,680
And she...

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Come on, come on.

47
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,240
Hello, Lin Nian's mom.

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,480
Lin Nian's dad.

49
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,520
Hurry, hurry, come here.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,120
Stand in the middle.

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,040
Alright, alright, alright.

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,600
Come on, everyone stand properly.

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,520
Come on, give a smile.

54
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,120
Come on, look to the front.

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Come on.

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
Yes, everyone look here.

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
What are you looking at?

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,600
You're so distracted.

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,400
Why are you looking at me? Look at the camera.

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,040
Okay, everyone look this way.

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,600
Three, two, one, cheese!

62
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,520
My little cutie sang so well today.

63
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,320
Lawyer Lin.

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,240
Take the child to the car and wait for me.

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,400
Nian Nian, let's go.

66
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,120
Captain Qin.

67
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Isn't the team busy today?

68
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,400
How do you have the leisure to come watch a show?

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,120
Just sneaking a break from work.

70
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,840
We're not machines, after all.

71
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,880
I just wanted to come and nurture my spirit.

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
And look for some inspiration.

73
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,720
Balancing work and rest is a good thing.

74
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,280
I envy you, Lawyer Lin.

75
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
You have a harmonious family.

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,440
Actually, Gu Nan and I are divorced.

77
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,880
From now on, I don't want to force myself for appearances.

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,840
Or make myself suffer.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,160
Did you come alone, Captain Qin?

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,400
Didn't bring a female companion?

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
If you need one,

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,560
you can let me know.

83
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I can introduce someone to you.

84
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,440
No need for that.

85
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,280
After all, Lawyer Lin's taste

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,960
isn't that great either.

87
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,320
Okay.

88
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,440
Alright, I'll tell Captain Qin.

89
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,320
Captain Qin, good news.

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,120
There's progress in Zhang Xiaochuan's case.

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,040
Gu Nan's bank card has been received.

92
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,440
The five million transferred by Lin Yi.

93
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,880
It should be hush money from Lin Yi.

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,160
We have reason to suspect

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,880
that Gu Nan is just a proxy for Lin Yi

96
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
to hold shares in Shuntu Auto Repair Shop.

97
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,440
What husband could accept his wife cheating

98
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,280
and still give her a large sum of money?

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
Just now, Lin Yi told me

100
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,320
that he and Gu Nan are divorced.

101
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,160
He could easily explain this money

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
as post-divorce property division.

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,760
Given Li Xiulan's personal income level,

104
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,840
she couldn't possibly afford to hire Lin Yi.

105
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,440
And Lin Yi doesn't need this money at all.

106
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,560
So why did he take this case?

107
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,640
The performance was quite successful.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,880
I'm happy for you.

109
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,560
I've envied you since we were kids.

110
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,760
Unfortunately, I just don't have that talent.

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,640
How did you know Mom killed Bai Tao?

112
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,440
Are you willing to believe me now?

113
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,440
Whether I believe you or not is my own decision.

114
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,440
You just need to tell me

115
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,160
how you knew about Bai Tao's death.

116
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,320
And why did you lead me

117
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,720
to discover Bai Tao's body?

118
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,440
Go ask Li Xiulan.

119
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,880
Bai Tao fell by accident.

120
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,760
It wasn't murder.

121
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,440
Do you believe that?

122
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,560
Mom wouldn't lie to me.

123
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,880
She hasn't lied to you enough already?

124
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,040
Her father raised her alone.

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,320
When we lived in Shigang County,

126
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,560
Li Meng was the neighbor's child.

127
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,480
Her mother passed away early.

128
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,760
Her dad raised her by himself.

129
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,920
She would sometimes suddenly say

130
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,480
"Mom."

131
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,200
To drive me away,

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,880
she lied to you, saying I once wanted to kill you.

133
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,480
I know all of this.

134
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,880
Because she fears everyone who knows the truth.

135
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,880
Li Xiulan not only killed Bai Tao,

136
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,000
she also killed Zhang Xiaochuan.

137
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,880
As long as she isn't locked up,

138
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,200
more people will die.

139
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,000
She wants to get rid of me

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
not to protect you,

141
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,360
but because of me.

142
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,280
Because I am the stain on her life.

143
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,800
She would rather send her own daughter

144
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,120
to a mental hospital

145
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,000
just to erase her own stain.

146
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,440
Do you think someone like that

147
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,400
deserves to be a mother?

148
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,320
Lawyer Lin

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,440
I didn't know what you like

150
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,960
so I bought a bit more

151
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,760
This is for Nian Nian

152
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,880
Coincidentally, I also have something for you

153
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,640
Please come in

154
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,000
Open it and take a look.

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,880
Sorry about that.

156
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,880
I must have scared you.

157
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,800
Auntie isn't home today.

158
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
No one is here to cook.

159
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,320
Can you cook?

160
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,880
Lawyer Lin,

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
I want to visit my mom.

162
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,640
Can you help arrange it?

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,960
Li Xiulan is suspected of a criminal offense.

164
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,640
Family visits are not allowed during detention.

165
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,080
If you have anything

166
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,240
you want to say to her,

167
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,200
I can consider passing it on for you.

168
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I want to eat fish.

169
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,120
Can you cook it?

170
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,440
I can.

171
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
In my mom's situation,

172
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,560
if it's considered self-defense,

173
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,000
how long would it take for her to be released?

174
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,560
That's hard to say.

175
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,200
It depends on whether I want to pull some strings.

176
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,640
And whether I can use my connections.

177
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,240
My mom's health isn't very good.

178
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,440
I'm afraid she won't be able to handle being inside.

179
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,120
Can you help me?

180
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
I still prefer the prouder version of you.

181
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,640
It reminds me of when we were kids.

182
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,400
Do you really not remember anything?

183
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,200
I thought you would

184
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,400
never forget me for your whole life.

185
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,880
I don't really understand what you mean.

186
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,200
Then I'll make you understand.

187
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,520
Do you still remember?

188
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,120
We were eighteen that year.

189
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,000
The first time I met you,

190
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,560
I just knew

191
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,320
I would never forget you in this lifetime.

192
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
You were quietly playing the piano.

193
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,000
You looked so beautiful, it felt unreal.

194
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,400
I was instantly captivated by you.

195
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,560
I thought it was just a beautiful encounter.

196
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,640
But I didn't expect

197
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,760
fate would bring us even closer.

198
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,440
Following this fate,

199
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,120
we got together.

200
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,640
Soon after,

201
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,400
your mom found out about us.

202
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:37,880
Mom.

203
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,520
She was very angry.

204
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,440
Mom, go back.

205
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,400
No.

206
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,280
She was firmly against us being together.

207
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,040
I'm not going in.

208
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,160
Go in, go in.

209
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,920
Mom.

210
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Let me out, I want to go out, Mom.

211
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,400
Mom.

212
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,320
I thought

213
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,440
you would be as determined as I was

214
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
to resist

215
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,280
to resist everything

216
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,000
that tried to keep us apart.

217
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,640
But I didn't expect you to give up.

218
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,080
You chose to leave my world with your mom.

219
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,000
Without saying a word.

220
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,880
Do you know how happy I was

221
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,040
when I saw you again this time?

222
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,720
I really don't remember.
