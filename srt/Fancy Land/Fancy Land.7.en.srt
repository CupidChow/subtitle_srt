1
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,760
Get in the car.

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
You scared me to death.

3
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,800
Didn't I tell you not to go out?

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,280
Nothing happened, did it?

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,480
Didn't I say not to go out?

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,880
Did you go see Li Xiulan?

7
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,960
You idiot.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
You have a life on your hands.

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
Do you know that?

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,480
There's a boat leaving tomorrow night.

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,880
The captain is a relative of my patient.

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,480
I once saved his wife's life.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,720
Tomorrow, go with him to Southeast Asia and lay low.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How many times have I told you?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,320
I'm not going, I'm not going—I'll go.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,960
If you don't go, what do you want to do?

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,000
Can you just stop making me worry?

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,280
How did I end up with such a fool for a child?

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,440
Just like your useless father.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,360
You're both worthless.

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,640
If you want to die, fine.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,440
I'll send you to prison right now.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,640
Say that again.

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm not worthless.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,080
Not worthless.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm not worthless.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,840
Do you know what this is?

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,760
Let me tell you.

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,400
Your son, me—

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,280
I'm about to make it big.

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,800
When that happens, none of you can look down on me.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,960
No one can look down on me.

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,560
Here.

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Let's go.

35
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,680
Keep up.

36
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,120
Come.

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
That's what bad guys do.

38
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,440
Bad guy.

39
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,200
What did you put in Yanyan's house? Calm down.

40
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,600
Calm down, calm down.

41
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,680
Did you see a bad guy

42
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,040
putting something through this door?

43
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,840
A bad guy put something through the crack in Yanyan's door.

44
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,600
Have we met before?

45
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,760
At Bai Tao's funeral.

46
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,960
You forgot? You knocked over the wreath.

47
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,040
I helped you pick it up.

48
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Do you remember?

49
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,040
What's wrong?

50
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,640
What time did you come back today?

51
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
We just got back not long ago.

52
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,640
Did you notice anything unusual?

53
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,360
Was there any change at home?

54
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,360
No.

55
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,640
According to a witness,

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,640
someone put something through the crack in your door.

57
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,800
Put something in.

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,920
Who?

59
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,080
Me.

60
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,520
It wasn't me, someone else did it.

61
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,240
Did you receive anything?

62
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,480
No.

63
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,600
Mom.

64
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,200
What's this?

65
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,520
It's nothing, go wash up.

66
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,640
We're getting ready to eat.

67
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,760
Boss, I want to ask you about someone.

68
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,640
See if you recognize this person.

69
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,640
Never seen them, don't know them.

70
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,520
Never seen them.

71
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,600
Boss, come here.

72
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,080
Okay.

73
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,080
Then please take a look.

74
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,920
Have you seen this person before?

75
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,360
No.

76
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,600
What do you guys do?

77
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,160
Police. Please cooperate.

78
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
Please take a look.

79
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,360
Okay.

80
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,320
This one.

81
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I've seen this person.

82
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,040
She came here a few days ago.

83
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,680
She was asking about the adult store across the street.

84
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,920
Boss, give me a pack of soft Chunghwa cigarettes.

85
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,200
Alright.

86
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
The adult store across the street—

87
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,920
Why hasn't it opened?

88
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,520
No idea.

89
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
Haven't seen the owner for several days.

90
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,920
Do you need something from there?

91
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,360
I just think the location is pretty good.

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,640
It's a shame to leave it unused.

93
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,920
What's there to be sorry about?

94
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,360
He owns the whole building.

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,640
He's just looking for something to do.

96
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,360
He's a well-known old bachelor.

97
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,360
No one lives more comfortably than he does.

98
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,640
Okay.

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,360
Thanks.

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,240
What's the last name of the owner over there?

101
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,360
His last name is Qiu.

102
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,840
Captain Qin.

103
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,960
The door's unlocked. There's blood.

104
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,800
Captain Qin.

105
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,440
Come take a look.

106
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,320
What's wrong?

107
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,000
Captain Qin,

108
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,320
look.

109
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,440
This is nonsense, absolute nonsense.

110
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,160
Faking your death right in front of the police,

111
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,760
are you trying to get Xiao Tao killed?

112
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,880
Why don't you say it even louder?

113
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
You might as well call the police over too.

114
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,560
Old Liang,

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,760
I've never asked you for anything in my life.

116
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,520
Today, I'm asking you for a favor.

117
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,960
Go ahead.

118
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,560
Xiao Tao is also my son.

119
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,000
There are three hours left.

120
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,440
You must keep an eye on him.

121
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,760
Then safely take him to the dock.

122
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,200
There's a ship to Southeast Asia there.

123
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,520
I've arranged everything.

124
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,200
I already said I get seasick and throw up, I'm not going.

125
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,440
Shut up! Do you realize what time it is?

126
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,000
And you're still acting like this.

127
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,840
All you do is play around.

128
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,400
You're facing death and you're still playing.

129
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,440
What are you doing?

130
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,320
Are you going or not? Going or not?

131
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
I'll go, I'll go!

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll take Xiao Tao.

133
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,560
What about you?

134
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,200
I have something even more important to do.

135
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,000
Bai Tao! Bai Tao!

136
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,760
Where is my son Bai Tao?

137
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,760
Bai Tao!

138
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,760
Didn't you say you found my son? Where is he?

139
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,240
Please calm down.

140
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,320
Let's talk things through.

141
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,640
Bai Tao!

142
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,080
No.

143
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,640
Bai Tao, this is our—

144
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
This is our office area.

145
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,880
Please don't make a scene here.

146
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,680
Move aside.

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,400
Let me see if my son is really alive.

148
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,200
What's all the commotion?

149
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,440
Captain Qin, she—

150
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,240
Officer Qin.

151
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,960
You called me and said my son is alive.

152
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,200
Did you really find my son?

153
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,880
He's my only son.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You came at the right time.

155
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,000
If you hadn't come to us,

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
we would have gone to find you.

157
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,880
Take her to Interrogation Room One.

158
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,320
Yes, yes.

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,440
This way, please.

160
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,120
Let go of me!

161
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,640
Ms. Bai, please.

162
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,440
Didn't you collect DNA last time?

163
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,000
What did you find out?

164
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Ask what you should ask.

165
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

166
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,400
Am I a criminal?

167
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
August 5th.

168
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,760
Did you go to the tobacco shop on Xiangwu North Road?

169
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
I don't remember.

170
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,560
The owner there remembers.

171
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,520
We went to see him.

172
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,320
He said you asked him about something.

173
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,880
I remember now, it was just small talk.

174
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,200
Officer Qin.

175
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
I just want to ask you,

176
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,560
did you really find my son?

177
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,120
Is he still alive?

178
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,120
Bai Fan.

179
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,240
Stop pretending.

180
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,080
You know better than anyone whether Bai Tao is alive or dead.

181
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,640
Not only is he alive,

182
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,400
he also killed the owner of the adult store.

183
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,040
That's Li Xiulan's landlord.
