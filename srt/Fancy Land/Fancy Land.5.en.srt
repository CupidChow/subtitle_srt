1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,080
Help me take off my gloves.

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,160
Captain Qin.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Captain Qin, here are the gloves.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,760
How did the car end up here?

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,440
They probably didn't see the warning sign.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,200
That warning sign fell into the sea.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,480
It might have been blown away by strong winds.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,360
But we can't rule out the possibility of sabotage.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,720
Let's go in and take a look.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,440
Slow down.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,160
Sun Mou, put on the shoe covers.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,280
What's the current assessment from the traffic police?

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,120
We took the evidence back and compared it.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,800
The current assessment is that it's a single-vehicle accident.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,920
Sync the car owner's information as soon as possible.

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,960
Send the body to the funeral home for preservation first.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,160
Contact the forensic doctor for an alcohol test.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,600
Sun Mou.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,480
Go check the victim's social connections.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,520
You didn't go out for socializing?

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,160
You're already home at this hour.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,320
Why did you come back?

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,600
Didn't I tell you to go out and lay low?

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,040
Why should I hide?

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,480
Who am I supposed to hide from?

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,320
I think the one who should be hiding is you.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,240
Manman called me today.

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,160
Half a year ago, you transferred money to Zhang Xiaochuan.

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,280
Two million.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,960
What was that money for?

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,440
Since I invested in Zhang Xiaochuan's repair shop,

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,680
that kind of transaction is normal.

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,760
Why are you checking my accounts?

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,880
My dear husband,

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,240
this wasn't a business-to-business transfer.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,120
This money was sent by you

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,800
to Zhang Xiaochuan's personal account.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,520
There are some things I just can't figure out.

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,680
Since you invested in Zhang Xiaochuan's auto repair shop,

40
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,320
why did you have to transfer so much money privately?

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,960
Is there something going on between you two

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,320
that I don't know about?

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,520
Now he's suddenly dead.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,320
I don't know what the police would think

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,600
if they found out about this.

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,440
Please come and confirm.

47
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,160
This is the birthday gift I gave my son.

48
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,400
This is the birthday gift I gave my son.

49
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,960
Please calm down, Ms. Bai.

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,880
Hold on, hold on, Ms. Bai.

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,120
Ms. Bai, Ms. Bai.

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,680
It's all my fault.

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,160
It's all my fault.

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,040
It's all because of me.

55
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,800
Otherwise, he wouldn't have ended up like this.

56
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,120
He wouldn't have ended up like this.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,520
Please calm down.

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,960
He argued with me a couple of days ago.

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
He said he didn't want to live anymore.

60
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,160
I even scolded him.

61
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,320
I told him he wasn't a real man.

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,880
I told him he wasn't a real man.

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,520
I pushed him too hard.

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
Calm down. I pushed him too hard.

65
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,960
Calm down. I should have understood him.

66
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,760
Calm down.

67
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,600
I should have understood him.

68
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,160
Okay, okay, okay.

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,960
Boss, give me a fish.

70
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,800
What kind of fish do you want?

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
How big?

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Let your mom pick one for me.

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
I want a big one.

74
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
Yanyan.

75
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
You don't remember me?

76
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Watch the stall, I'm going out.

77
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,120
Yanyan, Yanyan.

78
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
Who is that?

79
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,000
What did your mom go do with her?

80
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
I don't know either.

81
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,440
I think she's a friend of my mom's.

82
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,280
A friend?

83
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,440
My son is gone.

84
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,520
What?

85
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,440
Bai Tao committed suicide.

86
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,840
Did he come to see you?

87
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
What did you say to him?

88
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,560
What did you say to him?

89
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,680
It has nothing to do with me.

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,840
It has nothing to do with me.

91
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,160
I didn't say it had anything to do with you.

92
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
It's my fault.

93
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,000
I pushed him too hard.

94
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,280
If he hadn't come here, he wouldn't have died.

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,440
I've already taken him back.

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
I'll hold a funeral for him in a couple of days.

97
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,720
My condolences.

98
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,440
You keep it.

99
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,600
What are you doing?

100
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,840
Mom.

101
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,400
Did Bai Tao come to the market before he died?

102
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,440
He only came to see you once.

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,280
Yes.

104
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,840
Who is that woman?

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,880
I heard you talking about the person who died.

106
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,040
Who are you talking about?

107
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,320
Bai Tao.

108
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,840
Help me peel the potatoes.

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,840
Bai Fan was our former neighbor.

110
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,720
Bai Tao was her son.

111
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,800
We weren't very close.

112
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,240
Just neighbors, that's all.

113
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,720
Mom.

114
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,400
I don't remember any of this.

115
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,120
If you don't remember, then you don't remember.

116
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,120
Back then,

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,560
you were still little.

118
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
He wasn't anyone important anyway.

119
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,120
Did Bai Tao ever come to see you?

120
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
He was a troublemaker.

121
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,440
I'm just worried.

122
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,160
When he lost control, he could do anything.

123
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,880
I've never met him.

124
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,280
Mom.

125
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,160
Will Bai Fan come to see you again?

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,280
She lost her son.

127
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
She's heartbroken and can't get over it.

128
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,840
Just like if I lost you,

129
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,560
I wouldn't want to live anymore.

130
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,720
Mom.

131
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,000
How long has it been since we went back to Shigang?

132
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,720
Almost ten years, I think.

133
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,400
Why isn't sister coming back with us?

134
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,000
She doesn't know anyone there.

135
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
Why choose this place?

136
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,440
Who knows.

137
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,480
Is that girl Xiao Tao's friend?

138
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,080
Which one?

139
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,480
I haven't seen her before.

140
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,920
Her mother is probably Bai Fan's friend.

141
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,880
My condolences.

142
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,800
Bai Fan.

143
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,080
The child is in your care.

144
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,560
Is this the result we have now?

145
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,800
Are you still going to argue with me today?

146
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Today, here,

147
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
we gather with heavy hearts

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,320
to mourn Mr. Bai Tao.

149
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,000
He has left us forever.

150
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,440
Please observe a moment of silence.

151
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,120
The moment of silence is over.

152
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,880
Will the family please come up to give a thank-you speech.

153
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Thank you, everyone.

154
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
for attending my son's farewell ceremony.

155
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,440
I see Officer Qin, who is in charge of the case,

156
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
is also here.

157
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,680
Thank you.

158
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,880
You must all be wondering

159
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,320
why I chose this cold storage plant

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,680
to hold this farewell ceremony.

161
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
Because here

162
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,440
is where Bai Tao's father used to work.

163
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,120
It was also here that I met him.

164
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,880
We had the fruit of our love.

165
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,560
My greatest gift,

166
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,440
my son, Bai Tao.

167
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,440
Things remain, but people have changed.

168
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,320
I have lost in this world

169
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
my only family.

170
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,080
Actually, when Bai Tao was alive,

171
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,240
he didn't achieve much.

172
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,080
But he respected his teachers,

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,320
was filial to his parents,

174
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,200
and was always willing to help others.

175
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm proud to have had a son like him.

176
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,440
But I wasn't a good mother.

177
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,320
Before my son took his own life, he sent me a message.

178
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,760
He told me about how hard life was for him.

179
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,680
But at that time, I blamed him.

180
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,880
I said he was useless.

181
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
I said he was incompetent.

182
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
I think at that moment,

183
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,080
he must have needed my support the most.

184
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,440
But I didn't help him.

185
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
I didn't give him any help at all.

186
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,680
I'm not a qualified mother, I'm not.

187
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,680
I know

188
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,440
that I am the one

189
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,640
who was the last straw that broke him.

190
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,440
It was me who killed him.

191
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,080
It was me who killed him.

192
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,240
Bai Fan.

193
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,800
Don't do anything rash.

194
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,760
You crazy woman.

195
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
You crazy woman.

196
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,800
Calm down.

197
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,000
I thought you wouldn't come.

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,800
I had to come see him one last time.

199
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,560
From now on,

200
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,480
no one will disturb

201
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,880
the life that Yan Yan and I have anymore.

202
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,440
I hope this is

203
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,440
the last time I see you as well.

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,680
Thank you.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,680
Yan Yan.

206
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,440
If we don't leave now, we'll miss the bus.

207
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,800
Mrs. Bai, my condolences.

208
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,320
Thank you, Teacher Yang.

209
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm here on behalf of the school to see Bai Tao off for the last time.

210
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,480
Five, six, seven, go.

211
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,560
Five little monkeys jumping on the bed.

212
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,920
One fell off and bumped his head.

213
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,560
Mama called the doctor.

214
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,240
The doctor said,

215
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,000
Four little monkeys jumping on the bed.

216
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,320
One fell off and bumped his head.

217
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,680
Class is over, you can go.

218
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
Nian Nian, Nian Nian.

219
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,320
Come here.

220
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,120
Teacher Li just noticed

221
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
that you didn't make a sound when singing.

222
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,320
Can you tell me why?

223
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm afraid I won't sing well.

224
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,320
How could that be?

225
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,080
Your pitch is the best.

226
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,880
Shall we try it together?

227
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,200
Okay.

228
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,240
Come on.

229
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,560
Do.

230
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,440
Do.

231
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Can you hear it?

232
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,880
How was school today?

233
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,120
All she does is play games.

234
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,880
Mr. Lin (Nian Nian's father).

235
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,120
Teacher Li.

236
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,560
There's something I need to talk to you about.

237
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,880
Go ahead.

238
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,360
It seems that Nian Nian's hearing has declined.

239
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,640
Her hearing has declined?

240
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,680
I'm not quite sure what you mean.

241
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,560
I suggest you take her to the hospital for a checkup.

242
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,440
If there's a problem, it's better to find out early and deal with it early.

243
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,880
Okay.

244
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,560
I'll take her to the hospital for a checkup tomorrow.

245
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Thank you for letting me know.

246
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
We'll be going now.

247
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,800
There's something important. Come to the theater.

248
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,000
Li Meng.

249
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,880
Li Meng.

250
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,440
Li Meng! Li Meng!

251
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,080
I let you run.

252
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,360
I let you run.

253
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,960
Go away.

254
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,480
Leave.

255
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,360
Is it good?

256
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,360
It's you.

257
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
I wrote this.

258
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,080
I want the kids to perform it at the showcase.

259
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,600
What do you think?

260
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,720
The kids will perform this at the showcase.

261
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,360
Is it watchable?

262
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,840
Did I scare you?

263
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,960
I just wanted to test the performance effect.

264
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Why is my name on this?

265
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,440
And my mom's name too.

266
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,360
Are you reading it?

267
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,080
It's just the beginning.

268
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,800
This chapter is called—

269
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
The Death of Zhang Xiaochuan.

270
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,480
Don't go.

271
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,560
It's not over yet.

272
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,800
Don't you want to know who the killer is?

273
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,080
Li Xiulan.

274
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

275
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Why are you nervous?

276
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,840
A made-up story

277
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
will never be more dramatic than real life.

278
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,360
The story isn't over yet.

279
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,840
And life goes on.

280
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,480
It can tell the past,

281
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,720
and also predict the future.

282
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
My dear sister.
