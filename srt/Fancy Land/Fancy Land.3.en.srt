1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,080
Come on, let's have a drink.

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,840
Cheers, bottoms up!

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,080
Hello, please enjoy your meal.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,120
Okay, thank you.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,240
Boss.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,960
Add another ginger duck for me.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,720
Liang Zitao.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,720
What do you want?

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,440
I've changed my name.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Now my surname is Bai, Bai Tao.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,720
I take my mother's surname now.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,200
Don't call me the wrong name.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,000
Does your mom know you came to see me?

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,800
She knows I work here.

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,320
I told her I make three thousand a month.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,680
But Aunt Lan,

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,000
you know it's not that easy to make money.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,160
But I've thought it through.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,160
As long as I have something to eat,

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,000
I won't stay by my mom's side.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,680
Seeing her just makes me feel worse.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,160
Your business has nothing to do with me.

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,440
Why are you telling me all this?

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,840
It has nothing to do with you?

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,680
Are you sure?

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,080
If you really think my business has nothing to do with you,

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,640
then I'll go find your daughter.

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,680
Sorry.

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,320
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

30
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,480
Sorry.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,120
The number you have dialed

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,400
Why couldn't I reach you on the phone?

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,960
Where did you go?

34
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,720
Why are you only coming home now?

35
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,280
Mom went to make a delivery.

36
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,400
The place was a bit remote.

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
It was a long way.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,600
Maybe my phone lost signal on the way. Come here.

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,120
Stupid phone, why was there no signal?

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,840
What's wrong?

41
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,760
Did something happen?

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,040
You're so annoying.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,040
Keep your voice down.

44
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,560
It's nothing, no one's here.

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,120
It's nothing.

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,760
I was worried about you.

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,760
I couldn't find you.

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,320
I didn't know what to do.

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
Mom's here, don't be afraid.

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
It's my fault.

51
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,400
Next time, I won't let you lose track of me.

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,960
It's okay now.

53
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,320
Mom's here, Mom's here.

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,840
Go inside.

55
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,680
Okay.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,040
Teacher Li.

57
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,680
Hello.

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,840
I'll be counting on you to look after my child from now on.

59
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,360
Not at all.

60
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,920
It's my duty.

61
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Alright, goodbye then.

62
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,120
Good morning, Teacher Li.

63
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,680
Good morning.

64
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
What happened here?

65
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,600
Someone died.

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,600
This factory just opened not long ago.

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,320
On the opening day,

68
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,040
there were dragon and lion dances.

69
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,040
It was really lively.

70
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,600
But now someone’s gone.

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,680
His business was doing well.

72
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,760
What’s the use of that?

73
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,840
In a person’s life,

74
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
you can only handle as much wealth as your fate allows.

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,200
And you should only take on as much as you can handle.

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,320
As for Mr. Zhang,

77
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,760
if you ask me, his fate was too weak.

78
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,760
He couldn’t handle it.

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
What kind of person was he?

80
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,600
He was sleazy.

81
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,480
No, not sleazy.

82
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:29,920
Well...

83
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,520
What do you mean?

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,360
The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Medicine says,

85
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,480
a man shouldn’t always

86
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,040
be thinking about that kind of thing.

87
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,040
Otherwise, his energy and spirit

88
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,600
will drain from his head down through his body.

89
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,920
Right.

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,640
Being lewd drains your life.

91
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,960
So, are you saying

92
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,240
he had a lot of female friends?

93
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,200
I wouldn’t dare say that.

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,640
As a businessman,

95
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,760
I can’t just talk nonsense, right?

96
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,040
Yes, yes.

97
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,240
But,

98
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,840
he even went after the investor’s wife.

99
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,200
That’s really lacking in morals.

100
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,520
Right?

101
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,400
Who are you hiding from?

102
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
No, I'm not hiding from anyone.

103
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,920
You went to the dressing room last night, didn't you?

104
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,080
What did you see?

105
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,640
I didn't go.

106
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,480
You're lying.

107
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
I saw you.

108
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,800
You must have been mistaken.

109
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,480
Have you eaten? Let's eat together.

110
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,360
The place Director Zhang recommended is really good.

111
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Why aren't you eating?

112
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,760
I'm not feeling very well.

113
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,760
Can I leave first?

114
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,080
Li Yan.

115
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,040
Did I not introduce myself to you?

116
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,600
My name is Li Meng.

117
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,040
How do you know my name?

118
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,480
I also know your mom's name is Li Xiulan.

119
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,640
I must have scared you last night.

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,040
Do you think I'm not a good person?

121
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,400
As long as it's to survive,

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
I can do anything.

123
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,920
Maybe in your eyes,

124
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,760
someone like me is ugly.

125
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,480
But I don't think so at all.

126
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,120
Why are you telling me all this?

127
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,760
Didn't Li Xiulan ever mention it to you?

128
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,320
Mention me?

129
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,200
She mentioned you have an older sister.

130
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,640
An older sister?

131
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,760
How could I have an older sister?

132
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,920
That's true.

133
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,320
Why would she mention me?

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,360
You're the one she likes.

135
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
The obedient, well-behaved daughter.

136
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,040
She never raised me.

137
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,320
She abandoned me a long time ago.

138
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,840
The day Dad died suddenly from drinking,

139
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,840
no one cared about me.

140
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,360
I thought I would be like

141
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,080
a kitten whose owner had died.

142
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Then my uncle came.

143
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,320
He collected the relief money.

144
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
And sent me back home.

145
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,360
They wanted to get rid of me.

146
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,640
Do you know

147
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,400
how much relief money you get for a human life?

148
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,480
Do you know how much it is?

149
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,640
Fifty thousand

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,640
Five hundred yuan

151
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,920
They never saw me as a person.

152
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,320
In their eyes,

153
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,360
I was just

154
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,240
a tool to exchange for five hundred yuan.

155
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,520
Then one day,

156
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Li Xiulan came.

157
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,800
I thought my mother had come.

158
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,240
I thought my world was finally going to brighten.

159
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
But this woman,

160
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,920
my only relative in the world,

161
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,360
personally threw me into an even darker abyss.

162
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,080
Mom...

163
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,520
I was kicked around like a ball.

164
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,920
Mom...

165
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
I begged her to help me.

166
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,040
I begged her to save me.

167
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
But what did she do?

168
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,480
She said I was sick.

169
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,840
She said there was something wrong with my mind.

170
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
She sent me to a mental hospital.

171
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,600
Did you get better after that?

172
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
It doesn't matter.

173
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,240
As long as the doctor thinks I'm better,

174
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,240
then I'm better.

175
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,480
If he thinks I'm not better,

176
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,920
he ties me to the bed every day

177
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,800
and stuffs handful after handful

178
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,240
of unknown medicine into my mouth.

179
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,120
He pours cold water over me

180
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,600
like he's washing livestock.

181
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,240
Later, I understood something.

182
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,600
I had to act obedient and compliant like a normal person.

183
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,240
Because acting like a normal person

184
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,680
is more important than actually being one.

185
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,040
You really are my sister.

186
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,480
Actually, before I met you,

187
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,040
I thought about it every day.

188
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,560
When I saw you,

189
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,040
how should I introduce myself?

190
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,120
I was afraid you wouldn't remember me.

191
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,920
I was also afraid you'd be like everyone else,

192
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,600
and think I was crazy.

193
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
Afraid you wouldn't believe what I said.

194
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,560
If what you said is true,

195
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,360
and you really are my sister,

196
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,800
then I want to know about my childhood.

197
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,480
Sure.

198
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
After work, I'll take you somewhere.

199
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,480
So, at the early stage of your cooperation,

200
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
we can help you avoid many legal risks.

201
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,720
And loopholes as well.

202
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,040
We do have less experience in this area.

203
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,600
Hello, who are you looking for?

204
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,920
I'm from the Wucheng Criminal Police Unit.

205
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,800
My name is Qin Yang.

206
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,240
Could you please find Lin Yi for me?

207
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,800
Mr. Lin is over there.

208
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,480
Thank you.

209
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,360
The scenery here is really beautiful.

210
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,560
What brings you here today?

211
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,240
We won't take up Lawyer Lin's time.

212
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
We'll get straight to the point.

213
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,800
Do you know about the relationship between Zhang Xiaochuan and Gu Nan?

214
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,480
I just found out.

215
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,240
We've learned that Gu Nan is no longer in Wucheng.

216
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,480
So where did she go?

217
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,040
That seems like a question we should be asking you.

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
Why did she run away?

219
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,240
Where was she on the night of Zhang Xiaochuan's murder?

220
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,480
Take this.

221
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,600
Just pretend you don't know anything.

222
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,240
If the police find you,

223
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,600
just tell the truth.

224
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,280
I don't know.

225
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,480
You invested in Zhang Xiaochuan's auto repair shop.

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,120
You didn't know about Zhang Xiaochuan's affair with Gu Nan either?

227
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,280
Or do you actually know everything?

228
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,560
But does Zhang Xiaochuan have something on you?

229
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,120
So you had no choice but to invest in

230
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,600
a man who was cheating on you.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,280
This...

232
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,120
You haven't gotten married yet, have you?

233
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,800
If you were married,

234
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
you would know

235
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
how hard it is

236
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,040
for a man to keep a family together.

237
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
You and your wife have a child,

238
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,120
and her ex-boyfriend, who was in prison, comes looking for you,

239
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,240
threatening to ruin your family unless you pay him.

240
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
What would you do?

241
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,240
I had no choice.

242
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,120
I could only pay him.

243
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,360
For the sake of the child.

244
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,800
So you didn't just find out.

245
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,680
You knew all along.

246
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,800
You put up with it for your child.

247
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,800
But Gu Nan still betrayed you.

248
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,920
She got involved with Zhang Xiaochuan.

249
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
Officer Qin,

250
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,920
you don't need to imagine my motive for murder.

251
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,920
I'll say it again.

252
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,240
I didn't kill Zhang Xiaochuan.

253
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,480
Yes.

254
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Look at that lighthouse.

255
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,240
The ships at sea

256
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,040
rely on it to find their way.

257
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,000
Actually, I'm not a normal person either.

258
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,600
I'm sick too.

259
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,680
My mind isn't right.

260
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
I can never remember things.

261
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,920
It's been hard for my mom to raise me.

262
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
If she had chosen you back then,

263
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,920
her life would have been much easier, right?

264
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,800
I will forget everything.

265
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,800
My life

266
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,680
actually feels empty.

267
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,480
Without memories,

268
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,440
it's pretty good.

269
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,240
I forget the good things,

270
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
but I also can't remember the bad.

271
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,360
Forgetting is a kind of ability.

272
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
It's a gift.

273
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,000
Do you really think so?

274
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,120
Of course.

275
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,920
Go inside.

276
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,800
See you tomorrow.

277
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,120
Mom.

278
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,480
Where did you go?

279
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,560
We got off work early today,

280
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,240
so we took a walk by the sea.

281
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,480
This is my new colleague.

282
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,600
Mom.

283
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,360
Go back to your room and take your medicine first.

284
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,280
Why don't you listen?

285
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,720
I told you to come home after work.

286
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,280
Why are you running around everywhere?

287
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,920
I wasn't running around.

288
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,240
We just went for a walk by the sea.

289
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,360
Go inside.

290
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,600
Go to your room, quickly.

291
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,680
Mom, go to your room.

292
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,280
I'm an adult now. Go to your room.

293
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,880
Why do you always...

294
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,680
Mom.

295
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,800
Mom.

296
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,160
Mom.

297
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,280
The three of us as a family

298
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,920
are finally together again.
