1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,200
We checked Li Xiulan's withdrawal records.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,360
On the day Bai Tao died,

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,480
she withdrew twenty thousand yuan.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,920
What exactly did she need that money for?

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,600
Thank you.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,680
Is it possible that Bai Tao was blackmailing her?

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,600
She originally intended to give the money to Bai Tao.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,560
If she planned to pay,

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,840
then why would Li Xiulan still commit murder?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,680
Could it really be as Li Xiulan said,

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,600
that Bai Tao accidentally fell to his death?

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,640
But Bai Tao's autopsy report shows

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,440
he was already dead before the fall.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,760
But that would be too strange.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
If she was willing to pay,

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,760
there was no need to kill.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,080
Maybe their negotiation broke down.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,440
A crime of passion.

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,600
Then Li Xiulan is lying.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,960
Captain Qin, Bai Fan has been found.

21
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,160
Yanyan actually wanted to come see you too.

22
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't let her come.

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
Even if she wanted to, she couldn't come.

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,360
It's not allowed.

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,720
Yanyan.

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,280
Is she doing okay?

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
She's fine.

28
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,080
But your case isn't looking good.

29
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,720
This is the medical record you forged, right?

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,640
Do you realize that by doing this

31
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,800
you've basically ruined her whole life?

32
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,360
But don't worry.

33
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,800
She doesn't know yet.

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,360
I haven't told her anything.

35
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,440
Thank you.

36
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
Aunt Xiulan.

37
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
You can't hide anything from me anymore.

38
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,560
I really want to help you.

39
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Yes.

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,080
We all have regrets about what happened back then.

41
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,280
They deserved to die.

42
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,280
But the law doesn't care about feelings.

43
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,920
If you kill someone, you have to pay the price.

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,280
It's all my fault.

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,080
I'm the one who killed them.

46
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
If I have to go to jail or be executed,

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm not afraid.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But what about my daughter?

49
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,360
If I'm gone,

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,720
how will she live?

51
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,880
Here.

52
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,320
Lawyer Lin.

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,360
You said you wanted to go over things to watch out for in court.

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,200
Why did you ask me to meet here?

55
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,440
To help you pick out an outfit for court.

56
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,320
Do I need special clothes for court?

57
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,880
Yes.

58
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
We need to make a good impression on the judge.

59
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,920
How you present yourself in court is very important, trust me.

60
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,080
These clothes are expensive.

61
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,480
I don't want to spend money carelessly.

62
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,160
I'll just find something at home.

63
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,760
As long as it's clean and appropriate, it's fine.

64
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,880
Don't worry.

65
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm very confident about this case.

66
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,320
What you need to do

67
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,200
most importantly, is cooperate with me.

68
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,600
I'll give you the outfit.

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,720
Lawyer Lin.

70
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,040
Isn't this outfit a bit inappropriate for court?

71
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,040
My mom doesn't like me wearing skirts.

72
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,480
It looks great.

73
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,600
It's very appropriate.

74
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,440
You really didn't need to bring so many things.

75
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,360
I have everything you need at my place.

76
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,000
Lawyer Lin,

77
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,880
In exchange for helping my mom,

78
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,880
it's not about money,

79
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,320
it's me, right?

80
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
As a lawyer,

81
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,880
it's my duty to help my clients win their cases.

82
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
As for you and me,

83
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,720
we missed our chance before.

84
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,880
Now, I don't want to miss it again.

85
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Starting today,

86
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
you'll live here.

87
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,720
Please make sure you keep your promise.

88
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,040
I will do everything I promised.

89
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,160
I asked you to move in

90
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,280
partly for easier communication,

91
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,720
and on the other hand,

92
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,040
it's for your safety.

93
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,760
Besides, you cook two meals a day for me,

94
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,760
and help Nian Nian with homework.

95
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
This is also to repay me

96
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
for handling your mom's case for free.

97
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,440
That's fair, isn't it?

98
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,600
As long as I can save my mom,

99
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,040
I'll do anything.

100
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
It's a deal.

101
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,760
Li Xiulan, let me ask you again.

102
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,880
How did Bai Tao really die?

103
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,880
He slipped and fell to his death.

104
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,120
I advise you to tell the truth.

105
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,840
I am telling the truth.

106
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Aren't you curious about what the report says?

107
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,760
We found Bai Tao's blood sample

108
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,560
on Wang Guocheng's truck.

109
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,760
Bai Tao didn't die from a fall at all.

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
He was hit and killed by a vehicle.

111
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,880
You already know the result.

112
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
So why are you still asking me?

113
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,240
We're giving you a chance to confess.

114
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,760
We’ve already been to your house as well.

115
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,080
We found these things.

116
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,240
According to the investigation,

117
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,400
on the night of August 9th,

118
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,840
you withdrew money from several ATMs

119
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,560
with a total withdrawal of twenty thousand yuan.

120
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,560
From Wang Guocheng's account,

121
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
thirty thousand yuan was also withdrawn.

122
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,240
The total is fifty thousand yuan.

123
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
Traffic surveillance footage shows

124
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,080
that at the time of the incident,

125
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,400
you did hand this paper bag to Bai Tao.

126
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,880
After that, Bai Tao was killed.

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,880
Then this paper bag appeared in your home.

128
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,200
We've also reviewed the contents of this USB drive.

129
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,680
So can you tell us again

130
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,560
what happened that night?

131
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,560
The person—

132
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,560
I was the one who hit and killed him.

133
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,240
Wang Guocheng doesn't know anything.

134
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,840
He has nothing to do with this. The car—

135
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,560
I stole it.

136
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,000
Stole it.

137
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,640
Since you decided to give the money to Bai Tao,

138
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,880
why did you suddenly change your mind?

139
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,000
I didn't intend to kill him.

140
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
I also never really meant to give him the money.

141
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,760
Aunt Lan

142
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,840
What do you mean?

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You ambushed me.

144
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,440
I went through all that trouble to get you two the USB and the video.

145
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,200
And now you want to run me over.

146
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,760
Let me tell you,

147
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,000
if I die here today, you won't get away.

148
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,880
You want to run me over, right? Go ahead.

149
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
Come on, I won't run.

150
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,440
Come on, drive, do it!

151
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're just a fishmonger, do you even dare?

152
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,760
Who are you trying to scare?

153
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,440
Li Xiulan, let me tell you,

154
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
because of this,

155
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,760
your tens of thousands aren't enough anymore.

156
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,440
Go home and think about it.

157
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,960
How much is your precious daughter worth?

158
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,640
Why did you choose to

159
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,200
dispose of the body somewhere relatively close to your home

160
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,000
to dump the body?

161
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,760
That building

162
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,560
has been abandoned for four or five years.

163
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,320
There have always been rumors it's haunted, so no one ever goes there.

164
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,560
I thought if Bai Tao's body was to be discovered,

165
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,520
it would take at least a few years.

166
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
So you dragged Bai Tao to the unfinished building

167
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,320
to leave footprints.

168
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,760
You even deliberately got mud on yourself.

169
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,560
You also put on Bai Tao's shoes.

170
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,760
You created the illusion of one-way footprints.

171
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,760
But unfortunately, you overlooked something.

172
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,200
You faked everything,

173
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,120
but you couldn't fake the real characteristics of someone who fell from a building.

174
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,880
He deserved to die.

175
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,080
He used those photos of my daughter to blackmail me.

176
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,560
Didn't he deserve to die?

177
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So you

178
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,320
chose to kill him,

179
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,760
didn't you?

180
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,560
At that moment, I had only one thought in my mind:

181
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,080
how great it would be if this person just disappeared.

182
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,400
Li Xiulan,

183
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,400
didn't you ever think

184
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,080
that if you killed someone,

185
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,200
what would happen to Li Yan?

186
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,560
Li Yan would lose her only mother as well.

187
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,080
Captain Qin,

188
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,600
Bai Fan is awake.

189
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,040
I want to see Qin Yang.

190
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,880
I'll only talk when Qin Yang is here.

191
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,160
Captain Qin,

192
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,400
Li Xiulan has gone crazy.

193
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,280
She tried to kill me.

194
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,920
She wants to kill everyone.
