1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,760
Stop messing around, stop it.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,360
Don't mess around.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,480
No filming.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,640
Stop it, behave.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,320
I won't mess around.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,000
Speak properly.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,080
My future should be colorful.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,400
I want to stand at the top of the lighthouse.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,240
The weather is clear.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,240
Many seagulls are flying by.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,240
Do you want to kill them?

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,360
Can you help me?

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
Who do you most want to kill?

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,880
I want to kill

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,040
my mom.

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,920
The new place is nice.

17
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,680
Do you know how hard it was for me to find you?

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,880
What do you want?

19
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,960
I always have to go home.

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,200
Isn't that right?

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,840
Yanyan.

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,080
Let me show you something nice.

23
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,920
What is it?

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,080
It's so cute!

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,200
This is Xiaojun's new friend.

26
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,200
So cute.

27
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,080
Why didn't you bring it home to keep?

28
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,360
Grandma is allergic.

29
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,720
Mom

30
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,000
What's wrong?

31
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Where did you go?

32
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,440
I just went to bring food to Xiao Jun.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
Did something happen?

34
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,440
Mom, I was wrong.

35
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,080
Mom

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
I didn't mean to stay outside. Come here.

37
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,360
I just went to see the cat Xiao Jun found.

38
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,920
Mom

39
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,280
Mom

40
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,920
Mom

41
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Mom

42
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm sorry, Mom.

43
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,840
Yanyan

44
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,640
Come out, I'm back.

45
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
Why are you so nervous?

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,080
I just wanted to say hi.

47
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,120
Mom

48
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,520
Let me go out.

49
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,400
Don't lock me in anymore.

50
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,640
Mom

51
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,200
That's Li Yan, right?

52
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,080
Where did she go?

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,960
You're not welcome in this house.

54
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
It's not up to you.

55
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,960
Leave.

56
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,240
What right do you have to get mad at me?

57
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,800
If you were so capable, why didn't you do something earlier?

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,640
I just came to tell you

59
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
I'm all ready.

60
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,200
We'll meet again.

61
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,640
No

62
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,520
Mom

63
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,200
You're awake

64
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Wash up and eat

65
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,960
Okay

66
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,080
I'll drive you to and from work today.

67
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
No need, Mom.

68
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,400
You're so busy.

69
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,560
I can manage on my own.

70
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,120
Baby

71
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,080
Go in by yourself.

72
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Grandma is going back now.

73
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,120
Bye-bye. I'll pick you up after work.

74
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,640
Teacher Li

75
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,520
No need, Mom.

76
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,680
I'll go back myself. I'll leave after class.

77
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,680
Don't talk to strangers, okay?

78
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,360
Go on, I'll watch you go in.

79
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,920
Dad

80
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
Hurry up, I'm going to be late.

81
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,320
Niannian, slow down.

82
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,440
Your water bottle.

83
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,240
Let's review what we learned last class.

84
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,320
Let me see.

85
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,800
Who should we start with?

86
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,800
Wait for the teacher.

87
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,560
Teacher Li, I'm sorry.

88
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,120
I was late by accident.

89
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,480
It's okay. Who brought you here?

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Dad.

91
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,120
Dad, remember to pick me up after class.

92
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,360
I'm Nian Nian's father.

93
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
It was always her mother picking her up before.

94
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,120
Is this your first time here?

95
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm Nian Nian's choir teacher.

96
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,680
My name is Li Yan.

97
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,000
Teacher Li.

98
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,440
Are you a local?

99
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Yes, I am.

100
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,360
I've often heard my child mention you before.

101
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,360
Thank you for taking care of her.

102
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,320
Nian Nian is very well-behaved.

103
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,240
She's usually obedient and smart, too.

104
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Would it be convenient to leave a phone number?

105
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,920
In case anything comes up in the future,

106
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,000
I can contact you anytime.

107
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,360
Of course.

108
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,880
Have you been the one picking her up lately?

109
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,920
Yes.

110
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
I'll head inside, then.

111
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,880
Do you remember yesterday's homework?

112
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,560
Yes, I remember.

113
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,240
In a moment, the teacher will sing a line first.

114
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,560
Then you all sing the next part, okay?

115
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,320
Okay.

116
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,680
Five little monkeys jumping on the bed.

117
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,040
One fell off and bumped his head.

118
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,760
Mama called the doctor.

119
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,480
The doctor said,

120
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,000
No more monkeys jumping on the bed.

121
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,680
Four little monkeys jumping on the bed.

122
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,160
One fell off and bumped his head.

123
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,480
Li Yan.

124
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,480
Thank you.

125
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,320
You're welcome.

126
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,560
Here.

127
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,360
Cutting board, cutting board.

128
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,640
I told you already.

129
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,200
Your hand can't get wet.

130
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,960
What's going on with you lately?

131
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,560
Yanyan has grown up too.

132
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,400
You don't have to watch her so closely.

133
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,360
You don't know anything.

134
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,040
Don't tell me how to raise my daughter.

135
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,480
I'm leaving first, help me tidy up.

136
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,000
This, this, this.

137
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,600
Take this tape with you.

138
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,560
Take this fish home and make soup.

139
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,760
Sorry

140
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,320
The person you are calling is temporarily unavailable

141
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,600
Director Zhang, can you keep your hands to yourself?

142
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,440
You're so annoying

143
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,120
Keep your voice down

144
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,480
It's fine, no one's here

145
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,240
Aunt Lan

146
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,920
Long time no see
