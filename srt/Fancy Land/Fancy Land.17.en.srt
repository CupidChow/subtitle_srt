1
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,000
I swear

2
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,160
I volunteer to become

3
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,200
a People's Police officer of the People's Republic of China

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,520
I pledge loyalty to the Communist Party of China

5
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,000
loyalty to the people

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,320
loyalty to the law

7
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,640
to obey orders

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,000
to strictly observe discipline

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,160
to keep secrets

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,640
to enforce the law impartially

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,000
to be honest and upright

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,320
to fulfill my duties diligently

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,640
to fear no sacrifice

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,160
to serve the people wholeheartedly

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,400
I am willing to dedicate myself to the noble cause of public security

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,760
and strive to fulfill my oath

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,760
Captain Qin, sorry.

18
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,320
I was worried the wind might blow on you.

19
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,160
Okay, thank you.

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,400
Why did you come back?

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,080
Is it about Bai Fan?

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,840
She was traumatized last time.

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,680
She got very emotional.

24
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
She was semi-conscious all day yesterday.

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,560
The doctor said her body is still recovering.

26
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,600
It'll probably take two or three days.

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,960
Alright, then...

28
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,320
You should take a break too.

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,680
Yesterday,

30
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,480
Li Xiulan confessed to being involved in the murders

31
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,600
of Bai Tao and Zhang Xiaochuan.

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,920
She has fully confessed.

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
The rape case Bai Fan mentioned from years ago

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,840
is also strong evidence for Li Xiulan's motive.

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,240
Captain Qin, you should relax a bit these days.

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,960
Relax, relax.

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,840
So, did you find anything?

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,600
In Shigang County, around 1998,

39
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,040
I checked all the case files from those three years.

40
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
I also asked the local police.

41
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,760
There really was no report of a rape case.

42
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,760
Alright.

43
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,400
You...

44
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,600
Come with me this afternoon to take Li Xiulan to identify the scene.

45
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,560
Okay.

46
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,480
Xiaoqin, sorry to trouble you.

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,920
Keep watching Bai Fan.

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,040
Yes.

49
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,040
Describe how you committed the crime.

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,040
It was around one in the morning.

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,680
I did it over there.

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,120
Come here.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,960
Which spot?

54
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,760
Here.

55
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Which door did you come in through?

56
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
Which door did you leave through?

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,800
I came in through the front door.

58
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
I left through that door.

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,120
And then?

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,800
Then I saw Zhang Xiaochuan with a woman.

61
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,520
They were doing that kind of thing.

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,960
Why did you do it

63
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,920
when there were other people present?

64
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,920
My mind was all muddled.

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
I knew Zhang Xiaochuan ran an auto repair shop.

66
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,360
So I kept looking for a chance to act.

67
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,360
That night,

68
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,800
I... I...

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,200
I didn't know there were other people here.

70
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
Bai Tao, you thought of moving the body.

71
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,520
Zhang Xiaochuan, you just left him here.

72
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,360
It was my first time killing someone.

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
I was scared.

74
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,040
And he was pinned by the car, I couldn't move him.

75
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,920
And then?

76
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,080
Show us how you did it.

77
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,680
At that time, I...

78
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,240
I lured him here.

79
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,640
I ran him over with the car.

80
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,640
Then I found a tool.

81
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,640
And beat him to death.

82
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
How do you start the lift?

83
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,360
The lift

84
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,240
is started just like this.

85
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Hello.

86
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,280
My sister asked me to come and pick up something.

87
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,760
She just went out.

88
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,280
She, she was wearing—

89
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,080
A black coat.

90
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,720
Long hair, you—

91
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,320
Li Xiulan identifies the crime scene.

92
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,760
She readily confesses to the crime.

93
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,720
You live in a pretty remote place.

94
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,640
It's not that bad.

95
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,760
Li Xiulan has already been taken in.

96
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,400
So what are we waiting for?

97
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,400
Waiting to see her die.

98
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Once she's sentenced,

99
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
she's as good as dead.

100
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,720
What's wrong?

101
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,400
Someone's been here.

102
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
If someone is hiding in a closet,

103
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,080
what's the most hopeless way to be discovered?

104
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,000
What is it?

105
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,440
She was hiding in the closet.

106
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,720
She must have someone she doesn't want to face.

107
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,280
So should we make her come out,

108
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,440
or should we respect her choice

109
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,200
and let her stay in there forever?

110
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,880
No.

111
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,440
You were eavesdropping.

112
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,760
You were eavesdropping.

113
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,400
You were eavesdropping.

114
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,640
You were eavesdropping.

115
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,280
You were eavesdropping.

116
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
You were eavesdropping.

117
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,760
Should kids listen to adults' business?

118
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,400
Just wait, I'll beat you today.

119
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,840
Niannian.

120
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,280
Teacher Yanyan, you're awake!

121
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,960
You fainted near the auto repair shop this afternoon.

122
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Auto repair shop.

123
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,600
I...

124
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,320
I saw you with Li Meng.

125
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,880
Then you must have had a dream.

126
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,080
I brought you back home.

127
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,760
Because I had to go out.

128
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,320
I was afraid you’d wake up startled.

129
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,440
I wanted you to sleep a bit longer.

130
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,720
So I gave you some sleeping pills.

131
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,000
So it was just a dream?

132
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,840
Yes.

133
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,640
It was just a dream.

134
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,200
Lawyer Lin.

135
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,280
If my mom goes to identify the scene,

136
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
does that mean she’s admitting guilt?

137
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,840
Didn’t you say she could be cleared?

138
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,600
Are you doubting me?

139
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,000
But my mom didn’t kill anyone.

140
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,880
Where’s the evidence?

141
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Didn’t we agree to investigate Li Meng first?

142
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,720
No, I...

143
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,720
I want to call the police.

144
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,960
I want to tell the police everything.

145
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,880
You don’t trust me anymore.

146
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,960
Saving my mom is more important than anything.

147
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,200
You think I’m incompetent, don’t you?

148
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,520
You’re the one who said you’d save my mom.

149
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,320
But saving your mom takes time.

150
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,960
Sorry.

151
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,760
I didn’t mean to, I...

152
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,840
I found evidence that Li Meng committed the murder.

153
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,880
How did you find it?

154
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,440
As expected, it was with her.

155
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,400
For your mother.

156
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,400
I used some illegal connections.

157
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,000
For you.

158
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,000
I've really done a lot.

159
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,520
Then let's hand this over to the police.

160
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,760
It's not as simple as you think.

161
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,080
If you go now,

162
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,400
your mother will at least be charged with harboring a criminal.

163
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm not completely sure I can save her.

164
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,880
Then what should we do now?

165
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,760
Li Meng definitely won't confess.

166
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,640
Because she knows

167
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,280
Li Xiulan will definitely take the blame for her.

168
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,840
So there's only one way.

169
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,000
Li Meng has to disappear.

170
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,640
Disappear?

171
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,080
Yes.

172
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,720
Disappear.

173
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,400
Disappear.

174
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,120
I was wrong.

175
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,000
I was wrong.

176
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,480
You begged me.

177
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,360
You begged me to have Li Meng admitted to the psychiatric hospital.
