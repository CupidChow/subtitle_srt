1
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,760
Teacher Li, you're awake.

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,200
Sorry, Nian Nian.

3
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,360
I was just too tired.

4
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,800
Let's practice Czerny Etude No. 2 in a bit.

5
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,520
Today is my birthday.

6
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,680
Mom isn't here either.

7
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,120
Can you spend it with me and Dad?

8
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,880
Of course I can.

9
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,920
Nian Nian.

10
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,800
Can you tell me

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,200
when your hearing started to get worse?

12
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,120
Dad said Mom got angry during a fight with him

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
and accidentally hit me.

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,160
Bai Fan isn't dead.

15
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,440
He woke up yesterday at the city hospital.

16
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,440
Why?

17
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,960
You should have finished what you started.

18
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,440
Now we're in trouble.

19
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,720
We were supposed to tell the story.

20
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,240
But now there's someone else who wants to tell it.

21
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,720
I'll find a way to get things back on track.

22
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,880
As for Zhang Xiaochuan's death,

23
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
I plead guilty.

24
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,440
As your lawyer,

25
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,080
I have to remind you, once you plead guilty—

26
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,880
I know.

27
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,640
Nian Nian.

28
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,640
I'll play it once, and you follow along, okay?

29
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,080
Teacher, what's wrong?

30
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,360
Nian Nian, I'm fine.

31
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,360
Why don't you practice by yourself for a bit?

32
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
What are you doing here?

33
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,280
To remind you.

34
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Remind me of what?

35
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,640
Stay away from Lin Yiyuan.

36
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,280
Why?

37
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,680
I have my reasons.

38
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,400
It's not time to tell you yet.

39
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,680
Who are you going to kill this time?

40
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,280
What story are you going to make up this time?

41
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,000
Then take a guess.

42
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,840
Who will be the next to die?

43
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,960
I'm not in the mood.

44
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,520
Go back.

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,440
Do you not want to know, or are you afraid to know?

46
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,160
What is there for me to be afraid of?

47
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,120
What am I afraid of?

48
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
I know you killed those people.

49
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,560
Otherwise, you wouldn't know everything.

50
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,560
Since you did it,

51
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,440
why did you make my mom take the blame for you?

52
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,360
Before you came,

53
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
when I was with Mom,

54
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,840
I was always fine.

55
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,000
She protected you, the devil, from beginning to end.

56
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,120
You are the devil.

57
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,560
Do you want to know who will die next?

58
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,360
Him.

59
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,280
Happy birthday to you.

60
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,680
Happy birthday to you.

61
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,960
Happy birthday to you.

62
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,160
Happy birthday to you.

63
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,960
Niannian.

64
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,160
Happy birthday.

65
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,120
Are you cold?

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,680
Are you happy?

67
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,880
I'm happy.

68
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,280
Good girl.

69
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,080
Come on, let's cut the cake.

70
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,120
Teacher Li.

71
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
You all come and cut it together.

72
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,640
Sorry.

73
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,520
Attorney Lin

74
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,960
I’ve already found

75
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,760
a way to reduce Li Xiulan’s sentence.

76
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
It’s not about reducing the sentence.

77
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,560
It’s about proving her innocence.

78
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,800
My mom is completely innocent.

79
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,680
What are you talking about?

80
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,560
There’s something I’ve never told anyone.

81
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
But I have to tell you now.

82
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,680
I suspect she’s the one who committed the murder.

83
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,120
Who?

84
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,880
My sister.

85
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,320
No.

86
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,800
To be precise, I don’t even know who she is.

87
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,000
She suddenly showed up at my house.

88
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,120
And then

89
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
everything started to change.

90
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,000
She knows everything—it must be her.

91
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,240
She must be the one who killed.

92
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
Otherwise, she wouldn’t have known in advance.

93
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,880
And then she pinned everything on my mom.

94
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
I don’t know why my mom is taking the blame for her.

95
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,560
My mom said she’s a liar.

96
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,680
She’s not my sister.

97
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,560
So, Attorney Lin, you have to help me.

98
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,040
Help me investigate her.

99
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,040
Help me find evidence that Li Meng committed the murder.

100
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
I want to tell all this to the police.

101
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,040
You said this person’s name is Li Meng, right?

102
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,560
Yes.

103
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,000
Then I think

104
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,920
it’s better if you don’t tell the police just yet.

105
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,800
To avoid making things more complicated.

106
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,880
How about this—

107
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,120
Calm down for now.

108
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,240
Tomorrow, I can help you

109
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,560
look into this person named

110
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,120
Li Meng.

111
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,920
Li Meng.

112
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,040
Captain Qin

113
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Didn't Bai Fan already mention

114
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,680
one possible motive for Li Xiulan's murder?

115
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Why are you...

116
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,560
Li Xiulan has already confessed to killing your son

117
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,480
and even admitted to trying to kill you.

118
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,800
Why are you so eager to see me?

119
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
What do you want to tell me?

120
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Why did my son have to die like that?

121
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,680
Li Xiulan and her daughter

122
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,480
are both worthless.

123
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,480
They're lowly, and they still want to harm me.

124
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,560
Ms. Bai, please calm down.

125
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,000
Tell us what Li Xiulan did to you.

126
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,040
Explain everything clearly to us.

127
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,800
She tried to kill me.

128
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,680
She wanted to kill everyone.

129
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,000
She knocked me out.

130
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
Then she threatened me.

131
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,680
She told me not to reveal that secret.

132
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,680
Luckily, I survived.

133
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,560
Otherwise, you wouldn't be seeing me now.

134
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,240
What secret?

135
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Rape

136
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,680
Zhang Xiaochuan

137
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
Once raped her daughter

138
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,800
Isn't that clear enough?

139
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,160
She's taking revenge for her daughter

140
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,120
Then what was her motive for killing Bai Tao?

141
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,680
Did Bai Tao participate in the rape?

142
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,240
No

143
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,240
My son didn't participate

144
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,040
He was forced

145
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
My son is very well-behaved

146
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,480
He's so timid

147
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Bai Tao is obedient

148
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,120
He did threaten Li Xiulan

149
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,800
And he blackmailed her

150
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,360
We have evidence for all of this

151
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,360
When it comes to your son

152
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
You just deny his involvement

153
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,160
Shut up

154
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,360
Say less

155
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,240
Okay

156
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,680
The record of this rape case

157
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
We will investigate

158
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,720
Criminal record

159
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,040
There isn't a single trace.

160
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
No trace at all.

161
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,040
Li Xiulan chose to endure it herself.

162
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
No one forced her.

163
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,440
Officer Qin

164
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,440
You can try.

165
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,040
See if you can find anything.

166
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,800
Are you saying

167
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,120
this matter was covered up, right?

168
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,440
My son is dead.

169
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,440
None of them should expect to get away with it.

170
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,840
I'm the only one left who knows.

171
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,000
Do you still remember the exact time and place?

172
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,200
Of course.

173
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
I'll never forget that day.

174
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,960
1998

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,520
In the fields outside the Shigang County Gas Plant

176
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,840
Officer Qin

177
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,520
How old were you that year?

178
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Twenty-one.

179
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,640
It was from that year on

180
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,760
that everything changed.

181
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,200
Help!

182
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,520
Help!

183
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,000
Help!

184
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,640
Mom.

185
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
I think I hear someone crying.

186
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,000
Quick, close the window.

187
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,400
It's raining too hard.

188
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,080
No, the rain is coming in.

189
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
I really hear someone crying.

190
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,960
Close the window.

191
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
There's no one out there.

192
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,880
I'll go down and take a look.

193
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,200
Sit down quickly.

194
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
It's so dark today.

195
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,080
You misheard.

196
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,520
Young man, sit properly.

197
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,760
The bus is about to start.

198
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,120
Sit.

199
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,440
I don't even know

200
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,640
if it's fate or something else.

201
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
There was a heavy rain.

202
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,000
I really heard someone crying.

203
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,760
The rape case from back then.

204
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,520
That was your motive for murder, right?

205
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,000
What did my daughter do wrong?

206
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,320
Why did they do this to her?

207
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,840
They deserve to die.

208
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,320
Bai Tao, Zhang Xiaochuan.

209
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,000
They all deserve to die.
