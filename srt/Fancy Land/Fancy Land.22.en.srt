1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,000
You absolutely must not tell my mom.

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,320
Here you go.

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,800
You're not leaving, are you?

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,600
Get up, quickly.

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,680
Make her leave.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,120
These videos recovered by the tech department are crucial.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,720
Li Yan behaved abnormally after waking up last night.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,640
She was irritable at one moment,

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
and crying the next.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,360
There was an expert consultation this morning.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,880
They said it was schizophrenia.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,520
The video recorded by the landlord

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,720
isn't 24-hour footage either.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Last night, Sister Xiaoqin and I checked everything

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,000
and found this segment.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,800
If we keep investigating along this line,

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,800
we should be able to find

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,480
some evidence supporting her schizophrenia.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,680
Very good.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,320
Keep playing it, let's see Li Xiulan.

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,320
Captain Qin, it's this one.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,000
Chlorpromazine hydrochloride tablets.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,000
This...

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,440
This medicine bottle is for epilepsy.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,880
But the pills inside are chlorpromazine hydrochloride tablets.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
That's a medication for mental illnesses.

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,720
So that means

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,080
Li Xiulan has been giving Li Yan

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,120
schizophrenia medication all along.

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,600
And then she

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,360
put the pills in an epilepsy medicine bottle.

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,160
Right.

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,080
If we follow this line of thinking

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,800
and collect new evidence and witness statements,

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,160
the case should be solved soon.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,480
So when did the revenge plan start?

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,760
Since you and your mother moved to a new place,

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,480
wasn't it to start over?

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,760
Start over

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,680
Li Xiulan

41
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,800
You never told us before

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
that your daughter Li Yan

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,200
suffers from severe schizophrenia

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,320
So what?

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,120
I supervise her taking her medication every day

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,040
She has improved a lot

47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,840
Does she know that herself?

48
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,960
She forgot

49
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,560
She forgot everything

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,600
Slow down, slow down

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,120
We’ll rent a bigger house

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,200
That way, Yan Yan

53
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
will have her own room

54
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,040
This place is pretty good

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,480
The light bulb is broken

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,960
We’ll replace it later

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
There’s a dining table over there

58
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,760
I’ll go take a look

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,760
If it works, we can save some money

60
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,920
Mom

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,120
Besides being alive

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,120
eating

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,920
drinking

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,320
and sleeping

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,680
what else can I do?

66
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,480
What did you say?

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,320
Nothing

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,040
Let’s take another year to recover

69
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,840
Get your health back, then make some adjustments

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
If you want to practice piano

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,320
I’ll take you to the music store after work

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,200
I’ve already talked to the owner there

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,680
and got a good price

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,200
Yanyan

75
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,480
Mom

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,200
Go to the market.

77
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,480
Tidy up your things first.

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
I don't want her to remember these experiences.

79
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,520
As long as she doesn't remember,

80
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,320
her world will stay simple

81
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
and beautiful.

82
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,920
Isn't that right?

83
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,520
I'm at the market five days a week.

84
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,360
I have to get up at three in the morning.

85
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,080
Other people run their stalls as couples.

86
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,360
They can take turns resting.

87
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,640
But I'm all by myself.

88
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,400
Some people suggest I only work the morning market

89
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,760
or hire someone for the evening market.

90
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
But I can't do that.

91
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,760
Yanyan is very considerate.

92
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,320
After she got better,

93
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,400
she told me

94
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,680
she wanted to make things easier for me.

95
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,360
She found a job at the cultural center.

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,640
The pay isn't much,

97
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
but we

98
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,360
we're finally living a normal life.

99
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,920
So do you think Li Yan herself

100
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,520
sees life the same way?

101
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,960
Captain Qin, you're here.

102
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,960
Are you feeling better?

103
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,760
Officer Qin

104
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,680
If my mom didn't kill anyone,

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,480
would she still be charged with something else?

106
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,800
Yes.

107
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,920
Li Yan, I know this is very hard for you.

108
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,240
What I'm about to discuss with you

109
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,240
might make you uncomfortable.

110
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,360
If you feel any discomfort

111
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,760
you can tell us at any time.

112
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,240
We'll stop right away, okay?

113
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,520
Please try to remember carefully.

114
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,080
When you met Lin Nian's father at the youth center,

115
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,480
that is, before Lin Yi,

116
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,320
are you sure you hadn't seen this person before?

117
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm Nian Nian's father.

118
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
You and your mother, Li Xiulan,

119
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,080
came here eight years ago.

120
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,680
Is that right?

121
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,320
Then can you briefly describe to us

122
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,240
what it was like

123
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
after you came here?

124
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,480
I'm going to the market.

125
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,240
Pack up your things.

126
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,640
Don't go outside.

127
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,520
She often locked me in.

128
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,320
She wouldn't let me go out.

129
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,320
She thought she was protecting me.

130
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,080
But...

131
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
I was so scared.

132
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,440
In my mind,

133
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,240
I would remember

134
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,240
those painful memories from the psychiatric hospital.

135
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,360
Mom.

136
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,680
No, Mom.

137
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,880
Why do I...

138
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,920
Mom, I want to go home.

139
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,920
Mom.

140
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,240
Mom, don't leave me here, Mom.

141
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Mom.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't want to, Mom.

143
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,000
Mom.

144
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,680
I don't want to be here, Mom.

145
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,240
I want to go back.

146
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,680
Take me back.

147
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Mom.

148
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,240
Li Xiulan.

149
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,360
If I die here,

150
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,800
you'll pay with your life, you lunatic.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,360
Mom, Mom.

152
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,040
Relax.

153
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,720
Don't move.

154
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,280
You'll feel better after the injection.

155
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,920
What do you remember about your past life?

156
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
I...

157
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,880
Mom...

158
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,680
Being together.

159
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,240
I can play the piano.

160
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,360
Going to school.

161
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,600
It was very happy.

162
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,000
And then?

163
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,040
I was disobedient.

164
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,880
I was sent here.

165
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
It's not because you were disobedient.

166
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
You came here because you were ill.

167
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,040
What's your name?

168
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,240
Li Yan.

169
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,000
Li Xiulan told me to take medicine.

170
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,120
She wants to kill me.

171
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,600
How is that possible?

172
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,480
Owe today

173
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,120
Yanyan

174
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,880
Older sister

175
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,600
Fifty cents

176
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,680
Etc.

177
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,120
Xiao Jun got rich, also

178
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,360
Five hundred yuan

179
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
Would you like to be friends with me?
