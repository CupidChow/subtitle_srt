1
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,720
The dream has ended, and the sea is calm.

2
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
Doctor, what's the situation now?

3
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
When will she wake up?

4
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,400
It's still hard to say.

5
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,360
Based on the patient's previous medical history,

6
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,040
if she suffers another injury,

7
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,720
the risk is still very high.

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,800
What kind of risk?

9
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
She could become vegetative or lose her memory again.

10
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,480
Captain Qin.

11
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,280
You can go over to Lin Yi's side now.

12
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,080
Xiao Qin, you keep watch here.

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,160
Okay.

14
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,440
Li Yan.

15
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,560
You have to wake up.

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,360
You can't let those bad people

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,720
get away with it.

18
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,920
Lin Yi will definitely make up lies.

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,080
You must wake up.

20
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,080
Lin Yi is the one who ruined our lives.

21
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
I'm the victim.

22
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,920
That woman is crazy.

23
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,800
She tried to kill me.

24
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,000
What we saw was you trying to beat her to death.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,280
It was self-defense!

26
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,080
Lin Yi.

27
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,160
Start by telling us what happened last night.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Last night,

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,800
Li Yan came to my house.

30
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,080
She lied and said her bracelet fell into the fish tank.

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
She asked me to help her get it out.

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I didn't think much of it.

33
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,360
That crazy woman

34
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,640
threw a hair dryer into the fish tank

35
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,440
trying to electrocute me.

36
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,280
And then?

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,720
Then...

38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,920
Then I woke up at the lighthouse.

39
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,200
Why would she want to kill you?

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
I was being kind.

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
Out of consideration for our past as schoolmates,

42
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,920
and because I felt sorry for her and her daughter,

43
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
even the legal fees,

44
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,280
I agreed she could pay me in installments.

45
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,720
In return,

46
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,160
she just needed to tutor my daughter.

47
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,920
Captain Qin,

48
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
did I do anything wrong?

49
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,200
We all know what's going on here.

50
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,880
Let's not pretend otherwise.

51
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,080
That "crazy woman" you mentioned, Li Yan,

52
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,880
her real name is Li Meng.

53
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,000
She was sexually assaulted in her senior year of high school.

54
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,560
She suffered a serious head injury.

55
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,200
She didn't report it to the police right away.

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,080
She and her mother kept silent and endured it.

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,280
Why did your father, Lin Wei,

58
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,360
erase all traces of your involvement afterward?

59
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
I heard from Li Xiulan

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,800
that you were the one who saved her.

61
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,000
If you were saving her,

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
why erase the evidence?

63
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,320
Why go to the hospital to find the doctor

64
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,880
and persuade Li Xiulan not to call the police?

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,480
Why?

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,440
Yeah,

67
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,040
I really did save her.

68
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,600
But this "erasing" you just mentioned,

69
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,600
I don't understand.

70
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,880
Maybe my dad didn't want to make it public at the time.

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,040
He didn't want me to become the center of attention.

72
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,040
After all, I did a good deed.

73
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,200
There's no need for everyone to know about it, right?

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,560
Sun Mou,

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,360
this is the computer Li Yan left at the lighthouse scene.

76
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,280
Does it look familiar to you?

77
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,640
Take a closer look.

78
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,440
The photos in here

79
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,920
were materials I used when defending Li Xiulan.

80
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,080
What's wrong?

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,000
Lawyer Lin.

82
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,600
I didn't ask about the photos.

83
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,320
Do you really think what happened back then

84
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,440
would never be known by anyone?

85
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
Captain Qin.

86
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,880
I have a bit of a headache.

87
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,880
Once I'm discharged from the hospital,

88
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,640
I'll definitely cooperate fully with your investigation.

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,920
Also,

90
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,480
for my actions in self-defense

91
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
I apologize for my impulsive behavior.

92
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,600
I will take responsibility.

93
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,200
How is Li Yan?

94
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,280
Is she out of danger?

95
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,720
No matter what happens,

96
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
the truth will come to light.

97
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,120
Get some rest.

98
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Wishing you a speedy recovery.

99
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,120
After that incident happened,

100
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,400
Xiao Tao came home crying.

101
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,840
What's wrong? It's the middle of the night.

102
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,400
What happened?

103
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,680
You can't blame me entirely.

104
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,560
You really can't put all the blame on me.

105
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,080
I don't...

106
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,840
I don't know what to do.

107
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,560
Don't cry.

108
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,720
It was Lin Yi.

109
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
It's not my fault.

110
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,240
It's not my fault.

111
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Xiao Tao was always afraid of those people at school.

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,960
The real reason he got involved in this

113
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,520
was because he was afraid of being bullied.

114
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,480
Have you had enough to drink?

115
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,640
Not enough, let's have something stronger.

116
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,080
Children who have been bullied

117
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,720
are affected for their entire lives.

118
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,920
Some become timid when they grow up,

119
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,840
while others repay it with violence.

120
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,600
As a mother,

121
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,080
I wasn't able to help him.

122
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,840
I'm truly sorry.

123
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,960
If you don't find these people for me,

124
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,160
I'll come here every day.

125
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,400
Alright, alright, that's fine.

126
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,960
Why don't you dare say who those people are?

127
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,480
If I make a scene at school,

128
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,760
it might make him even more isolated.

129
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,760
Come home with me.

130
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,160
This is my fault.

131
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,080
It's all my fault.

132
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,840
In your eyes, is Bai Tao

133
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,960
a good person?

134
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,840
He should be a good kid.

135
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,480
It's Lin Yi.

136
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,960
Xiao Tao said

137
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,280
Lin Yi is infatuated with Li Yan.

138
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,160
Li Meng.

139
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,960
Your performance will be scheduled as the finale.

140
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Okay, class monitor.

141
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,520
After evening study,

142
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,720
do you want to go out for a late-night snack?

143
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,840
I can't. My mom doesn't let me come home late.

144
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Then what about the weekend? Are you free on the weekend?

145
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,720
I just organized a few classmates. Bye.

146
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,360
Class monitor.

147
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,080
But Li Yan didn't really respond.

148
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,120
She likes another boy

149
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,640
in school who plays basketball.

150
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,600
Classmate.

151
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,960
Classmate, are you okay? Classmate?

152
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,400
Classmate, are you okay?

153
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,080
Classmate.

154
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,600
There's something wrong with Lin Yi.

155
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,840
His thinking is rather extreme.

156
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,840
You were looking for me?

157
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
You didn't tell me he was a bookworm.

158
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,080
Are you wasting my time?

159
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,160
Kidnap a girl tomorrow night.

160
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,280
Eight o'clock in the evening.

161
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
I'll arrange everything.

162
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
My request is a bit different.

163
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,040
He told Zhang Xiaochuan to pretend to rape Li Yan.

164
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,200
So he could play the hero and save her.

165
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,840
Rape Li Yan.

166
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,960
Did Bai Tao actually take part or not?

167
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,760
No.

168
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,400
According to Lin Yi's instructions,

169
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,960
he just went to take photos.

170
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,720
He didn't dare stand up to those thugs.

171
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,720
Go over and take the photos.

172
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,480
Lift it, lift it.

173
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,160
Lift it and take the photo, lift it and shoot!

174
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,840
Weren't you supposed to give me a signal?

175
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,160
Didn't we agree this was just an act?

176
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,840
You ruined everything.

177
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,640
Do you know that?

178
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,080
A rich kid is always a rich kid.

179
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,280
A few thousand yuan just to put on a show.

180
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,160
Are you out of your mind?

181
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,600
That money could get you with her so many times.

182
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,600
A lot of blood came out of Li Meng's head.

183
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,960
This was nothing like our plan.

184
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,480
Completely different.

185
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,720
This so-called plan

186
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,040
was actually just a joke.

187
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,360
A joke.

188
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,520
Is rape a joke to you?

189
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,520
Captain Qin.

190
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,600
In other words,

191
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,640
the incident of Li Yan being assaulted back then

192
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,520
from the very beginning

193
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,280
was just a child's prank, right?

194
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,520
Officer Qin,

195
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
what is cause and effect?

196
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,720
What is fate?

197
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,920
It started with a child's infatuation,

198
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,520
with a senseless prank,

199
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,080
and everyone's fate changed.

200
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,400
Everyone's.

201
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,720
A butterfly flaps its wings

202
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,960
and stirs up a storm.

203
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,480
My son

204
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,160
My son

205
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,520
actually died because of a prank made by others.

206
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,480
He died.

207
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,400
Bai Fan,

208
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,720
at the time of the incident,

209
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,640
even if Bai Tao was dragged into it,

210
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,280
you were still an accomplice after the fact.

211
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,720
To protect Bai Tao as you saw fit,

212
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,360
you made Li Yan completely lose her memory,

213
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,960
deceived Li Xiulan,

214
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,480
locked Li Yan in a psychiatric hospital,

215
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,720
and subjected her to the wrong treatment.

216
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,200
It was you

217
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,520
who amplified the hatred.

218
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,400
It's all on me.

219
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,480
Fate.

220
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,960
What I must pay for

221
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
will come one day.
