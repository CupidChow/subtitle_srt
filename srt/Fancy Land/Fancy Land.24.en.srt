1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,160
The lighthouse is lit.

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,880
We saw it.

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,080
Do you believe the future will be bright?

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,160
You’ve seen it.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,680
So you believe it’s there.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,600
I believe you.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,160
So I believe it’s there.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,080
With you,

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,440
it feels like I have a new life.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,960
I remember everything now.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,960
But no matter what,

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
we still have to face the future.

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Are you still adjusting in there?

14
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,560
Li Yan remembers everything.

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
What happened ten years ago.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,440
The matter of killing Zhang Xiaochuan.

17
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,720
And the matter of killing Bai Tao.

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,720
She has confessed.

19
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,960
You can’t get away with murder.

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,800
No.

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,480
She’s talking nonsense.

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,400
She confessed herself.

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,360
For her own conscience.

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,960
And for you.

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,520
So you wouldn’t take the blame.

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,360
I’m the one who killed them.

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,840
I’m the one who killed them.

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,360
It has nothing to do with my daughter.

29
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,960
It’s okay.

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,360
Calm down.

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,360
We checked the contents of Lin Yi’s computer.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,080
He was involved ten years ago too.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,080
In hurting Li Yan.

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
I was too confused.

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,640
I was confused.

36
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,200
I was confused.

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,000
I should have realized it long ago.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,640
Li Xiulan

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,080
Listen to me

40
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,360
Your daughter

41
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,720
is stronger than you think

42
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,840
She is much braver than you imagine

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,080
Let me show you something

44
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,640
Mom

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I miss you

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
I know everything you've done for me

47
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,480
You don't need to help me anymore

48
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,280
I've confessed

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,920
Maybe you'll be disappointed in me again

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm sorry

51
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,200
But I really want to tell you

52
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,080
I have the courage to face a gray world

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,840
You don't have to make everything colorful

54
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
I don't hate you anymore, Mom

55
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,840
Being my mom

56
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
You've worked so hard

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,960
I don't need your protection anymore

58
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
This world

59
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,640
was gray to begin with

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,960
I understand now

61
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,520
And I've accepted it

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,080
I heard somewhere

63
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,120
that no matter who you are

64
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,680
the last thing you think of before you die is your mom

65
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,280
I miss you too

66
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,920
That's all

67
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,000
Am I

68
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Am I never going to see my daughter again?

69
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,240
I... I...

70
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,800
Am I never going to see her again? I...

71
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,920
According to the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China

72
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,160
Article 236

73
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,160
and the provisions of Article 232

74
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,560
Lin Yi is guilty of rape and intentional homicide

75
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,400
The circumstances are especially serious, and multiple crimes are punished together

76
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,160
Sentenced to death, to be carried out immediately

77
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,200
All individuals involved in this case

78
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,280
have been sentenced and the sentences have been carried out according to the sentencing guidelines.

79
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,240
Director Liu,

80
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,800
there's one more thing I'd like to discuss with you.

81
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,760
Go ahead.

82
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,440
For the purpose of education and rehabilitation,

83
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,680
and in the spirit of humanitarianism,

84
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,240
I'd like to make a special request to you.

85
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,480
I hope you can allow Li Xiulan and her daughter Li Yan

86
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,880
to meet under police supervision.

87
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,200
I just want them to know

88
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,000
that when they face injustice or mistreatment,

89
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
the police will stand up for them.

90
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,120
Qin Yang,

91
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,000
as police officers,

92
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,240
we must do our utmost

93
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,720
to uncover the truth of the matter

94
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
and uphold justice for the innocent.

95
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,400
You are a compassionate and good police officer.

96
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,400
I'm proud of you.

97
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,240
This is also the outcome I hoped to see.

98
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,240
If you think there's no problem,

99
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,800
I'll immediately apply and coordinate with the judicial authorities.

100
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,720
Qin Yang,

101
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,800
this situation is special.

102
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,120
Wait until Li Yan's condition stabilizes further.

103
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,320
If both the judicial authorities and the prison

104
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,360
approve the meeting,

105
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,640
you must ensure the meeting is safe.

106
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Yes, sir.

107
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
I guarantee the task will be completed.

108
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,280
Don't be nervous.

109
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,840
It's already quite good.

110
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
To make sure nothing goes wrong with this meeting,

111
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
I need to record.

112
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,160
Please understand.

113
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
I've done my best.

114
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,160
Thank you.

115
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,040
Does it hurt?

116
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,360
It doesn't hurt.

117
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,600
I'm doing pretty well now.

118
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,360
Mom is doing well too.

119
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,920
Mom.

120
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,560
Your hair...

121
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,120
It's gotten so much whiter.

122
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm getting older.

123
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,400
That's just how it is.

124
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,360
I'll dye it later.

125
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
It looks nice.

126
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,720
Sweetie.

127
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,920
Let Mom take a good look at you.

128
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,920
Sweetie, don't cry.

129
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,120
Neither of us will cry.
