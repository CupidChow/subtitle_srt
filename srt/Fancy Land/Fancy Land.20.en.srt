1
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,040
Why don't you just kill them?

2
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,080
Aren't you afraid the police will find out?

3
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,200
Everything should end now.

4
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,760
You should have listened to me.

5
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,760
Kill them.

6
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,880
Then run far away.

7
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,200
I won't let you control my life.

8
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Then what do you want?

9
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,200
Wait for the police to find you.

10
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,720
And then let Li Xiulan go.

11
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,440
Yanyan.

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
Who are you talking to?

13
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,880
Where is the person?

14
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,040
Where is the person?

15
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,400
Where is the person?

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Over there?

17
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,560
You're talking to yourself again.

18
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,040
Have something to eat.

19
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,880
Where is Lin Yi?

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,120
I tied him up. Don't worry.

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,480
Where are we going next?

22
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,040
If we could take a boat,

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,480
we could go to so many places.

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,600
We could go to an uninhabited island.

25
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,880
Go across the sea.

26
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,960
Go across the sea.

27
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Go across the sea.

28
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,240
Where am I?

29
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,600
Who are you? You are...

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,680
You... don't come any closer.

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,480
Don't come any closer.

32
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,120
What are you going to do?

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,120
Let me go.

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,680
Let me go, please.

35
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,880
Is anyone there?

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,320
Help me!

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,400
Somebody help!

38
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,600
Somebody help!

39
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,120
What are you going to do?

40
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,760
Li Yan

41
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,680
Li Yan, Li Yan, what are you doing?

42
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,840
Let me go!

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,760
Let's not make a scene.

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,880
Can you let me go?

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,240
Let go.

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,480
Do you think I'm still afraid of you?

47
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,400
When I found out my mom confessed at the scene,

48
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
I knew then

49
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,400
you'd been lying to me all along.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,600
No, no.

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,880
I was trying to help you.

52
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,120
Only if she confessed could you be free.

53
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,320
You know I killed Zhang Xiaochuan.

54
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,680
You know I killed Bai Tao.

55
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,120
How do you still dare come near me?

56
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,480
I'm doing this for your own good.

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,240
I really am trying to save you.

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
Let go of me, now!

59
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,680
Hurry, hurry!

60
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,120
No, I won't.

61
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,400
What, just the two of you?

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
What could you possibly do?

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,840
Li Yan

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
Would you have survived until now without me?

65
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,160
The Zhang Xiaochuan incident—

66
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,720
I was the one who cleaned up your mess.

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,840
The Bai Fan incident—

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,400
I helped your mom handle it.

69
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,840
Even after she went to prison,

70
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,960
I was the one running around for you every day.

71
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,560
Shouldn't you be grateful to me?

72
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,160
You're such a wretch.

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,840
Do you even deserve it?

74
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,160
What are you doing?

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,280
Come on, come back, come here.

76
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,840
Come back, come back!

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,400
If you have the guts, let me go!

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,440
What exactly do you want?

79
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,280
Take a look.

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,560
What kind of disgusting thing is this?

81
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,560
If it weren't for you,

82
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,400
my life wouldn't have been ruined.

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,680
Then why didn't you just kill me at home?

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,280
That would have been too easy.

85
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,960
It would have been too easy for you.

86
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
And I didn't want Nian Nian to see it.

87
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,560
You made the child deaf by hitting her, didn't you?

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,240
Anyone who doesn't listen to me

89
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,720
deserves to be hit.

90
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,680
Are you even human?

91
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,440
That's true.

92
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,840
Only someone like you

93
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,720
could live with a clear conscience.

94
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,000
She's here, Yanyan, she's here!

95
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,400
Who?

96
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,120
Who's here?

97
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,600
Li Yan, who's here?

98
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,600
Li Yan, don't go!

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,320
Li Yan, let go of me!

100
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,840
Li Yan! Li Yan!

101
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,560
Who's here?

102
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Don't close the door!

103
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,160
Li Yan!

104
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Let go of me!

105
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,320
Xiao Jun, watch him.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
I'll be back soon. What are you going to do?

107
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Why did you agree to meet me?

108
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,440
Where is Lin Yi now?

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,280
I'm not here out of kindness.

110
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,280
I'm not a good person.

111
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,560
But I have to survive.

112
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,560
I need money.

113
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,440
I need freedom.

114
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,120
But as long as Lin Yi is alive, I can't live.

115
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,720
You're the only one who can help me now.

116
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
I've brought what you wanted.

117
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,800
Lin Yi has been bribing people all these years.

118
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,280
Frequenting adult venues.

119
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,960
Doing dirty deeds under the name of a lawyer.

120
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,160
All the evidence is here.

121
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,840
But I know

122
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,960
what you care about most is the photo from that year.

123
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,840
It's here too. Check it for yourself.

124
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,400
Gu Nan.

125
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,160
Our meeting today

126
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,040
will remain a secret forever.

127
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,480
Have we met before?

128
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,720
Xiao Jun.

129
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,200
Xiao Jun.

130
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,920
Xiao Jun.

131
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,160
Yanyan, Yanyan, Yanyan.

132
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,600
Xiao Jun.

133
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,840
Yanyan

134
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,040
Xiao Jun

135
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,720
Don't move, don't move, don't move.

136
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,040
Don't.

137
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm begging you, don't, don't.

138
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,960
If you take one more step,

139
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
I'll kill him, Yanyan.

140
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,640
No.

141
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,400
No.

142
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,480
Don't panic.

143
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,400
He's still holding on.

144
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,520
I... I...

145
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,400
I... I'll step back.

146
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,920
Don't, don't move.

147
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,480
Step back.

148
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm begging...

149
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,720
Beg me? I'm begging you.

150
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,600
Come on, then.

151
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm begging you.

152
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,480
I'm begging you.

153
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,600
I never thought

154
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,800
that for an idiot

155
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,920
you could stoop so low.

156
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,480
Despicable.

157
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Am I despicable?

158
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,600
Then you really don't know what's good for you.

159
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,480
If it weren't for you back then,

160
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,600
would all this trouble have happened?

161
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,720
Someone like you, used by so many,

162
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,800
been with so many people,

163
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,600
and I still let you stay by my side.

164
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Continue living with me.

165
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,040
That's because I'm generous.

166
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,840
Shouldn't you be grateful to me?

167
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,160
I like you

168
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,280
because I think you're worth it.

169
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,720
Anything I, Lin Yi, like

170
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,960
I've never failed to get.

171
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,720
Never.

172
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,920
And never will.

173
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,080
You just had to make things turn out like this.

174
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,280
Fine, I'll give you what you want.

175
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,280
Make the call.

176
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,040
Call that officer named Qin, report this, and turn yourself in.

177
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
Then I'll let him go.

178
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,040
No, Yanyan, don't.

179
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,400
Don't believe him.

180
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,840
He's a really bad guy.

181
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,840
You are really noisy.

182
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,280
Don't, don't move.

183
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Don't move, you stay still.

184
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,920
I'm scared.

185
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,520
I'm afraid.

186
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,400
Turn yourself in.

187
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,040
Turn yourself in.

188
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,400
That's right.

189
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,400
Let me tell you another story.

190
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,960
Back then, Zhang Xiaochuan and Bai Tao took turns raping you.

191
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,360
I happened to pass by.

192
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,720
I found you covered in injuries.

193
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
I was the one who took you to the hospital.

194
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,520
I saved you.

195
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,280
You and your mother, to get revenge,

196
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,160
teamed up to kill Zhang Xiaochuan and Bai Tao.

197
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,080
But because I knew about what happened back then,

198
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,960
you wanted to kill me too.

199
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,800
But unexpectedly, your mother was caught by the police.

200
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,720
You had no choice but to change your plan at the last minute.

201
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,160
You threatened me.

202
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,600
As long as I could help your mother get off the hook,

203
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,840
you would let me go.

204
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,960
But unexpectedly,

205
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I couldn't help your mother get acquitted.

206
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
So you teamed up with this fool to kidnap me.

207
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,080
You wanted me dead.

208
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,160
I told you to trust the law.

209
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,280
Trust the police.

210
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,040
You were finally persuaded by me.

211
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,040
And decided to turn yourself in.

212
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,840
Come on.

213
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,400
Call and turn yourself in.

214
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,280
I'll call.

215
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,600
I'll call.

216
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Don't listen to him.

217
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,400
You can't call the police.

218
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,040
The truth isn't like he said.

219
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,200
Shut up.

220
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,520
Call!

221
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Hello, Officer Qin.

222
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,280
I'm turning myself in.

223
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,720
I killed all of them.

224
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,720
Where are you?

225
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,040
I'm at the lighthouse by the sea.

226
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,800
Liyan

227
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,160
Liyan

228
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,840
Liyan

229
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,280
Liyan

230
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,840
Yanyan

231
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,360
Yanyan

232
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,280
Good girl

233
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Come to mommy

234
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,200
Come

235
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,800
Mom

236
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,600
Why won't you listen?

237
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,920
It's so nice to be obedient

238
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:19,920
Come

239
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,800
You bitch

240
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,160
Come on, come on

241
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,280
Since you want to die

242
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,520
I'll make it quick for you

243
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,920
Liyan

244
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,200
Liyan, wake up, hang in there

245
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,400
Call 120, quick

246
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,440
Hurry

247
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,680
Slow down, slow down, slow down

248
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,040
Take him away
