1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
That is to say,

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,800
Li Yan was originally called Li Meng.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,400
When she was receiving head treatment in the emergency room,

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,480
she was still called Li Meng.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,400
After she was transferred to the psychiatric hospital,

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,880
she changed her name to Li Yan.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,920
After something like that happened,

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,760
it's understandable to change her name.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,600
By the way, Captain Qin,

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,920
what you just said to Dr. Liu,

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,680
what did you mean by that?

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,680
Back then, someone

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,160
didn't want others to know

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,760
about this hidden past.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,920
They arranged everything.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,080
Let me test you.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,120
Who do you think this person named Lin is?

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,440
Come in.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,760
Sit.

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,440
Sit over there.

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,720
I need to talk to you.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,760
I'm about to resign.

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
So I came to say goodbye to you.

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,280
Will we not see each other again?

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,680
Today, to say goodbye to me,

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,120
you dressed up for the occasion,

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,160
didn't you?

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,080
Lift your head.

29
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,360
Look at him.

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,720
Don't be afraid.

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
Do you like this?

32
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
You've been bullying me since I started working here.

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,840
You used your position to oppress me.

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,680
You made me beg you for help.

35
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,920
And then you humiliated me.

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,840
You thought I wouldn't fight back, didn't you?

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,840
Say something.

38
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,120
Help! Help!

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,320
Help! Help!

40
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Shout.

41
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Scream.

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,200
When you bully me here,

43
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,400
can anyone hear?

44
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
No, please.

45
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,200
I...

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,920
My wife and child, I'm begging you.

47
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,400
Now you remember you have a wife and child.

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,200
What are you doing?

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,480
What are you doing?

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,920
What are you doing?

51
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,200
Maybe I should thank you.

52
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,120
If it weren't for you,

53
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,600
I wouldn't have remembered the pain of the past.

54
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
And I wouldn't have learned to fight back.

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,600
You already have a good job.

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,640
And a happy life.

57
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,200
Why are you still not satisfied?

58
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,800
Why do you still do such disgusting things?

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,080
Why are you still not satisfied?

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,080
You really deserve to die.

61
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,520
Kill him.

62
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,520
Don't leave him alive. Kill him.

63
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,760
Kill him.

64
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Li Xiulan, interrogation.

65
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,520
Only now are you starting to take revenge.

66
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,240
Why didn't you report it back then?

67
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
Mom.

68
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,960
It hurts so much.

69
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,360
It really hurts.

70
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,520
Bear with it.

71
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
Just endure it and it'll be fine.

72
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,800
Be good.

73
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,360
Nurse, please be gentle.

74
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,240
Family member.

75
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,040
Come out with me for a moment.

76
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,120
Regarding your daughter's genital laceration,

77
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,080
our hospital bears responsibility.

78
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
We suggest calling the police.

79
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,960
No.

80
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,760
Don't call the police.

81
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,760
It was my decision.

82
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,960
What does that have to do with Bai Fan?

83
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,640
Bai Fan.

84
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,640
He lied to you, didn't he?

85
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,240
The patient in bed six is still not very stable.

86
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
You need to keep a close watch.

87
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,240
Doctor.

88
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,960
You go ahead and take care of your work.

89
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,400
Is there something you need?

90
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,080
Here, please take this.

91
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,080
I can't accept this.

92
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,200
I...

93
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,920
I want to ask you for a favor.

94
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,800
I'll do my best to treat your daughter's illness.

95
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,640
She's in a pretty stable condition right now.

96
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,520
It will take some time for her to regain her memory.

97
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,240
No.

98
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,080
Then what is it?

99
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,240
What are you doing?

100
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,680
Get up, quickly.

101
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,720
I want to ask for your help.

102
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,480
Let her...

103
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,920
Let her...

104
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,360
not remember so many things.

105
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,040
You're a mother too.

106
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
You can understand me.

107
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,680
Right?

108
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,120
So you only found out later

109
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,600
that Bai Tao was also involved back then.

110
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,280
Bai Fan didn't tell you the truth.

111
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,240
She wanted to protect her son

112
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,600
and made your daughter completely lose her memory.

113
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
Blame my ignorance.

114
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,600
As a mother,

115
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,680
I became an accomplice.

116
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,680
Then why did you let her go

117
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,360
instead of killing her?

118
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,600
Life and death are her fate.

119
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,120
It's not for me to decide.

120
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,920
Maybe letting her live

121
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,800
and suffer the pain of outliving her child

122
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,240
is the greatest punishment.

123
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
You might not know

124
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,120
Lin Yi, your lawyer,

125
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,600
is also connected to what happened ten years ago.

126
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,680
He knows about what happened back then.

127
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,240
He was the one who saved my daughter.

128
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,040
Doctor, help!

129
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,000
Help, doctor!

130
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,600
Hurry!

131
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,800
What's wrong?

132
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,800
What's wrong?

133
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,240
I'm sorry, Auntie.

134
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,920
I was too late.

135
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,800
And then

136
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,360
Lin Yi's father came.

137
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,240
He took him away.

138
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,240
Okay.

139
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's stop here for today.

140
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,800
What happened to Lin Yi?

141
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
You'll find out later.

142
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,880
What happened to Lin Yi?

143
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,320
Aren't you going to invite me in?

144
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,680
Please come in.

145
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,040
Long time no see.

146
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Didn't we just see each other?

147
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
You haven't seen me like this in a long time, have you?

148
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:32,920
That's right.

149
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,920
What about Nian Nian?

150
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,480
Nian Nian went to her mom's place.

151
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,800
She won't be back for a while.

152
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,040
Captain Qin

153
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,800
What are you thinking now?

154
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You suspect that incident from back then is related to Lin Yi?

155
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,240
We might have another case on our hands now.

156
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,040
A rape case.

157
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,680
It's been so many years since this happened.

158
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,000
And it's not even in our jurisdiction.

159
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,680
The statute of limitations hasn't expired yet.

160
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Li Xiulan has to pay for her mistakes.

161
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,920
But those who participated in the rape,

162
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,480
shouldn't they be punished too?

163
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,600
Sorry.

164
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,360
Let's go find Lin Yi now.

165
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,480
Sun Mou, which building?

166
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,280
That one.

167
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,240
Over there.

168
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,160
The whole complex suddenly lost power.

169
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Turning off the switch doesn't help either.

170
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,880
I just heard it at home.

171
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,240
There was a bang from Lawyer Lin's place, did you hear it?

172
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,560
I heard it too.

173
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,040
Right?

174
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
I heard it as well.

175
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,480
It was really loud.

176
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,800
No one dares to go in now.

177
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,280
Look.

178
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,440
What if something really happened?

179
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,600
Sun Mou, go find the property management.

180
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,480
Okay.

181
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,720
Did something explode?

182
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,480
Then we definitely can't go in.

183
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,000
This way.

184
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't move.

185
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,000
Secure the scene.

186
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,520
Go notify the others.
