1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,480
The weather forecast says there will be a typhoon in the next couple of days.

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,440
Strong winds and heavy rain.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,720
We can't go out to sea.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,760
We can't catch any fish.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,960
How are we supposed to run the fish market business?

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
It's so hot.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,040
That seafood will probably spoil.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,720
Ask your Uncle Wang about it tomorrow.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,280
Mom.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,120
Who is Zhang Xiaochuan?

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,520
Who mentioned this person to you?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,800
Li Meng.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,120
Did she say anything else to you?

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,680
Not really.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,480
What did she say?

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Tell me.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
What exactly did she say?

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,640
She said...

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,840
You killed Zhang Xiaochuan.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,680
Are you finished eating?

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,400
If you're done, I'll clear the table.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,640
Mom.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,320
She told me a lot about the past.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,640
Because I don't remember any of it.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,520
Mom.

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,600
Can you tell me

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,400
what really happened between you two?

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,520
Do you really want to know?

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,000
She’s not your sister.

30
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,200
And I’m not her mother, either.

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,960
Or maybe I should say,

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
she thinks I’m her mother.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,160
That’s what you get for not listening.

34
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,760
Li Meng.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,880
I told you not to be disobedient.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,760
It was when we lived in Shigang County.

37
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,040
Was it easy for the neighbor’s child?

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
Her mother passed away early.

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,720
You little burden.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,160
Her dad raised her alone.

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,000
Crying again, all you know is how to cry.

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
Her father’s life wasn’t going well.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,480
He drank often.

44
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Still crying?

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
He blamed all his misfortunes on the child.

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,320
He would hit and scold her from time to time.

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,400
What are you looking at?

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,200
That’s what you get for crying.

49
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,920
Still crying.

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,120
All the neighbors knew.

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,560
But no one dared to intervene.

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,600
I really couldn’t bear it.

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,600
I often brought her food.

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,840
Later on,

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,200
I started to care for her and look after her.

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Whenever I had time,

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,760
I’d take you and her out to play together.

58
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,760
She would sometimes blurt out,

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,400
“Mom.”

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
And then?

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,680
Later,

62
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,760
One day,

63
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
when I was coming home from grocery shopping,

64
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,400
I saw her trying to smother you with a pillow.

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,400
What are you doing?

66
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
What are you doing? What?

67
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,200
What's wrong with you?

68
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,800
You...

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,600
You were too young back then.

70
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,400
So you don't remember any of it.

71
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
She was jealous of you.

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,400
She wanted me to be her mother only.

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,040
After that,

74
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,760
I kept my distance from her.

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,040
She moved away too.

76
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
So you sent her to a mental hospital.

77
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,960
Liar.

78
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,240
After she grew up,

79
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,040
she would come to our house from time to time.

80
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,480
I always let her stay for a meal or a couple of days.

81
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,480
I've done everything I could for her.

82
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
She's a dangerous person.

83
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,960
These past few days you've spent with her,

84
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,480
you should have noticed she's not mentally stable.

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,760
Mom is really scared.

86
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,240
I'm afraid she'll hurt you again.

87
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,640
A couple of days ago, I hesitated.

88
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
That was my fault.

89
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,320
Now,

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,240
she has to leave.

91
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,680
Come on.

92
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,800
Take your medicine.

93
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,400
You're trying to kick me out.

94
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,360
Aren't you?

95
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,080
You're awake. Go wash up and eat.

96
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,480
Where is she?

97
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,400
She left. She left early this morning.

98
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,800
From now on, our days will be peaceful.

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,680
Sit.

100
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:41,960
Wait a moment.

101
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,040
Take your medicine.

102
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,040
Go on, head home.

103
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,920
The scent of orange blossom mixed with white musk.

104
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,600
I hope you like it.

105
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,080
Zhang Xiaochuan is a recently released convict.

106
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,680
In the third month after his release,

107
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,080
he received investment from Huashang Law Firm.

108
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
The owner of this law firm is Lin Yi.

109
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,640
But before Zhang Xiaochuan was released,

110
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,200
we couldn't find any

111
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,120
connection between him and Lin Yi.

112
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,520
According to what we know,

113
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,120
Zhang Xiaochuan and Gu Nan are lovers.

114
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,240
So why would Lin Yi invest in someone

115
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,520
who destroyed his family?

116
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,640
I find this point very strange.

117
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,960
Captain Qin, what do you think?

118
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,040
Captain Qin, Captain Qin

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,400
I just analyzed so much

120
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,600
Do you have any thoughts?

121
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,200
Xiao Qin

122
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,520
Where did you graduate from?

123
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,800
Jiangdu Police Academy

124
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
I've been here for two years

125
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,040
Where did you graduate from?

126
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,120
Me

127
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,360
I am

128
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,280
I'm from Lanhai People's Police University

129
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,920
Captain Qin

130
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,880
Qin and I went to the same school

131
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,920
I'm one year below her

132
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,720
Yes, we went to the same school

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,720
Li Xing from my class

134
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
Didn't he marry that girl from your class?

135
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Zhang Yao

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,880
Yeah, didn't we all go to that wedding?

137
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
But at that time

138
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,680
You probably hadn't joined our police team yet

139
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,480
At their wedding

140
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
I have no impression of you at all

141
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,480
I was at the front desk greeting guests then

142
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,040
Captain Qin, Captain Qin

143
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,000
Do you have any new ideas?

144
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,360
At Bai Tao's funeral

145
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
I saw a wreath

146
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,040
The signature read

147
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,600
Classmate

148
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,120
Lin Yi

149
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,880
Bye-bye.

150
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,880
Wait for Dad a moment.

151
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,040
Teacher Li.

152
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,480
Lin Nian's father.

153
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,480
After Nian Nian got the hearing aid,

154
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,560
she could clearly hear in class today.

155
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
We still have to thank Teacher Li for your careful observation.

156
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,680
As parents,

157
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,240
we didn't notice it in time.

158
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,800
I've been feeling quite guilty about it.

159
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,600
It's something I should have done.

160
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Do you still like the perfume?

161
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,560
Lin Nian's father.

162
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,920
This is too valuable.

163
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,800
I can't accept it.

164
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,040
Thank you very much.

165
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,240
Nian Nian picked out this gift.

166
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
I've never really known how to express my gratitude.

167
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,160
So I took Nian Nian to the department store.

168
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,360
It was a way for us to have some father-daughter interaction.

169
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,560
It's really not expensive.

170
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,600
I hope you can accept it.

171
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,680
If you don't accept it,

172
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,680
Nian Nian will be disappointed.

173
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
Well, Teacher Li, we'll be leaving now.

174
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
Teacher Li, bye-bye.

175
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,920
Nian Nian, goodbye.

176
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,560
What are you doing?

177
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
What are you doing?

178
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,720
Does it have anything to do with you?

179
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,560
Jerk!

180
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
What are you stuffing into Yan Yan's house?

181
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,360
Are you crazy? What does it have to do with you?

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,600
Get lost!

183
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Jerk! You're putting things in Yan Yan's house, jerk!

184
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,120
Catch the bad guy!

185
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,800
Are you a dog?

186
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,040
Why are you chasing me?

187
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,240
Catching bad guys.

188
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,680
Catching bad guys.

189
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,280
About that Bai Tao case,

190
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,560
I still think something's off.

191
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,800
What's going on? We need to check again tomorrow.

192
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,160
Eat some more.

193
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,800
Are you okay?

194
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,920
Are you okay? That person just now looked like...

195
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,440
Looked like Bai Tao.

196
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,120
How is that possible?

197
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,040
Didn't Bai Tao die?

198
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,480
Catching bad guys.

199
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,680
Catching bad guys.

200
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,040
Let's go.

201
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,800
Stop!

202
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,840
Don't run! Police! Don't run!

203
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,120
He's gone.

204
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,120
Gone again.

205
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,920
Wait a second.

206
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,240
Three.

207
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,920
Four.

208
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,920
Xiaoqin, keep an eye on him.

209
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,680
I'll go up and look.

210
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,160
Police inspection.

211
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,760
Hello

212
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,920
Hello, Xiaoqin

213
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,640
Bai Tao is staying on the east side of the Sixth Floor Hotel

214
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Okay, got it

215
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,520
Let's go
