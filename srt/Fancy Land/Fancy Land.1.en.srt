1
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,400
What are you doing here today?

2
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,000
Wouldn't your office be better?

3
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,000
The office is so boring.

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,560
It's much more interesting here.

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,800
Did you wash your hands before touching me? Aren't they dirty?

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,800
Now you think I'm dirty?

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,640
Now you think I'm dirty?

8
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,800
What's going on?

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,040
It's nothing, it's nothing.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,360
The light bulb exploded.

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,080
It's fine, let's keep playing. That scared me.

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,320
It's too cramped here.

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,040
What's wrong now?

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,080
There's someone here.

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,600
Who would be here?

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,680
Hurry, hurry up!

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,720
There really is someone.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,560
I told you, there really is someone.

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,800
You just didn't believe me, did you?

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Come here, come here!

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,800
Who?

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,920
Who is it?

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,560
You should go back first.

24
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,080
Young lady, doing business isn't easy.

25
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,080
Are you tired?

26
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,160
Not at all.

27
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,640
Someone as young and pretty as you

28
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,000
doing this kind of work,

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,160
I've never seen it before.

30
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,640
Why don't you give me your number?

31
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,080
If I want to buy fish in the future,

32
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,160
I can call you in advance.

33
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,080
No need, thank you.

34
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,160
Your fish is ready, okay.

35
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
Here, have an apple.

36
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,200
No, no.

37
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,880
I'm wearing gloves.

38
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,440
Really, no need.

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,160
You have it.

40
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,280
Really, you have the apple.

41
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,960
It's no big deal.

42
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,920
I really don't need it.

43
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,760
I really won't eat it, you have the apple.

44
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,600
Here, here, thank you, take it, take it.

45
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,400
Xiulan

46
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,360
Xiulan

47
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,840
Mom

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,800
How could you be so careless?

49
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,000
Yanyan, quickly go find a thin string.

50
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,880
Your knife has meat residue on it.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
Hurry to the hospital for a tetanus shot.

52
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,080
What does it have to do with you?

53
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,000
We've bought everything, let's go.

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,240
Let me take a look.

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,160
Let me see.

56
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,080
It's nothing, it's fine.

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
How can you say it's nothing?

58
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,200
Mom

59
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,760
It's fine, don't worry about it.

60
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,480
From now on, don't ask others for help with your own problems.

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,600
Mom, let's go to the hospital.

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
You focus on your work.

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,080
Mom.

64
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,200
Let's go to the hospital.

65
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,320
Wrapping it in a plastic bag like that really won't do.

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,760
The deceased is named Zhang Xiaochuan.

67
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,880
Male, thirty-two years old.

68
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
He was the owner of an auto repair shop.

69
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
The forensic examiner's initial assessment

70
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,880
is that the time of death was over ten hours ago.

71
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,040
The body was found by a worker at the shop.

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,880
What about the victim's family?

73
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,440
After the victim's father passed away,

74
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,200
his mother remarried.

75
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,880
All these years,

76
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,760
the victim had little contact with his mother.

77
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,480
He also didn't keep in touch with relatives or friends.

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,320
Notify the family.

79
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,600
Understood, Captain Qin.

80
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,720
Captain Qin.

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,160
Logically, the victim was already crushed to death by the car.

82
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,440
But the killer still smashed his face.

83
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,440
Such a brutal method.

84
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,200
It must be a revenge killing.

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,560
And a deep-seated grudge at that.

86
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,840
What about the surveillance? Has it been checked?

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,720
Yes, it has.

88
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Around 7 p.m. last night,

89
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,240
the surveillance cameras were turned off.

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,560
Where's the person who reported the case?

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
Over here, Captain Qin.

92
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
I was completely stunned at the time.

93
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,200
How did the questioning go?

94
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,200
It's almost done.

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,640
Check the surveillance footage near the auto repair shop.

96
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,480
Take all the physical evidence back to forensics.

97
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,680
Yes, Captain Qin.

98
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
The doctor said you can't get your hand wet for a while.

99
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
You'd better not go to the market these days.

100
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,040
The person who talked to you at the market—

101
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,800
Do you know him?

102
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,520
No, I don't.

103
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,360
What's wrong?

104
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,520
Why did a stranger talk to him for so long?

105
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,640
How's work been these days?

106
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,360
Is everything going smoothly?

107
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,320
It's going pretty well.

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,520
I don't have many classes lately.

109
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,360
So I wanted to come help you.

110
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,320
Try not to come to places like this in the future.

111
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,200
Don't get any closer.

112
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,080
Move along, move along.

113
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,160
Let's go, let's go.

114
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
What happened here?

115
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,080
Stop looking.

116
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,640
Mind your own business.

117
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,800
We interrupt with breaking news.

118
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,240
Shuntu Auto Repair Shop in the south of the city

119
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,360
was the scene of a homicide yesterday.

120
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,360
The deceased, Zhang, male,

121
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,240
was the owner of the auto repair shop.

122
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
At around 11 a.m. today,

123
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,800
Zhang was found inside the shop

124
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,320
and had been dead for some time.

125
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
We're back.

126
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
Niannian.

127
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,760
Mom.

128
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,800
Why didn't you pick me up today?

129
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Mom had something come up unexpectedly.

130
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,640
Didn't I ask Dad to pick you up?

131
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,480
Auntie, take Niannian upstairs to change clothes.

132
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
Go on, hurry and change your clothes. Come on.

133
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,760
Little stinker.

134
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
What's the first thing you should do when you get home?

135
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,080
Wash my hands.

136
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,360
That's right. Then do your homework.

137
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,600
Dad will come up to check later.

138
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,080
Come on, Niannian.

139
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,960
We're leaving.

140
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Where are you going?

141
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,360
I'm going back to my hometown to stay with my mom for a few days.

142
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,760
Zhang Xiaochuan is dead.

143
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,520
You know about it, right?

144
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,640
Really?

145
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,200
So the money you invested in his factory—

146
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,960
You probably won't get it back, right?

147
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,280
I heard he died in a really horrible way.

148
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,400
His whole lower body was crushed and mangled.

149
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Half his face was gone.

150
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,880
That's enough.

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Was it you?

152
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
Why would I kill him?

153
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,880
Because you lost money on your investment.

154
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,760
You want to cause trouble for yourself?

155
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,160
Or because he slept with my wife?

156
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,720
Li Xiulan.

157
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,440
Last month's electricity bill was three hundred.

158
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,840
Li Xiulan.

159
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,200
Li Xiulan

160
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,960
I'm talking to you.

161
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,520
Your shop is stealing electricity from my house.

162
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,000
If you have the guts, then move out.

163
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,200
Li Xiulan, how can you just say whatever comes to your mind?

164
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,760
Look at you, always with that long face.

165
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,320
Ask the neighbors.

166
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,320
Kids get scared when they see you.

167
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,960
If it weren't for Yanyan being so sweet and likable,

168
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,760
I would have raised your rent a long time ago.

169
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,720
Yanyan is getting prettier and prettier.

170
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,520
Let's go.

171
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,320
What kind of people are these?

172
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,960
Mom, why don't we move to a different place?

173
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,080
Find one closer to your market.

174
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
If you don't have time,

175
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,200
I can go take a look after work.

176
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,080
You don't need to worry about it.

177
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,080
Hurry inside.

178
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,960
I'm back.

179
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,320
Mom.
