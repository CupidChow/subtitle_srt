1
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,560
The only thing you can do now is trust me.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,760
You don't have any other choice.

3
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,360
Officer Qin,

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,280
long time no see.

5
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,840
I am Li Xiulan's attorney.

6
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,280
Lin Yi.

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
Since my client has a low level of education,

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,840
her understanding of the law is not very strong.

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
So I need to make a statement on her behalf.

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,720
There was no kidnapping from start to finish.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It was just a misunderstanding.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,680
Attorney Lin,

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,320
have you resolved your family matters?

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,600
Thank you for your concern, Officer Qin.

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,440
But don't worry.

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,840
I always keep my personal and professional matters separate.

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,640
My personal affairs will never affect my work.

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,760
Captain Qin, all the procedures are in order.

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,040
I have all the legal documents required to meet my client.

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,120
If you continue to prevent me,

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,160
from seeing my client,

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,400
then I have reason to suspect your department's interrogation methods

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,640
may be hiding something unspeakable.

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,600
Watch your words.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
What do you mean by "may be hiding"?

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,080
Something unspeakable?

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,120
Officer, please don't get upset.

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
This is just standard language for criminal defense lawyers.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,760
There's absolutely no threat or intimidation intended.

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,760
Officer Qin,

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,760
may I see my client now?

32
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,240
I did this alone.

33
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,600
No one else was involved.

34
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,120
I know.

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,960
I am your criminal defense lawyer.

36
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,240
I'm responsible for defending you against the charge of kidnapping Bai Fan

37
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,320
and the case of killing Bai Tao.

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,200
I will be defending you.

39
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,320
These are the case files I prepared for you.

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,840
Li Yan has already been released on bail pending trial.

41
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,120
Our conversation will be monitored.

42
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,680
But it will not be recorded.

43
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,840
Ms. Li Xiulan,

44
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,320
as my client,

45
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,120
you can trust me completely.

46
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,320
So I hope you can tell me

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,680
all the details of the case.

48
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,840
I hope you won't hide anything from me.

49
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,480
Otherwise, I won't be able to help you.

50
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,040
What do you want to ask?

51
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,120
Did you kill Bai Tao?

52
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,840
Intentional homicide and accidental death

53
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,200
are two different charges.

54
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,760
The sentence for accidental death

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,600
is usually between three and seven years.

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,960
If the circumstances are less serious,

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,600
it could be less than three years.

58
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,440
But for intentional homicide,

59
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm sure you know the consequences.

60
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,800
For the following questions,

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,200
if you don't want others to know,

62
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,640
just lower your head to answer me.

63
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,040
It's normal if you don't trust me yet.

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
But if anything happens to Bai Fan,

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,960
it will be very bad for you.

66
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,080
So I hope you can tell me

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,920
where Bai Fan is now.

68
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,600
Near Lighthouse Coast.

69
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,240
Whether alive or dead,

70
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,080
I don't know.

71
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,640
It's her fate.

72
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,800
Why not just kill her?

73
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
If you killed her,

74
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,040
the incident from ten years ago

75
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,800
would have one less person who knows about it.

76
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,040
You...

77
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,440
You... Who are you?

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
I told you before,

79
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm your criminal defense lawyer.

80
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,400
My name is Lin Yi.

81
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,040
Aunt Xiulan,

82
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm your daughter's classmate.

83
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,800
My name is Lin Yi.

84
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
It's you.

85
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
It's a small world, isn't it?

86
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,320
I also think they all deserve to die.

87
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,360
Right now, I'm the only one you can trust.

88
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,040
And I,

89
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,960
for Li Yan's sake,

90
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,800
will do everything I can to help you.

91
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,800
Please come in, Lawyer Lin.

92
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,080
Lawyer Lin, please have a seat in the living room.

93
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,120
I'll pour you a glass of water.

94
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,840
Alright.

95
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,480
Is this your room?

96
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,080
Yes.

97
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,280
Auntie's case

98
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,480
I looked over the case files

99
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
It's a bit complicated

100
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,120
Will my mom go to jail?

101
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,360
It's hard to say

102
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
The death penalty isn't out of the question

103
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,160
Please save my mom, Lawyer Lin

104
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,120
Since I chose to come

105
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,440
it's because I want to help you

106
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,360
Thank you

107
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,160
Thank you

108
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
The usual fee for a criminal defense lawyer is

109
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
at least three hundred thousand

110
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,160
My fee is five hundred thousand

111
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,800
If we go through all three trials

112
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,920
it will cost one and a half million

113
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,120
But since you're Teacher Nian Nian

114
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,880
I can charge you the lowest rate

115
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,440
So you'll need to prepare at least one million

116
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,680
One million

117
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,680
I really don't have that much money right now

118
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,240
Then I'm sorry

119
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,680
Lawyer Lin

120
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,800
Money

121
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,920
Maybe

122
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,560
Maybe there's another way besides money

123
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,120
If you're obedient enough

124
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,040
I might help you for free

125
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,240
I'll do as you say

126
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,280
I'm very obedient

127
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
But I really, right now

128
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,360
can't come up with that much money

129
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
I promise you

130
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,160
as soon as I have the money

131
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,280
I'll definitely pay you back

132
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm begging you, please help me

133
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,920
What did you just say?

134
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,440
I said,

135
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,920
I promise you.

136
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,800
As soon as I have the money, I'll pay you back.

137
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,360
No, no, no.

138
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,560
Not that one.

139
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,800
I'll do as you say.

140
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,600
The last sentence.

141
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,880
I'm begging you.

142
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,440
Help me.

143
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,480
How do you beg?

144
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,680
I don't understand what you mean.

145
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,480
You understand.

146
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,040
You know what I mean.

147
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,040
How should you beg?

148
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,880
Come.

149
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,720
Come.

150
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,040
The case of Li Xiulan killing Bai Tao.

151
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
There's no way to defend it.

152
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,800
Only I have a way.

153
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,840
To defend her as causing death by negligence.

154
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,040
Or even as self-defense.

155
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,800
She could be acquitted.

156
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Looks like your mom

157
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,120
isn't that important to you after all.

158
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm begging you.

159
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,600
Save my mom.

160
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
I'm begging you.

161
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,680
Save my mother.

162
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm begging you.

163
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,240
Yanyan.

164
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,040
Yanyan, are you home?

165
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,240
I saw you come home.

166
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,600
Yanyan, Yanyan, Yanyan.

167
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,240
Yanyan, open the door.

168
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,680
Yanyan, Yanyan.

169
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
Are you home?

170
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,920
Who are you?

171
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,000
Where's Yanyan?

172
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,360
Yanyan, move aside.

173
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,680
Yanyan, I knew you were at home.

174
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,560
Aren't I smart?

175
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,920
Why are you kneeling?

176
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
Since you have guests at home,

177
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,680
I won't bother you then.

178
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,600
Why are you crying?

179
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,000
Teacher Li.

180
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,560
Come up for a moment.

181
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,120
Director Zhang.

182
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,040
Teacher Li.

183
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,720
Please take a look.

184
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,040
Since this morning until now,

185
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,680
I've received complaints from more than a dozen parents.

186
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,680
It's not been easy for our cultural center to get to where we are.

187
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,120
I hope you can understand.

188
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,040
Director, I don't understand what you mean.

189
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,800
About your family matters,

190
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,240
I know everything about your mother.

191
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,360
But today is the performance.

192
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,240
It's precisely because of today's performance

193
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,360
that all the parents are here for the show.

194
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,000
That's why I have to resolve this issue.

195
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,280
To put it more bluntly,

196
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,240
your mother is a murderer.

197
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,600
If you, as the murderer's daughter, go on stage,

198
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,480
I can't explain it to the parents.

199
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,920
My mother isn't a murderer yet.

200
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,680
Whether she is or not,

201
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,680
we won't use you anymore.

202
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,600
Director Zhang

203
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,680
Lin Nian's father

204
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,720
Hello

205
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,480
Hello

206
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,480
Hello, hello

207
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,880
Is there something you need from me?

208
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,720
My child keeps telling me

209
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,120
how much they love your youth center

210
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,480
and really like Teacher Li Yan

211
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,040
I happened to be passing by today

212
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,880
so I wanted to stop by and express my thanks

213
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,800
It's what we should do

214
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
Teacher Li is here as well

215
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,360
Our law firm

216
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,240
plans to sponsor a new piano for you

217
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,360
I wonder, Director Zhang

218
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,240
Thank you so much, Lin Nian's father

219
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,360
Thank you

220
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,680
No need to thank me

221
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,600
The main thing is

222
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,280
that you are able to bring together

223
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,720
such an outstanding group of teachers

224
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,920
which really puts us parents at ease

225
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,800
You have a good eye

226
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,360
Our child being able to learn from Teacher Li

227
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,040
I should be the one thanking you

228
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,480
That's right

229
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,280
Teacher Li is the backbone of our cultural center

230
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,520
the pillar of strength

231
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,360
Nian Nian's father

232
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,400
I have something else to take care of

233
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,880
Teacher Li, please see Nian Nian's father out for me

234
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,640
I'll head over first

235
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,880
Take care, Director Zhang

236
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,520
Thank you for helping me out

237
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,600
How do you plan to thank me?

238
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,640
Come to my place after the performance

239
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,640
Let's celebrate
