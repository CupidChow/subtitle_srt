1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,600
See?

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,720
Your landlord

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,480
wasn't illegally wiring electricity at all.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,760
He was monitoring you all along.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,920
And we have indeed met before.

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,400
At Bai Tao's funeral.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,760
Although now, I guess we can't call it a funeral.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,560
What do you mean?

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,280
Bai Tao isn't dead.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,480
Yeah.

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,560
Long time no see.

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,320
Who are you?

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,240
You...

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,440
Yeah, that's right.

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
I'm here to see you.

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,160
Did you see the photos I left at your place?

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,640
What photos?

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,960
Looks like that wasn't shocking enough.

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,720
What's in here

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
is even more valuable.

21
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,640
I've realized you and your mom

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
are really not ordinary people.

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,120
Did I underestimate you?

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,360
Go back and tell your mom

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,920
to get the money ready quickly.

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,840
Use the money to shut me up.

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
I'll be waiting for you to come find me.

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,280
What's wrong?

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,000
He said he wants money.

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,160
He has something on us.

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,720
Something we don't want others to know.

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,920
Who?

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,920
Bai Tao.

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,560
He went to find you.

35
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
You go home first.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,080
We'll talk at home later.

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,360
What exactly are you hiding from me?

38
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,000
You don't tell me anything.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,640
Listen to me.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,160
I'll tell you when we get home tonight.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,640
Every day I feel like a fool.

42
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,440
Being kept in the dark by you.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
These people keep

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,440
showing up in our lives.

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,920
Do you think I'm not capable at all

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,800
of sharing your burden?

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,280
Or is everything Li Meng said true?

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Are you really hiding some secret from me?

49
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,280
What are you doing?

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,360
Xiulan.

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,360
Yanyan, you go home first.

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,160
I'll talk to your mom.

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,560
You go back first.

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
Come on, I'll take you home.

55
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,200
Let's go, let's go.

56
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,720
Come.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,560
Come.

58
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,440
What exactly happened?

59
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,640
Let me... What should I do?

60
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,880
What should I do? What should I do?

61
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,720
Tell me, what should I do?

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,160
I have no way out.

63
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,320
I really have no way out.

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
I need money.

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
Can you lend me some?

66
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,040
Okay.

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,560
Okay.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Lend, lend.

69
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,600
I said I'll lend it.

70
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,600
Lend, lend, lend.

71
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,720
What should I do?

72
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,320
Officer Qin said

73
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
that day, someone

74
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,400
slipped something through the crack in our door

75
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,440
and left something there

76
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,600
Call the police

77
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,040
I'm going to call the police

78
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,680
No

79
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,440
How can you let the police know about something like this?

80
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,560
Isn't this embarrassing enough for you?

81
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,320
Will you ever stop?

82
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,600
So many years have passed

83
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,320
You just can't change your ways, can you?

84
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
If it hadn't been for you back then

85
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,040
Shut up

86
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,440
Leave

87
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,560
This is between my daughter and me

88
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,320
It's none of your business

89
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,880
You think you're doing this for her own good

90
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,880
Have you ever thought about how she feels?

91
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
Get out

92
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,760
You get out! I'm not leaving

93
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,440
Leave this place

94
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,320
Leave this place

95
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm not leaving

96
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,360
You're a devil, you know that? Our family...

97
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,200
I'm not leaving! You get out

98
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,600
This is my home! How can you be so selfish?

99
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
This is my home

100
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,880
Get out of here

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,320
Why shouldn't I come in? You're a devil

102
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,000
Li Yan

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,480
Let's go

104
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,040
You

105
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,280
Yanyan

106
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,600
Yanyan

107
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,600
Yanyan, Yanyan

108
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,480
Yanyan

109
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,600
What's wrong?

110
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,480
Mom, Mommy will get you some medicine.

111
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,560
Don't worry.

112
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
Come on, come on.

113
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,880
Come.

114
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,320
Have you checked the surveillance footage sent by the municipal department?

115
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,840
Is there any sign of Bai Tao?

116
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,080
Yes, there is.

117
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's take a look first.

118
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,080
The area near the Yingbin Hotel is a surveillance blind spot.

119
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,240
But we found something.

120
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,080
Footage of the streets near the Cultural Palace.

121
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,880
Bai Tao was very cautious.

122
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,640
He got off the bus two stops before the Cultural Palace.

123
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,840
The one wearing the hat is Bai Tao.

124
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,320
After getting off, Bai Tao turned into a small alley.

125
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,320
He was probably walking to the Cultural Palace.

126
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,760
Continue.

127
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,240
That's all.

128
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,440
There’s no surveillance in the alley.

129
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,560
Do we know where he got on the bus?

130
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,520
No, we don't.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,520
On the road from the Huayuanli neighborhood to the Cultural Palace,

132
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,760
there’s a section where the surveillance is broken.

133
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,880
We can’t access any footage.

134
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,880
Our city just started setting up surveillance.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
People often cut the wires to sell as scrap.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,760
The surveillance breaks down every few days.

137
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,120
Xiaoqin.

138
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,520
Go notify the security department and the police station.

139
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,480
Tell them to focus their patrols.

140
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,360
Also, pay attention to the Cultural Palace and the market.

141
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,560
And the area near Li Yan’s home.

142
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, I’ll go right away.

143
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,520
Any progress on Liang Bin's side?

144
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,560
According to him,

145
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,880
Bai Fan has arranged a boat.

146
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,320
He wants Bai Tao to go to Southeast Asia.

147
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
The boat has been found,

148
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,560
but Bai Tao is missing.

149
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,360
Where do you think Bai Tao could have gone?

150
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,120
We've set up checkpoints at the airport and train stations.

151
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,520
But there's been no feedback.

152
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,320
There are also checkpoints on the highways.

153
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,120
Could Bai Tao have just vanished into thin air?

154
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,760
If you had killed someone,

155
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,320
and clearly had a chance to escape,

156
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,760
why would you take such a big risk

157
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,680
just to come back?

158
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
After Bai Tao came back, he went to Li Xiulan's house.

159
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,240
By the way,

160
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,680
what's the name of the woman at Li Xiulan's house?

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,680
Li Yan.

162
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,440
According to a witness,

163
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,200
someone slipped something through the crack in your door.

164
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,320
They put something in.

165
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,240
Did you receive anything?

166
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,880
No.

167
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,920
Li Xiulan lied.

168
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,680
Ms. Yang, I'll get straight to the point.

169
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,240
Do you remember this student?

170
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
I have a vague impression.

171
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,120
Ms. Wang.

172
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,440
Do you remember this child?

173
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,560
I remember now.

174
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,920
It's a pity about this child.

175
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,560
She played the piano very well.

176
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,320
Back then, the art school

177
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,800
even intended to admit her early.

178
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,320
Who would have thought she'd suddenly get meningitis?

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,880
Meningitis?

180
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,120
Yes.

181
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,760
Her brain was affected, she can't remember things.

182
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,320
She's also prone to seizures.

183
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,440
It's so sad.

184
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,520
Her life is ruined.

185
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,120
She was fine before the holidays.

186
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,080
Then suddenly, she didn't come back when school started.

187
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,680
Ms. Li.

188
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,560
Officer Qin.

189
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,880
Ms. Li, I'd like to ask you about something.

190
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Is this a good time for you?

191
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,320
Yes, it's fine.

192
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,120
No need to be nervous.

193
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,920
I just have a few questions.

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,880
Do you know Bai Tao?

195
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,080
No, I don't.

196
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,080
I've only seen his photo at the funeral.

197
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,640
Officer Qin.

198
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,640
Bai Tao isn't dead.

199
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,320
Then why did his mother hold a funeral for him?

200
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,120
We'll get to the bottom of this.

201
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,080
We still haven't found Bai Tao.

202
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,440
He could come looking for you at any time.

203
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,120
You need to be careful.

204
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,440
Okay.

205
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Thank you, Officer Qin.

206
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,680
If he comes to see me,

207
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll let you know right away.

208
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,440
Alright, let me give you my number.

209
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,320
The things in here

210
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,520
are even more valuable.

211
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,880
Li Yan.

212
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,360
Li Yan.

213
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,760
This is my number.

214
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
If you remember anything

215
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,760
or if Bai Tao comes to see you,

216
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,880
you can call me anytime.

217
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,920
Thank you, Officer Qin.

218
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
I'll be going now.

219
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,760
You reap what you sow.

220
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,640
You get what you deserve.

221
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,680
Since fate won't take you,

222
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,760
I'll do it myself.

223
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,640
At this moment, Bai Tao seemed to foresee his own death.

224
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,560
He backed away in terror.

225
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,880
Li Xiulan, what are you doing?

226
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,200
Are you going to kill me?

227
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,120
Didn't we agree

228
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,320
not to cause any more trouble?

229
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,560
The police are already watching us.

230
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,760
Why are you still doing these

231
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,000
inexplicable things?

232
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,520
Bai Tao isn't dead.

233
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,240
You know that.

234
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,520
Mom didn't kill anyone either.

235
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,240
The things you're making up

236
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,760
will only make the police more suspicious.

237
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,880
Even though Bai Tao isn't dead yet,

238
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,880
he will definitely die tonight.

239
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,680
Then you'll see

240
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,760
whether I'm making things up or not.

241
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,240
An abandoned office building.

242
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,520
It's surrounded by weeds.

243
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,200
Bai Tao chose to meet her here

244
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
to better hide himself.

245
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,080
Because tonight's deal

246
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,640
is crucial for him.

247
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,240
It concerns a secret that's been kept for years.

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
A secret that Li Xiulan

249
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,760
still doesn't dare to tell you.

250
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,080
Bai Tao had been waiting for a long time.

251
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,880
When he saw Li Xiulan,

252
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
he even greeted her with a smile.

253
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,320
Aunt Lan,

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,320
I've been waiting for you for ages.

255
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,680
Did you bring what I asked for?

256
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,200
But he didn't know

257
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,080
the person in front of him wasn't there to give him something,

258
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,520
but to ask him for something.

259
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,120
Don't worry, I brought what you wanted too.

260
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,640
What I want

261
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,240
is your life.

262
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,320
Bai Tao fell like a pile of mud.

263
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Blood seeped out from under his body.

264
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,520
It nourished the surrounding flowers and grass.

265
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,240
From then on, the world was at peace.

266
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,440
Bai Tao also went to where he belonged.

267
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,120
Hell.

268
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,360
Impossible.

269
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,360
Madman.

270
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,960
You madman.
