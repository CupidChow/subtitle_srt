1
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,680
Li Meng

2
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,600
You don't remember me.

3
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,000
You've got the wrong person.

4
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,000
Shigang High School

5
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,640
I don't remember at all.

6
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

7
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Take another look.

8
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,200
You really don't recognize me?

9
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,400
I really don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,800
It's fine.

11
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,960
Let's go, let's go.

12
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,520
No.

13
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,760
Let me help you.

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,000
No need, I can do it myself. It's fine.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,520
There's only one repair shop nearby.

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,240
I own it.

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,920
Let's go, it's okay.

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,880
No need, don't trouble yourself. Hurry, hurry.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,320
But your tire's blown out. Come on, come on.

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,320
Is your foot okay?

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,240
Really, don't trouble yourself.

22
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,880
It's fine.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,280
I've really troubled you, thank you.

24
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,000
You're welcome.

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,320
After you got out of the psychiatric hospital,

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,960
you moved to a new place.

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
Li Xiulan gave you medicine every day.

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,040
Logically,

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,600
if you followed Li Xiulan's plan,

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,760
all of this would have passed.

31
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
So when did you remember?

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,960
Officer Qin, you're wrong.

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
Li Xiulan is wrong too.

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,040
The person who drove me crazy was Lin Yi.

35
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,400
So you've always remembered Lin Yi.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,400
How could I ever forget him?

37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,320
It was Li Yan who forgot.

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Just a few days after being discharged from the hospital,

39
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
I realized it as soon as I got home.

40
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,960
I have to thank Lin Yi for helping me remember.

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,680
After I was discharged, he came to see me.

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,040
He told me

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,520
a story about a redeemer.

44
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,040
But I saw it.

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,760
Do you want to kill them?

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,520
Can you help me?

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,960
Who do you want to kill the most?

48
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,600
Li Xiulan, who hid everything.

49
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,160
Officer Qin

50
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,160
If you were the victim

51
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,160
everyone around you

52
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,440
was telling you different versions of the story

53
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,960
and you couldn't tell who was good and who was bad

54
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,520
do you know what that feels like?

55
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
It's almost like being in a state of amnesia

56
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
You even thought Lin Yi was someone who helped you

57
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,440
The day you saw the digital camcorder

58
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,000
was when part of your memory was awakened

59
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,000
I remembered

60
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,160
It was all done by Lin Yi

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,720
So you're the personality with the memories, right?

62
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,720
You think Li Xiulan

63
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,400
wants to kill off your personality, right?

64
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,760
I've said it many times

65
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
All of this

66
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,280
I know everything

67
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,560
It's that idiot Li Yan

68
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
She obediently takes her medicine

69
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,840
and follows orders

70
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,000
then obediently forgets everything

71
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,440
You've always remembered

72
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,240
what happened ten years ago

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,440
Can you clearly describe the whole process?

74
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,440
Did Lin Yi actually take part in it?

75
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,280
Li Meng

76
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,040
I actually think you are the most beautiful right now.

77
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,280
Like a wounded little animal.

78
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,720
So cute.

79
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,840
It makes my heart ache.

80
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
I want to protect you.

81
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,240
He planned everything.

82
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,440
He raped me.

83
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is this Lin Yi?

84
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,440
He...

85
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,280
Why is he still alive?

86
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,960
Why hasn't he died yet?

87
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,440
Calm down.

88
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,440
Tell me.

89
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,960
Nurse.

90
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,040
I want to kill him. Calm down.

91
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,600
Calm down, calm down.

92
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,440
Nurse, why hasn't he died yet?

93
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,000
Calm down.

94
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,160
Why?

95
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,240
Why?

96
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,560
Look, look, look.

97
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,760
Look carefully.

98
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,840
We already have substantial evidence against Lin Yi.

99
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,160
He has already been arrested by us.

100
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,840
He will be handed over to the prosecution.

101
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,160
Now we need you to testify.

102
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,560
If you do something wrong, you must pay the price.

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Now it's your turn.

104
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,560
It's your turn to explain.

105
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,040
The whole process of killing Bai Tao and Zhang Xiaochuan.

106
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,400
Li Xiulan

107
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,160
It was Li Xiulan who did it.

108
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,600
She knew everything.

109
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
She didn't call the police.

110
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,720
She didn't seek justice for me.

111
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,520
She made me move.

112
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,600
She made me take medicine.

113
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,480
She wanted me to forget all of this.

114
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,840
She is the real accomplice.

115
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,160
Okay.

116
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,720
Let me show you something first.

117
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,400
We know Lin Yi's father

118
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,520
in order to cover up the truth,

119
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,920
bribed the people involved.

120
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,200
Bai Fan used electroshock therapy

121
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,960
and forced your daughter into amnesia by confining her.

122
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,520
And the confusion kept getting worse.

123
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,720
What's the point of saying all this now?

124
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,840
It's my fault.

125
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,160
I was the one who chose to let her forget.

126
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,040
I failed my daughter.

127
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,120
I'm not a good mother.

128
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,720
I... I couldn't protect her properly.

129
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,840
I can't comment on Li Xiulan's actions.

130
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,920
But how she took the blame for you all along the way,

131
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,280
you should know best in your heart.

132
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,280
Li Xiulan faked the shoe prints.

133
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,280
She was also helping you cover up your traces of murder.

134
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,280
You ran over and killed Bai Tao.

135
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,720
Captain Qin.

136
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,840
Zhang Xiaochuan was also killed by you, Captain Qin.

137
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,480
Is that right?

138
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,720
I killed them.

139
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,840
I did it.

140
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,160
I killed them all.

141
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,600
I'm willing to bear the consequences.

142
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,040
I'm willing to bear the consequences.

143
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,720
Answer me.

144
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,840
Is that so?

145
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,960
Yes.

146
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,840
Li Yan.

147
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,480
No.

148
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,840
Li Meng.

149
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,160
So when did you first have the intention to kill?

150
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,760
Because that scum Zhang Xiaochuan

151
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,640
actually showed up again after ten years

152
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,560
and reappeared in my life.

153
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,480
This time

154
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,280
I want those who hurt me

155
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,360
to pay the price

156
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,840
After dealing with Zhang Xiaochuan

157
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,600
it was the greedy Bai Tao's turn

158
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,600
He deserved to die too

159
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
He brought it on himself

160
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,600
After running over Bai Tao

161
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,360
I took him to the rooftop and pushed him off

162
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,400
Then I had Xiao Jun call Li Xiulan to the abandoned building

163
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,960
She died

164
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,480
I killed her before you arrived

165
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,800
You need to leave now

166
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,840
Go, hurry up and leave

167
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,280
Go quickly

168
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,600
Even though I've been taking medicine all along

169
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,920
that heart full of hatred for everyone

170
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,600
has come back again

171
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
After you’re discharged from the hospital

172
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,520
I’ll take you back to the police station

173
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,520
Officer Qin

174
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,800
I know I won’t see my daughter again

175
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,400
I want to say a few words to her, is that okay?

176
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,640
I beg you

177
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Please, I beg you

178
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,360
Please, I’m begging you, is that okay?

179
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,040
Okay

180
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,800
Thank you

181
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,720
Thank you, thank you

182
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,040
Sweetheart

183
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,600
Mom hasn’t called you that in a long time

184
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,600
Mom did something wrong

185
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,280
It’s Mom’s fault

186
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,520
From now on

187
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,840
From now on, just forget about Mom

188
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,360
Mom hurt you in the past

189
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Don’t blame me

190
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,320
Mom is truly blessed.

191
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,920
To have such a well-behaved daughter like you.

192
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Everyone says

193
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,440
that you are so obedient.

194
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,320
And you make us proud.

195
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,680
You look good and do well in your studies.

196
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,520
In the future,

197
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,320
Mom won't be able to stay by your side anymore.

198
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,600
You have to take good care of yourself.

199
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,800
Eat well.

200
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,040
Sleep well.

201
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,800
Work hard.

202
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,960
Love sincerely.

203
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,200
Get married.

204
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,840
Have children.

205
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,960
When the weather is cold,

206
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,920
wear more clothes.

207
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,520
You're too thin.

208
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
And your constitution is weak.

209
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,280
You should eat more.

210
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,600
With some flesh on your face,

211
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,160
your smile will look even better.

212
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,280
Just remember,

213
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,440
you are an ordinary person.

214
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,440
But you are pure and clean.

215
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,520
In the future,

216
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,040
you still have many, many good days ahead.

217
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,080
You must live well.

218
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,520
Be good.

219
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,920
Mom loves you.

220
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,840
At that time,

221
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,960
it was the hateful me who returned.

222
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,320
My sister

223
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,560
never really existed.

224
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,400
You imagined a sister in your mind.

225
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,560
A sister who wanted revenge.

226
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,440
The sister I always hated

227
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,000
was just another version of myself I didn't want to face.
