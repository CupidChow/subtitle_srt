1
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,800
Xiao Qi, go back to the ward.

2
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,800
Captain Qin, this way.

3
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,360
It seems Bai Fan

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,960
suddenly resigned in 1999.

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,040
After that, he went to a private hospital.

6
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,000
1999.

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
Do you know the reason?

8
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,760
Okay.

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Officer Qin.

10
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,080
Thank you.

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,040
Get a chair.

12
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,040
Li Meng definitely won't confess.

13
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Because she knows

14
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,320
Li Xiulan will definitely take the blame for her.

15
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,960
So there's only one way.

16
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,120
Li Meng has to disappear.

17
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,480
How should one face pain?

18
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,760
Should you forget it or confront it?

19
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,400
The only person I could rely on

20
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,120
also stood on the abuser's side.

21
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
Helping the abuser hide their crimes.

22
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,240
What is the only thing I can do?

23
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
Stop pretending.

24
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,120
Do you know what I've been through?

25
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,960
Do you know what I've suffered?

26
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,240
If everything is as you say,

27
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,680
then even the pitiful have their faults.

28
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,320
Li Yan.

29
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,840
You really are your mother's good daughter.

30
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,840
You also think I'm at fault.

31
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,680
So it was you.

32
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
That night, Bai Tao...

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,840
No, back then he was still called Liang Zitao.

34
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,400
It's already dark.

35
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
I need to go home early.

36
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,840
Li Meng.

37
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
Can you help me finish drawing?

38
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,920
Tomorrow I'll definitely buy fish from your family.

39
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,560
Do I still have to deliver it?

40
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,120
No, no, you've helped me so much.

41
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,600
Of course I should pay and go pick it up myself.

42
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,200
Alright.

43
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,320
Can you draw a lighthouse?

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,360
A lighthouse?

45
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,760
He begged me to stay and finish the bulletin board.

46
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,480
If we didn't finish, the teacher would scold him.

47
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,200
There should be a sun above the lighthouse.

48
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,760
The places we can reach in the future

49
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,080
are always full of sunshine.

50
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,520
Hope.

51
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
That sun

52
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,800
seems like the last sun I ever saw.

53
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,840
Who did this?

54
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,800
What should we do about this?

55
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,840
It's not convenient for me either.

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,240
I can't have you sit on the beam, can I?

57
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,040
I'll walk home.

58
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,240
The bulletin board should be fine now.

59
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,120
I'll come back tomorrow to touch it up.

60
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,400
I'm heading out now, my great benefactor.

61
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,600
Back then, I still didn't know

62
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360
what was waiting for me

63
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
was an endless darkness.

64
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,520
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

65
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Let go.

66
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,600
Let go now.

67
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Help!

68
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,760
Shut up!

69
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,680
Help!

70
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
Somebody help!

71
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,800
The one who raped you was Zhang Xiaochuan.

72
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,760
So he deserved to die.

73
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,080
What about Bai Tao?

74
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,840
He deserved to die too.

75
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,240
Help me.

76
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,920
No, Brother Chuan.

77
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,040
What do you mean, no?

78
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
Did you bring what I told you to?

79
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,360
Take it out.

80
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,360
Give it to me.

81
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Take off her clothes.

82
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,040
Take off her clothes.

83
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,720
Go take off her clothes.

84
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,600
Didn't you drink enough urine?

85
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,040
Record her.

86
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

87
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,040
Record her.

88
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,720
Why are you crying?

89
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,680
Record her!

90
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,280
Record her.

91
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,480
Coward.

92
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,360
Brother, Brother Chuan.

93
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,240
I'll record, I'll record.

94
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,600
Brother, look, is this okay?

95
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,480
You killed them.

96
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,120
You should turn yourself in.

97
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,040
I want my mom to come back.

98
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,680
Do you know why I hate her?

99
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,360
Because she chose to stay silent.

100
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,120
No.

101
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,120
She didn't just choose to stay silent.

102
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,120
She allowed others to hurt me.

103
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,800
I was in a coma for a long time.

104
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,600
When I woke up, I couldn't remember anything.

105
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,600
The doctor said I was raped.

106
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,240
Come.

107
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,720
But I...

108
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,560
But I can't remember anything.

109
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,880
All I could see were

110
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,040
a lot of blurry figures.

111
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,920
Eat something.

112
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,240
Mom.

113
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
It hurts so much.

114
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,240
It really hurts.

115
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,360
Just bear with it, it'll pass.

116
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,040
Hang in there.

117
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,120
Be good.

118
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,920
Family, please come out with me for a moment.

119
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,920
Later, I found out what they talked about.

120
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Li Xiulan didn't call the police.

121
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,040
To keep things quiet,

122
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,120
she chose not to pursue it.

123
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,800
When this girl was brought in,

124
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,360
her pupils were already dilated.

125
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,680
She suffered a heavy blow to the head.

126
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
It caused intracranial bleeding.

127
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
And also...

128
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,360
And also what?

129
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,600
When the child was brought in,

130
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,240
besides the head injury,

131
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,480
there was also severe tearing in the lower body.

132
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,600
I suspect she was violently assaulted.

133
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
In your patient's medical records,

134
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,880
why isn't this documented?

135
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,800
She was only seventeen that year.

136
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,240
The same age as my granddaughter.

137
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,800
Her mother kept begging me to keep it a secret.

138
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,680
She said

139
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,040
she was afraid it would affect her daughter's future.

140
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,600
She had no money.

141
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
She didn't know anyone.

142
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,600
What was she supposed to do?

143
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,480
What,

144
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,920
are you going to kill me?

145
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Your knife

146
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,240
should be pointed at the real bad people.

147
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,240
The real bad people.

148
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Wait, Dr. Liu.

149
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
At the time, Li Xiulan said it herself.

150
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
That she didn't want to call the police?

151
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,040
She was the one who insisted on not calling the police.

152
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,480
But you had a duty to persuade her to report it.

153
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,600
Now can you tell me

154
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,240
who came to see you in private?

155
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,560
I only know his last name is Lin.

156
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,240
I understand.

157
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,040
I did something wrong.

158
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
I feel guilty about it.

159
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,360
I've been keeping an eye on this child for a while.

160
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,680
She changed her name.

161
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,920
When she came, she was called Li Meng.

162
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,920
After some time of psychological counseling,

163
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,640
she changed her name to Li Yan.

164
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,680
You should point the knife at those bad people.

165
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,680
Why?

166
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,240
Back then, we chose you to teach the students

167
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,240
because you were obedient.

168
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,720
I know it's not easy for you and your mother.

169
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,360
Are you still obedient now?

170
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,320
Now you understand why, right?
