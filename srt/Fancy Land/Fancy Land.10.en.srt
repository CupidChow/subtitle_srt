1
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,040
Although Bai Tao isn't dead yet,

2
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,120
he will definitely die tonight.

3
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
Then you'll know

4
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,960
whether I'm making this up or not.

5
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,560
An abandoned office building,

6
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,680
surrounded by weeds.

7
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,400
Bai Tao chose to meet her here

8
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,480
to better hide himself.

9
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
Because tonight's deal

10
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,200
is crucial for him.

11
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,600
It concerns a secret that's been kept for years.

12
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,480
A secret

13
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
that Li Xiulan still doesn't dare to tell you.

14
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
You're back.

15
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,680
Where did you go?

16
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,480
Why won't you say anything?

17
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,040
Where did you go?

18
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,640
Well?

19
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,800
Wasn't I right?

20
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,360
How do you know Bai Tao died in the abandoned building?

21
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
I not only know that Bai Tao died in the abandoned building,

22
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,320
I also know who killed him.

23
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,760
And I'm sure

24
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
you didn't call the police.

25
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,200
There's no way my mom killed him.

26
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,600
If you know everything,

27
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,920
then tell me, who was it?

28
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,640
Li Yan.

29
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,920
You really are stupid.

30
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,640
It was Li Xiulan who killed him.

31
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,600
You know that better than anyone.

32
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,240
You're lying.

33
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Don't you get it yet?

34
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm telling you this to warn you.

35
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,520
Li Xiulan killed someone.

36
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,240
Protecting her will only hurt you.

37
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
Stop talking.

38
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,480
After all these years, you still don't know

39
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,760
what kind of person Li Xiulan is?

40
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,360
When she was young, she was someone's mistress.

41
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,920
Now she's become a murderer.

42
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,520
Li Xiulan was never a good person.

43
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,760
That old witch.

44
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,640
She even her own daughter—

45
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,360
Shut up!

46
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,080
I won't let you talk about my mom like that!

47
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,600
My mom is not a murderer!

48
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,520
It's you, you lunatic, framing my mom!

49
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,960
Why are you trying to hurt us?

50
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,520
Ever since you showed up,

51
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,920
strange things have been happening around us.

52
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,920
We just want to live a normal life.

53
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
What's wrong with that?

54
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,480
Why do you want to destroy this family?

55
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,760
Destroy my mom?

56
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,960
Go to hell!

57
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,040
Li Yan

58
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,080
So you can be ruthless too

59
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,520
and go all the way

60
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,080
I didn't lie

61
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,360
This USB drive

62
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,760
This USB drive is the evidence

63
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,640
Do you remember

64
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,080
those photos Bai Tao gave us?

65
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,520
All the videos are in here

66
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,120
He used these videos back then

67
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,360
to blackmail Li Xiulan

68
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,800
and that's what got him killed

69
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
What?

70
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,920
To put it bluntly

71
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,640
Bai Tao brought this on himself

72
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,320
Are you done talking?

73
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
If you are, please leave

74
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,240
Trying to kick me out?

75
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
Aren't you afraid I'll call the police?

76
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,760
If you wanted to call the police, you would have done it already

77
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Why did you know everything from the start

78
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,800
but never called the police?

79
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
What are you afraid of?

80
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,120
Did you do something you can't let others know about?

81
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,040
You don't dare call the police

82
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,880
My mom will be back soon

83
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,800
She doesn't want to see you

84
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,000
I believe you'll come find me

85
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll wait for you

86
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,240
Uncle Wang

87
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,680
Is my mom with you?

88
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,000
You just let her go like that?

89
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,720
Bai Fan's immediate family

90
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,120
applied for her bail pending trial.

91
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
It's compliant and legal.

92
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,800
No, Captain Qin,

93
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,360
this isn't your usual way of doing things.

94
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,000
Besides, Bai Tao hasn't been found yet.

95
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,920
And you let her go?

96
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,600
Aren't you afraid she'll run away?

97
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,680
If we don't let her go,

98
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
how will we find Bai Tao?

99
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,440
Hello, what's going on here?

100
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,680
What's wrong with this door?

101
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,920
It won't open, no matter how many times I try.

102
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,040
Let me help you open it.

103
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
Why does it break every time?

104
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,120
Sorry, sorry.

105
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,160
Hello?

106
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,480
What?

107
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,680
Okay, I got it.

108
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,920
No, what's wrong, Captain Qin?

109
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,680
Don't ask.

110
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,920
Over here, Captain Qin.

111
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,920
We just received a report.

112
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,560
Someone found a body in an abandoned building.

113
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,800
It should be Bai Tao.

114
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,280
Who reported it?

115
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,800
An elderly woman who collects scraps.

116
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,920
She's already been taken to the station for questioning.

117
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,720
Captain Qin.

118
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,960
So, have you compared the details?

119
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,680
Body build, appearance, personal belongings—

120
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,600
all have been checked.

121
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,240
The deceased is indeed Bai Tao.

122
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,920
Hello

123
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
We've found Bai Tao

124
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,560
My son

125
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,280
He's dead

126
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,120
Impossible

127
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,120
Please come to the Chengxi Forensic Center

128
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,840
Qin Yang, stop trying to trick me

129
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,680
Just come over

130
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
You'll understand when you get here
