1
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,120
Bai Fan

2
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
You know better than anyone whether Bai Tao is alive or dead.

3
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,480
Not only is he alive,

4
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
he also killed the owner of the adult store.

5
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,760
That person was also Li Xiulan's landlord.

6
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,320
On August 5th,

7
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,120
you received a phone call.

8
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,960
It was from Bai Tao.

9
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,760
He told you he had killed someone.

10
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,680
But he didn't know how to get rid of the body.

11
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,880
So the first person he thought of was you.

12
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,240
His mother.

13
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,120
Mom

14
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,120
Where is he?

15
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,120
In the car.

16
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,600
Mom, I didn't mean to—

17
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Mom, I didn't do it on purpose.

18
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
This person has been monitoring Li Yan.

19
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,400
So I tried to grab the video from him.

20
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,280
But he wouldn't give it to me.

21
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,400
I—I accidentally—

22
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,880
Mom, help me. You must have a way.

23
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,000
You won't let me go to jail, right?

24
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I can't go to jail. You won't—

25
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,400
You won't go to jail.

26
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,280
I won't let you go to jail.

27
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,680
Get in the car.

28
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,160
I’ll arrange a funeral for you.

29
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,880
From now on, Bai Tao will be dead to the world.

30
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,040
Remember what I said.

31
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Don’t come out.

32
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,320
You still have a long life ahead of you.

33
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,240
I’ll definitely find a way to get you out.

34
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Officer Qin,

35
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Being a police officer is a waste of your talent.

36
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,440
You should be a director.

37
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,280
If you make a movie, I’ll definitely watch it.

38
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,720
Forget it, forget it, just forget it.

39
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,800
I actually considered it before.

40
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
But there are too few good actors like you.

41
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
So I gave up on that idea.

42
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,160
I’ll stick to being a police officer.

43
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,720
After all, someone has to handle cases of faking death to escape punishment.

44
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,840
Don’t you think so?

45
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,960
Bai Fan, you really are smart.

46
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,960
You thought of the body being highly carbonized.

47
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,600
So that DNA couldn’t be extracted.

48
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,200
It’s a pity.

49
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,280
Bai Tao didn’t listen to you.

50
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,040
He still went to see Li Xiulan.

51
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,280
And we happened to catch him.

52
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,840
Call Bai Tao.

53
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
He can’t escape.

54
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Causing death by negligence.

55
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,800
Whether he turns himself in or goes on the run,

56
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,640
the sentencing will be very different.

57
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,680
You’d better think it over carefully.

58
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,560
If my son really is as you say,

59
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,880
how many years would he get?

60
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,000
Causing death by negligence and destroying evidence.

61
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,360
If he turns himself in voluntarily,

62
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
the judge will consider a lighter sentence.

63
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,760
But if he runs away to avoid punishment,

64
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,120
he’ll be sentenced according to the maximum penalty.

65
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,120
I’m afraid it won’t be easy then.

66
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,440
I really don't know where he is.

67
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,680
Why don't you help me look for him?

68
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,000
Stop pretending with us.

69
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Don't try to scare me.

70
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,080
If I don't know, I don't know.

71
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,200
Sun Mou.

72
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,560
It's fine, I didn't expect you to talk anyway.

73
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,840
Sun Mou, go ask if Liang Bin has arrived.

74
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,680
Okay.

75
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,760
Why are you looking for my ex-husband?

76
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,240
Building B, Huayuanli Community.

77
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,320
That's the house Liang Bin bought for his mistress, right?

78
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,200
It's true, it's not under either of your names.

79
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,320
It wouldn't immediately

80
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,880
attract the police's attention.

81
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,760
If I were you,

82
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,120
that would be a great place to hide Bai Tao.

83
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,240
This way.

84
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,880
Liang Bin.

85
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,200
What do you mean?

86
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,640
What are you trying to say?

87
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,800
Let go of me! What do you mean?

88
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
You useless idiot.

89
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,680
Let's go.

90
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,880
Goodbye, Teacher Li.

91
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
We're leaving now. Goodbye, goodbye.

92
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,000
Did you have fun today?

93
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,920
Yes, I did.

94
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,240
What did you draw today?

95
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,040
I drew a little bunny today.
