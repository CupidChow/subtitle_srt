1
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,680
You're awake.

2
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,600
Li Xiulan.

3
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,840
Is my son still alive?

4
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,200
Did you set this up with them?

5
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,040
Did you hide my son?

6
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,040
I'm asking you a question.

7
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,280
Where is my son?

8
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,040
He's dead.

9
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Now we need to keep a close eye on Bai Fan's movements.

10
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,680
Captain Qin, Bai Fan is missing.

11
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,560
His phone is off.

12
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,320
We can't find him either.

13
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,040
Dafei, Xiao Zhang.

14
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,480
Notify the traffic department.

15
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,000
Check all the highways.

16
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,480
Yes.

17
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,560
Xiao Wang.

18
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,280
Notify patrol units in all areas.

19
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,000
Search along the routes.

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,400
Yes.

21
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,040
Dongzi.

22
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,120
Contact anyone you can at the municipal department immediately.

23
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,920
Ask them to assign someone to help retrieve

24
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,280
the road surveillance near Bai Fan's home.

25
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,920
Yes.

26
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
Xiao Qin, stay at home and be on standby.

27
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,560
Yes.

28
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,920
Uncle Wang, where's my mom?

29
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,000
I've called her many times, but she didn't answer.

30
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's talk inside, let's talk inside.

31
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,120
Alright.

32
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,200
Yanyan.

33
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
This isn't something I can explain in just a few words.

34
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,760
Go pack your things first.

35
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Don't make it too complicated.

36
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,480
Just pack enough for a day or two.

37
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,560
I'll take you to find your mom.

38
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,560
The bamboo basket next to the TV.

39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,120
The bamboo basket, the bamboo basket.

40
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,040
That's the one.

41
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,000
Hurry up!

42
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,320
Give it to me.

43
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,200
Quick, quick!

44
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,880
Go quickly!

45
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,480
Hurry!

46
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,640
Yanyan.

47
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,040
Sit in the back.

48
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,400
Uncle Wang

49
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,080
The police called me.

50
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,080
Don't answer.

51
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,080
Turn off your phone, Yanyan.

52
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,520
Uncle Wang

53
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,080
Did my mom kill someone?

54
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
You know, don't you?

55
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,080
Right?

56
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,520
Yanyan

57
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,920
There's some misunderstanding here.

58
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,360
Don't ask so many questions right now.

59
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,960
Come with me, your mom is waiting for you.

60
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,840
City surveillance shows

61
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,120
Bai Fan was likely kidnapped by Li Xiulan.

62
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,640
A detention warrant has been requested.

63
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,240
Everyone, move out immediately.

64
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,200
Split up and search.

65
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,240
Make sure within twenty-four hours

66
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,640
to find Li Xiulan and Bai Fan.

67
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
She hasn't set up her stall these past two days?

68
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,240
I didn't notice.

69
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,520
Thank you.

70
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,320
Is there any?

71
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,760
No.

72
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,600
Go upstairs.

73
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,800
Didn't get any information.

74
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,640
Let's go.

75
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,960
Do you have any water?

76
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,120
I'm thirsty.

77
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,480
You killed my son.

78
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,560
I killed you.

79
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,920
If you have the guts, kill me.

80
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
You think I won't?

81
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,240
If I could kill Bai Tao,

82
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,480
I can kill you too.

83
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,120
How could you bring yourself to do it?

84
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
How could you bring yourself to do it?

85
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,360
You should ask your son that.

86
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,360
If I had known he would turn into a monster,

87
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,120
I should have killed him long ago.

88
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,920
Back then, I was the one who wronged you.

89
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,800
It was all my fault.

90
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,920
I've already paid the price.

91
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,600
Can you let me go now?

92
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,680
There's nothing inside either.

93
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,480
Nothing at the market either.

94
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,240
Nothing at home either.

95
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,480
The captain is here.

96
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,440
What's going on?

97
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,120
Captain Qin.

98
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,920
All the places Li Xiulan might have gone

99
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,600
we've already checked.

100
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,680
There are no leads.

101
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,120
Li Yan didn't come to work either.

102
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,680
We can't reach her by phone.

103
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,680
Any feedback from the transportation department?

104
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,800
No.

105
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,680
We haven't received any

106
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,040
information about Li Xiulan leaving the city.

107
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,800
But at the market,

108
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,240
we found out something.

109
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,680
Not sure if it's related to Li Xiulan.

110
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
The market.

111
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,680
Got it.

112
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Get in the car, come with me.

113
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,120
You should go. Don't worry about what happens next.

114
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,920
If I don't take care of it, who will?

115
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,040
It's already come to this.

116
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,120
You're still drawing lines with me?

117
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,800
I've been with you for so many years.

118
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,600
I don't owe you anything.

119
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,040
Hurry up and go back.

120
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,920
If the police ask, just say

121
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
that I stole the car.

122
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,720
Xiulan.

123
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
I'm already involved in this.

124
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
I can't get out now.

125
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
And I've already said

126
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,800
that I did all this willingly.

127
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,920
Let me say it again.

128
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,480
My business is none of your concern.

129
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,040
Go.

130
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,040
Why are you being so stubborn?

131
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,680
I just can't get through to you.

132
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,360
I'm doing this for you and your daughter.

133
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,240
I really don't want anything to happen to you.

134
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
I don't need your kindness.

135
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,360
If something happens to me, it's no one's fault.

136
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,480
We're just using each other.

137
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,440
I've gotten what I needed from you.

138
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,240
I don't need you anymore.

139
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,120
Do you understand?

140
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,920
You cripple.

141
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,920
You think I actually like you?

142
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,920
Get lost.

143
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,800
The farther you are from me, the better.

144
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,040
Xiulan.

145
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,880
Xiulan.

146
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,680
Are you okay?

147
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,360
Get out of here! Go away!

148
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,240
I said get out of here!

149
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,360
You cripple.

150
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,040
Don't let me see you again.

151
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,800
Xiulan.

152
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,040
Stop following me.

153
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,360
Xiulan

154
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,920
Xiulan

155
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,800
Everything is packed up.

156
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,800
Mom.

157
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,440
Why did you kill Bai Tao?

158
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,680
Aunt Lan.

159
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,440
For you and your precious daughter,

160
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,560
I got these videos.

161
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,480
It really took a lot of effort.

162
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,880
Now I’m asking you for

163
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,560
two hundred thousand. That’s not too much, right?

164
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
I don’t have that much money.

165
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
No money?

166
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
I heard that online these days,

167
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,160
a lot of people like these kinds of videos.

168
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,360
If I sell them,

169
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,240
I could make quite a bit, couldn’t I?

170
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,480
What are you doing?

171
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
Robbing me in broad daylight?

172
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,920
Li Xiulan.

173
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,880
I’ve given you enough respect.

174
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,240
I even call you Aunt Lan.

175
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,040
Why do you have to be so shameless?

176
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,040
Give it to me.

177
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,160
If you hurt me today,

178
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,720
Give it to me.

179
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
My mom won’t let you off.

180
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,600
Pull me up.

181
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,600
Help me!

182
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,720
Give me the stuff.

183
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,800
Pull me up first.

184
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,120
Give me the stuff.

185
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,680
I’m telling you, Li Xiulan,

186
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,720
these are only some of the videos.

187
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,240
If you don’t pull me up,

188
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,560
you can forget about getting the rest.

189
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,800
Pull me up.

190
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,600
Help me!

191
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,920
Some people

192
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,360
once their desires are satisfied

193
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,560
become a bottomless pit

194
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
unless they die

195
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,000
otherwise, it will never end

196
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,560
so I chose to let go

197
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I won't let anyone hurt you

198
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,440
Silly girl

199
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,720
With mom here, there's nothing to fear

200
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,040
Mom has already made all the arrangements

201
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,040
Let's move somewhere else to live

202
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,280
Wherever mom is

203
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
that's where home is

204
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,160
Hello

205
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,040
The police have gone to the dock

206
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,040
Who are you

207
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,400
The number you have dialed is not in service
