00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why is he so stupid?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He sent you to be a bastard.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Madam, get up first.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm Zheng Kun.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You killed my son.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll beat you to death.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Your son killed someone.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And he raped someone's wife.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You blame him.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who made him like this?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You should go find someone.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Madam, think about it.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
These days, did he do anything strange?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Did he tell you anything?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What can he tell me?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
These days, he doesn't even know

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
that I'm dead.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Since he was a bastard,

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
he's not even human.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What a bad luck!

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Say it!

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I said it's not me.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why don't you believe me?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't believe you.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hu San is your master.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He's the one who killed Juan.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He's so bold.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You...

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Master.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Master, I won't let him in.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What are you doing?

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Come on, boy.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're wearing this shabby dress.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You don't even care about me.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Master Li is right.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Zhou Da is dead.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Can't I investigate the case?

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Investigate the case?

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who?

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Me?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Did I kill him?

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Didn't Hu San stay with you before he killed him?

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He went crazy all of a sudden.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What does it have to do with me?

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Am I his father?

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Wu Ren Kun,

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
you're pitiful.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let me tell you a secret.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I stayed at Wang Xiaohua's house

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
until dawn that day.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I didn't have time to go out.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You got the wrong person.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Wang Xiaohua.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Wang Xiaohua.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So those rumors are true.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You...

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Did you hear that?

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My son didn't stay with Hu San.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You...

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I heard that

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you like Juan.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What?

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Are you afraid that I'll take him away?

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're messing with me.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Do you have evidence?

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And you.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll kill you if you don't believe me.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Are you okay?

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Get out if you're okay.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Push.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you really at Wang Xiaohua's place?

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Father,

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I just want to try.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Go and sit.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go and sit.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Master Wu has made a plan.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If I drown you,

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
if you dare to touch Juan again,

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you'll be dead.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Father,

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
why are you afraid of him?

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What else can he do with that old man?

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Keep your mouth shut.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
After all, our family is an outsider.

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The dragon won't bite the snake.

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's also an outsider.

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You...

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Shut up.

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You hit me.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't use it.

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Change the knife.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Chop me.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come on.

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Give me a hand.

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Xiyou,

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
it's you again.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You,

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
learn from me.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Is it really Husser?

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's not that bold, is he?

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're right.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You mean

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
someone saw Juan's accident that night.

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Li Zhenzu came out of Wang Xiaohua's house in the middle of the night.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Is it possible that he went out in the middle of the night

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and then came back to Wang Xiaohua's house

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
before the third day?

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Husser was originally Li Zhenzu's subordinate.

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So Li Zhenzu deliberately left Husser in the Lost Soul Formation

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to prove himself.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's not impossible.

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And Wang Xiaohua.

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If we look for him,

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
he won't tell the truth.

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And he will also clean up the mess,

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
which will make Li Zhenzu more alert.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Brother Chun,

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
we've asked everything we should.

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not a good idea to keep looking for him.

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Can we really find him?

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why are you always here?

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Where are you going?

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Officer Wu,

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
are you falling in love with me?

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No.

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I definitely don't mean that.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then you're so affectionate with me.

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We're just here to find you.

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You three?

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm not allowed to do that.

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Where are you going?

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We're here to ask you something.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Ask me something?

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Then ask me.

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm busy.

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Have you been here recently?

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No.

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So quickly?

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Where is Li Zhenzu?

144
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He hasn't been here for a long time.

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He thinks that our girls are so vulgar.

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He's not as good as the little widow

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and the rich and rich.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Why don't you think about it more carefully?

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What's there to think about?

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How big is Huli Town?

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How many men are there in this town?

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Which position does this man have?

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What kind of behavior does he have?

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't know.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I know which position

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and what shape he has.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Not to mention this little bastard.

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Are you sure you remember it correctly?

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Officer Hu,

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the biggest feature of me

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
is that I have a good memory.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's like someone said,

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Officer Hu,

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
you're still a child.

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You...

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Life is in the air.

167
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't fool us.

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Who is this little bastard?

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's the first time he's been to our Chunxiang House, right?

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They all say that

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the monk from outside can read the scriptures.

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I wonder

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
if the man from outside

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
will be more useful.

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Boss Chen.

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You scared me.

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You scared me, Kun.

178
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why are you laughing?

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Kun,

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
you're really...

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

182
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Tong Zi.

183
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I...

184
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't be angry.

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This little bastard has never been here.

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He doesn't look like he's talking

187
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
when he looks like this.

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's a blood fox.

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Blood fox is bewitched.

190
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Tomorrow, the Ruyin Taoist will ask me

191
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
to help him with the grand master.

192
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I have to get rid of that dead man.

193
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I have a lot of things to do.

194
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll go first.

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That corpse

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
doesn't have any sense at all.

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's burnt like this.

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Who agreed?

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You have to ask Mr. Hu.

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The corpse is a dead man.

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What corpse is a dead man?

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My brain is spinning slowly.

204
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're a brainless man.

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Kun.

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Didn't he just say it?

207
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Is he going to

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
go to Mr. Hu for a complaint?

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's go.

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Where are you going?

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
To find Mr. Hu.

212
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Mr. Hu.

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Before the Yang family

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
accuses you of blackmail,

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
let's get this clear first.

216
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Come on.

217
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You're so kind.

218
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I think you should go to find Juan.

219
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
