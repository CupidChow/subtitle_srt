00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He did such a thing?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hu Li Zhen did something strange again.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What do you think is wrong with him?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Master Hu,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
how did this big cow get crazy?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And why did he kill the cat?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Speaking of big cows,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
this one is also a mystery.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It was probably two years ago.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The big cow and a girl named Li Lian

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
got engaged.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Li Lian was very handsome.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Many men were chasing her.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But she really liked big cows.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
One day,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Li Lian went to her sister's house.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When she came back,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
someone saw her on the way.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But she didn't get home very late.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So the big cow went out to look for her.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Lian Er!

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Lian Er!

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Lian Er!

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Lian Er!

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I want to help you!

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Lian Er!

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's the little fox.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The big cow killed the cat.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In fact, in her heart,

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
she killed the fox

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to avenge Li Lian.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What a poor man.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What about Li Lian?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How did she die?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We didn't find out.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Li Lian must have met a bad person

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and died.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Met a bad person?

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What about Li Lian?

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How did she die?

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We didn't find out.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
She was killed.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Met a bad person?

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Li Zhen did it?

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who else can be in the Fox Town?

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Many people are familiar with it.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But there is no evidence.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mr. Hu, I'll go first.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You rest early.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Say it.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Master,

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
this is the well

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
next to Wang Xiaohua's death.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Find a place where there is no one.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Get rid of it.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And,

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
who knows the secret of Master Zhenzuo

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
is Hu Xiaoyun.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hui Niang,

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm going back.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
After revenge,

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll take you to find the best doctor in the world.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sure I can cure you.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I haven't seen you for so long.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You've grown up.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If you hadn't taken care of me in Nanyang,

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm afraid I would have died there long ago.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
From that time,

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I swore in my heart

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that I would grow up quickly,

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
grow up quickly,

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and then get you out of Nanyang.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's get out of Nanyang

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and come back to avenge together.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We have to kill Hu Xiaoyun.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Otherwise,

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the things that Zhenzuo did

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
will be buried sooner or later.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The villagers will know

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that there is no blood fox.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It was because of the people killed by Zhenzuo

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that the blood fox was exposed.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Dad,

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I always feel that there is a pair of eyes behind us

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
staring at us.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I have the same feeling.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The woman who was killed by the wind was strange.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It seems that someone is making a big mistake.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't worry about Hu Xiaoyun.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I will solve it.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can't do it.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is there anyone?

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Help!

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Help!

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Help!

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What's wrong?

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Master Hu, what's wrong?

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She is hurt.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What's wrong?

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Xiaoyun.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Xiaoyun, why are you so confused?

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
She is old.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
She is not so sharp.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I am really worried that someone will see her.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now I think about it,

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I am really scared.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
By the way,

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
there is another person.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We must pay more attention to her.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You mean...

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What's wrong, Hu?

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You are in such a hurry to find me.

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Do you miss me?

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When do you plan to leave?

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Officer Hu,

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
are you so rude?

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If you can leave, then leave now.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you don't leave, be careful.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I came to find me specially.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I said that you offended the Li family.

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I am afraid that they will be accused.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The Li family?

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What did I tell you?

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What did you say?

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Nothing.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You haven't congratulated me yet.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Congratulations.

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
When will you treat me to a wedding dinner?

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What wedding dinner?

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I heard that last night...

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You didn't do anything.

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You just drank too much.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I heard that Mr. Hu had a fight with Juan.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is Juan okay?

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He said that he is yours now.

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Although he is so angry,

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
in my opinion,

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
it will be too late for Juan to marry you.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What are you talking about?

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Father,

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I thought about it.

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We can't keep this Yang Nan.

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I suspect that he kidnapped Zuo'er.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have been thinking about

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
what happened these days.

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't understand two things.

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Who kidnapped Zuo'er?

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And who kept the letter?

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You mean the letter about the blood?

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You suspect him?

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He said that I saved his life.

158
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He shouldn't have cursed me.

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Maybe he knows our relationship.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No.

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Unless he hears

162
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
what the formation team did to me and Juan,

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
who will believe it?

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What?

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If he knew that

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you saved his life,

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
it was his trick.

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You mean he wanted to get close to me?

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No way.

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If I didn't arrive in time,

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
his blood would have been all over the place.

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Besides,

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
if Juan was not in trouble,

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
he would have left the next day.

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Who is it?

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Open the door.

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm looking for Li Chenzu.

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Where is Li Chenzu?

179
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No.

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Li Chenzu.

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What are you doing?

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How dare you?

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Get him out.

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Go.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You killed my son.

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Go.

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What are you talking about?

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You are so heartless.

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
My son treated you like a slave.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You are worse than my son.

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Go.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Go.

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How dare you push me?

194
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
My son is dead.

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What strength do I have?

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Our family is in a dead end.

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll kill you.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you crazy?

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll kill you.

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Move.

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll kill you.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Stop.

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you doing?

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Go to see Dr. Huang.

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Go.

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Go.

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Go.

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Go.
