1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,640
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,480
I didn't expect

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,040
you've been looking for your enemy for so many years.

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,160
It's actually him.

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,920
Master also knows Hu Changshan.

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,160
We had a meeting a few years ago.

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,600
But you've decided

29
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,920
to do this?

30
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,880
Wu He and Hui Niao were killed by the family.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can't help but

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,280
avenge these grudges,

33
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,320
these hatreds.

34
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,520
You've been looking for your enemy for so many years.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,920
You never thought

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,200
he'd become your savior.

37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,800
He owes you a life and has already paid you back.

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,560
He

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
did cause you to be ruined.

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
You're going to avenge his family.

41
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,280
This is your cause.

42
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,720
I know you've been trying to

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,520
put an end to my hatred.

44
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,760
To be honest,

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,640
I was really grateful

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,680
for his help that day.

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,120
Especially when I woke up

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,800
and found out that he had done so many good deeds in Hulizhen.

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,680
I wanted to give up,

50
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,800
but I couldn't.

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,520
But don't worry, Master.

52
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,240
I won't kill the innocent for revenge.

53
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,480
Amitabha.

54
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,720
I want

55
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,480
a mask that tears his good deeds in public.

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
I've already got a plan.

57
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,840
But

58
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,000
I need your help.

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,680
I can ask you about the situation.

60
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,760
As long as you don't kill me.

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,960
Master.

62
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,960
Master.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
Master.

64
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,360
Master.

65
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,480
Master.

66
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,320
Master.

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,160
Master.

68
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,080
Master.

69
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,960
Master.

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,800
Master.

71
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Master.

72
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Master.

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,560
Master.

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,440
Master.

75
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,320
Master.

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,200
Master.

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,160
Master.

78
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,160
Master.

79
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,080
Master.

80
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Master.

81
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,000
Master.

82
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,960
Master.

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,920
Master.

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,880
Master.

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,800
Master.

86
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,840
Master.

87
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,800
Master.

88
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,800
Master.

89
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Master.

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,400
Master.

91
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,880
Master.

92
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,560
I don't know.

93
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,280
Isn't Dr. Huang here today?

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,200
I don't know.

95
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,480
I don't know.

96
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,480
Hu Xiaoyun?

97
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,800
I don't know.

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
Who is that?

99
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,760
Brother Zu.

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Is there any search on the roadside?

101
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,760
No search on the roadside.

102
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,880
What?

103
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,840
There's no search on the roadside.

104
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,400
Brother Zu.

105
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,680
What's wrong? Do you miss your uncle?

106
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,600
You don't know? I've been busy all day.

107
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,920
Hey.

108
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,680
Give me the medicine.

109
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,520
Let me see. Let me see, Brother Zuo.

110
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
Here.

111
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,920
Come here.

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,240
Don't be shy. Come here.

113
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,560
Brother Zuo, this medicine...

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,360
Can you give it to me?

115
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,960
Yes, I can.

116
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,560
Go and give it to him.

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,560
Brother, don't be shy.

118
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,400
I'll come and get the medicine later.

119
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,120
Hey, I'm shy.

120
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,200
Wait for me.

121
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,720
Go.

122
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
Wangji Danggui.

123
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,880
Keep your voice down.

124
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,160
Is this the way to do it?

125
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,920
You know it too.

126
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Don't say it out.

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
Hu Xiaoyun.

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,160
I'm talking about Husser.

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,640
Husser?

130
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,960
What's wrong with Husser?

131
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
I don't know.

132
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,960
I don't know anything.

133
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,200
Do you need anything else?

134
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,240
I'll get some medicine for your injury.

135
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,920
Okay.

136
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Hurry.

137
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Hurry.

138
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Where are you going?

139
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Your home.

140
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Juer, what are you doing?

141
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Juer, let's have dinner tonight.

142
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Juer, give me a chance.

143
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Get out of my way.

144
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
I miss you so much.

145
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
You...

146
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Who is it?

147
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Who?

148
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Me.

149
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Juer, let's go.

150
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
You...

151
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Come here.

152
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Wait.

153
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
You go back first.

154
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
I'm in good shape today.

155
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
I can go to see Wang Xiaohua.

156
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
You...

157
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Find me a better place.

158
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Go to my father's house.

159
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Don't worry. I'll definitely go.

160
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
I'll give up.

161
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
If my father hits me again,

162
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
I'll eat you.

163
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Get out.

164
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Brother Kun,

165
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
I heard that the blood fox is here again.

166
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,920
Is it true?

167
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,920
I don't understand either.

168
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Juer, I saw it.

169
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Don't be afraid of them.

170
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Be careful.

171
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
They can do anything.

172
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
You know that.

173
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Why did you let him go?

174
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I know that you can't blame him.

175
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
My grandfather is so powerful.

176
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
He can't do anything.

177
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
What can you do?

178
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Juer,

179
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
before we came to Huli Town,

180
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
what did your grandfather do?

181
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
He used to do big business in Shanghai.

182
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,920
He opened a big store.

183
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,920
He gave him a lot of respect.

184
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
You were young then.

185
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I was still young.

186
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
My grandfather said that my father died.

187
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Shanghai was in chaos.

188
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,920
He took me from Shanghai to here.

189
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
No wonder.

190
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Everyone said that Mr. Hu had seen the world.

191
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
He was kind and did things well.

192
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Without him,

193
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
the Li family would be so arrogant.

194
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I told my grandfather many times

195
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
to let him clean up the Li family.

196
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
I heard that

197
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
it's better to have more friends and more ways.

198
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
It's better to have a family.

199
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
As long as the Li family is not too arrogant,

200
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
let him go.

201
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
In my opinion,

202
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
my grandfather is old.

203
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
He is too timid.

204
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Juer,

205
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
the Li family is indeed big.

206
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Mr. Hu didn't clean up the Li family.

207
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Let's hide from them.

208
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Brother Xiao Kun,

209
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
if they bully me,

210
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
will you help me?

211
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
As long as he breaks the law,

212
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
I'll arrest him.

213
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
I knew you would say that.

214
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Brother Xiao Kun,

215
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,920
do you like me?

216
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Mutou,

217
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
actually,

218
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I like you.

219
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Li Zhenzu.

220
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
Brother Zuo,

221
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,920
did you say you would accompany me today?

222
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Don't move.

223
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Today is the first day of the first month.

224
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
I have nothing to do.

225
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
You said you would accompany me.

226
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Look at this.

227
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I'm so tired.

228
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
I'm so tired.

229
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
You said you would accompany me.

230
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Look at the blood of the foxes in the town.

231
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
They are afraid.

232
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Besides,

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
he is not at home today.

234
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
It's not suitable today.

235
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
I'm leaving.

236
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,920
It's not tomorrow morning.

237
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Tomorrow?

238
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Today is not the first day of the first month.

239
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Yes, Zuo.

240
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
I'm leaving.

241
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Why are you so anxious

242
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
to say tomorrow?

243
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I'm leaving.

244
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I'm leaving.

245
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm leaving.

246
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm leaving.

247
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
I'm leaving.

248
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,920
I'm leaving.
