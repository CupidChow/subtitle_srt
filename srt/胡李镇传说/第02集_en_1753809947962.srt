00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's the general situation.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Did you see anyone?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
When I arrived,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
there was only Juan left.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Hu.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You can't blame yourself.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you want to blame,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you can only blame Juan's bad luck.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Hu family has done many good deeds.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How can God not open his eyes?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Mr. Hu,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
don't worry.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I will find this bad guy as soon as possible

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and get Juan justice.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What can you do if you find him?

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What can you do if you get justice?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Juan's reputation has been destroyed.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I think this is

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the end.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Juan is only 17 years old this year.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He has a long life.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't want him to live

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
with such a big burden for his whole life.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hu Quan.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Master.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Tell them to reveal this matter

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
in half a word.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't forgive them.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Mr. Hu.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't say anymore.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's settled.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Master, what about the big cow?

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's lock it up.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Follow Dr. Huang to get the medicine

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and come back to drink it.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
When he wakes up,

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
we will send him back.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll go.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Master.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now the family is in such a big trouble.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm worried about leaving now.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Besides, I've lived at home for so long.

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I've long regarded Juan as my own sister.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now she has become like this.

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I want to stay.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
First, I can take care of the family.

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Second, I can share your burden.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're so thoughtful.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Mr. Hu.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I heard Juan keep saying

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
that blood is like a fox.

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
To be honest,

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I've heard this legend in the town recently.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's just a rumour

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
that people are talking about.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't take it seriously.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's getting late.

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You should rest.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:14,840
The

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The fox is killing people.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The fox is killing people.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The fox is killing people.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The fox is killing people.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The fox is killing people.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't move.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Get up.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Stand up.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Turn around.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The fox is killing people.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The fox is killing people.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The fox is killing people.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The fox is killing people.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Mr. Yang.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mr. Hu.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You scared me.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What are you doing here?

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Like you,

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't believe in foxes or demons.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So I came to find out.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Did you see anything?

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Did you and Juan

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
find Juan at this place?

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Then it's right.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What do you mean?

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What do you mean?

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Footprints.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There should be no footprints in the blood fox.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Human's tail.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Later,

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
go to the pharmacy with me to get the medicine.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Dr. Huang.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How is Juan?

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Is he okay?

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
After eating this,

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
he will be fine.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If he doesn't want it,

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
he will be fine.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Go.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Juan.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How are you?

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Are you feeling better?

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm fine, Brother Kun.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yesterday,

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
what happened?

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't be afraid.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Brother Kun is here.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Tell me.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't know.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I just remember

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Mr. Shu came to tell me.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
After I finished reading the book,

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I went home alone.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Please listen to the next time.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then,

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't remember

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
anything after that.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,260
The

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Do you know?

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I heard that

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
that night,

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Miss Wen was killed by a prince.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
when she was found,

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
she was unconscious.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That...

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So,

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Officer Hu

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
has seen her body.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Will he marry her again?

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Miss Wen wants to marry someone else.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now she has been killed by someone else.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Officer Hu can marry her again.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Zao Ni.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Miss Wen is only 17 years old.

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
She is just an orphan.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Her life is still long.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What should she do in the future?

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Who says she is not?

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hurry up.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Miss Wen will hear you.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Officer Hu.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Officer Hu.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Officer Hu.

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Officer Hu.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She is dead.

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What?

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Who killed her?

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
She is dead.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
She is dead.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
She is dead.

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
She is dead.

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Doctor Sha.

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
She is dead.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
She is dead.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Go.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Wait for me, Peng.

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Miss Wen.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Today is my mother's death day.

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So, I took Xiaoyun

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
to the grave with my mother.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But when the grave was half-baked,

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I heard a sound.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Sound?

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What sound?

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I can't explain.

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It seemed that the woman was crying.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And it seemed that the child was laughing.

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The more I heard it, the more I was panic.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I took Xiaoyun to find the sound.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then I saw a dead man

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
in the uncle's hand.

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He was laughing.

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Laughing?

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll take you to see.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The rain in the sky,

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the blood in the lake,

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
the living people in the first day of the fifteenth day,

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I can't escape.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I can't hide.

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll return to the heart after I kill the evil.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The End
