1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,480
Please.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,000
Master, please have a seat.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,000
Master Hu, please.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,480
Last time,

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,720
I left you

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,200
was a few years ago.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,920
Today, you came to Huli Town.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,680
I didn't get to meet you in person.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,040
Please forgive me.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,480
Don't worry, Master Hu.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,120
I have eight ways

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,920
to cultivate myself.

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,080
Although you haven't seen me for years,

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,880
you're still talented.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,880
Master,

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,960
look at what happened today.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,120
The dead have been put in the temple.

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,840
Master Hu, don't worry about the super-division.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,840
Now,

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,120
there's a blood-suckers' poem in the town.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,600
The curse of blood-suckers

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,080
has spread all over the town.

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,600
People are in panic.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,320
I swear.

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,680
Can you do a magic for the town?

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,440
First,

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,840
you can calm the evil spirits

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
and ease the panic and worry

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,600
of the people.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Master Hu,

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,680
don't worry about the magic.

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,240
But I have to warn you.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Ghosts and evil spirits are illusory.

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,920
They will die in the end.

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,440
Kun, what does it mean?

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,640
The ghosts will know it.

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,480
Let's do it.

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,400
Hurry up.

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,360
Let's do it.

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,760
Kill them.

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,800
Kill them.

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,720
Bodyguard.

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,560
Danke.

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,880
Ù€

47
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,880
Ah.

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,760
A death.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,680
I'll buy you a ball of blood-sucking mystique.

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,440
But I'd like to kill someone too.

51
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,280
and left.

52
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,600
Since last night,

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
we've had a few troubles.

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,040
Master has no choice

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
but to let him out.

56
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
The town is in chaos.

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,760
I'm afraid he'll get into trouble.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,520
Thank you.

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,760
Thank you for your hard work, Officer Hu.

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,040
Let's go.

61
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,360
Master, Young Master Yang is here.

62
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,880
Come on.

63
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,920
Please have a seat.

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,440
Yang,

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,360
you're a

66
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,960
smart and steady child.

67
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,680
I won't bother you anymore.

68
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,560
I invited you here

69
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,040
because I need you

70
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,560
to help me with something.

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,000
It's okay, Master Hu.

72
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,680
Did you go to that

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,640
shabby house last night?

74
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
I'm sorry, Master Hu.

75
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,480
I made the decision.

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,440
I just took Juer

77
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,640
as my own sister.

78
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,440
I really didn't

79
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,240
want her to...

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
I didn't mean to blame you.

81
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,080
I just want to ask

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,000
if you've found any clues.

83
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,840
I did.

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
You're a traitor.

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,360
Master Hu,

86
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,200
is that all?

87
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,080
I know you don't want to

88
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,040
take Juer's reputation

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,960
out of the way,

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,160
but Hu Zhen Kun

91
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,200
won't give up easily.

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,240
He'll keep an eye on her.

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,960
I invited you here

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,680
for this reason.

95
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
I want to build a shabby temple.

96
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,760
You

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,320
and the Ruyin Fashi

98
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,680
will take care of it.

99
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,120
Besides,

100
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,040
you can help Ruyin Fashi

101
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,000
build a big temple

102
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,720
in the town.

103
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,240
But Master Hu,

104
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,960
when you mentioned the blood fox yesterday,

105
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,080
you said it was just a rumor.

106
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,560
But why are you

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,160
building a shabby temple

108
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
and building a big temple now?

109
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,200
It's hard to say.

110
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,120
I want people to believe

111
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,840
that Juer was not beaten by humans.

112
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,720
It was a evil girl who broke the temple.

113
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,760
Then,

114
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,720
people will pity Juer.

115
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,560
Juer's reputation

116
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,320
will be saved.

117
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,280
I see.

118
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,720
Master Hu,

119
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,360
when the Fashi said that,

120
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,320
I saw you seemed to be worried.

121
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,960
Did you guess

122
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,520
that Li Zhenzuo was the murderer?

123
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,440
Since we're talking about this,

124
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,880
I'll keep it from you.

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,720
We need to

126
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,920
talk about it a few days ago.

127
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,560
Look.

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,560
What would you like?

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,120
No.

130
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,840
Get out of the way.

131
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,520
Juer.

132
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,760
Juer.

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,720
Where are you going?

134
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,040
Would you like to have a drink with me?

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,560
Juer.

136
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,160
Juer.

137
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,760
Juer.

138
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,880
Don't run.

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,880
Kneel.

140
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,200
Juer.

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,920
He hit me.

143
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm sorry, Master Hu.

144
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,680
Since you have such a foresight,

145
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,760
you should be more careful.

146
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,240
The Li family

147
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,880
is also a big family in the town.

148
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,160
They all admit their mistakes.

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
What else can they do?

150
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,160
Yuan family is not a good family.

151
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,720
If the two families really fight,

152
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,040
they will be defeated.

153
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,360
No one can save their reputation.

154
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,960
My wife is also a good person.

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,400
She is a rich woman.

156
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,920
In the end,

157
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,440
she still hurt Juer.

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,280
But I won't let this go easily.

159
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,000
I've sent someone to talk about it secretly.

160
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
I've checked it.

161
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,680
Once I get the evidence,

162
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm afraid the Li family will be unkind.

163
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,960
The Hu family is not easy to bully.

164
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,600
Before the truth comes out,

165
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,960
I want you to help me.

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,760
For now,

167
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,400
hold on to Zheng Kun.

168
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,680
This child is a straight person.

169
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,080
I'm afraid he will be impulsive

170
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,080
and create trouble.

171
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,480
Yes, Master Hu.

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,400
Sister, brother-in-law.

173
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,520
Is he okay?

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,560
Why don't you go talk to him?

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,800
What?

176
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,800
You feel bad?

177
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,560
Sister, what are you talking about?

178
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,840
I can't understand.

179
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,120
Come here.

180
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,600
Here?

181
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,520
What a coward.

182
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,200
You couldn't kill me

183
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,160
before I died,

184
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,760
you heartless boss.

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,360
Sister, I...

186
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Juer and I

187
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,160
really don't have anything.

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,960
Earlier, if I didn't feel so pitiful,

189
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,920
I'd like to show some gratitude

190
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,600
I saved you from being

191
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,400
treated by you

192
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,480
for the sake of my face.

193
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Don't think I don't know

194
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,520
