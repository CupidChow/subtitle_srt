00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're so mean.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Don't let her go.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm fine.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Don't touch her.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You're so mean.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let me pass.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What are you doing?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Brother Jing.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Police is investigating the case.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The scene is ruined by you.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank you.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Has anyone touched the scene?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Everyone, I'm scared.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Are you okay?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I can't see anything.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Blood.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Brother Kun.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you okay?

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What are you thinking?

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So stubborn.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm born with it.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I have no choice.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Brother Kun.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You've been observing for so long.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Have you found any clues?

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The man's name.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And then?

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The cause of death

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
is unknown.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's all?

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Last night, it was a heavy rain.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All the clues were gone.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Did he kill himself

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
or kill himself?

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There's no obvious wound

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
on the body of the victim.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Basically,

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
it can eliminate the possibility

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
of a fierce conflict

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
with others before he died.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So now,

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
except for the fact that

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
the victim is dead,

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
nothing can be confirmed.

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There's no clue at all.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Have you heard of it?

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What?

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let the dead speak.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let the dead speak?

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What are you joking about?

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What are you talking about?

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm dead.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Have you seen

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
or heard of

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
a dead person who can laugh?

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Look.

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Brother Kun.

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He seems to be really laughing.

63
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I saw it in a book before.

64
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
After a normal person died,

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
he still had a smile on his face.

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Either he saw something

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
that really stimulated him

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
he was poisoned by a poison.

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've heard of a poison

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
that can make people

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
feel happy

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
or scared when they see it

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and make people

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
move or look at them

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
in a strange way

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
or make them look at them.

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Could it be that

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
he was poisoned to death?

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Look at his hand.

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This should be

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
a clue he left behind.

83
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
His finger is in a direction.

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let's go.

85
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's go and have a look.

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's go.

87
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Brother Kun, wait for me.

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's go.

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's go.

90
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Brother Kun.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's not go in.

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I feel like

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
it's getting colder here.

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Brother Kun,

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm a little scared.

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How about

97
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
we go back?

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's okay.

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There are so many people here.

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's not be scared.

101
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Brother Kun.

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Brother Kun.

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What's that sound?

104
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Brother Kun,

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
it's that sound.

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's that sound.

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This morning,

108
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yin and I heard

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
that sound.

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's strange.

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's so sunny.

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why is it raining suddenly?

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Look.

114
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Look over there.

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Brother Kun.

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Look.

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Brother Kun.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Brother Kun.

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Brother Kun.

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Brother Kun.

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Brother Kun.

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Brother Kun.

123
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Brother Kun.

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Brother Kun.

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Brother Kun.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Brother Kun.

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Brother Kun.

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Brother Kun.

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Brother Kun.

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Brother Kun.

131
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Brother Kun.

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Brother Kun.

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Brother Kun.

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Brother Kun.

135
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Brother Kun.

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Brother Kun.

137
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Brother Kun.

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Brother Kun.

139
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Brother Kun.

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Brother Kun.

141
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Brother Kun.

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Brother Kun.

143
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Brother Kun.

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Brother Kun.

145
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Brother Kun.

146
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Brother Kun.

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Brother Kun.

148
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Brother Kun.

149
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Brother Kun.

150
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Brother Kun.

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Brother Kun.

152
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Brother Kun.

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Brother Kun.

154
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Brother Um Lv.

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Brother Qun.

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Brother Qun.

157
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Brother Qun!

158
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Brother Qun.

159
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Brother Qun.

160
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Brother Long.

161
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Brother Long.

162
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Brother Long.

163
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Brother kannst.

164
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
BrotherShe.

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Brother Um Lv.

166
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,880
Today, I, the blood fox,

167
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,920
will be the first soul to be born,

168
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,200
and I will never leave you.

169
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,120
I will return your life after the war.

170
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,520
Return your life after the war.

171
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,280
Return your life.

172
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,080
Today, I, the blood fox,

173
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,600
will be the first soul to be born,

174
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,720
and I will never leave you.

175
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,280
You fool.

176
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,360
You are really a fool.

177
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,000
Look at you. You are so stubborn.

178
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,840
You are so merciless.

179
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,480
You haven't been able to go out for half a month.

180
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,600
How can you see people?

181
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,520
You deserve it.

182
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,440
Today's matter is too ridiculous.

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,480
Is it really the blood fox?

184
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,200
Hu Xiaoyun.

185
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,960
Aren't you the first to find out about this?

186
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
Tell us about it.

187
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,600
What's going on?

188
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,680
Is there really a curse of blood fox?

189
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,280
Actually, I'm not sure either.

190
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,120
Today is my mother-in-law's death anniversary.

191
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,640
I went to the tomb with the head of the family.

192
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,280
And then...

193
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,880
Father. Mother.

194
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,840
I'm not filial.

195
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,640
I couldn't go back to clean your tomb.

196
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
The war is getting worse.

197
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,160
Our family can't live on anymore.

198
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,840
What sound is that?

199
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,880
There's no sound.

200
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,480
Don't be so careless.

201
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,720
Why is it raining suddenly in this sunny day?

202
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,360
Why is it raining suddenly?

203
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,840
Master.

204
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,800
Do you remember the two words we sang when we were young?

205
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,760
What words?

206
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,640
The rain of love, the blood fox,

207
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,800
the first day of the 15th year of the year, the living season.

208
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,760
Master, I'm a little scared.

209
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,160
Let's go back first.

210
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,840
Okay. Let's go.

211
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
The first day of the 15th year of the year, the living season.

212
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a blood fox.

213
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
It must be a blood fox.

214
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,200
A curse.

215
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,880
What should we do?

216
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,160
We'll all die if we get cursed by a blood fox.

217
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,720
What blood fox?

218
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,520
Don't scare yourself.

219
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,320
Officer Hu said it's a trap.

220
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,240
Could it be that Xiaoyun

221
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,120
is playing with your Manager Zhou in the store?

222
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,800
She wants to find some excitement in the mountains.

223
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,520
You're talking nonsense. I'll tear your mouth off.

224
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,280
Do you think everyone is like you?

225
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,760
You just know how to get out of bed.

226
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,320
I'm just kidding.

227
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,760
Why are you angry?

228
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,160
Could it be that you're not with your Manager Zhou?

229
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
You're with that dead man.

230
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,360
Then your Manager Zhou found out.

231
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,040
Then they fought.

232
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,040
That's right.

233
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,440
You're so bad.

234
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
Get out.

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Get out.

236
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,760
I'm not welcoming you.

237
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,960
Go. Go.

238
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,360
What are you talking about?

239
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,960
Zhou Tian.

240
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,680
Say it.

241
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,920
Yuan, what are you talking about?

242
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,320
Tell me.

243
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
Don't be shy.

244
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,240
How about finding a place with no one?

245
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Just the two of us.

246
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Talk to me.

247
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,840
Talk about that dead man.

248
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm asking you.

249
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
I'm asking you.

250
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,880
You're a big brother.

251
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,720
Sit down.

252
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
Dead man?

253
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,560
You killed him.

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,120
How could I kill him?

255
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
I have no grudge against him. Why would I kill him?

256
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,080
You didn't kill him.

257
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,320
It's not the New Year.

258
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,880
Why are you so angry?

259
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,760
Say it.

260
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,680
Today is my mother's death anniversary.

261
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,640
What a coincidence.

262
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,560
It's your mother's death anniversary.

263
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,560
You went up the mountain by coincidence.

264
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,640
You met the dead man by coincidence.

265
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,640
You killed him by coincidence.

266
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,480
Don't talk nonsense, brother.

267
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,880
Then shut up.

268
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
Don't talk nonsense.

269
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,240
Get lost.

270
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,040
Yuan.

271
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,160
It's okay.

272
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,600
I'm not after you.

273
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,000
I have something else to do today.

274
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,640
I'll find you another day.

275
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,120
Let's go.

276
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,400
Let's go.

277
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
You're here.
