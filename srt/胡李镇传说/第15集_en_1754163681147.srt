00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,720
You still have your hatred in your heart.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,240
I'm about to die.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,760
I just can't rest assured about Anan.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,760
He risked his life

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,760
to save me from the fire of Nanyang.

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
I owe him.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Now I'm paying him back.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,760
It's the cause and effect of us.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
I was sold to Nanyang by my enemies.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
I met Anan by chance.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Now I found my enemies because of Anan.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
It's the cause and effect of me and my enemies.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm just worried about Anan.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
Because of hatred,

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,760
I became a person of hatred.

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,760
Maybe only hatred can make him let go of it.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,760
He hasn't given up hatred for so many years.

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
But hatred

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,760
is his only obsession in this world.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Once he gets revenge,

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
what can he do

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
in the future?

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
Brother Kun.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Brother Kun, something happened. Open the door.

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Brother Kun.

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Open the door. Something happened.

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
What's wrong?

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Li Zhenzu is dead.

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Li Zhenzu is dead.

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Brother Kun.

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Look at his face.

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
He's smiling.

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Is it the blood fox?

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Don't talk nonsense.

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
What blood fox?

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Zhenzu.

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Zhenzu.

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Zhenzu.

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
What's wrong with you?

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Zhenzu.

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Wake up.

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,760
You don't listen to me.

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Zhenzu.

46
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
You're so stupid.

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Zhenzu.

48
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm begging you.

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Wake up.

50
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Dad.

51
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
You want to avenge Zuer?

52
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,760
How many things are you hiding from me?

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
I...

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
Zuer's smile

55
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,760
and the smile on the face of the man on the mountain.

56
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
What's going on?

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Do you think you can fool me?

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Yes.

59
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,760
The man on the mountain is a beggar.

60
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
It's the news I got from him.

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
He killed people.

62
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
Yes.

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Who else knows about this?

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
Mr. Hu.

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
But he's dead.

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
I thought it would be okay

67
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,760
if I put everything on the blood fox.

68
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,760
But Zuer was killed by the poison.

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,760
You suspect that Zuer was forced to take the medicine.

70
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
He died in a hurry.

71
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
I've been waiting for a long time.

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Finally, I got it.

73
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Zuer took the thing to Wang Xiaohua that night.

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,760
You suspect Wang Xiaohua?

75
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Wang Xiaohua is missing.

76
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
I haven't found her yet.

77
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
It must be her.

78
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
If she didn't seduce Zuer,

79
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Zuer wouldn't have died.

80
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
She wouldn't have died.

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Enough.

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Shut up.

83
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,760
You didn't have a good son.

84
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,760
You're a traitor.

85
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Zuer died in vain.

86
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Leave it to me.

87
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Dad.

88
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Dad.

89
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
I find it strange

90
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
what happened recently.

91
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Especially after that lunatic came.

92
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Did he find us again?

93
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
So Zuer...

94
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Xiaokun.

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
Xiaokun.

96
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,760
Brother Zuiyi, you're so nice.

97
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Zuiyi.

98
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Zuiyi.

99
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
Zuiyi.

100
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
Isn't this Da Niu?

101
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Niu.

102
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Da Niu.

103
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
What are you doing, Da Niu?

104
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Niu.

105
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Come and drink.

106
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Are you drunk, Niu?

107
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
What face?

108
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
You should have died earlier.

109
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Are you stupid?

110
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Wake up, Da Niu.

111
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Let me see.

112
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
Come.

113
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
Da Niu.

114
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Da Niu.

115
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Come on.

116
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Da Niu.

117
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Wait.

118
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Wake up, Da Niu.

119
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
You're a fox.

120
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
You're a fox.

121
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
You're a fox.

122
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
You're a fox.

123
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,760
You're a fox.

124
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Zuer.

125
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Xiaokun.

126
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
I heard from Shuanzi

127
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
that since Li Zhen died,

128
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,760
you've been locked up at home.

129
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
If you have any worries,

130
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
you can tell me.

131
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Why?

132
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Why is that?

133
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Xiaokun.

134
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Xiaokun.

135
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
Xiaokun.

136
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Xiaokun.

137
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
So this is what you like.

138
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Brother.

139
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
What are you doing?

140
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Da Niu is dead.

141
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,660
What?

142
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Da Niu is dead.

143
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
There's a murderer in the blood pool.

144
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Yes.

145
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
The knife was cut on his neck.

146
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
It seems that he cut it himself.

147
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Zuer.

148
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Stay here.

149
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
I'll pick you up later.

150
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Brother Xiaokun.

151
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
I'm scared.

152
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Shuang.

153
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
You can send him off.

154
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
It's okay.

155
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Brother Xiaokun.

156
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Next time we drink,

157
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
can you lock the door?

158
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Yes.

159
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
If you dare to tell others,

160
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
I'll beat you.

161
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
No.

162
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
It's a secret.

163
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
Let's go.

164
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Let's go.

165
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Let's go.

166
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Brother Xiaokun.

167
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Why did Da Niu cut himself?

168
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Did the blood fox hurt him again?

169
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
He was bewitched by the blood fox.

170
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
He was laughing on their faces.

171
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Stop talking about blood foxes.

172
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Did you see it?

173
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
We saw it.

174
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
You can't say that.

175
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
You said Da Niu's thing.

176
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Why did you say that about me?

177
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Before we figure it out,

178
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
don't talk nonsense.

179
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
Did you hear that?

180
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Yes.

181
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Go to sleep.

182
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Go.

183
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Don't drink too much.

184
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Okay.

185
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Okay.

186
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Let's go.

187
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Brother Kun.

188
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
I don't believe in blood.

189
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
But it's too evil.

190
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
I only have goosebumps.

191
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
You drank it too?

192
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
You're a girl.

193
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
You ran into a man's room in the middle of the night.

194
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
You're so rude.
