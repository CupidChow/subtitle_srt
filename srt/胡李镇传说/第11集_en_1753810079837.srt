00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Xiao Yang,

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,800
although Da Niu is a lunatic,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
he is often honest.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,400
Then,

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,600
who did he see?

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,600
Who killed him?

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,800
Or did he fall to his death?

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
I don't understand.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,600
The father and son of the Li family are not things.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
They brought the crazy woman there.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,800
There must be some conspiracy.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,800
It's said that

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
the one who caused the trouble should be Li Zhenzuo.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,200
But it's Li Xingzong.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,200
I don't know.

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,000
But Master Ru Yin said

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,800
it has nothing to do with the blood fox.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,200
Correct.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,800
That can't be!

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,400
Master,

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,800
Master,

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,040
Are you kaikki day day day day today

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,800
to make sure your dad grew up well?

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,280
He does not look well.

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,800
But,

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,000
he is in good health.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
It is lot better than living in a 같이be.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,100
Then I wouldn't have

31
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,180
Are you crazy?

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,420
Have you read books?

33
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,500
Kun,

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,740
why don't you believe

35
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,260
in the blood fox?

36
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,780
I don't believe it.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Here, take it.

38
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,660
I don't want it.

39
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,620
I want to keep it for my father.

40
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,860
If you really want to be filial to your father,

41
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,940
you should grow up quickly

42
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,540
and earn a lot of money

43
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,700
to buy your father good food.

44
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,660
Okay?

45
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,260
Okay.

46
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,180
Son.

47
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,820
I'm leaving.

48
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,780
Father.

49
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,140
Father, you're back.

50
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,020
You...

51
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,580
Brother Shi Te.

52
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,900
Let's talk.

53
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,780
No matter how you ask me,

54
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,700
it's the same thing.

55
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,500
I really didn't go out.

56
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,420
But you can say

57
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,380
it's possible.

58
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,140
If he wants to kill Li Xing Zong,

59
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,260
why would he kill Li Zhen Zong?

60
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,540
I don't know.

61
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,420
Is there anything else?

62
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,420
No.

63
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,540
Thank you.

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,300
I'm leaving.

65
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,900
Wait.

66
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,660
Did Master Hu

67
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,260
have a grudge against you before?

68
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,620
Yes.

69
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,580
I met a robber here.

70
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,260
If Master Hu hadn't come to save me,

71
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,260
I would have been dead.

72
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,340
Let me tell you the truth.

73
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,260
I came here

74
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,140
to prevent the Li family

75
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,500
from framing Master Hu.

76
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,580
Brother Shi Te.

77
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
I know Master Hu is also interested in you.

78
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,380
You don't want Master Hu to be framed either.

79
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
I'm still the same.

80
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,300
I really didn't go out that night.

81
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,660
Even if I want to kill the Li family,

82
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,940
I won't talk to them.

83
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,660
But

84
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,580
Li Xing Zong

85
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,140
wants to know why that crazy woman

86
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,220
hit Master Hu.

87
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,980
She's not at peace.

88
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,060
Everyone in town knows

89
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,540
Li Xing Zong wants to ruin Master Hu's life.

90
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,260
Li Zhen Zong.

91
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,860
That woman wanted to kill Li Xing Zong.

92
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,860
Li Zhen Zong chased her and killed her.

93
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,940
Then she came back to play tricks.

94
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,460
No. No. No.

95
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,500
If Li Zhen Zong did kill her,

96
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,220
how could Mu Ban explain it?

97
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,220
Is she the only one?

98
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,940
She's playing tricks

99
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,340
and changing the world.

100
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,500
It's possible.

101
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,380
You don't know her.

102
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,500
She's not smart.

103
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,140
It's impossible.

104
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,500
Who could it be?

105
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,620
Does she have any grudge

106
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,460
against the Li family?

107
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,340
Is it possible

108
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,420
that the Hu family and the Li family

109
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,620
have nothing to do with each other?

110
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,180
You want to say

111
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,980
the Hu family has something that can't be seen.

112
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,580
But Li Xing Zong knows it.

113
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,860
He even helped her to hide it

114
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,660
and help her kill that woman.

115
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,460
I didn't say it.

116
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,340
You said it.

117
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:19,760
Bo

118
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,160
Come on.

119
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Brother-in-law.

120
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,160
Come on.

121
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Oh my god.

122
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Brother-in-law. Come on.

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
Okay.

124
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
You are so good.

125
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,160
Wait for me. I'll drink some water.

126
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
Brother-in-law, come back.

127
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,160
No.

128
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,160
Brother-in-law.

129
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,760
This damn Wang Langhan.

130
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,360
The price of food has gone up again.

131
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,760
I can't live like this.

132
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,360
Xiu'er. Xiu'er.

133
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,760
This damn girl.

134
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,160
The sun is already setting.

135
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,760
She's still not up.

136
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
I can't live like this.

137
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,360
Someone is killed. Someone is killed.

138
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
What should we do?

139
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Why is it like this?

140
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Xiu'er.

141
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,560
She's awake.

142
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Xiu'er.

143
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Xiu'er.

144
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Don't touch me.

145
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Xiu'er.

146
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Xiu'er.

147
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Xiu'er.

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Xiu'er.

149
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Xiao Kun.

150
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,960
It's Li Zhenzuo.

151
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,560
That bastard killed her.

152
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Go get him.

153
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,960
Madam, calm down.

154
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,160
Listen to me.

155
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,760
If it's really Li Zhenzuo,

156
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,960
I'll go get him now.

157
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,960
He came to my house for two days in a row.

158
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,560
Is it a proof?

159
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
He fell asleep and killed her.

160
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,760
Is it a proof?

161
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,360
He thought I didn't know.

162
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,160
I saw everything.

163
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,760
Go get him.

164
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,560
My Xiu'er.

165
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,360
Xiu'er.

166
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,560
Stop it.

167
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:51,960
Stop it.

168
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,360
Get him out of here.

169
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
What are you doing?

170
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,360
Get out.

171
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,760
Get out.

172
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,560
What are you doing?

173
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,360
You want to rebel?

174
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,960
Get out.

175
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,560
What are you doing?

176
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:01,960
You want to rebel?

177
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,160
What are you doing?

178
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,760
Put me down.

179
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,960
Put me down.

180
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,160
Xiao Kun.

181
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Did I give you a face?

182
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
Again and again.

183
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,160
You're done.

184
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Get them.

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Get them.

186
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,560
You old woman.

187
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,160
Who killed her?

188
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,960
Why are you looking for me?

189
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,760
Li Zhenzuo.

190
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,160
You're not a person.

191
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,560
My daughter is pregnant with your child.

192
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,160
You killed her.

193
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Did you hear that, Li Zhenzuo?

194
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
I'll fight you.

195
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,960
Did you hear that?

196
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
What are you doing?

197
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
What are you doing?

198
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,560
Be quiet.

199
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,160
Move.

200
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Li Zhenzuo.

201
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
My aunt saw it.

202
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
What else do you have to say?

203
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,760
Bullshit.

204
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm telling you.

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
I didn't go out last night.

206
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,160
They can all testify for me.

207
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,760
Yes.

208
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,160
Right?

209
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,360
We can all testify.

210
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,960
Murder is a life-and-death matter.

211
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
If someone can prove that you went out,

212
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,160
you'll be dead.

213
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Who can prove it?

214
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,960
Who?

215
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,360
Who can prove it?

216
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,960
No one can prove it.

217
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
It's not my son who did it.

218
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,360
Right.

219
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,160
It's the blood fox.

220
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,560
Everyone knows

221
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:06,640
that my old Li family has only one

222
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,160
but she has a big belly.

223
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,560
Dr. Huang also sold it.

224
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,160
He said it was her son.

225
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
I also agreed.

226
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,560
As long as she gives birth,

227
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,760
I'll let Zhenzuo marry her.

228
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,560
Ke.

229
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
This is the root of my family.

230
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,960
She's crazy to kill him.

231
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,160
He's a bastard.

232
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,960
What did you say?

233
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Beat him.

234
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,160
Who?

235
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,360
Stop.

236
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,160
Don't move.

237
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Don't move.

238
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,160
Li Zhenzuo went out last night.

239
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,960
What's going on?

240
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,160
It's not him.

241
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
It's not him.

242
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,360
He's my son.

243
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,960
Hey.

244
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,760
I'm sorry.

245
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
I'm sorry.

246
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm sorry.

247
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
I'm sorry.

248
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
I'm sorry.

249
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
I'm sorry.

250
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
I'm sorry.

251
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
I'm sorry.

252
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
I'm sorry.

253
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
I'm sorry.

254
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
I'm sorry.

255
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
I'm sorry.

256
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
I'm sorry.

257
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
I'm sorry.

258
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
I'm sorry.

259
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I'm sorry.

260
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm sorry.

261
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
I'm sorry.

262
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
I'm sorry.

263
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
I'm sorry.

264
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
I'm sorry.

265
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I'm sorry.

266
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm sorry.

267
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
I'm sorry.

268
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
I'm sorry.

269
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm sorry.

270
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
I'm sorry.

271
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
I'm sorry.

272
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
I'm sorry.

273
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I'm sorry.

274
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I'm sorry.

275
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
I'm sorry.

276
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
I'm sorry.

277

I'm sorry.

278
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
I'm sorry.

279
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I'm sorry.

280
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
I'm sorry.

281
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
I'm sorry.
