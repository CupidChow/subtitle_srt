1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Officer Wu, look at this board.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
Is it made of blood foxes?

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Zheng Keke, don't talk nonsense.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,400
What's going on?

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Master Hu.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Master Hu, look at this.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Blood foxes.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,400
The blood foxes are ordered by Hu Changshan, Li Xingzong, Li Zhenzu.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
They can't die easily.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
This...

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Master Hu.

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Master Hu.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
This board has been held by this woman.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,400
Isn't this done by the blood foxes again?

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, what should we do?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, the village has been in a bad shape recently.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Master Hu, I've checked the body.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,000
It's obviously killed by the criminal.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Master Li, this woman

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
has been living in your house before.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What do you mean?

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Alright.

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Xiao Kun.

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
You send this woman's body to the temple first.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're a poor man.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hu Quan.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Master.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Burial the coffin and bury it.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,600
Yes.

34
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,000
Master Hu, this...

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's do it now.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Blood Fox

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Amitabha.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Master Hu.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This woman's body has nothing to do with the blood foxes.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Master.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What do you mean?

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is a human body, not a demon's body.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm useless.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
She has been taken in by the Li family.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
An outsider

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
is rich

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and can take revenge on anyone.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Did the Li family let her down?

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
why did she curse Master Hu?

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We've been ignoring the most important question.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This woman is an outsider.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She's a lunatic.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
How could she know about the blood fox's story?

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I know.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She must be sent by the Blood Fox.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You just said that she's a fox.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Later, she revealed the fox's tail.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
She was found out and killed.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's reasonable.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's logical.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
how do you explain the story?

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The story?

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Maybe the secret of the lunatic

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
can only be solved by the lunatic.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Right.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The bull runs outside every day.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It might see something.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm going to find the bull.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You two

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
are...

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know what she meant.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But I ran out last night.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I remember it clearly.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's Li Zhenzuo.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I was right.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Li Zhenzuo is a bastard.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He's really something.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He won't even let a lunatic go.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Juan'er,

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
there are some things

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you're not suitable to hear.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Why don't you wait outside?

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Juan'er,

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
are you okay?

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I couldn't save you.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If I didn't get sick,

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
it's my fault.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't blame yourself.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's all done by the Blood Fox.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Even if you didn't get sick,

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
there's nothing you can do.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Blood Fox?

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not a Blood Fox.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Blood Fox?

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's a man.

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Is it Hu San'er?

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Bull,

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
do you remember something?

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
My head hurts.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Blood Fox is here to kill me.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ling'er is dead.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ling'er.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Bull.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Ling'er.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What's wrong?

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm going crazy too.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What should we do now?

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I believe what Bull said.

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's go find Li Zhenzu.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Brother,

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
have you thought about it for Juan'er?

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If the Blood Fox didn't do it,

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
then I...

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I believe in you.

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But...

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If so,

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
everyone in town knows

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
your innocence was ruined.

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Will you marry anyone else?

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I won't marry anyone else.

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I won't let you get out.

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You marry him?

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I will.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you, Brother Zhenguan.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I won't go with you then.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll go home and find my grandpa.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Come.

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Remember to buy me a drink.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hu Zhengun,

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
you're here again.

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Master Hu.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Tell me.

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What are you doing this time?

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Li Zhenzu,

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you killed someone

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and you're pretending to be a normal person.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Bull saw it.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you doing here again?

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You dare to say that you didn't kill that crazy woman?

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Of course I dare to say that.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Bull got married.

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You saw it clearly before the wedding.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Master Wu Xian,

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
everyone in town knows that Bull is crazy.

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Even cats can see blood.

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think you can understand

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
what he said.

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Doctor,

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I slept in the dark yesterday.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes,

157
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I didn't go out at all.

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Brother,

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
you're the one who opened the door of this door, right?

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No.

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Old Hu's leg fell off.

162
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I raised it at home.

163
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll help him.

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Tell everyone the truth.

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Did no one go out last night?

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No one went out.

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I've been in the door.

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I didn't see any sleep.

169
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You have to go out to kill someone.

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hu Zhengun,

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll kill you.

172
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We've been waiting here for so long.

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Your father can still sleep.

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Ask him to come out.

175
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Young Master, bad news.

176
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Master passed out again.

177
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Father.

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Father.

179
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Father.

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What's wrong with you?

181
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Stop crying.

182
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Move.

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Master.

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's awake.

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Master Hu,

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
what's going on?

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's going on?

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Master.

189
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's that woman.

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That woman wanted to kill Master last night.

192
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Master passed out without paying attention.

193
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Then she ran away.

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Master was afraid that everyone would worry about him.

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He didn't let me tell him.

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He even went to the temple to force him.

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That woman

198
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
thought that Master Li was dead.

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
She ran away in a hurry.

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
She fell down the rock in the chaos.

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No one killed her.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
She fell down the rock and died.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Master Hu, you make sense.

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're right.

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right?

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Didn't you just say that

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Da Niu saw the person I killed?

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
How is she doing living with you?

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
She's a good eater.

211
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
She's honest.

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
She can help her family with some chores.

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But I didn't expect that she...

214
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That silly girl.

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
She wanted to kill you for no reason.

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Master Li,

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
what did you do to her?

218
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What do you mean?

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
She wanted to kill Master Hu for no reason.

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What about Master Li?

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What did Master Hu do to her?

222
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Stop.

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Master Hu,

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I didn't mean anything else.

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He just framed me.

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now he's framing my father.

227
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What do you mean?

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Master Li,

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
you don't need me to tell you who you are.

230
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You dare to say that

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you didn't have any idea

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
to get this crazy guy into your family?

233
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What idea?

234
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
A crazy guy?

235
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You have ideas for crazy people?

236
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You...

237
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What?

238
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Master Hu,

239
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I respect you.

240
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I brought him back

241
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to help you with a little favor.

242
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I just thought

243
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
to give Master Li some good news.

244
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't think so.

245
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He's quite normal

246
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
when he's in our family.

247
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think

248
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
he's probably

249
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
obsessed with this blood fox.

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Master Hu,

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

290
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry.
