1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
I'll go first.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,440
Okay.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,200
Be careful on your way.

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,000
I will.

5
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,720
Yang.

6
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,640
I'll walk you out.

7
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,680
Thank you, Brother Hu.

8
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,400
Brother Yang, I can't bear to leave you.

9
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,200
Bad news!

10
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,520
Bad news, Master Hu!

11
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,400
Bad news!

12
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,320
Master Li is...

13
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,320
He...

14
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,360
What's wrong? Tell me.

15
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,520
Master Li has a lot of bugs in his stomach.

16
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,440
He crawled out of the house with his nose and eyes open.

17
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,440
It's so scary!

18
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,640
Master!

19
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,600
Master!

20
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,400
Master!

21
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,200
Master!

22
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,880
Master!

23
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,600
Master!

24
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,160
Master!

25
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,040
Master!

26
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,840
Master!

27
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,360
Master, the medicine is ready.

28
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,280
Dr. Huang, is it a good medicine?

29
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,880
Can it kill the bugs?

30
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,280
I've been passed this insect repellent medicine

31
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,200
since my ancestors.

32
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,360
It can help with three diseases.

33
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,240
Master Li will be fine.

34
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,480
That's good.

35
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,960
Xing Zong!

36
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,600
Xing Zong, are you okay?

37
00:00:59,600 --> 00:00:59,880
Master!

38
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,880
Master, what is this?

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,920
Dr. Huang also died.

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,120
Did you hear?

41
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,480
The bugs

42
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,800
came out of his ear, nose, mouth

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,520
and eyes now.

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,840
They are not paralyzed.

45
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,560
And you still want to walk to 왜� the eigenen bee in this Wiz Green?

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
They can't leave.

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
Let them wait.

48
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,840
God misses them.

49
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,560
We have to take them away sooner or later.

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,480
I think

51
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,040
it's the blood fox who did it.

52
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,080
Don't talk nonsense.

53
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Don't you believe it?

54
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,560
Think about it.

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
How long has our Fox Town been in peace?

56
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,040
Think about those strange things.

57
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,760
When did it start?

58
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,680
The dead man was found on the mountain.

59
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,480
Yes.

60
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,560
The dead man was found on the mountain.

61
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,680
Then something happened.

62
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Then there are Dafa,

63
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,560
Husser, Xiu,

64
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,360
and Black Tiger, Xiaoyun.

65
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Xiaoyun?

66
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,480
Blood fox.

67
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,640
Blood fox.

68
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,720
Please.

69
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,040
Master Hu,

70
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,000
Master is here.

71
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,280
Thank you for coming.

72
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,640
You're welcome.

73
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,840
Come here.

74
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,680
There's a demon aura here.

75
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,200
Come here.

76
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,920
The wind is coming.

77
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,800
The wind has connected me to the demon.

78
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,320
Take me to talk to it.

79
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,280
The demon is disobedient.

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,320
Come here.

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,080
Let's begin the talk.

83
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,080
Sir, please.

84
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,900
The

85
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,560
Yellow Moon L adultery hero's soldiers

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,760
are full of wicked demons

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,520
Let's Street Fighter!

88
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,840
ify

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,240
Clan Leader Di Dao De!

90
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,840
begged

91
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,920
Da Li Chang

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,680
In five days,

93
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,800
you, Hu Li Zhen,

94
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,280
will be dead

95
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,800
to no one.

96
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,440
Priest.

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,240
Where is Shen Zun?

98
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,320
Don't worry.

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,040
The golden knife has already cut his egg.

100
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
The demon egg.

101
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,360
God bless you.

102
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,040
The golden knife has already cut his egg.

103
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,320
Ghost.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,680
Ghost.

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,800
Don't come.

106
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,920
Don't come.

107
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,520
Ghost.

108
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,600
Ghost.

109
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,040
Father.

110
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,840
Father.

111
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,120
Master.

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,840
Master.

113
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,760
Father.

114
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,240
Go and save him.

115
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,200
Help.

116
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,080
Help.

117
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,680
Help.

118
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,400
Be gentle.

119
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,920
Be gentle.

120
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,640
Master.

121
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,880
Take him out.

122
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,920
Find a place to bury him.

123
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,960
No.

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,920
Don't buy it, Master.

125
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,400
He is crazy.

126
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,600
He killed himself.

127
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
What does he have to do with me?

128
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,080
You still dare to be stubborn.

129
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,680
You are so much.

130
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,080
No.

131
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,520
I...

132
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,120
I say.

133
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,880
He was poisoned with

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,480
the insect poison of Nanyang.

135
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,880
I heard that

136
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,560
there is a kind of sorcery in Nanyang

137
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,720
that specializes in poison.

138
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,760
Actually, I knew it when I came in.

139
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,400
But no one can save him

140
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,160
except the person who poisoned him.

141
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,520
He is dead anyway.

142
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
He is dead

143
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
because he pretended to be a ghost.

144
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,440
Is that true?

145
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,080
Go.

146
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,520
Go.

147
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,280
Master.

148
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,080
Don't buy it.

149
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,840
Master.

150
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,320
Master. Don't buy it.

151
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,560
Master.

152
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,160
Kid.

153
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,040
You are...

154
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,880
He has been pregnant for two months.

155
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,720
But he is no longer in the formation.

156
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,120
Good kid.

157
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
Give birth to the child.

158
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,880
Leave a good one for the Li family.

159
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,280
From now on,

160
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,080
I, Hu Changshan,

161
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,800
will be your biggest support.

162
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,560
This...

163
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,560
This...

164
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,560
Steward Hu.

165
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,080
Steward Hu.

166
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,680
Go back.

167
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
Master Hu said he was fine.

168
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,320
He has received the heart of the people.

169
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,880
Then you should tell Master Hu

170
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,520
that we all care about his health.

171
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,920
Yes.

172
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,480
Tell him to take good care of himself.

173
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,280
Yes.

174
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,440
Yes.

175
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,800
Master Hu is the master of our Hu Lizhen.

176
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,080
If something happens to him,

177
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,960
what should we do?

178
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,520
Yes.

179
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,280
Yes.

180
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
Master Hu is really...

181
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,240
The people of the Li family are dead.

182
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,880
Why do you have to be so angry?

183
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,840
Yes.

184
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,480
Right?

185
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,880
It's good that he is dead.

186
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
We should buy more firecrackers

187
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,040
to celebrate.

188
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,600
Yes.

189
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,120
To celebrate.

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
We have received the heart.

191
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Please go back.

192
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,320
Well...

193
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,680
No need.

194
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Go back.

195
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,880
Okay.

196
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,760
Please take care of Master Hu for us.

197
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,120
We'll leave now.

198
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,160
We'll leave now.
