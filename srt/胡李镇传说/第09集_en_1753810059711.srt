00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Episode 31

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:27,280
The description

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
The water in Fulishen

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,160
was completely mixed up.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,000
You stole that corpse.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,520
What if?

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,520
What do you plan to do?

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,440
Since it's a corpse,

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,480
I'll use it

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,400
in the right place.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,440
Amitabha.

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,520
The water in Fulishen is really messed up.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Quan'er was ruined.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,400
Zhou Dafa and Husserl were all killed.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,640
Even that corpse was lost.

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,480
By the way,

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,120
how is the Ruyin Master?

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
He's injured.

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,800
He should be fine.

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,240
He'll be fine soon.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,800
Brother Pu.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,560
I've been traveling north and south.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
I've heard about

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,120
foxes and monsters.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,440
There are some things

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,800
we should believe.

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,920
Stop talking about blood foxes.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,200
I don't believe it.

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,600
But many people

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,680
were killed by foxes on the street.

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,320
And there's something strange

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,200
happening in the town.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,280
I don't know what else

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,560
can be explained except blood foxes.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,080
I have a feeling

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,440
that there must be

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,120
a conspiracy behind all this.

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,600
It must be true.

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,720
I must find out the truth.

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Li Zhenzu went to the pharmacy today.

41
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,320
You know that, right?

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,480
You're so kind.

43
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,600
No.

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,800
I'm showing it to everyone.

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,400
Listen.

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,600
That's what he said.

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,480
I can't blame you for it.

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,000
But Hussan is a bad guy.

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,560
I didn't take good care of him.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,680
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,200
You didn't

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,840
mention blood foxes at all.

54
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,080
Everyone said that

55
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,880
he made blood foxes muddled.

56
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,120
Why didn't Li Zhenzu mention it?

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,960
At least he should say

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,960
although he made blood foxes muddled,

59
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,320
he didn't say

60
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,160
I didn't take good care of him.

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,280
He knew it wasn't blood foxes.

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,200
No.

64
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040
We've seen Hussan.

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,800
And that crazy woman

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
was taken away by Li's family.

67
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,080
Could it be...

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
It seems that

69
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,520
your plan didn't work out.

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,040
The police still don't believe it.

71
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,360
It seems that we should

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,720
make the guards more confused.

73
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,200
It seems that

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,680
the police

75
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
are in trouble.

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,680
Since they don't believe it,

77
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,000
we should let them go.

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,600
It's time for him to show up.

79
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,320
Kun.

80
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,560
Kun.

81
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,680
Kun.

82
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
Something happened.

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,320
What happened?

84
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,600
That corpse appeared.

85
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,360
What?

86
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,000
Kun.

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,960
When the officer was ill,

88
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,480
you didn't come.

89
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,160
The officer hit him and he died.

90
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,960
Really?

91
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,320
I saw it.

92
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,720
He's grown up.

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,240
He's a kid.

94
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,000
What's going on?

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,960
Kun.

96
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,880
Is the fox fur

97
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,720
made by blood foxes again?

98
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,120
It's possible.

99
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,000
It's possible.

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,200
Amitabha.

101
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,080
Amitabha.

102
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
Master Hu.

103
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,960
It's time.

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,680
Light the fire.

105
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,680
Shunzi.

106
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,360
Shunzi.

107
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,240
Open the door.

108
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,520
Shunzi.

109
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,480
Shunzi.

110
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,680
Let me out.

111
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,800
Kun.

112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,120
Don't knock on the door.

113
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,920
Master Hu's order

114
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,960
is not allowed.

115
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,240
I dare not let you out.

116
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,680
I repeat.

117
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,760
Wang Dali's corpse can't be burned.

118
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,120
Shunzi, believe me.

119
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,760
This must be a conspiracy.

120
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,080
Everything is strange.

121
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,520
Wang Dali's corpse is the key to the case.

122
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,280
Let me out.

123
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,000
Kun.

124
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,960
Don't be obsessed.

125
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,640
Wang Dali

126
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,240
was killed by the blood fox.

127
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,680
His corpse must be burned.

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,840
Otherwise, something big will happen.

129
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,000
I repeat.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,840
There is no blood fox in this world.

131
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,280
Brother.

132
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,160
Everyone saw it.

133
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,680
If it's not blood fox,

134
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,760
who else can do it?

135
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
What are you doing?

136
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,840
Juan.

137
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,680
Why are you here?

138
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,760
I'm here to find Kun.

139
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,520
Juan.

140
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,440
Let me out.

141
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,240
I'm inside.

142
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,680
Can I go in?

143
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,720
No.

144
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,000
I dare not

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,320
follow your grandfather's order.

146
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,840
Shunzi.

147
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,600
Let him in.

148
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,480
I believe Kun.

149
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,840
I know a lot of things happened in the town recently.

150
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,320
I also know that in order to protect me,

151
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,560
everyone said that it was done by the blood fox.

152
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,800
But I know it very well.

153
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,280
I remember it all.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
I'm sure it wasn't done by the blood fox.

155
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,320
If it wasn't done by the blood fox,

156
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,480
someone must be behind it.

157
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,440
We can't let more people be harmed.

158
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,760
All right.

159
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,240
I can't help you.

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,600
How about this?

161
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
You hit me with this stick.

162
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,400
I'll pretend I don't know anything.

163
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,920
Juan.

164
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,440
Hit him.

165
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,160
Get me out.

166
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,280
It's not good.

167
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,440
Kun.

168
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,000
Juan.

169
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,240
Thank you.

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,920
Juan.

171
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,400
I have something important to do now.

172
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,200
I'll come to you later.

173
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,120
Kun.

174
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,600
Shunzi.

175
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,040
Wake up, Shunzi.

176
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,800
Shunzi.

177
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,080
Juan.

178
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,200
Didn't you say it was bad?

179
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400
Kun.

180
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,160
Kun.

181
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Kun.

182
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,360
What's wrong?

183
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720
The crazy woman is dead.

184
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,880
What crazy woman?

185
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,160
The crazy woman in Mr. Li's house is dead.

186
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,200
Where?

187
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,720
You take her there.

188
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,800
All right.

189
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,440
I'll go to see Mr. Li.

190
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,200
Go.

191
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,440
Mr. Li.

192
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,800
Mr. Li is in trouble.

193
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,400
Mr. Li is dead.

194
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,760
Your mother is dead.

195
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,720
That crazy woman is dead.

196
