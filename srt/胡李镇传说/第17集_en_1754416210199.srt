00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,200
Kun.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,280
If you want to find Juan,

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,480
just do it.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,200
Kun.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,360
Did you...

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,040
Don't listen to Li Guangfu.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,360
Nothing happened.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,000
Don't think too much.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,880
Fine.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,000
By the way,

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,880
I asked you to inquire about

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,840
Hu Sa's mother.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,600
How is it?

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,520
I did.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,080
Doctor Huang told me

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,920
she's fine.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,920
He said Yang Nan was dying.

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,040
He saved her.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,720
He told me

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,200
there's a big dam on her chest.

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
It's scary.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,720
Chief Hu.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,920
Why are you here?

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,200
Officer Hu.

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,800
Master asked you to go there.

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,800
It seems

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,400
you didn't understand me.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,840
Master Hu.

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,520
You mean

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,960
I must not be there

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,920
to investigate Li Zhenzuo.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,120
She's dead.

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,120
She's dead.

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,120
Even if you know the truth,

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,960
what can you do?

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,800
Master Hu.

39
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,240
You're wrong.

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,840
We need the truth.

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,560
If it's because of this,

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
I can't promise you.

43
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,480
I'm a policeman.

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,400
It's my responsibility to find out the truth.

45
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,320
If the Li family will take revenge on me,

46
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,200
just let them come to me.

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,400
What about Juan?

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,240
I'm afraid Juan will be implicated.

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,760
If you insist on working with the Li family,

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,760
I won't give Juan to you.

51
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,120
Grandpa.

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,080
You want to piss me off?

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,240
Brother Xiao Kun.

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,280
What about you?

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,240
Li Zhenzuo

56
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,560
is the lifeblood of Li Xingzong.

57
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,480
Now he's in trouble.

58
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,880
Not only you

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,600
will be angry with others.

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,480
You want to make the old men of Hu Li Town

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,760
suffer the same fate?

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,960
Besides, he promised me

63
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,880
that after Li Zhenzuo's first wife died,

64
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,080
he would take the whole family

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
to leave Hu Li Town

66
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,440
and never come back.

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,000
In order to keep the secret,

68
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,760
you can't keep

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,560
investigating them.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,640
I want you to take Juan

71
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,040
to hide for a while.

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
Mr. Hu.

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,280
Give me some time to think about it.

74
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,480
You've decided?

75
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,560
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,960
I wanted to be a policeman since I was a kid.

77
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,920
I thought I was a good policeman.

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
But after I was born,

79
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
I changed my mind.

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,840
I wanted to catch all the bad guys.

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,880
I had to be fair and just.

82
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,080
I couldn't be selfish.

83
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,480
I had to change my mind.

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,360
I had to explain to the judicial office

85
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,400
and the dead.

86
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,320
Juan.

87
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,320
Don't blame me.

88
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm not good enough for you.

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,720
Don't look for me anymore.

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,440
Just go.

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,800
Do you like me?

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,880
I know you like me.

93
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,760
I like you, too.

94
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,960
I've decided.

95
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,000
I won't leave.

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,600
You're not afraid. I'm not afraid, either.

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,680
I've done so many wrong things.

98
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,760
I should be punished for my mistakes.

99
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
I support you.

100
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,800
But your grandpa...

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,320
I'm the one he loves the most.

102
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,120
I'll go beg him.

103
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,200
He'll definitely agree.

104
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,400
It's quite lively.

105
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,920
Officer Zhao.

106
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,760
The chief is here.

107
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,040
Officer Zhao.

108
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,600
What's the matter?

109
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,720
You have

110
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
a man named Li Xingzong, right?

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,360
Yes.

112
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,800
He's here to report you.

113
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,640
The chief asked me to investigate this matter.

114
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,840
Officer Zhao.

115
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,520
Is it true?

116
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,520
You must have made a mistake.

117
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,960
He won't do it.

118
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,440
Don't worry, Officer Zhao.

119
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,400
I'll go find my grandpa.

120
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,960
Juan.

121
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,680
Officer Zhao.

122
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,080
Let's go.

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,800
Officer Zhao.

124
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,000
Dad.

125
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
I don't understand.

126
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
We're the local emperors here.

127
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
Why do we have to go to the provincial capital?

128
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,680
Besides,

129
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,680
isn't the head of the town still here?

130
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,480
Dad.

131
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,400
What are you afraid of?

132
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,360
Shut up.

133
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,400
What are you afraid of?

134
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,440
Shut up.

135
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,360
Didn't I tell you

136
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,440
to keep an eye on the town

137
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,360
and keep it from me?

138
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,360
If it's not a terrible situation,

139
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,480
why should we go?

140
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,440
Do you know who Mr. Hu is?

141
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Who?

142
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,040
Just go.

143
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,080
I really can't bear to leave you.

144
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,440
Don't worry, Mr. Hu.

145
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,840
I'll come to see you often

146
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,000
if I have a chance.

147
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,440
Okay.

148
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,080
Master.

149
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,160
Master Li is here.

150
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,200
He's here for a trip.

151
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,680
Get him in.

152
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,760
Yes.

153
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,040
Master.

154
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,080
You can go ahead.

155
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,160
I'll leave first.

156
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,720
I won't keep you then.

157
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,080
Dad.

158
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,440
Dad.

159
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,480
I've packed up.

160
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,480
I don't have much time left.

161
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,240
Let me kowtow to you.

162
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,280
What's the use of kowtowing?

163
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,800
Can you not go?

164
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,600
Can you?

165
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,680
Can't I not marry Hu Zheng Kun?

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,400
Zuo is just a man of his own.

167
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,920
If he has a son,

168
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
he must be good to him.

169
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,440
Don't be like him.

170
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
He's a man of his own.

171
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,760
I see.

172
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,680
Dad.

173
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,240
Start.

174
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,140
verification

175
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,800
Easy.

176
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,560
It'll crust you.

177
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,440
I'm fine.

178
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,680
I see.

179
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,200
Father.

180
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,800
Your nose.

181
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,560
What's wrong?

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,360
Your nose.

183
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,040
Your nose.

184
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,920
Worm.

185
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,960
Are you okay, Master?
