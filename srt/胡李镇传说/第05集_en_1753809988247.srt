1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
Stand By Me

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,540
Episode 43

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,820
How is my lady

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,280
It's okay.

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,440
She'll be fine after a few days.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,240
Okay.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,120
Her illness is a heart disease.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,720
Master,

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,160
we found her.

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,280
It's Hu San.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,600
Besides,

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,480
the Li family sent someone to say

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,720
what?

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,800
The Li family has beaten Li Xingzong to death.

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,160
Father.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,480
He's your son.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
Calm down.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,960
But I think

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,400
even if he's a bastard,

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,960
you're at home

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,960
and you're scolding him in front of so many people.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,880
He really doesn't dare to do such a thing.

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,800
I know it's not his doing.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,120
But someone saw

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,800
the little bastard

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,520
who was in the room of Hu San

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,560
on the night of the accident.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Master,

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,040
it's easy to beat him.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,800
It's all my fault.

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
I've been busy all day and couldn't take care of him.

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
He's been spoiled.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,640
Look at him.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,880
He's got a bunch of bad guys.

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,480
He's not as good as a fish in a pond.

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,160
He's not a rich man.

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,600
It's not his fault.

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,600
You have to discipline him.

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,000
Especially the bastard below him.

40
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,520
Who is Hu San?

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,600
He's a bandit.

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,840
If something happens,

43
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,560
not only you,

44
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,920
but even I can't protect him.

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,480
Sit down.

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,960
I asked you to come today

47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,920
because I have something to tell you.

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,880
Back then,

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,480
the Hu family was framed and killed by the enemy.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,160
They hid in the Fox Town.

51
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
Now the situation is unstable.

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,560
It's getting more and more chaotic outside.

53
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,200
I think

54
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,240
although the Fox Town is remote,

55
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,560
it's not a place to hide.

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,240
I'm going to take the opportunity to build a temple

57
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,000
and get the original plan done in advance.

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,320
There's a rumor on the town

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,160
about the blood fox.

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,200
You have to help

61
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,960
to set a fire.

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,680
I understand.

63
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,560
Don't.

64
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,720
He's still angry.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,720
Stop laughing.

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,320
Enough.

67
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,800
Where did you get this?

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,280
I don't know.

69
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,400
What did you say?

70
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,520
Blood fox.

71
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,040
Blood fox.

72
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,800
Blood fox.

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,000
What's going on?

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,560
He's confused by the blood fox.

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,600
God bless me.

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,200
Master Hu.

77
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,920
Master Hu.

78
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,480
Who's that?

79
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,320
I'm back.

80
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,800
Master Hu.

81
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,320
Look at this fool.

82
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
Nonsense.

83
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,160
You're crazy too.

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,640
Where did you get the blood fox?

85
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,040
I'm not.

86
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,720
You...

87
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,720
Stop talking.

88
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,840
Stop talking.

89
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,600
Big sister.

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,680
Don't be afraid.

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,880
Are you okay?

92
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,400
Stop.

93
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,160
Stop.

94
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,640
How dare you hit Master Hu?

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
I can't stand you.

96
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,640
Master Hu.

97
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,760
Don't be so crazy.

98
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,480
Master Hu.

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,960
We all know you're kind.

100
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
You want to help him.

101
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,200
But he's so kind.

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
Leave him to me.

103
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,640
Master Hu.

104
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,320
You're a Bodhisattva.

105
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,880
I'll do you a favor.

106
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Anyway, I don't need this food.

107
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Where do you think?

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,360
That's good.

109
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Then you don't need to do this.

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,600
I should.

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,040
I should do a favor.

112
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,120
I'll take a look at your face.

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,360
Take him away.

114
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,560
What's wrong with him?

115
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,200
You...

116
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,080
Let him go.

117
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,760
Let's go.

118
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,440
Master.

119
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,840
Did something happen?

120
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Let him go.

121
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,960
What can happen?

122
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,120
He was taken back by the Li family.

123
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
All the plans are messed up.

124
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,440
Hu Juan's case is an accident.

125
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,080
He's innocent.

126
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,040
If I don't punish him,

127
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,400
I'll find out the truth.

128
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
All the people who should pay the price

129
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,800
will be punished twice as much.

130
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,560
Sister, look.

131
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,400
It's so beautiful.

132
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,680
What are you doing?

133
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,360
Why are you following a lunatic?

134
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,960
You don't want to be a lunatic either?

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,760
Go.

136
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,360
Dad.

137
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,280
Call me dad.

138
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,680
Call me dad.

139
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,320
Master.

140
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,000
Call me dad.

141
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,560
Call me dad.

142
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
You dare to hit me?

143
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,120
Shut up.

144
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,920
You're shameless.

145
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,200
Master.

146
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
Why did you make a lunatic live here?

147
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,280
You should go back.

148
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,440
You dare to hit me?

149
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,520
Just kill him.

150
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,800
I can't go back.
