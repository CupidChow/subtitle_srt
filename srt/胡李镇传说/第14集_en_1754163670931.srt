The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Are you crazy?

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
I'll beat you to death.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
You're so annoying.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
You said that you killed that crazy woman and Xiu'er?

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
I didn't kill them.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
They killed them in the blood pool.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
I...

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
I...

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
I...

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
You're capable enough to kill me.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Say it.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Say it.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
I didn't kill them.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
My father, that old man,

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
forced me to kill them.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Father?

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Why?

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
I don't know.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
I know. I know.

23
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Who is that?

24
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
That crazy woman.

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
She told my father

26
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
that when Master Wu was young,

27
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
he was a human trafficker.

28
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Xiu'er heard about it.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So they had to die.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My father had to keep the secret for Master Wu.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Your father kept the secret for Master Wu?

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What's your family's relationship with the Hu family?

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't know.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He didn't tell me.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I...

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I really don't know.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He really didn't tell me.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Xiu'er.

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How did Xiu'er kill her?

40
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I wanted her to die a little bit strangely.

41
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
So I gave her a drug.

42
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
What drug?

43
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
And the man on the mountain

44
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
was also a drug you gave her?

45
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
You know all about it?

46
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
The death is the same.

47
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Even the mouth is smiling.

48
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Is it hard to guess?

49
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Xiu'er.

50
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
I'm in your hands today.

51
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I only have one request.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Tell me.

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Tell me.

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Tell me.

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That man was actually a flower seller.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He killed Hu Juan that night.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hu San and I blocked him.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Stop.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Stop.

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Stop.

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Stop.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Stop.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Stop.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Stop.

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Spare me.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I saw you running.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're running again.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Spare me.

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Just listen to me.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's going on?

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Stop.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What's going on?

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What are you doing?

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tell me.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll tell you.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll tell you.

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
This is a kind of drug.

78
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
It's applied on people's faces.

79
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
It will make them unconscious.

80
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
What does it do?

81
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
What does it do?

82
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
It's so good.

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Zi Ge.

84
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
This is a treasure.

85
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Why do you want to do this?

86
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Zai Juan.

87
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Is there anything else?

88
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
No.

89
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Just this one.

90
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
You're not listening.

91
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Ya Feng.

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're so fast.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Juan.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm here.

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't know

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
if this

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
is really that good.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Try it.

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Try it.

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What are you doing?

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Go.

102
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you doing?

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a drug.

104
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
A drug?

105
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Zi Ge.

106
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
This is really good.

107
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
It's really good.

108
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Get up.

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're playing dead with me, aren't you?

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm out of energy.

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So this is also the drug that Juan was given.

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Juan?

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll tell you.

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You know

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Juan's little wolf-hide

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I've been following him for a long time.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I was going to

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
get him confused.

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That night in the shabby temple

120
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I was going to get him.

121
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
But that crazy wolf

122
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
got me.

123
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Prince Shen.

124
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Say it.

125
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Juan.

126
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
No.

127
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Take it to the mountain.

128
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
I'll take you to the forest.

129
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Go.

130
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Juan.

131
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Juan.

132
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Juan.

133
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
I'm here.

134
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
This little foot.

135
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
What's that?

136
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
What's that?

137
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Who's there?

138
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Get lost.

139
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
I'm sorry, Juan.

140
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
I was scared back there.

141
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Scared back there.

142
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Damn it.

145
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm telling the truth.

146
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This was an accident.

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That night when I found him on the mountain

148
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
he was already fainted.

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But it had nothing to do with me.

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I was not in the mood later.

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I went to the old house to play.

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
After all, I had to turn off the fire.

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you're responsible for the fox-hide.

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Fox-hide?

155
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
It's me, it's me, it's me.

156
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm the one who ate and drank my poison.

157
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
That bastard

158
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
ate and drank my poison.

159
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
He even threatened me with the money.

160
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
He told me that if I didn't give him the money,

161
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
he would tell Master Hu.

162
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Later, I found out

163
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
that after I left that night,

164
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
he went in.

165
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
He's a good man.

166
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
So he must die.

167
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm not good at singing.

168
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
You should compare with him.

169
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:24,380
Yihou isemos

170
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
She went to kill Zhaofan.

171
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Then she committed suicide.

172
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Mr. Li, you're so cunning.

173
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,420
You said that the people who knew about this

174
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,740
were all dead.

175
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,020
What did Zhou Dafa and Hu Xiaoyun know?

176
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,380
Did I say it?

177
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,860
I said it! I said it!

178
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,980
Because they knew about my medicine.

179
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,300
I caught up with the medicine at the Chinese Pharmacy that day.

180
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,260
Come on.

181
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,500
I'll show you.

182
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,380
I'll show you.

183
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:00,940
I'll show you.

184
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,740
I'll show you.

185
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,500
I'll show you.

186
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,380
I'll show you.

187
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,220
I'll show you.

188
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,660
Is my medicine ready?

189
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,780
Yes. Yes.

190
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,940
Yu'er, do you miss me?

191
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,020
Mr. Li.

192
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,780
Come on.

193
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,140
Do you want to get married?

194
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,340
Yes. Yes.

195
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,900
If you want to get married,

196
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,740
shut your mouth.

197
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,860
Do you hear me?

198
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,180
Yes. Yes, Mr. Li.

199
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,980
It's almost done.

200
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,460
But Mr. Li,

201
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,220
I'd like to say something.

202
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,980
Don't take this medicine too often.

203
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,540
I don't need your teaching.

204
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,220
The pharmacy was opened by the doctor on the line.

205
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,580
Don't be so nosy.

206
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,380
You'll ruin our young master's reputation.

207
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
Do you want to live?

208
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,180
Yes. Yes.

209
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,860
We promise not to let others know.

210
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,660
Yes.

211
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,860
Brother,

212
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,540
look at this girl.

213
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,660
I'll pray for her.

214
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,220
Okay.

215
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,940
I'll give you this face.

216
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,740
Yu'er, don't be afraid.

217
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,020
I love you.

218
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,180
Let's go.

219
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,620
Go.

220
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,900
You're afraid they'll leak the secret,

221
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,900
so you kill them.

222
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,500
Brother,

223
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,660
if Hu San doesn't threaten me,

224
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,420
they won't die.

225
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,580
I have no choice.

226
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,340
Do you want me to let you go?

227
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,860
Can I?

228
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,140
Okay.

229
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,900
Okay.

230
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,580
As long as you let me go,

231
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,100
I can do anything.

232
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,900
How much do you want?

233
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,540
Tell me.

234
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,180
I'll act in a play.

235
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,620
Act in a play?
