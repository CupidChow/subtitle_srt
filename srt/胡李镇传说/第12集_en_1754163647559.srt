The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,300
Listen up.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,700
How many times do I have to ask you?

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,300
You want me to admit that you're old?

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,700
Hu Xiu.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,300
Think about it.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,300
I'll ask you one last time.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,500
Will you admit it or not?

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,700
Xiaokuan.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,200
Don't be impulsive.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Hu Jun's case

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,100
was done by Hu San.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,200
Not me.

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,900
Chunzi.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,600
No, no, no.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,800
Hu Zhengkuan.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
What are you doing?

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,400
Steward Hu.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,400
He won't admit it if he doesn't take action.

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,400
If you take action,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
you'll be humiliated.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
He killed him.

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,500
Xiu'er saw it with her own eyes yesterday.

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,500
Bullshit.

27
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,800
Zhenzu.

28
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,600
My father and your father are friends.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,100
I won't make it hard for you for his sake.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Tell me the truth.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Did you kill Xiu'er?

32
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Steward Hu.

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,900
You're not a child.

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
I'm a human.

35
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm not a creature.

36
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,100
Then who do you think did it?

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,300
Not a human.

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,000
It's a blood fox.

39
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,500
Father.

40
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,700
Father is here.

41
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,300
Tell me what you saw.

42
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,700
Well.

43
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,300
Last night,

44
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,700
I saw Young Master coming out of Xiu's room.

45
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,100
I saw him send her out.

46
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,500
He was holding a dog in his mouth.

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,100
You're so smart.

48
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,100
It's so late.

49
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,900
Why didn't you sleep?

50
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,100
I was hungry and slept for a whole night.

51
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,700
Yaolong.

52
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,300
If you lie,

53
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
you'll know the consequences.

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
I dare not lie.

55
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,200
If I lie,

56
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
I'll be beaten.

57
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,500
Why did you go?

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Tell me now.

59
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
You don't know what kind of person Xiu is.

60
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
I have a grudge against her.

61
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
If I tell her,

62
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
she'll have to dig my eyes out.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,200
Now I'm in trouble.

64
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,400
I have no choice.

65
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,200
I have to come out and testify.

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
Now you know it's a matter of life and death.

67
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Why did you go?

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,600
Go on.

69
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,000
Well.

70
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll tell you.

71
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Last night,

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,600
I had a stomachache.

73
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,700
I was squatting in the toilet.

74
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,500
I was pulling and pulling.

75
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,100
I suddenly heard a noise.

76
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,300
When I looked up,

77
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,300
there was a blood stain on the roof.

78
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,100
What are you talking about?

79
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
I didn't mean it.

80
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,300
Why didn't you tell me?

81
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,100
The master said

82
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,700
there was no blood stain.

83
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
If I told you,

84
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,500
I wouldn't have taken the responsibility of spreading rumors.

85
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,500
Enough. Stop talking.

86
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
You're a bunch of crap.

87
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Manager Hu.

88
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,100
What do you think?

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Enough.

90
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
Open it.

91
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,200
Amitabha.

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
After you worship my Buddha,

93
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
don't cut off the incense.

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,200
The Buddha's heart is the most important thing

95
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
in the world.

96
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,900
Please rest assured.

97
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,700
I've been walking around the whole Fox Town

98
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,900
and I can't feel any demon aura.

99
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,700
But I have something to say.

100
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,300
The demon is gone.

101
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,100
The trouble is inevitable.

102
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,700
Please take care of yourself.

103
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,500
I'm leaving.

104
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Amitabha.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Master.

106
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,500
Amitabha.

107
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,300
This is from Hu Changshan.

108
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Keep it.

109
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,100
I'll come to you after I take revenge.

110
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
But Master,

111
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,300
I have something to say.

112
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,500
What's the difference

113
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,900
between what we did

114
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
and what the people who harmed us did?

115
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,900
And the people who raised us...

116
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,500
It's all a conspiracy.

117
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,500
The evil spirit they planted on you

118
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,500
should now bear the evil fruit

119
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,100
you gave them.

120
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,500
This is the cycle of nature.

121
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,300
You have to remember one thing.

122
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,900
The cause and effect are in the heaven.

123
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,300
The good and evil are in the heart.

124
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,300
In the end,

125
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
it's all up to you.

126
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,900
But I can't turn back now.

127
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,700
Dad,

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,200
you're so good at this.

129
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
You're a good horse.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,400
I'm just reading a book.

131
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
You don't know what's going on.

132
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,200
But you

133
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
have to stay for so long.

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,200
And the woman found out.

135
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,200
You haven't seen her in your life.

136
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,000
Dad,

137
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
you don't know

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
that show

139
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,000
is so good.

140
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
It's so good.

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
How can she not know?

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Tell me the truth.

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
You're still so strong.

144
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
So great.

145
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
Since my brother-in-law has satisfied you,

146
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,600
you should satisfy him too.

147
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,800
How can I satisfy him?

148
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Tell him

149
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,400
what that woman said.

150
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Brother-in-law,

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,400
I don't dare to say it.

152
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Your father said

153
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,900
if I dare to say it,

154
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,700
he will never let me in.

155
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,300
Don't make it hard for me.

156
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,300
How about

157
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
you ask him?

158
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,900
I'm asking him?

159
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,700
Come here.

160
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,500
You little girl.

161
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,100
Am I embarrassing you?

162
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Why do you ask him?

163
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,300
I'm asking you.

164
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,300
Believe it or not, I'll beat you to death.

165
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,100
I just want to go in.

166
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,100
I won't say it even if you beat me to death.

167
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,900
Oh,

168
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,700
you're coming into my house?

169
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,300
Do you know what this is?

170
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
Believe it or not, I'll beat you to death.

171
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,100
Say it.

172
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
This is my son.

173
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,100
He's your brother-in-law.

174
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
You won't kill me, right?

175
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,900
Yes.

176
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,700
You're the best woman in the world.

177
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,100
How can I bear to kill you?

178
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,500
Come on.

179
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
What a pity.

180
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,900
It's all fate.

181
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Be quiet recently.

182
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,700
Why?

183
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,100
You say why.

184
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,400
That Ruyin Master has left.

185
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Before he left,

186
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
he blamed all the strange things

187
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,200
on the blood fox.

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,800
But he came here

189
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,000
and did the magic.

190
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
He even said in front of everyone

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,200
that the blood fox was already stuck in his mouth.

192
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
If anything happens in the future,

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,200
he will never admit it.

194
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,800
What a big deal.

195
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
I think he's just making a big deal.

196
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,600
Today I finally understand

197
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
what magic

198
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,600
is all fake.

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,600
Dad,

200
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,400
when those people pretended to be ghosts,

201
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,400
they were so funny.

202
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,200
Where did the blood fox come from?

203
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,200
But so many people in town said they saw it.

204
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,800
What do you think is going on?

205
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's hard to believe.

206
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
And we can't believe it all.

207
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,400
Who knows?

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
But so many years ago,

209
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,700
people were talking about things with noses and eyes.

210
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,700
It can't be fake.

211
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,700
Thanks to Mr. Hu's help today.

212
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,700
Help?

213
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,300
He's helping?

214
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,700
How can you tell the difference?

215
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
If it weren't for Mr. Hu,

216
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
it wouldn't be over

217
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,500
if we didn't kill two people today.

218
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
You're so stubborn.

219
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
I'll remind you at last.

220
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,100
Don't touch the blood fox.

221
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,500
Do you hear me?

222
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,500
Dad,

223
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,800
you can't hold me back.

224
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I have a wife.

225
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,000
Forget it.

226
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
It's really tasteless.

227
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,200
Forget it.

228
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Sleep alone tonight.
