00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Juan.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,600
Juan.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,800
Open the door.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
I know you're in there.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,800
Go away, Brother Xiao Kun.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm not worthy of you.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,400
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,200
Don't you understand my thoughts?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,800
But

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,200
I'm not worthy of you.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,200
Juan.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,000
I didn't protect you well before.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
But I hope

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,400
you'll be by my side in the future.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,800
I swear

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,600
no one will bully you again.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,400
Everything will be fine.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,400
I'll find out the truth

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
and give you justice.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,200
I'm not afraid of people or blood foxes.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm not afraid of people or blood foxes.

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm not afraid of anything.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,400
I have a good eye.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,600
I'm not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
I'm not afraid of anything.

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,600
This jade pendant was given to me by my mother.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,000
It blesses me with safety.

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Now I'm giving it to you.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,200
Promise me, Juan.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't do anything stupid in the future.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,800
I'm going.

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,920
I'll go.

36
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,440
Master Wu said so.

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,440
You heard it.

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
How can it be rewarded?

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,800
How to do it?

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,520
I didn't.

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,360
Just watch.

42
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,040
I don't know who the next bad guy is.

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,160
Hu Xiaoyun.

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,320
Hu Xiaoyun?

45
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,240
Have you forgotten about the past?

46
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,040
Three women

47
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,760
were killed by the blood fox.

48
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,880
This time,

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,400
didn't Hu San want to be with Hu Xiaoyun?

50
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,040
This is a bad fox.

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,360
Can she be afraid of being bullied

52
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,520
if someone else does something bad?

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,800
Hu Xiaoyun

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
is always late.

55
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,200
If you say so,

56
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Juan

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,960
is really a bad fox.

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,280
Don't talk nonsense.

59
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,800
Have you heard it?

60
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,440
Juan

61
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,920
is in trouble.

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,080
Fortunately, he was found in time.

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,920
God bless him. God bless him.

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,680
Juan can't be in trouble again.

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,960
Who is Juan?

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,400
That's Master Hu's favorite.

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,240
Juan is in trouble.

68
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,400
How can Master Hu find him?

69
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,680
That's right.

70
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,640
Do you have any way

71
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,960
to kill the blood fox?

72
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,360
You

73
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,160
are so careless.

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,880
The master will start to practice tomorrow.

75
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,240
He is a respected monk.

76
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,000
He must be good at it.

77
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,160
How capable can a fox god be?

78
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,480
He was captured more than a hundred years ago.

79
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,960
This time, he can't run away.

80
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
I heard that

81
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,080
there is a temple.

82
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,160
The Li family

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,040
made a lot of money.

84
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,240
It's a good thing.

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Is it so good?

86
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,320
It's because of Master Hu.

87
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,760
He wants to please Master Hu.

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,720
Otherwise,

89
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
the Hu family is in trouble.

90
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,720
Otherwise, the Li family...

91
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,560
The Li family...

92
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,600
Yun, don't cry.

93
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,920
It's okay.

94
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,120
That's right.

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,080
You can't live or die.

96
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,160
You have to take care of yourself.

97
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
That's right.

98
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,000
As the saying goes,

99
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,600
the old man won't die.

100
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,000
The new man won't come.

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Look at me.

102
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,760
It's okay.

103
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,760
You'll be fine after taking this medicine.

104
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Thank you, Dr. Huang.

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,200
Dr. Huang,

106
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,680
is Li Zhenzu

107
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,200
interested in Hu Xiaoyun?

108
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,000
He doesn't like Hu Xiaoyun.

109
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,800
Hu Xiaoyun is a big boy.

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,960
He likes young people.

111
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,440
He is a good boy.

112
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,600
I heard that he has a baby.

113
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,720
Move aside.

114
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,120
Move aside.

115
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,040
Look.

116
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
Move aside.

117
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,960
What are you doing?

118
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,320
Yun,

119
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,920
I'm here to apologize to you.

120
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,360
Yun,

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,960
although this has nothing to do with me,

122
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,200
it's not about Hu San.

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,400
It's about me.

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,560
So,

125
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,720
I didn't watch him well.

126
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
I'm irresponsible.

127
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,720
I announce that

128
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,440
from today on,

129
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,240
I'll take care of Hu Xiaoyun.

130
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,840
Whoever dares to bully her

131
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,280
will be the one who bullies me.

132
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,520
Young Master, you're being too kind.

133
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,600
Don't cry.

134
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,720
I understand.

135
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,080
I won't say anything even if I die.

136
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
It's good that you know.

137
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,440
If you have any problem,

138
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
just tell me.

139
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,640
There's nothing that the Li family can't do.

140
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,640
That's right.

141
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,360
Why are you here?

142
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,880
You're everywhere.

143
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,880
What are you doing here?

144
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,240
He's here to get medicine.

145
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,480
I'm here to help him.

146
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,560
Help him?

147
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,640
Listen,

148
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,040
you're a foreigner.

149
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,880
Don't wander around in Huli Town.

150
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,640
If you make me angry,

151
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,200
even that old man Hu can't protect you.

152
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,200
Do you know that?

153
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,640
Go.

154
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,920
Master Hu.

155
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,720
Master Hu.

156
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,440
He's back.

157
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,720
Master Hu.

158
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,200
I want to see

159
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,320
if I can protect you.

160
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,400
Protect you?

161
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,160
I was wrong just now.

162
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,040
No, you heard it wrong.

163
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,440
I'm old.

164
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,000
But I'm not deaf.

165
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Usually,

166
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,360
the Li family

167
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
does something ridiculous

168
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,840
by being naughty.

169
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,280
I'm just trying to

170
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,480
keep my eyes on you

171
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,360
for Master Li's sake.

172
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,360
But I can tell you that

173
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,040
Huli Town can't allow you to be naughty.

174
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,200
The Li family can't control you.

175
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Even the Hu family

176
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,080
can't control you,

177
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
there's still the law.

178
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,640
Shut up.

179
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,800
Master Hu.

180
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,280
It's not a big deal.

181
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,880
Even if it's not about our relationship,

182
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,720
for Jun's sake,

183
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,160
I can't make you angry.

184
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,000
Master Hu.

185
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,000
What do you think?

186
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,120
You'd better think it over.

187
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,200
Although you didn't do those things,

188
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,000
Hu San has been following you.

189
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,240
You can't get rid of it.

190
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,480
When I find out everything,

191
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,040
I'll settle the score with you.

192
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,400
Master Hu.

193
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,840
I'm wronged.

194
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,520
Hu San followed me.

195
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,680
But he was hurt by the blood fox.

196
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,760
The blood fox didn't follow me.

197
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,560
Master Hu.

198
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,800
I heard that

199
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,560
the person who was hurt was found.

200
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,960
It was also the blood fox.

201
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,280
Master Hu.

202
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,520
It's not a good time.

203
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
My father asked me to go home early.

204
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,760
He didn't want me to walk around.

205
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,960
Master Hu.

206
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,920
I'll go first.

207
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,520
How about

208
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,760
an apple?

209
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,080
I see.

210
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,280
Hua.

211
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,400
Take it.

212
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,280
You're a fool.

213
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,720
Wait for me.

214
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,520
Young Master.

215
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,000
You two are being traitors.

216
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,660
Goodbye, BlackJemba.

217
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,460
Uhh,

218
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,460
why are you here?

219
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,380
Why are you here?

220
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,700
Why does you ask me why I am here,

221
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,220
if I won't help you?

222
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,260
Of course you have to help me,

223
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,580
if especially,

224
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,020
All women aged 13, 23, 33, 43, and 53

225
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,180
who are married,

226
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,500
turn around.

227
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,740
You're here.

228
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,100
You're still talking nonsense.

229
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,140
I'm not a woman.

230
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,420
I'm a real widow.

231
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,420
I'm not like you.

232
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,460
You're a fake widow.

233
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,940
I...

234
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,100
Don't argue.

235
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,460
Hear him out.

236
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,500
Let's see

237
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,460
how to win his heart.

238
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,300
See him go?

239
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,620
Answer me,

240
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,220
poor man!

241
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Come back!

242
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,740
Now,

243
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,220
теперь,

244
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,120
Mingxian

245
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,320
Give him

246
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,960
사는

247
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,220
What's going on?

248
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
What's going on?

249
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,220
She's gone.

250
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
What's going on?

251
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
