00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This Fox Town

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
was called Fox Town a long time ago.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It is said that a blood fox

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
set a curse on the town 100 years ago.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The whole town was destroyed

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
overnight.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then a monk passed by

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and fought with the blood fox

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
for three days and nights

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to suppress it.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
After a hundred years,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
this place has become

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
a fox town.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Because the residents of the town

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
mainly belong to the Hu family

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and the Li family,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the Fox Town was renamed

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Fox Town.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Master Rong Yi,

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Master Rong Yi,

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the Fox Town is ahead.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's say goodbye here.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Amitabha.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you for taking care of me

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
on the way.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Master Rong Yi,

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you're welcome.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You cured the false witness

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
of my young master.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's a great achievement.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's also right

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
to escort you along the way.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Amitabha.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Amitabha.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Amitabha.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Amitabha.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Da Niu.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Da Niu.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Da Niu.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Where are you?

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Brother Kang.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Brother Kang.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
How is it?

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Did you find it?

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Not even a shadow of a person.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you doing?

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm telling you.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Da Niu went out

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
with a knife.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He was sick and sick.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He didn't recognize anyone.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He didn't recognize anyone.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He didn't recognize anyone.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He didn't recognize anyone.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He didn't recognize anyone.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He didn't recognize anyone.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He was sick and sick.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He didn't recognize anyone.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If he hurt anyone,

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
it's our serious mistake.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you know that?

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hurt someone?

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I think he can only

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
cut one or two wild cats.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Brother Kun.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm just

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
admiring our life.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
For so many years,

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
two police officers

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
have been in Huli Town.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They haven't even caught a thief.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Enough.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Stop talking nonsense.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Keep looking.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Da Niu.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Kill.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Brother Kun.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Da Niu.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That way.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's go.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Da Niu.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why are you hanging a paper man

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
here?

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ling'er is dead.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is not Ling'er.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Ling'er is not dead.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Do you know

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
how to deal with him?

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You can't kill him.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He's not dead.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He's alive.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He's alive.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Da Niu.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't come over.

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Stay away from him.

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Calm down.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He's sick now.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Who else would he be if he didn't know you?

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Da Niu.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm Zeng Kun.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Look at my eyes.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Da Niu.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Brother Kun.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Are you okay?

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Da Niu.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Are you okay?

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ling'er is dead.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's okay.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's go home.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Brother Kun.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's dangerous here.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What?

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's dangerous here.

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Little fox.

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Little fox.

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Da Niu.

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Kill him.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Kill him.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's go.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Kill him.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm going crazy.

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Stop talking nonsense.

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Go after him.

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Go.

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Da Niu.

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How can you run like that?

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Brother Kun.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Where is this place?

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Little fox.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Little fox.

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a little fox.

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What little fox?

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's go see.

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,740
Set off!

138
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,400
Man consegue!

139
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,480
Geng!

140
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,780
Geng, wake up.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Add the sauce

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Add the sauce

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Add the sauce

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Add the sauce

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Add the sauce

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Add the sauce

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Add the sauce

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Add the sauce

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Add the sauce

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Add the sauce

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Add the sauce

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Add the sauce

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Add the sauce

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Add the sauce

155
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,000
Add the sauce

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Add the sauce

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Add the sauce

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Add the sauce

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Add the sauce

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Add the sauce

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Add the sauce

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Add the sauce

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Add the sauce

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Add the sauce

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Add the sauce

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Add the sauce

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Add the sauce

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,600
And Master, I may be fired.

169
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,560
You're going to leave?

170
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,880
I have a lot of important things to do.

171
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,000
So...

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
All right.

173
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,680
You're different from the people of Fox Town.

174
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,240
You have great ambition.

175
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,280
You saved my life.

176
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,600
I'm not a ungrateful person.

177
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,760
Master Fu, don't worry.

178
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,720
After I finish my work,

179
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,400
I'll come back to see you and Juan.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,720
Go.

181
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,720
I won't force you.

182
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,600
Master.

183
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,080
Huo Quan.

184
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,360
Master.

185
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,080
Go and invite Dr. Huang.

186
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,280
Remember, don't tell him anything else.

187
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,080
Just invite him.

188
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,360
Yes.

189
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,120
The late fox...

190
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,600
The late fox...
