00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Brother Kun,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that house

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
has been searched for seven or eight times.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There's no clue.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How about we not go there?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Zhu'er has suffered such a great humiliation.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll find someone to prove it.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That house must have been searched for nine times.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As long as it's a person,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
there must be a clue.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What if it's not a person?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Do you really believe in me?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't you know that

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
you're the only one

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
who doesn't believe in this town?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Even if it's a real blood fox,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll find it to prove it.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Brother Kun,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
did you hear anything?

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't talk nonsense.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There's no sound.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Brother Kun.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Brother Kun.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Brother Kun.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He's not here.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Where's Xiao Yun?

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hurry and get me some medicine.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't know.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Did you bring your prescription?

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's always the same prescription.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's just...

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You all know it.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't worry.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's all here.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Xiao Yun is really something.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hurry and go.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Brother Kun.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Brother Kun.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Brother Kun.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Brother Kun.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Brother Kun.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Brother Kun.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Brother Kun.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Brother Kun.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Brother Kun.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Brother Kun.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Brother Kun.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Da Fang.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Husser.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Da Fang.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What's wrong?

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Look.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Look at him.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Husser.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Husser?

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What do you mean?

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't talk nonsense.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let me tell you.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let me go.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let me go.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let me go.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The blood fox is back.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Everyone has to die.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Everyone has to die.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Kill him.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm killing someone.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's wrong?

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm killing someone.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What do we do?

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What do we do?

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Help.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is there anyone to save him?

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Move aside.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Move aside.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let me go.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He's dead.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Help.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Help.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Help.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Help.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Help.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Help.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Help.

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Help.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Help.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What's going on?

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Who saw it?

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I...

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I saw it all over the city.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Say it.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Today is the first day of the lunar month.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I got up earlier than usual.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But I got up and got sick.

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
My stomach hurts.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm so tired.

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mrs. Li.

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to ask you about Hu San.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's the rush?

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Shouldn't we talk about it one by one?

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Go ahead.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
My stomach hurts.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Forget it.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I came to get the medicine because my stomach hurts.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I just got in.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hu San came in.

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hu San stared at Hu Xiaoyun.

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He felt like he was not human.

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He felt like a fox.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Fox?

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is it a fox?

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Mrs. Li.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What does the king call a fox?

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I have an idea.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a big deal.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Officer Hu.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You help us think of a way.

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If it's really a fox, then...

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I said it.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There's no fox.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't worry.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Master Wu has entrusted the Ruyin Faction to make a big fencing for us.

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
In the next few days,

125
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
we will be able to keep everyone safe.

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Except for the demon.

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's great.

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's great.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yang Nan.

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why did you show up in the pharmacy today?

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I went to get some medicine.

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I still coughed.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why?

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What why?

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Now the whole town is in a panic.

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Wu Sanrui, the blood fox, came back and killed people in public.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know what's wrong with giving everyone a heart-to-heart pill.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will find out.

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I have always believed in the ability of Officer Hu.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not just talking about this case.

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And you.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Who are you?

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I will find out.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Where are you going?

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
To investigate the truth.

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Officer Hu, do you want to come with me?

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So you and Old Hu

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
have known that Hu Sanrui was the one who was killed, right?

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes.

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
At first, we all thought it was Li Zhenzu.

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But yesterday someone saw

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Li Zhenzu went to Wang Xiaohua's house for three hours.

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then you found out that it was the second day.

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And before that, someone happened to see

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hu Sanrui coming out of that broken house.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Besides, you also saw that Poison Dou.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll go to Old Hu and ask him.

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Even if you catch Old Hu and use him,

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
he will only tell you that it was the blood fox.

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What should I do?

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Just let Hu Sanrui sell his magic?

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He is dead.

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But his crime has not been announced yet.

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And Juan?

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What about his grievance?

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What about his marriage?

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You still have the nerve to mention Juan?

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Juan was hanged yesterday.

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you know that?

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What did you say?

171
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Juan was hanged?

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
There is no answer.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hu Zheng Kun,

174
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I tell you.

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If you still have a little sympathy for Juan,

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
then don't do this again.

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now the whole town thinks that

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Juan was killed by the blood fox.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You tell Old Hu now

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
to tell everyone that Juan's case is human-made.

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What about Juan?

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He will be ruined by you forever.

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What do you want me to do?

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I am a policeman.

185
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You want me to tell them

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
that all this was done by the blood fox?

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If this is the best way,

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't mind you putting down your shit.

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I am sorry.

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I am sorry.

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I am sorry.

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I am sorry.

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
