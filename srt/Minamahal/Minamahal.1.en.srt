1
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:37,681
This is me and Luna.

2
00:00:38,394 --> 00:00:41,650
Just friends, hanging out.

3
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:46,030
You're not gonna believe
how we ended up in a relationship.

4
00:00:46,637 --> 00:00:51,072
If you can even call it that.

5
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:52,111
Look at this.

6
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,388
Even when she was
crying over her boyfriend,

7
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:57,795
she still managed to take ten selfies.

8
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:02,480
Wow, I really don’t understand why you
need to take pictures while crying. Right?

9
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:05,119
Here, I'll give her a sad-react.

10
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,344
- Luna?
- Hmm?

11
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,312
Have you ever had a boyfriend before?

12
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,706
Look, I see him bonding with plants
more often than with people.

13
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:21,222
Such a waste, he’s cute,
but kind of weird.

14
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:26,194
Oh, did you know I once saw him
at the plaza, selling flowers?

15
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,470
Are they poor?

16
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,897
Come on, maybe he’s
just doing a side hustle.

17
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,568
Hey, what are you guys
standing up here for?

18
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:34,272
Go get the other paint from the stockroom.

19
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:35,570
Ah, okay, okay.

20
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:37,180
You can go ahead first in the studio.

21
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:38,781
We’ll just follow later.

22
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:40,892
- Okay.
- Bye!

23
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,365
Your head is full of gossip.

24
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:45,049
You know too much!

25
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:08,110
If you need to go home already...

26
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:10,276
Is it okay if I go ahead?

27
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:11,822
We have a family dinner.

28
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:16,571
Oh, I’ll go with you. There aren’t many
jeepneys going to our place at night.

29
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:19,367
It’s fine, I can handle this.
Go on, head home.

30
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:22,533
See, Luna, this is why even
if you’re just in Grade 11,

31
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:25,130
you were chosen as President
of the Artist Guild.

32
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:29,791
Stop flattering me.
I know you’re all eager to go home.

33
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:32,610
- Bye, Luna!
- Are you sure you can handle it?

34
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:34,235
- Take care!
- Hey, just take it already.

35
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,379
Do it.

36
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:37,735
Let's go.

37
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,816
This leftover is for you, Sir Dan.

38
00:03:40,323 --> 00:03:41,408
Give it to your wife.

39
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:43,380
Wow, perfect, Raffy!

40
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,077
It’s our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

41
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:47,163
- Really?
- Mhmm!

42
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:48,418
Happy Anniversary!

43
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,936
Thanks, it’s beautiful!

44
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:52,692
Wait, don’t you have
someone to give flowers to,

45
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:55,753
like a girlfriend or
someone you’re courting?

46
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,950
Not yet.

47
00:03:58,515 --> 00:03:59,854
I’m not ready for that.

48
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:01,634
That’s boring.

49
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:02,912
Sir,

50
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:05,218
- Hm?
- do you have a key to the auditorium?

51
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:06,327
Luna?

52
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:08,823
Why are you still here?
I thought you all went home.

53
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:10,415
I still have something to finish.

54
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,816
Can I borrow the key? I’ll prep
the stage for tomorrow.

55
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:13,841
Is that so?

56
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,180
Wait a sec.

57
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:18,945
Isn’t Raffy your classmate?

58
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:21,643
- Since grade 7.
- Raffy,

59
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,910
hand this to Luna.

60
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:31,698
Raffy, go with Luna, so
she can finish up faster.

61
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:33,713
Oh, I got it, Sir Dan. I can handle it.

62
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:39,260
It’s hard to do it all alone, though.
So go with her. Raffy, go with her.

63
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,596
Because I can’t leave my post either.

64
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:44,664
Of course, I’m a professional, right?

65
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:46,545
I'm being paid above minimum, right?

66
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:47,675
Go on.

67
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:52,773
Oh!

68
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,150
What the hell!

69
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,374
You need help?

70
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:01,359
Why are you still at
school at this hour?

71
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:06,352
The gate at home is locked.

72
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:08,483
You're not allowed to knock?

73
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:11,824
- Ugh!
- I’ll do it.

74
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:17,962
Let me help you.

75
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,561
Can you not touch me?

76
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:47,386
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

77
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:00,378
You know what, I’ll just
give you something to do

78
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,131
so you’re not just standing
guard like a dog there.

79
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:04,782
- Here, peel the back
- Alright.

80
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,258
off that double-sided tape.

81
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,406
All of this?

82
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,431
Obviously.

83
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,243
Okay.

84
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,431
There, give me the A.

85
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:14,522
Give me, give me the E.

86
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:16,064
Next, hand me the A.

87
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:22,905
Where do you go home to?

88
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:24,776
Let’s go together if
we’re on the same way.

89
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:27,023
I can’t go home at this hour.

90
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:29,113
I’ll just stay overnight here.

91
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,918
So you’ll go straight to class like that?

92
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:35,727
No shower? No brushing your teeth?

93
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:38,795
Do I smell?

94
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:45,588
Here. There’s a shower
at the Artist Guild studio.

95
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,766
Complete toiletries.
You can take a bath there.

96
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,575
Really?

97
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:52,918
Just don’t use our
toothbrushes, okay?

98
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:54,729
There’s mouthwash
there if you need to rinse.

99
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:56,895
Just return the key to me tomorrow.

100
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,069
Wow! Fresh from a shower, huh.

101
00:07:41,786 --> 00:07:42,786
You’re early.

102
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,838
The pandesal at the
bakery near us runs out fast.

103
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:48,689
I left early so I wouldn’t miss out.
Have you had breakfast?

104
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:50,295
I don’t...

105
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:53,234
- Eat this while it's still hot.
- I don’t eat breakfast.

106
00:07:54,946 --> 00:07:55,946
Hmm!

107
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:58,895
Did you see the viral video
of Cathy and Arnold?

108
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:01,062
- The ones from 9-Banahaw?
- Not yet.

109
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,119
Watch it.

110
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:09,833
Cassy, I really, really like you.

111
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:16,202
Maybe you only see me as a best friend,
but for me, it’s more than that.

112
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,636
So from now on, I want us
to be more than best friends.

113
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,105
Right?

114
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:23,673
Arnold, I've waited for that
from you for so long.

115
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:25,356
You get giddy over that?

116
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,465
Hmm! Gross!

117
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,138
No, I don’t! It’s super cringe.

118
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,526
Then why do you look like that?

119
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,662
I was just laughing.

120
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:35,934
Like you said.

121
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:37,023
Gross.

122
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:39,837
Super gross.

123
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,336
Hmm! Is that yours?

124
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:55,808
I just picked it earlier.

125
00:08:56,684 --> 00:08:58,686
I’ll replant it at home.

126
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,049
Do you want it?

127
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:08,029
It’s yours.

128
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:12,386
What will I do with that?

129
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,208
I don’t know.

130
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:19,849
Put it in a flower vase
at your house?

131
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:21,764
Or something?

132
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:27,330
Anyway, if you don’t want it,
it’s fine.

133
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:30,163
[girls chattering]

134
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,803
Hey! Here!

135
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:33,923
Hey, share some pandesal!

136
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,128
- Where’s that from?
- From me! I bought it at the bakery.

137
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:37,162
I thought you made it.

138
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:39,528
- Come on, sis! Then don't eat it!
- Don't eat!

139
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:43,915
- Don't eat it!
- Alright then! You guys eat it all!

140
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:07,141
Are they paying you here?

141
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:11,935
And does this count as extracurricular?

142
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,410
Nobody’s maintaining it.

143
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:16,921
What a waste.

144
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:18,733
Also,

145
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:21,790
I’m really into plants.
Especially flowers.

146
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:22,831
Why?

147
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:25,765
They remind me of my parents.

148
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,845
They were floral arrangers, like that?

149
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:32,625
Maintaining the garden at home has always
been how we bonded as a family.

150
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:34,993
So ever since they died,

151
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:37,055
it’s been neglected.

152
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,870
Sorry.

153
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:53,007
Here.

154
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:56,386
What’s that?

155
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:58,577
A flower. For you.

156
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:00,942
Yes, I know. What I mean is...

157
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,350
What for?

158
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:04,843
Nothing. I just wanted
to give you something.

159
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:21,286
Hmm.

160
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:22,996
Ta-da!

161
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:24,789
You colored it?

162
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:26,124
Mhm!

163
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:29,648
If you soak the stem of a
white rose in water with blue dye,

164
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:31,181
the petals absorb the color.

165
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:32,801
Nice!

166
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:35,144
Try another color next time.

167
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:37,866
That’s yours.

168
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:39,572
Huh?

169
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:41,003
That’s yours now.

170
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,684
I gave them to you as a gift.

171
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:45,903
Yeah.

172
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:47,475
And now, they’re yours again.

173
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:52,775
Look at this.

174
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,630
Even when she was
crying over her boyfriend,

175
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:58,157
she still managed
to take ten selfies.

176
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:02,369
Wow, I really don’t get why you’d take
a picture of yourself crying. Right?

177
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:05,331
Here, I'll give her a sad react.

178
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:12,649
- Luna?
- Hmm?

179
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:16,605
Have you ever had a boyfriend before?

180
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:24,246
Are you going to court me?

181
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:34,645
Can I?

182
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,402
Do we really have to go through courting?

183
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:43,427
Gross.

184
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:44,596
Let’s just be together already.

185
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:47,175
Are you serious?

186
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:50,267
You're not going to add “just kidding”
at the end of your sentence?

187
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:51,638
Yeah.

188
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:52,848
But,

189
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:54,831
this is my only condition, Raffy.

190
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:57,666
How we are with each other now,
let’s just stay like this.

191
00:12:57,932 --> 00:12:58,932
Chill.

192
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:00,653
No drama, nothing—

193
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:01,678
Gross?

194
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:02,989
Exactly.

195
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:04,245
Understood?

196
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,566
Ma’am, yes ma’am!

197
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:26,091
Yeah, I’m happy that we’re together now.

198
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:30,355
But she didn’t even make me work
hard for it before saying yes.

199
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:32,712
So, what’s the problem?

200
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:35,034
I kinda wish she did.

201
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,277
I’ve never experienced courting someone.

202
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:45,014
Just because she said yes doesn’t mean
you should stop courting her.

203
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,500
You know what, Raffy?

204
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,287
Every day God made,

205
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:57,025
I treat as another opportunity to show
and make my wife feel how much I love her.

206
00:13:57,359 --> 00:14:00,703
So if you want to do
something to make Luna feel

207
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:02,722
that she’s special to you,

208
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:03,939
just do it.

209
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:07,548
Well, that’s the problem, Sir Dan.

210
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:09,789
She doesn’t like that.

211
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:12,665
It’s like...

212
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:15,385
she has a wall.

213
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:17,212
She’s just not used to it.

214
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:18,964
As time goes on,

215
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:20,966
the wall will come down.

216
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:29,641
I’m not weight conscious, okay?

217
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,309
But when I weighed
myself earlier at the clinic,

218
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,975
I was three kilos lighter
compared to last month.

219
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:36,582
- Congrats!
- Mhmm!

220
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:37,900
And because of that...

221
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:50,573
There was a surprise quiz
and I got a perfect score.

222
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,353
I just relied on stock knowledge but bam!

223
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:56,089
Wow, 30 out of 30! Look!

224
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,461
Good job!

225
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:13,017
What’s that for?

226
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:15,836
We’ve been together for two months.

227
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Hmm!

228
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:23,403
For you.

229
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:24,445
I made it.

230
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,034
Have a look!

231
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:33,705
A coaster.

232
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:35,821
Made from resin. I made it.

233
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:36,967
Oh!

234
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:39,586
Hmm.

235
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:43,132
You can put this in your
locker so it smells nice.

236
00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:44,757
And then,

237
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:45,958
hmm,

238
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:48,553
bookmarks.

239
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:49,721
I made them too.

240
00:15:57,563 --> 00:16:00,008
Why do you keep returning
everything I give you?

241
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,294
Uh...

242
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:06,029
Well, you gave them
to me. So, they’re mine.

243
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:09,341
And because they’re mine, I have the
right to do whatever I want with them.

244
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:12,369
And what I want is to gift them back to you
with my artistic touch.

245
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:13,743
Are we good with that?

246
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:15,831
You don’t have to do that.

247
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:18,374
I’m not expecting anything in return.

248
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:19,485
You too, Raffy.

249
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,922
You don’t need to give me flowers.

250
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,691
To be honest, it’s kind of...

251
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:29,011
- Kind of gross.
- Gross?

252
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,013
What’s so gross about that?

253
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,384
I just want to make you feel special

254
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,077
by giving you flowers that I
grew and took care of myself.

255
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:37,477
You really don’t have to do that!

256
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:38,753
Luna, I want to!

257
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:41,498
Our agreement was to
keep things chill. So, why?

258
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:42,774
Because I love you!

259
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:03,629
Ma, I’m busy. Can you call later?

260
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:06,221
You're here?

261
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:08,914
At school? Why?

262
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:14,948
Ma!

263
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:17,659
Hon,

264
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:20,521
do you have a thousand pesos?
I just have somewhere to go to.

265
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:21,812
Where?

266
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:24,172
A friend’s birthday.

267
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:27,168
Where exactly? Why would the fare
cost a thousand pesos?

268
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:28,445
In Bulacan.

269
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,470
Bulacan?

270
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,260
You’re going to see that
guy again, aren’t you?

271
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,817
You said you were done with him.
He’s just milking you for money, Ma.

272
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:38,386
I also have the right

273
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:39,693
to be happy.

274
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:42,052
Since the day that I gave birth to you,

275
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:44,710
my life lost its happiness.

276
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:46,672
I’m tired.

277
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,212
I’m so sick of raising you.

278
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:54,598
Just give me your cellphone,

279
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:55,624
- I’ll pawn it.
- No way.

280
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:56,740
No way!

281
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:57,824
I bought that!

282
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:58,992
That’s my cellphone!

283
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:00,601
Sell your own cellphone!

284
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:02,946
- Give it to me!
- What’s wrong with you, Ma? This is mine!

285
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,111
You and your aunt meddle too much.

286
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:11,909
Why don’t you live together,
since you’re both so nosy!

287
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Luna?

288
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:33,635
Are you okay?

289
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:35,928
Why?

290
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:38,073
Do you think I’m pitiful?

291
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,267
Do you think I’m sad?

292
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:43,773
I’m used to my mom’s craziness,
so stop looking at me like that.

293
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
It's okay.

294
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:03,790
It's okay.

295
00:19:16,762 --> 00:19:18,388
This is my stop. Take care.

296
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:21,155
Who else is with you there?

297
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:23,527
No one.

298
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:25,771
Your dad? Is he not there?

299
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,168
I don’t have a father.

300
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:32,154
Don’t you have other relatives
you can stay with?

301
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,696
It’s not my first time
being left alone at home.

302
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:37,032
My mom goes out more than I do.

303
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,367
Alright, bye now.

304
00:19:44,873 --> 00:19:45,873
I’ll keep you company.

305
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:49,586
If that’s okay with you.

306
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:57,955
Is there any food in the fridge?

307
00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,806
I can cook something for you.

308
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:03,350
I don’t know. Just check.

309
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:08,600
Do you want something in particular?

310
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:10,649
Anything, up to you.

311
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:17,280
Oh, by the way.

312
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,491
While you don’t have a phone,

313
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:21,468
you can use mine.

314
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:23,593
I got it unlocked already.

315
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,276
What, so I could go through your inbox?

316
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:32,376
I have nothing to hide.

317
00:20:32,452 --> 00:20:33,452
I’m a good boy.

318
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,434
Raffy,

319
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,072
do you really love me?

320
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:58,917
Of course I love you!

321
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:03,509
What’s on your mind?

322
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:13,134
Do you really love me,
or am I just your distraction?

323
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:15,672
Distraction from what?

324
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:18,303
From your life issues.

325
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:19,926
You don’t want to go home, right?

326
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:23,458
- It’s not that I don’t want to.
- Sir Dan already told me, Raffy.

327
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:30,269
You sell flowers every night

328
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:33,798
because you don’t want to
ask your siblings for allowance.

329
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,717
You’d rather stay late
at school than go home

330
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:38,917
because you don’t want to bother them.

331
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:45,224
Maybe I’m just your distraction
because you can’t face your own problems?

332
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:50,748
How about me?

333
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,712
Am I just your distraction
from your life's problems?

334
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:56,785
Yeah.

335
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,697
Whatever you can give me,

336
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
I’ll take it.

337
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:08,171
What?

338
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:12,613
It’s okay with me if you only
see me as a distraction.

339
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,119
At least,

340
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:15,544
I serve a purpose in your life.

341
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:17,389
Loser!

342
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:20,403
Do you hear yourself, huh?

343
00:22:20,593 --> 00:22:22,345
That’s literally gross!

344
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:25,011
You’re making an effort for me
but it’s okay that you get nothing back?

345
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:26,634
You’re content with that?

346
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:29,498
Why don't you demand, Raffy!
Ask for more!

347
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:34,083
Tell me, "Luna, you’re so dry! Can you
at least match my efforts?" Or maybe,

348
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:37,945
"Luna, if you really love me,
why are you afraid to show it?" Like that!

349
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:40,306
I don't want to.

350
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,455
Why?

351
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:45,361
Because I don’t want to lose you.

352
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:49,224
I’m already happy with what you're giving.

353
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:51,247
That’s better than nothing.

354
00:23:00,694 --> 00:23:01,820
You’re so weak.

355
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:04,698
Be straight with me.

356
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:09,202
I don’t have parents anymore, Luna.

357
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:11,580
It’s been ten years.

358
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:15,125
My older sister and brother

359
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:17,377
have their own lives.

360
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:20,519
I’m sure they just want
me to finish high school

361
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:22,277
so I won’t be their
responsibility anymore.

362
00:23:22,577 --> 00:23:23,703
And if you ask me,

363
00:23:23,846 --> 00:23:25,130
that’s what I want too.

364
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:29,018
I don’t want to be a burden to them.

365
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:35,604
You know I despise going home?

366
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:38,734
Because that’s how I
feel whenever I’m home.

367
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:40,089
A burden!

368
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:43,574
You’re the only reason
I don’t feel alone.

369
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:46,009
And should I gamble that?

370
00:23:47,112 --> 00:23:48,947
By demanding more from you?

371
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:55,207
Luna, I don’t care if you
can’t reciprocate my efforts.

372
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:59,124
If I’m just your distraction
from your life’s crap, then fine!

373
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:00,802
I’m consenting to this!

374
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:11,056
Get changed.

375
00:24:11,306 --> 00:24:12,474
Take me to your house.

376
00:24:12,857 --> 00:24:13,941
Why?

377
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:18,900
Why do they lock it when
they know you’re not home yet?

378
00:24:21,684 --> 00:24:24,060
Here’s the thing—
They’re already asleep by 6 PM,

379
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:27,797
because they have to wake up at 3 AM
for their work at the airport.

380
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:30,489
And since I usually
come home late,

381
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:33,214
they lock the gate before
going to bed for safety.

382
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:35,331
And you don’t have a key because?

383
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:37,005
I misplaced it?

384
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:40,185
Then why didn’t you
have a duplicate made?

385
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:41,795
I don’t want to bother them.

386
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:43,755
This gate is creaky
when you open it.

387
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:44,797
And...

388
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:46,877
when I get inside, I still have
to knock on the front door,

389
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,470
which is locked from the inside.

390
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:49,639
I don’t want to wake them up.

391
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:53,133
Actually, I used to wait
outside here until 3 AM,

392
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,315
then I realized that it’s
better to kill time at school

393
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,318
chatting with Sir Dan.

394
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,791
What?

395
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:11,781
Luna, what are you doing?

396
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:15,136
A demo to show you
how small your problem is.

397
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:16,204
Stay there!

398
00:25:16,454 --> 00:25:17,454
Hey, stop!

399
00:25:18,571 --> 00:25:19,571
Luna!

400
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:21,501
Luna, what are you doing?

401
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:28,018
Luna! Luna, stop!
What are you doing? Stop!

402
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:29,925
What?

403
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:35,632
What are you talking about? I don't
understand you! If I fall down from here...

404
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:38,734
What the heck, Raf! Do you know
what time is it? It’s eleven already!

405
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,419
Sorry, Kris.

406
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,292
Good evening.

407
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Who are you?

408
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:52,073
I’m Raffy’s girlfriend.

409
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:56,380
Well, your brother lost his gate key.

410
00:25:56,864 --> 00:25:59,371
Why didn’t you duplicate
mine and Bry's keys?

411
00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:02,107
Right? That’s exactly what I told him.

412
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:08,314
You're selling flowers on the street?

413
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:12,266
But Bry and I already
give you allowance.

414
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:14,870
Is it not enough?

415
00:26:15,513 --> 00:26:16,525
Sometimes.

416
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:21,177
Especially when I need to buy things
for school requirements.

417
00:26:23,396 --> 00:26:24,814
Why didn’t you say so?

418
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,599
I don’t want to be a burden, Bry.

419
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:41,188
Ever since Mom and Dad died,
I saw how hard the two of you worked.

420
00:26:42,824 --> 00:26:44,534
And you two sacrificed a lot,

421
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,841
just so we could get by.

422
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:49,134
But,

423
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,985
I started to feel invisible here at home.

424
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:54,075
Often,

425
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:55,659
when I get home,

426
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:57,825
the gate is already locked.

427
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:03,115
Then, there’s no food.

428
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:08,429
But I get it. You’re busy. Tired.

429
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:14,076
It would be so needy and ungrateful
of me to demand attention.

430
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:17,362
When you’re the ones supporting me.

431
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:22,871
But,

432
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,250
I promise,

433
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:28,545
Bry, Kris,

434
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,690
I will study well,

435
00:27:31,405 --> 00:27:34,450
and I will finish high school
as soon as possible,

436
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:37,459
so you won’t have to
take care of me anymore.

437
00:27:42,642 --> 00:27:43,642
Raf,

438
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:46,688
Raf, you’re not a burden to us.

439
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,230
Get it?

440
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:50,400
We’re family here.

441
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:54,280
And no matter what happens,

442
00:27:54,737 --> 00:27:56,698
you will always be our baby brother.

443
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:58,323
Okay?

444
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:01,578
Sorry, okay?

445
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,360
If we ever made you feel invisible,

446
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:07,726
we didn’t mean to.

You?

Just kidding.

459
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,125
How’s your mom?

460
00:29:23,624 --> 00:29:25,376
She’s in Bulacan.

461
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:28,215
I’ll stay at my aunt’s place
while she’s away.

462
00:29:32,502 --> 00:29:33,502
Raffy...

463
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:36,089
Can we talk later?

464
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:39,007
About what?

465
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:42,343
About...

466
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:45,514
us.

467
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,226
What do you want?

468
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:53,310
Holding hands? Couple pics
on social media?

469
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:54,670
A kiss?

470
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:00,487
I don’t want to be too demanding.

471
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:02,931
That’s why we’re talking, right?

472
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:07,631
Tell me directly, what do you want
from me as your girlfriend.

473
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:09,579
And don’t be afraid to be honest,

474
00:30:09,604 --> 00:30:12,528
because just because you ask
doesn’t mean I’ll give it.

475
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:16,990
If I can’t give it, or can’t
give it fully, I’ll tell you.

476
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:22,729
How about...

477
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,823
holding hands?

478
00:30:24,848 --> 00:30:25,894
In public?

479
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,119
Okay.

480
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:34,263
How about...

481
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:38,209
I’ll change my profile
pictures on social media?

482
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:39,568
I’ll put our picture together.

483
00:30:39,593 --> 00:30:41,762
Ew! Gross.

484
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:47,909
But if you want to post videos
or pictures of us together,

485
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:50,335
like on your feed or in
your story, go ahead.

486
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:51,653
Even if it’s set to public?

487
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,824
Hmm.

488
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:54,581
Okay.

489
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,460
Hmm.

490
00:30:56,502 --> 00:30:57,616
How about...

491
00:30:57,673 --> 00:30:59,138
a kiss in public?

492
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:02,255
Even just on the cheek.
Even just on the cheek.

493
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:03,860
Just keep it low key.

494
00:31:04,223 --> 00:31:05,788
I don’t want too much attention.

495
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:08,722
Okay.

496
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,146
But, if...

497
00:31:12,557 --> 00:31:13,892
a kiss in private,

498
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:16,814
I won’t refuse.

499
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:23,171
Hold on.

500
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:24,356

501
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:25,907

I said, you can go home.

Why?

521
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:49,572
Are we done?
Let's finish up first.

522
00:32:53,202 --> 00:32:54,352
Or,

523
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:56,849
you can all go home now.
I’ll finish up in here.

524
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:58,051
Come on!

525
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:02,955
Just admit it, you and Raffy
just want the studio to yourselves.

526
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:08,895
- You’re unbelievable!
- Look at her eyes!

527
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:10,667
But seriously, Luna.

528
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:14,246
You often send us home early
even if the work isn’t finished.

529
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:15,944
So as payback,

530
00:33:15,984 --> 00:33:17,941
we’ll send you home early this time.

531
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:19,683
- Right?
- Right!

532
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,873
- Bye!
- Bye!

533
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:25,735
- Go home!
- Raffy, take her home.

534
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,944
- Raffy!
- Wait a sec.

535
00:33:26,945 --> 00:33:30,224
Let's go! Let’s ride shotgun. Hurry!

536
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,033
Give me a kiss!

537
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:34,409
Give me a kiss!

538
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,631
That's a lot!

539
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,373
- My turn!
- Okay, fine.

540
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:45,671
♪ I will wait for your return, ♪

541
00:33:51,399 --> 00:34:00,411
Go Raffy, shoot that. Shoot
it, Raffy! Let’s go, Raffy!

542
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:03,362
Go Raffy, shoot that. Shoot it!

543
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:05,895
Go Raffy!

544
00:34:09,153 --> 00:34:10,404
I love you, Raffy!

545
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:13,073
I wasn’t wrong about you!

546
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:16,164
That's really just like you.

547
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:25,103
Was I good?

548
00:35:26,818 --> 00:35:29,571
My boyfriend’s an athlete,
and he didn’t even tell me.

549
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:31,634
Surprise!

550
00:35:32,945 --> 00:35:35,386
- Congrats!
- Oh, I’m sweaty, I’m sweaty.

551
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:37,617
It’s okay, I don’t care.

552
00:35:37,731 --> 00:35:38,982
- Alright then.
- Mhm!

553
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:40,702
- Really, huh, I warned you!
- Mhm!

554
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,321
What?

555
00:35:42,894 --> 00:35:44,101
Hey!

556
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,675
Don’t tell me all of that is for me.

557
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:56,551
Nope! I’ll sell it.

558
00:35:57,049 --> 00:35:59,427
But I thought Kris didn’t want you to.

559
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,467
I’m raising money
to buy you a phone.

560
00:36:04,222 --> 00:36:05,235
What?

561
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,700
Is it okay if it’s just a cheap one?

562
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:09,058
I found one online.

563
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,429
Secondhand, only five thousand.

564
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:14,778
It’s not much, but at least
you can use social media.

565
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:17,265
To take videos or pictures.

566
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:21,212
You just want me
to call you with that.

567
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:23,087
That too.

568
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:25,769
But seriously, Raffy,

569
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:27,613
you don’t have to do this.

570
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:28,954
It’s fine,

571
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:30,598
this is practice for me.

572
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:32,493
Practice for what?

573
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:35,327
For when we get married.

574
00:36:36,184 --> 00:36:38,105
I need to learn how
to provide for my wife.

575
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:44,730
You’re too much!

576
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:46,352
- Flowers!
- Flowers!

577
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:47,919
Flowers here!

578
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:52,041
- For your wife! Or for your girlfriend!
- Wow!

579
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:58,446
Or for your parents! For your grandparents!
For anyone you love in life!

580
00:36:58,471 --> 00:37:02,767
Or even if you don’t love them!
And you just want to suck up!

581
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,325
We should break up.

582
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:11,325
This is Luna and me

583
00:37:11,377 --> 00:37:13,421
when we decided to end things.

584
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:15,130
Or should I say,

585
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:18,049
when she decided to end things,

586
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,974
unilaterally.

587
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:21,046
Why?

588
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:23,305
Alright, class!

589
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:28,661
Who will represent 11-Alitaptap
in the lakan and lakambini of

590
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:30,138
Dalisay High?

591
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:35,109
Okay, guys, guys, listen.

592
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:38,633
Okay, I have a suggestion
as your class president.

593
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,374
For lakan,

594
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,826
no other than...

595
00:37:44,077 --> 00:37:45,996
Raffy Murillo!

596
00:37:46,073 --> 00:37:51,632
[applauding, cheering]

597
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:54,459
Okay, quiet, quiet!

598
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:56,703
For lakambini…

599
00:37:58,962 --> 00:38:01,089
Sydney Bengco!

600
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:05,184
[applauding, cheering]

601
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,074
Well, Ma'am,

602
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,463
I’m honored.

603
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:11,753
But, I’ll have to consult
with my parents first.

604
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,186
That's alright Ma'am. Her parents
are supportive when it comes to pageants.

605
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,529
Yes?

606
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:22,563
I volunteer.

607
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:31,298
I already told Bry and Kris.

608
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:34,269
They can't promise to come
to the pageant because they have work,

609
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:37,337
but they said if I
need to buy anything,

610
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:40,419
like a props or costume,
they're willing to support.

611
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,510
Luna,

612
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:44,539
are you sure?

613
00:38:45,471 --> 00:38:46,471
About what?

614
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:51,060
About the pageant.

615
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:54,813
Of course.

616
00:38:55,804 --> 00:38:57,014
You think I can’t win?

617
00:39:01,483 --> 00:39:02,654
That’s not what I meant.

618
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:08,778
I just didn’t think you’re the type
to join something like that.

619
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:11,621
You too.

620
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:14,415
Fair enough.

621
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:17,586
But if that’s what you want,

622
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:19,713
I’ll support you 100%.

623
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,397
- Let’s take a picture.
- Let's go.

624
00:39:26,326 --> 00:39:28,328
Not to be crabby, okay?

625
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:29,612
But...

626
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:31,776
it’s unlikely Luna will win the pageant.

627
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:33,972
How about you, Tim?

628
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:37,026
Who’s your representative
from 11-Gamu-gamo for lakambini?

629
00:39:37,051 --> 00:39:38,143
Zoey, of course.

630
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,176
- Huh?
- Really?

631
00:39:39,201 --> 00:39:42,461
- Zoey? As in Zoey Palomares?
- No way...

632
00:39:42,486 --> 00:39:43,588
Yeah, I have a crush on her.

633
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:46,668
It’s over, girl! Alitaptap’s
really going to lose.

634
00:39:46,907 --> 00:39:47,928
Guys,

635
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,245
I don’t know what
got into Luna’s head.

636
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:53,685
Does she think she’s
prettier than Sydney?

637
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,307
Hey, that’s harsh.

638
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:57,178
How many of you are in class?

639
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,900
Not one of you objected
when she volunteered?

640
00:40:00,914 --> 00:40:03,874
What did you want us to say?

641
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:08,112
"Hey, Luna! Girl! Don’t compete anymore,
you’re not going to win anyway."

642
00:40:08,137 --> 00:40:09,250
Really?

643
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:11,323
I don’t get them.

644
00:40:11,348 --> 00:40:13,188
Guys, guys.

645
00:40:14,002 --> 00:40:15,045
Isn’t it obvious?

646
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,167
She volunteered because of Raffy.

647
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:20,666
She doesn’t want to be
apart from her boyfriend.

648
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,382
So clingy, right?

649
00:40:22,484 --> 00:40:24,963
She thinks one of the other
candidates will steal Raffy?

650
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:25,987
Yes.

651
00:40:26,196 --> 00:40:27,196
Or...

652
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:30,108
maybe she’s scared

653
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,807
that Raffy might win.

654
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:35,022
She’ll be left behind.

655
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:36,289
Good point, good point.

656
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:39,018
Like people will say—

657
00:40:39,713 --> 00:40:40,713
"Oh,"

658
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,626
"Raffy’s too handsome for Luna."

659
00:40:43,714 --> 00:40:47,209
Raffy should find
someone who matches him.

660
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,428
What if it were you instead?

661
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:50,413
Wow, you’re so mean to Luna!

662
00:40:50,436 --> 00:40:55,034
[overlapping chatter]

663
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:56,226
Are you guys done?

664
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,777
- Luna...
- Um...

665
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:02,164
We're not yet finished
but we're almost there!

666
00:41:02,188 --> 00:41:03,483
We only have this left.

667
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:05,653
Okay, fine, I’ll help you. But...

668
00:41:06,025 --> 00:41:09,028
I’ll leave right after, okay?
We have rehearsals at six.

669
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:13,410
- Alright, let’s go.
- Five, six, seven, eight, and two.

670
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:16,996
And chest. And a one, two, three, four.

671
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:20,017
And a one, two, three.

672
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:25,481
And slide. And a one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

673
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:30,301
And a one, two,
three, four, then, pose.

674
00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:32,048
What’s that, Cabigting?

675
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:33,807
Are you up for this?

676
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:36,057
Sorry, sir.

677
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:40,085
You need help?

678
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:42,539
From the top!

679
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:45,032
You know what I’m thinking
for the sportswear portion?

680
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:47,642
I’ll wear something equestrian,
or maybe a racer outfit.

681
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,667
What do you think?

682
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:50,328
- That's cool!
- Right?

683
00:41:50,353 --> 00:41:51,840
It gives off that lady boss vibe.

684
00:41:52,116 --> 00:41:53,879
Hey! This one!

685
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:55,386
It suits you.

686
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:57,454
Like a Cristiano Ronaldo look.

687
00:41:57,913 --> 00:42:02,751
We’ll just find matching
high socks and shorts.

688
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:04,359
Actually,

689
00:42:04,545 --> 00:42:06,184
- Norwin and I were thinking…
- Hmm?

690
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:07,415
To make it unique,

691
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,045
I’ll do fire dancing for the sportswear.
Polynesian vibe.

692
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:15,972
With glow-in-the-dark henna
tattoos on my legs, arms, and chest.

693
00:42:15,997 --> 00:42:17,001
Chest?

694
00:42:18,811 --> 00:42:20,266
So you’ll go topless?

695
00:42:20,685 --> 00:42:22,520
Yeah, like Maui in Moana.

696
00:42:22,545 --> 00:42:24,547
- And with accessories—
- No, I don’t like it,

697
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:26,895
that’s too revealing.

698
00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:30,452
Just wear a basketball jersey,
since you’re a basketball player anyway.

699
00:42:31,155 --> 00:42:33,865
But we already started
practicing the fire dancing.

700
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,890
I said I don’t want that.

701
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:37,175
You should’ve asked me first, right?

702
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:41,174
You’re the only one
allowed to touch my body.

703
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:45,776
Anyone else can only look.

704
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:50,732
No.

705
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:58,329
Candidate number whatever
is Raffy Murillo!

706
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:05,928
Good evening, wonderful people
of Don Anselmo Dalisay High!

707
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:10,027
I am the Lakan representing
Grade 11-Alitaptap.

708
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:12,744
Rafael Xavier A. Murillo!

709
00:43:14,576 --> 00:43:18,746
Candidate number something,
Luna Cabigting!

710
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,242
Good evening, Dalisay High!

711
00:43:24,308 --> 00:43:27,211
I’m Maria Luna P. Cabigting. The...

712
00:43:27,368 --> 00:43:29,478
the Lakambini of 11-Alitaptap!

713
00:43:29,896 --> 00:43:32,671
Wait. Hold on. Do this
for me real quick. Just like this.

714
00:43:33,816 --> 00:43:34,816
Smile.

715
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:41,266
Walk. One, two. Push.
Like that!

716
00:43:41,634 --> 00:43:48,228
Candidate number whatever, I’m the
Lakambini of 11-Alitaptap, Luna Cabigting!

717
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:49,869
What was that?

718
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:53,114
Why add that extra move? I’ve never
seen a contestant do that ever.

719
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:55,640
No, just try it so we’ll
know if you can do it.

720
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:57,292
I don’t want to.

721
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:00,361
Gross, Norwin, why are you forcing me?

722
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:02,403
Because we’re at a disadvantage with you!

723
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:06,617
You need to catch the judges
attention so they’ll remember you.

724
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,252
Because real talk, Luna,

725
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,821
compared to your competitors,

726
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:12,057
you are forgettable!

727
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,569
And you think those little
shoulder moves will help?

728
00:44:17,594 --> 00:44:19,488
That is why we need to try, right?

729
00:44:19,513 --> 00:44:20,779
Why did you even
volunteer in the first place?

730
00:44:20,804 --> 00:44:22,849
- Sydney didn’t want to, right?
- She did want to!

731
00:44:22,975 --> 00:44:24,017
She wanted to, sis.

732
00:44:24,143 --> 00:44:25,143
But you jumped ahead of her.

733
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:27,837
Didn’t she say she just had
to ask her parents’ permission?

734
00:44:28,981 --> 00:44:29,981
Crazy.

735
00:44:33,377 --> 00:44:34,986
- Luna!
- What?

736
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:38,083
Luna, you don’t have to do
this pageant if it’s hard for you.

737
00:44:38,506 --> 00:44:40,299
- You agree with Norwin, don’t you?
- Huh?

738
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,882
Damn it, Raf!

739
00:44:41,953 --> 00:44:45,126
He was trash-talking me,
and you didn’t do anything!

740
00:44:45,164 --> 00:44:46,974
You didn’t say a word,
you didn’t even stop him!

741
00:44:46,999 --> 00:44:48,202
You didn’t defend me

742
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,642
because you also think I don’t
stand a chance in this pageant!

743
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:53,861
Luna, in my eyes, you’re the most
beautiful girl in the world!

744
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,233
But I’m not the judges,
and I’m not all of Dalisay High!

745
00:44:57,909 --> 00:45:00,491
And I also don’t know
what you want me to say to Norwin.

746
00:45:02,376 --> 00:45:03,638
But answer me this,

747
00:45:03,832 --> 00:45:05,844
why did you even
volunteer for this pageant?

748
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:08,209
Are you jealous?

749
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:10,873
Or are you afraid I might develop
feelings for other candidates?

750
00:45:11,205 --> 00:45:13,184
Damn it, Luna!
I’m not like that!

751
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:20,954
But if you’re not comfortable,

752
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:24,219
fine,

753
00:45:24,316 --> 00:45:26,076
- I’ll just back out of the pageant.
- Don't.

754
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:29,916
Don't.

755
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,068
You were right about everything you said.

756
00:45:42,786 --> 00:45:43,912
Okay, class.

757
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:47,053
Since Miss Cabigting
backed out of the pageant,

758
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:51,183
she will be replaced
by none other than Miss Bengco!

759
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:00,821
Luna!

760
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:08,454
Can I come in?

761
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:12,536
Luna, wait! Let’s just talk, please!

762
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:13,769
Luna, wait!

763
00:46:13,794 --> 00:46:16,043
Just wait a second!
The door’s locked!

764
00:46:16,903 --> 00:46:18,178
Come on! Come in already!

765
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,840
Come in!

766
00:46:25,634 --> 00:46:26,635
Let's break up.

767
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:31,686
Why?

768
00:46:36,189 --> 00:46:38,483
Luna, I demand you to tell me why!

769
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:40,176
Answer me!

770
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:44,694
Congrats.

771
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:46,782
So you’ve learned how to demand.

772
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:49,359
You now know what you deserve.

773
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:52,398
But why?

774
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:53,848
Did I do something?

775
00:46:54,908 --> 00:46:56,104
Is this about Norwin?

776
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:05,623
Before us, I was fine on my own.

777
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,100
But now look,

778
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,070
I’m like a leech clinging
to you all the time.

779
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:17,617
That’s the kind of person
I became since we got together.

780
00:47:19,495 --> 00:47:20,996
I don’t think I like it anymore.

781
00:47:22,045 --> 00:47:24,047
Do you want us to just
go back to being low-key?

782
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:25,909
That’s fine with me.

783
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,567
But you’re not okay with that.

784
00:47:29,158 --> 00:47:32,653
It’s obvious in you. You were happier
when we went public.

785
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:36,650
But I’m the one struggling.

786
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:39,125
I keep thinking.

787
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,153
Am I doing enough as your girlfriend?

788
00:47:42,577 --> 00:47:44,037
Am I right? Am I lacking?

789
00:47:45,886 --> 00:47:47,387
I’m becoming toxic.

790
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:50,817
Gross. I don’t want this anymore!
I don’t want this.

791
00:47:54,453 --> 00:47:55,453
So that’s it?

792
00:47:58,284 --> 00:47:59,284
What about me?

793
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:01,275
There!

794
00:48:02,194 --> 00:48:03,194
That’s right.

795
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:05,072
Think about yourself.

796
00:48:06,323 --> 00:48:07,323
What about you?

797
00:48:09,524 --> 00:48:10,900
But I can’t answer that.

798
00:48:12,899 --> 00:48:15,443
Because I don’t even know
what to do with myself.

799
00:48:17,013 --> 00:48:18,623
I love you so much.

800
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,764
So the next time you get a girlfriend,

801
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,177
don’t choose someone crazy like me, okay?

802
00:48:36,279 --> 00:48:38,323
And don’t settle for scraps.

803
00:48:39,775 --> 00:48:42,069
Because you deserve more than that.

804
00:48:44,594 --> 00:48:47,305
Honestly, I don’t deserve your love.

805
00:48:49,562 --> 00:48:50,563
It’s too...

806
00:48:51,676 --> 00:48:53,011
Too pure.

807
00:49:00,227 --> 00:49:01,895
You deserve love, Luna.

808
00:49:03,522 --> 00:49:04,523
Remember that.

809
00:49:08,181 --> 00:49:11,142
I hope someday I
can say that to myself.

810
00:49:30,488 --> 00:49:32,281
It’s really over, Sir Dan.

811
00:49:32,451 --> 00:49:35,912
We haven’t spoken
since we broke up.

812
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:37,471
Why?

813
00:49:37,509 --> 00:49:39,029
Are you two fighting?

814
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,659
Not really.

815
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:42,636
But it feels like

816
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:44,213
it’s for the best.

817
00:49:44,408 --> 00:49:45,576
Because...

818
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:47,949
if we start talking again,

819
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:49,916
our feelings might come back

820
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,323
and we’ll return to
the same problems.

821
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,493
Whatever those were.

822
00:49:57,476 --> 00:49:59,960
You don’t know what
the problem was?

823
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:03,602
To be honest, I don’t.

824
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:06,187
I got tired of thinking about it.

825
00:50:06,676 --> 00:50:09,568
It is what it is, I guess.

826
00:50:13,817 --> 00:50:15,135
Murillo!

827
00:50:15,226 --> 00:50:16,226
Idiot.

828
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,620
Sorry, sir.

829
00:50:18,038 --> 00:50:19,038
Hey Raffy,

830
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,027
isn’t the pageant coming up soon?

831
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:23,590
Aren’t you going
to diet, or work out?

832
00:50:25,642 --> 00:50:27,143
I just want it to be over.

833
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:28,819
I don’t care if...

834
00:50:29,621 --> 00:50:30,830
if I win or lose anymore.

835
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,497
- Ow!
- Hey, Raffy!

836
00:50:35,915 --> 00:50:37,375
Get your act together.

837
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:39,206
Always remember,

838
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:41,596
in everything you take on in life,

839
00:50:41,693 --> 00:50:44,362
you should always give 100 percent.

840
00:50:44,677 --> 00:50:47,918
Not join something
only to lose heart now.

841
00:50:48,029 --> 00:50:49,029
What’s that?

842
00:50:49,144 --> 00:50:51,420
I’m really not going to win, Sir Dan.

843
00:50:51,738 --> 00:50:52,738
Promise!

844
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:55,482
By contestant number two,
I’ve already lost.

845
00:50:55,557 --> 00:50:58,414
He’s got eight-pack abs.
Look at me!

846
00:50:58,832 --> 00:51:00,708
And he’s really good
at answering questions.

847
00:51:00,733 --> 00:51:02,944
His talent is flipping like Carlos Yulo.

848
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:07,360
You know what’s more important
than winning, Raffy?

849
00:51:07,754 --> 00:51:12,771
It’s the kind of person you become
in the process of achieving success.

850
00:51:24,143 --> 00:51:25,946
Hey guys, I'm so sorry.

851
00:51:25,971 --> 00:51:30,475
And now, the candidates for Lakan
and Lakambini of Dalisay High!

852
00:52:09,524 --> 00:52:13,936
Good evening, wonderful people
of Don Anselmo Dalisay High School!

853
00:52:13,961 --> 00:52:17,674
I am the Lakan representing
Grade 11-Alitaptap—

854
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:20,657
Rafael Xavier A. Murillo!

855
00:52:30,045 --> 00:52:31,476
Candidate number one….

856
00:52:31,755 --> 00:52:36,842
If there is one important lesson
you have learned from joining this pageant,

857
00:52:36,843 --> 00:52:39,511
which you would like to share
with your fellow students...

858
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:42,205
what would it be?
You have 30 seconds.

859
00:52:43,033 --> 00:52:45,382
Thank you for that meaningful question.

860
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:49,196
The lesson I would like
to share with everyone is,

861
00:52:50,203 --> 00:52:52,622
in the process of
reaching our dreams,

862
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:55,426
who we become along the journey

863
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:58,465
is more important than
whether we win or not.

864
00:52:58,615 --> 00:53:00,992
Yes, I gave this pageant my all.

865
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:03,264
But what I’ve become on this voyage—

866
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,140
a more courageous man,
a more responsible student,

867
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,684
and a persevering person…

868
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:12,399
matters more than any title.

869
00:53:44,452 --> 00:53:47,013
Class! Class!

870
00:53:48,296 --> 00:53:52,172
Just one more school year
and you’ll graduate senior high.

871
00:53:54,251 --> 00:53:55,688
Okay, do your best, alright?

872
00:53:55,713 --> 00:53:58,184
College is a different battleground.

873
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,362
Okay, you guys can have your break.

874
00:54:02,387 --> 00:54:03,638
Go on, eat lunch!

875
00:54:06,352 --> 00:54:10,208
Excuse me, ma’am. Miss Principal
is calling for Raffy Murillo.

876
00:54:12,492 --> 00:54:14,349
Take that off.
Move it over there.

877
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:20,732
This summer, we are going to construct
a bust of our founder here in the school.

878
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:24,802
Why did you call for me, ma'am?

879
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:28,682
Well, one of the school
guards told me that

880
00:54:28,707 --> 00:54:33,059
you’ve been taking care of the
flowers here as if they were your own.

881
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,248
I’d like to thank you for that.

882
00:54:36,485 --> 00:54:39,499
As a token of my appreciation,

883
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:43,436
I would like to help you relocate
some of the flowers to your home.

884
00:54:43,553 --> 00:54:44,958
But only if you want.

885
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:49,374
Some, okay. Just some. Not all.

886
00:54:51,856 --> 00:54:52,959
Let me help you.

887
00:55:07,945 --> 00:55:09,946
If you have something to say,
just say it.

888
00:55:09,995 --> 00:55:12,581
You keep sneaking glances,
you’ll get a stye.

889
00:55:17,517 --> 00:55:19,034
I want us to get back together.

890
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,160
Raffy...

891
00:55:27,173 --> 00:55:29,489
This is probably the last
time we’ll see each other.

892
00:55:31,183 --> 00:55:32,838
Huh? Why?

893
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,360
I’m stopping school for now.
My mom and I don’t have enough funds.

894
00:55:36,779 --> 00:55:39,401
I’ll help you, we’ll do
fundraising again. Like before!

895
00:55:43,603 --> 00:55:44,603
No need.

896
00:55:44,962 --> 00:55:46,555
No, seriously, Luna!

897
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:48,001
I got you!

898
00:55:48,279 --> 00:55:49,858
I’ll borrow from Kris.

899
00:55:57,358 --> 00:55:59,526
Raffy, I’m not your responsibility.

900
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:03,101
Besides, money isn’t the only problem.

901
00:56:03,632 --> 00:56:05,633
I’ve decided to follow
my mom to the province.

902
00:56:05,658 --> 00:56:08,369
I heard her boyfriend there has been
hurting her, she needs me.

903
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,750
So...

904
00:56:16,462 --> 00:56:18,005
do well next school year, okay?

905
00:56:19,138 --> 00:56:20,138
And...

906
00:56:20,995 --> 00:56:22,365
prepare your speech.

907
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:26,281
For sure, you’ll have a farewell walk
at the next Lakan and Lakambini.

908
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:44,351
If you allow me to be your
student council president,

909
00:56:44,405 --> 00:56:49,523
I will fight for safe spaces where we can
talk about our mental health without shame.

910
00:56:50,425 --> 00:56:52,991
And I will push for a support system

911
00:56:53,122 --> 00:56:55,285
that not only lectures,

912
00:56:55,315 --> 00:56:56,631
but listens.

913
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,068
I’ll take care of this.
Just handle the photocopies.

914
00:57:05,093 --> 00:57:06,374
Oh, okay. Okay.

915
00:57:09,282 --> 00:57:10,282
That’s all, sir?

916
00:57:10,366 --> 00:57:11,366
Just eight copies.

917
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:12,492
Eight?

918
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:15,395
Let’s go, touch the line, guys!

919
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,789
Touch the line, guys!

920
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:20,915
Let's go!

921
00:57:25,214 --> 00:57:27,609
Ma'am, is our order ready? Please toast it.

922
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:31,195
Reminder, everyone,
right minus wrong.

923
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,408
If you are caught cheating,
you will be expelled.

924
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:36,645
That was fast!

925
00:57:39,764 --> 00:57:41,018

In your batch, only you twelve…

942
00:59:05,023 --> 00:59:07,377
Passed the exam for PRU!

943
00:59:07,402 --> 00:59:11,379
One of the most prestigious
colleges in the Philippines!

944
00:59:11,404 --> 00:59:14,657
Congratulations!

945
00:59:16,826 --> 00:59:18,077
Damn you!

946
00:59:18,494 --> 00:59:19,746
I have nothing, Jimboy.

947
00:59:19,771 --> 00:59:20,997
Nothing.

948
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:23,099
Ah, but you can
afford a pedicure?

949
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:25,375
I bragged to my friends
that I’d treat them,

950
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,501
and now you're saying
you have nothing?

951
00:59:26,681 --> 00:59:27,880
You're going to embarrass me?

952
00:59:28,713 --> 00:59:32,197
I’ll find a way. I'll borrow money.

953
00:59:32,467 --> 00:59:34,077
Damn you!

954
00:59:35,988 --> 00:59:37,196
Damn you!

955
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:39,260
I’ll call the cops
if you don’t stop.

956
00:59:40,245 --> 00:59:41,245
You too!

957
00:59:41,584 --> 00:59:43,253
You’ve been freeloading here for so long.

958
00:59:43,532 --> 00:59:44,575
You contribute nothing!

959
00:59:48,524 --> 00:59:50,755
That's my whole salary this month,
that should shut you up.

960
00:59:52,754 --> 00:59:54,756
Clean the bathroom
before you go to sleep!

961
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:08,596
Why did you even come along?

962
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:12,722
You should’ve just
stayed with your aunt.

963
01:00:13,328 --> 01:00:15,837
If I weren’t here, you might’ve
ended up a dead already.

964
01:00:18,455 --> 01:00:19,789

Okay, if you need anything,
just call, alright?

974
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:08,835
Did you leave anything here?

975
01:01:09,105 --> 01:01:10,665
No, I brought everything.

976
01:01:27,127 --> 01:01:28,377
Baby, kill that monster, will you?

977
01:01:28,402 --> 01:01:31,947
- It annoys me!
- For you babe, we'll kill it.

978
01:01:32,003 --> 01:01:34,247
You're so good, baby!

979
01:01:34,881 --> 01:01:36,924
Not even a kiss?

980
01:01:37,508 --> 01:01:38,843
A kiss right away?

981
01:01:39,218 --> 01:01:42,136
See I won, don't I
deserve a reward?

982
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:43,598
Alright.

983
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:45,692
Here on the other side too.

984
01:01:46,475 --> 01:01:48,143
You are demanding.

985
01:01:48,168 --> 01:01:50,295
You're so stingy,
just on the lips.

986
01:01:50,771 --> 01:01:51,960
Wow!

987
01:01:54,068 --> 01:01:55,453
- Hello?
- Luna?

988
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:58,046
Who’s this?

989
01:01:58,226 --> 01:02:01,061
Wow, you deleted my number.

990
01:02:01,245 --> 01:02:02,412
It’s Raffy.

991
01:02:03,726 --> 01:02:04,769
Raffy?

992
01:02:06,215 --> 01:02:08,901
Ah, Raffy.

993
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:10,502
What made you call?

994
01:02:14,306 --> 01:02:15,306
Hello?

995
01:02:19,934 --> 01:02:21,009
I miss you.

996
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:22,510
I think.

997
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:28,767
Balut!

998
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,519
Sir, balut, sir. Balut!

999
01:02:33,314 --> 01:02:34,444
Balut!

1000
01:02:34,774 --> 01:02:36,025
Sis, balut, sis!

1001
01:02:51,749 --> 01:02:56,401
Sis, he’s here now.

1002
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:00,493
Okay, okay, let him in.

1003
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:03,505
Hello, does Luna work here?

1004
01:03:04,426 --> 01:03:05,468
Luna!

1005
01:03:07,181 --> 01:03:08,224
Ah,

1006
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:09,681
Raffy.

1007
01:03:10,315 --> 01:03:11,730
You found the address.

1008
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:13,585
It's quite far, right?

1009
01:03:14,105 --> 01:03:15,462
Long time no see.

1010
01:03:16,649 --> 01:03:17,968
I know right?

1011
01:03:18,526 --> 01:03:19,768
One year.

1012
01:03:20,987 --> 01:03:21,987
One year.

1013
01:03:23,624 --> 01:03:25,042
Ah, I brought this for you.

1014
01:03:25,403 --> 01:03:26,444
Oh my gosh.

1015
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,629
You went through the trouble.

1016
01:03:27,882 --> 01:03:30,050
Are you really just staying
behind the counter, sis?

1017
01:03:30,247 --> 01:03:32,764
Take good care of your guest.

1018
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:34,676
He came all the way from Manila.

1019
01:03:47,802 --> 01:03:48,803
Thank you.

1020
01:03:51,058 --> 01:03:52,058
How are you?

1021
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,020
Um...

1022
01:03:56,355 --> 01:03:57,377
Hmm—

1023
01:03:57,402 --> 01:03:58,987
Oh, this is Nash, by the way.

1024
01:03:59,608 --> 01:04:00,719
Hi, Nash.

1025
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:02,111
Nice name.

1026
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,487
Short for NashMa.

1027
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:06,498
Assalamualaikum.

1028
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,513
Go ahead.

1029
01:04:11,329 --> 01:04:13,431
Go! I’ll take care of closing up.

1030
01:04:13,456 --> 01:04:16,732
- Are you sure?
- Yes, absolutely sure.

1031
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:32,385
Ah, miss, bill please.

1032
01:04:32,612 --> 01:04:33,743
I got it, I got it.

1033
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,212
Come on. I’ll do it.

1034
01:04:35,237 --> 01:04:36,268
You’re the guest.

1035
01:04:36,293 --> 01:04:37,627
You still have a long trip home.

1036
01:04:39,699 --> 01:04:40,708
How much is it?

1037
01:04:40,733 --> 01:04:42,443
One hundred fifty only.

1038
01:04:48,924 --> 01:04:51,095
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

1039
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:52,918
I’m earning.

1040
01:04:53,171 --> 01:04:56,545
I do live selling gigs when I’m
in the mood to face the camera.

1041
01:04:57,833 --> 01:04:59,168
Thank you.

1042
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:02,066
Um...

1043
01:05:03,047 --> 01:05:05,014
School starts in a month, right?

1044
01:05:05,174 --> 01:05:06,374
What course are you taking up?

1045
01:05:06,717 --> 01:05:07,767
Botany.

1046
01:05:09,293 --> 01:05:11,564
You really can’t let
go of plants, huh?

1047
01:05:12,139 --> 01:05:13,797
You really know me, don’t you?

1048
01:05:13,992 --> 01:05:15,875
Good thing I got accepted there.

1049
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:18,961
Because my second choice
was accountancy,

1050
01:05:18,986 --> 01:05:21,696
and I just couldn’t imagine
myself in that kind of course.

1051
01:05:21,721 --> 01:05:25,973
At least, right, what you’ll study
is really close to your heart.

1052
01:05:30,487 --> 01:05:35,841
But seriously, Luna, thank you.

1053
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:40,568
If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have
achieved a lot in high school.

1054
01:05:40,663 --> 01:05:43,015
You taught me to be assertive,

1055
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:47,969
to believe that I deserve to be
seen and reach greater heights.

1056
01:05:52,538 --> 01:05:53,538
Hey, come on now.

1057
01:05:53,687 --> 01:05:54,809
It’s 7:30 already.

1058
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:57,133
The last trip to Manila is at 8.

1059
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,252
Come on, I’ll take you to the bus station.

1060
01:06:01,731 --> 01:06:02,815
Luna, wait!

1061
01:06:02,948 --> 01:06:05,179
- Let’s go!
- Wait a sec, Luna!

1062
01:06:06,303 --> 01:06:07,850
What? Let’s go!

1063
01:06:10,532 --> 01:06:12,117
I wanna be with you longer.

1064
01:06:16,308 --> 01:06:17,630
But it’s already late!

1065
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:19,506
I’ll just sleep over at your place.

1066
01:06:19,827 --> 01:06:20,829
Huh?

1067
01:06:20,881 --> 01:06:22,269
Where exactly?
It’s so cramped there.

1068
01:06:22,294 --> 01:06:23,670
I only sleep in the living room.

1069
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:25,105
Then I’ll sleep in the living room too.

1070
01:06:25,212 --> 01:06:26,217
No way.

1071
01:06:26,242 --> 01:06:27,576
Don’t you want us to be together?

1072
01:06:28,801 --> 01:06:31,804
I'm not gonna do anything
you wouldn't consent to.

1073
01:06:32,138 --> 01:06:33,473
You just don’t understand.

1074
01:06:33,498 --> 01:06:34,660
Understand what?

1075
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:35,911
Tell me.

1076
01:06:38,735 --> 01:06:43,472
I read your messages, and they even saw you
at the church. What were you doing there?

1077
01:06:43,497 --> 01:06:45,815
Of course! I listened to
them, they showed me.

1078
01:06:45,816 --> 01:06:46,917
They have proof?

1079
01:06:46,942 --> 01:06:48,210
- Yes, they showed—
- Nothing, nothing.

1080
01:06:48,235 --> 01:06:49,945
What do you mean nothing?
Why are you lying to me?

1081
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:52,781
- You’re going crazy again.
- Huh? I’m not crazy.

1082
01:06:52,782 --> 01:06:54,276
- I’m not lying!
- Do you understand now?

1083
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:55,318
Nothing!

1084
01:06:55,343 --> 01:06:57,259
Do what you want!
You’re going crazy!

1085
01:06:57,284 --> 01:06:58,662
- There's nothing!
- Whatever, piss off!

1086
01:06:58,662 --> 01:06:59,685
- Wait a second!
- What do you want?

1087
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,183
I’m still talking to you,
what’s wrong with you?

1088
01:07:01,207 --> 01:07:02,476
It's not my fault
women are drawn to me,

1089
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,560
there’s nothing you can do about it!

1090
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:05,228
Then you should’ve
brought them here instead.

1091
01:07:05,252 --> 01:07:06,919
What am I to you, really?

1092
01:07:06,944 --> 01:07:08,653
A nanny? A maid, what?

1093
01:07:08,678 --> 01:07:09,905
You know what, you should be grateful.

1094
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:12,588
If it weren’t for me,
no one would even want you!

1095
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,737
Damn you!

1096
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:17,071
Hey! Hey! That’s enough!

1097
01:07:18,448 --> 01:07:19,758
- What the hell?
- Damn it. Who are you?

1098
01:07:19,783 --> 01:07:21,785
- A friend of Luna, why?
- Let me go!

1099
01:07:21,919 --> 01:07:24,047
You’re a grown man, physically able!

1100
01:07:24,072 --> 01:07:25,949
And you dare hurt a woman?

1101
01:07:26,148 --> 01:07:27,148
Coward!

1102
01:07:28,457 --> 01:07:30,250
How about I bash your head in?

1103
01:07:36,461 --> 01:07:37,504
Come on, sir.

1104
01:07:38,224 --> 01:07:40,593
Even if I just pay for half the seats.

1105
01:07:40,783 --> 01:07:42,304
It’s only almost midnight, sir.

1106
01:07:42,448 --> 01:07:43,846
The first trip is at 4:30.

1107
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,240
Alright, sir.

1108
01:07:49,418 --> 01:07:51,768
You can board while
waiting if you’d like.

1109
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:53,375
So you can also lie down.

1110
01:07:53,424 --> 01:07:55,080
Okay. Thank you.

1111
01:07:57,951 --> 01:08:00,662
Jimboy is really a good person.

1112
01:08:01,917 --> 01:08:03,461
Just short-tempered.

1113
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:07,659
Maybe he got it from his father
who was in the military.

1114
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:11,905
But auntie, that’s no
excuse to hurt people.

1115
01:08:15,406 --> 01:08:20,661
In my situation, son,
as a single mother,

1116
01:08:21,725 --> 01:08:22,725
older now,

1117
01:08:23,156 --> 01:08:25,778
I don’t have the right to
be picky about a partner.

1118
01:08:26,242 --> 01:08:27,242
Do you—

1119
01:08:29,671 --> 01:08:31,577
Did you even hear yourself, auntie?

1120
01:08:32,131 --> 01:08:33,131
What about Luna?

1121
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,835
Don’t you think about how
she’s affected by your stupid decisions?

1122
01:08:38,443 --> 01:08:41,070
You’re so selfish and irresponsible.

1123
01:08:53,468 --> 01:08:54,469
Auntie!

1124
01:08:55,421 --> 01:08:56,421
Auntie!

1125
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:58,709
You can't keep walking
away from this, Auntie!

1126
01:08:59,383 --> 01:09:00,653
Luna is so talented,

1127
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,929
but her potential is being wasted
because of what you’ve been doing.

1128
01:09:02,954 --> 01:09:07,181
You don’t know what I went through
to raise Luna on my own!

1129
01:09:08,404 --> 01:09:10,747
If you want, go marry her,

1130
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:13,064
then you take care of her, since
you act like such a know-it-all!

1131
01:09:13,089 --> 01:09:17,064
If only I could, auntie, but Luna herself
insists on staying close to you.

1132
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,691
Even if she’s so fed
up with your madness,

1133
01:09:20,716 --> 01:09:23,123
you’re still her mother
and she loves you.

1134
01:09:23,148 --> 01:09:26,568
As your only child, she chooses
to endure your nonsense with you.

1135
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,329
Hoping that you wake up!

1136
01:09:28,354 --> 01:09:29,688
Raffy, that’s enough.

1137
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,127
She needs to hear this.

1138
01:09:35,152 --> 01:09:36,611
You’re not in the position.

1139
01:09:36,636 --> 01:09:38,409
You don’t deserve
to be treated like this.

1140
01:09:38,434 --> 01:09:40,754
Please, don’t interfere.

1141
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:42,134
He’s right, my child.

1142
01:09:46,505 --> 01:09:48,961
I haven't been a good mother.

1143
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:54,820
Maybe if you had a different mother,

1144
01:09:57,563 --> 01:09:59,731
you would’ve gone so far already.

1145
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,459
Can you forgive me, my child?

1146
01:10:45,405 --> 01:10:47,741
Raffy, come eat here.

1147
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:48,928
I’ll cook.

1148
01:10:49,451 --> 01:10:50,578
Ah, no need, auntie.

1149
01:10:50,603 --> 01:10:52,146
I need to go back to Manila.

1150
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:55,242
Anyway, you’re always welcome here.

1151
01:10:55,828 --> 01:10:58,252
Just visit whenever you like.

1152
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:00,129
Alright.

1153
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:12,773
Thanks for meddling.

1154
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:14,669
Oh no!

1155
01:11:14,759 --> 01:11:16,678
I left the anthurium at Jimboy's place.

1156
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,250
Just let it be.

1157
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:22,463
Anyway, if you need help, or
someone to talk to, just call.

1158
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:26,820
Take care.

1159
01:11:29,434 --> 01:11:31,181
Take care. Bye.

1160
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:34,146
Bye.

1161
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:38,534
I’ll head inside now.

1162
01:11:39,651 --> 01:11:40,651
Okay.

1163
01:11:56,794 --> 01:11:57,836
Raffy!

1164
01:12:40,546 --> 01:12:41,546
I’ll do that, ma.

1165
01:12:41,922 --> 01:12:43,562
I’ll just call you
when it’s time to eat.

1166
01:12:45,551 --> 01:12:46,551
Ma?

1167
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:58,172
Do you know why I broke up
with your dad?

1168
01:13:00,607 --> 01:13:02,109
It felt like...

1169
01:13:04,153 --> 01:13:06,363
I didn’t deserve him.

1170
01:13:07,781 --> 01:13:09,616
I was just... ordinary.

1171
01:13:13,162 --> 01:13:14,371
A waitress.

1172
01:13:15,622 --> 01:13:17,040
From a broken family.

1173
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,960
I never finished school.

1174
01:13:24,423 --> 01:13:26,466
You told me before he had another woman.

1175
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,261
Yes.

1176
01:13:30,429 --> 01:13:34,224
That was the woman his
parents wanted for him.

1177
01:13:35,058 --> 01:13:39,396
So, he had no choice but to follow.

1178
01:13:41,481 --> 01:13:44,943
He didn’t even know I was pregnant.

1179
01:13:49,364 --> 01:13:51,033
He didn’t know he had a child with you.

1180
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:52,950
Is that it, ma?

1181
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:58,336
There's always a brief nowadays.

1182
01:13:58,587 --> 01:13:59,587
Ecoluxury.

1183
01:13:59,612 --> 01:14:01,602
Agri-integrated spaces.

1184
01:14:01,919 --> 01:14:03,045
Urban farms.

1185
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:04,927
Rooftop gardening.

1186
01:14:05,255 --> 01:14:06,435
Vertical planting.

1187
01:14:06,883 --> 01:14:08,092
Even condos now.

1188
01:14:08,462 --> 01:14:10,047
They want edible landscapes.

1189
01:14:10,268 --> 01:14:11,284
That’s right.

1190
01:14:11,309 --> 01:14:14,604
Clients want their buildings to
look like they care about the climate.

1191
01:14:14,827 --> 01:14:16,547
Even if they have three cars in the garage.

1192
01:14:17,601 --> 01:14:19,434
- See you guys next week.
- See you.

1193
01:14:20,697 --> 01:14:21,697
Vito.

1194
01:14:29,237 --> 01:14:30,447
What are you doing here?

1195
01:14:31,089 --> 01:14:32,674
My wife might see us.

1196
01:14:33,992 --> 01:14:34,992
Dad!

1197
01:14:40,907 --> 01:14:43,179
Why didn’t you tell me, Letty?

1198
01:14:47,432 --> 01:14:51,853
You were already engaged to Gwen
when I found out I was pregnant.

1199
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:54,906
I didn’t want to cause a scene.

1200
01:14:56,431 --> 01:14:58,433
So, why now?

1201
01:15:02,462 --> 01:15:05,506
Why are you telling me
this after all these years?

1202
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:08,419
Because Luna deserves
to know her real father.

1203
01:15:12,777 --> 01:15:14,445
You don’t have to do anything, dad.

1204
01:15:15,415 --> 01:15:16,658
I’m not asking for anything.

1205
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:21,655
I just wanted to know you.

1206
01:15:22,708 --> 01:15:24,126
To see you face to face.

1207
01:15:24,626 --> 01:15:28,672
It’s enough for me
that you know I exist.

1208
01:15:30,632 --> 01:15:31,633
Let’s go, Ma.

1209
01:15:36,596 --> 01:15:37,596
Stop!

1210
01:15:39,092 --> 01:15:40,579
Raffy!

1211
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:42,244
Dad will be the one
to send me to school.

1212
01:15:42,269 --> 01:15:43,762
He’ll also give me a monthly allowance.

1213
01:15:43,787 --> 01:15:45,789
And starting tomorrow...

1214
01:15:45,814 --> 01:15:47,808
I’ll catch up with the
enrollment for grade 12.

1215
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:49,525
Really? At Dalisay High?

1216
01:15:49,755 --> 01:15:50,755
Yes.

1217
01:15:51,523 --> 01:15:53,823
A miracle.
You didn’t refuse your dad’s offer.

1218
01:15:54,297 --> 01:15:55,757
Well, of course.

1219
01:15:55,782 --> 01:15:58,367
Would I deny him the
chance to make up for it?

1220
01:15:58,368 --> 01:16:00,124
I’d be so arrogant if I did, right?

1221
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:01,471
Well, that’s true.

1222
01:16:01,528 --> 01:16:03,874
Luna, focus on your studies.

1223
01:16:04,038 --> 01:16:06,307
Then apply here at PRU, okay?

1224
01:16:06,332 --> 01:16:07,332
It’s good here.

1225
01:16:08,545 --> 01:16:10,589
You just want to be
with me there, huh?

1226
01:16:13,144 --> 01:16:15,271
Of course, that’s automatic.

1227
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:19,222
Hello, Luna. How’s school?

1228
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:21,390
There's so many readings.

1229
01:16:21,391 --> 01:16:23,310
But it’s all good. I can handle it.

1230
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:28,012
You’re so motivated.

1231
01:16:28,565 --> 01:16:31,151
It’s like I was given a
second chance at life.

1232
01:16:31,568 --> 01:16:32,694
I won’t waste it.

1233
01:16:35,322 --> 01:16:39,926
Welcome back, Luna!

1234
01:16:39,951 --> 01:16:41,912
How about you, how are you there?

1235
01:16:44,716 --> 01:16:46,432
I got a part-time job.

1236
01:16:46,487 --> 01:16:47,798
Just for extra money.

1237
01:16:48,602 --> 01:16:50,411
Why? You're running short on money?

1238
01:16:50,457 --> 01:16:51,558
Not really.

1239
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:53,256
I just want to buy something.

1240
01:16:54,074 --> 01:16:56,878
Hey, handsome.
I said no sweetener, right?

1241
01:16:57,405 --> 01:16:59,262
Oh, sorry ma’am.
I’ll just replace it.

1242
01:17:00,013 --> 01:17:01,306
I'm really sorry.

1243
01:17:02,724 --> 01:17:05,435
You keep fiddling with your phone
while working.

1244
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:08,497
Luna!

1245
01:17:08,522 --> 01:17:09,931
Luna, Luna, Luna!

1246
01:17:09,956 --> 01:17:11,374
- What?
- Come here! Come here!

1247
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:13,165
Where?

1248
01:17:13,193 --> 01:17:14,935
Here! Here!

1249
01:17:15,835 --> 01:17:19,004
- Look! Look!
- What is it? What is it?

1250
01:17:19,312 --> 01:17:21,606
Ma’am, someone’s here to pick you up.

1251
01:17:25,197 --> 01:17:26,532
Wow.

1252
01:17:29,768 --> 01:17:31,645
Don’t you have class on Friday?

1253
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:33,377
We had an early dismissal.

1254
01:17:33,435 --> 01:17:35,273
That’s why I came straight here.

1255
01:17:36,575 --> 01:17:37,737
Is that for me?

1256
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:41,587
Who else would I give
this to? No one, right?

1257
01:17:42,389 --> 01:17:43,515
So annoying.

1258
01:17:55,861 --> 01:17:57,556
This looks expensive, Raf.

1259
01:17:58,338 --> 01:17:59,547
Just once in a while.

1260
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,240
Let’s eat.

1261
01:18:07,164 --> 01:18:08,790
- Oh, by the way.
- Yes?

1262
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:13,837
I have a...

1263
01:18:15,033 --> 01:18:16,659
Very big problem?

1264
01:18:19,134 --> 01:18:20,134
Problem?

1265
01:18:21,251 --> 01:18:22,251
What?

1266
01:18:24,355 --> 01:18:25,732
Are we back together again?

1267
01:18:28,602 --> 01:18:29,602
My God.

1268
01:18:29,768 --> 01:18:31,168
I thought it was something serious.

1269
01:18:31,688 --> 01:18:33,148
No, seriously.

1270
01:18:36,095 --> 01:18:37,349
Isn't it obvious?

1271
01:18:49,954 --> 01:18:50,973
What's wrong?

1272
01:18:55,066 --> 01:18:56,149
I passed.

1273
01:18:56,174 --> 01:18:57,301
At PRU?

1274
01:18:57,438 --> 01:18:58,773
Yeah. Fine Arts.

1275
01:18:58,798 --> 01:19:00,359
So, we’ll be at the same school next year?

1276
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:02,777
- Yes.
- Wow.

1277
01:19:02,802 --> 01:19:04,721
- Congrats, Luna!
- Wow.

1278
01:19:06,723 --> 01:19:08,599
I'm so proud of you.

1279
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:15,047
Up next, the salutatorian of the batch,
Maria Luna Poblete Cabigting.

1280
01:19:28,411 --> 01:19:32,822
So, you're the boyfriend
of my daughter?

1281
01:19:33,161 --> 01:19:34,161
Yes, sir.

1282
01:19:37,087 --> 01:19:38,797
Should I be worried?

1283
01:19:42,968 --> 01:19:44,010
About what, sir?

1284
01:19:45,868 --> 01:19:49,794
Won’t you be a
distraction to her studies?

1285
01:19:50,559 --> 01:19:52,185
Especially now that...

1286
01:19:53,298 --> 01:19:55,634
you’ll both be entering
the same university.

1287
01:19:56,329 --> 01:19:57,329
No, sir.

1288
01:19:57,354 --> 01:19:59,684
I want us to prosper
together in life.

1289
01:20:08,087 --> 01:20:09,797
For you, Luna.

1290
01:20:12,795 --> 01:20:13,963
Are you serious?

1291
01:20:14,916 --> 01:20:16,167
Congratulations.

1292
01:20:18,534 --> 01:20:21,626
Thank you, Pa.
Thank you so much.

1293
01:20:22,146 --> 01:20:26,849
I already bought you
a one-bedroom condo near PRU.

1294
01:20:26,874 --> 01:20:28,584
150 square meters.

1295
01:20:29,197 --> 01:20:31,032
Really? Wow, Pa, that's too much, Dad!

1296
01:20:31,103 --> 01:20:34,190
I want you to have the perfect
environment when you're studying.

1297
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:37,014
And I don’t want you
just barely passing, okay?

1298
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:38,665
I want you to be successful.

1299
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:41,059
I want you to be the
best that you can be.

1300
01:20:41,645 --> 01:20:43,839
- Okay?
- Yes, Pa. Promise.

1301
01:20:43,864 --> 01:20:45,161
- Good.
- Promise.

1302
01:20:46,409 --> 01:20:47,409
Good.

1303
01:20:47,657 --> 01:20:48,657
Thank you, Pa.

1304
01:20:59,669 --> 01:21:03,106
- Hello, hello!
- Raffy!

1305
01:21:03,131 --> 01:21:04,571
Welcome!

1306
01:21:05,415 --> 01:21:06,792
It’s beautiful!

1307
01:21:06,843 --> 01:21:07,843
Right?

1308
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:09,967
Did you know? Oh, wait a sec.

1309
01:21:09,992 --> 01:21:11,784
- Please leave your shoes by the door.
- Oh, sorry.

1310
01:21:11,809 --> 01:21:12,809
It's okay!

1311
01:21:13,595 --> 01:21:14,596
Right.

1312
01:21:15,066 --> 01:21:16,186
Here’s my housewarming gift.

1313
01:21:16,269 --> 01:21:19,456
Aw, thank you!

1314
01:21:19,481 --> 01:21:21,124
It’s so nice!

1315
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:22,864
Please close the door.

1316
01:21:22,889 --> 01:21:23,889
Oh, okay.

1317
01:21:24,176 --> 01:21:25,594
Come on, over here.

1318
01:21:29,908 --> 01:21:32,827
Wow, perfect!

1319
01:21:33,787 --> 01:21:36,623
I’m excited, Raffy. Excited but nervous.

1320
01:21:37,949 --> 01:21:39,616
- Hey! Careful, you might sit on that.
- I moved it.

1321
01:21:40,005 --> 01:21:41,090
Ah, okay.

1322
01:21:48,385 --> 01:21:49,385
Are you okay?

1323
01:21:50,178 --> 01:21:51,178
Of course.

1324
01:21:52,305 --> 01:21:54,935
Come on, hurry up.
Say it already.

1325
01:21:57,568 --> 01:21:58,568
Well...

1326
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:01,877
when I found out you passed PRU,

1327
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:05,975
I just had this wishful thought that
you’d live at my boarding house.

1328
01:22:06,272 --> 01:22:09,978
Not in the same room,
but you know, in the same building.

1329
01:22:10,894 --> 01:22:12,099
Unless...

1330
01:22:13,835 --> 01:22:15,294
You know, that would be nice.

1331
01:22:16,295 --> 01:22:17,919
But, no.

1332
01:22:17,997 --> 01:22:19,808
My dad got this condo.

1333
01:22:28,216 --> 01:22:31,423
Hey, stop it!

1334
01:22:31,553 --> 01:22:32,761
If you tear this up, I'm telling you!

1335
01:22:32,786 --> 01:22:34,982
Stop bothering me, Raffy!

1336
01:22:35,724 --> 01:22:37,902
You’re so messy! So annoying!

1337
01:22:39,017 --> 01:22:40,633
Don’t!

1338
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:44,242
This baby’s so cute.

1339
01:22:44,267 --> 01:22:45,586
Ready for school?

1340
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:47,378
You’re really so gross.

1341
01:22:47,403 --> 01:22:49,504
Oh, is that so?
Is that so?

1342
01:22:49,621 --> 01:22:51,029
- Gross?
- Gross!

1343
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,851
Don’t, Raffy!

1344
01:22:54,965 --> 01:22:57,640
Don’t, Raffy!

1345
01:23:14,004 --> 01:23:15,345
I love you.

1346
01:23:19,631 --> 01:23:22,434
I’ll sleep over here,
would you like that?

1347
01:23:23,808 --> 01:23:24,808
Hmm.

1348
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,002
Oh, come on!

1349
01:23:28,027 --> 01:23:32,920
You know what, better help me
wrap these instead. Come on.

1350
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:33,974
Okay.

1351
01:23:33,999 --> 01:23:40,147
M-theory suggests the
universe isn’t just strings—

1352
01:23:42,202 --> 01:23:43,475
it’s branes.

1353
01:23:43,915 --> 01:23:48,171
B-R-A-N-E-S, not brains like the mind.

1354
01:23:48,265 --> 01:23:50,760
They’re multidimensional structures

1355
01:23:51,029 --> 01:23:52,986
vibrating in a space

1356
01:23:53,301 --> 01:23:56,254
- your senses were never built to grasp.
- Let's meet up. Grandstand, 5 PM.

1357
01:23:56,766 --> 01:24:00,906
Now, who invented M-theory?

1358
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:07,650
Who?

1359
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:11,049
Ah, sorry ma’am,
what’s the question again?

1360
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:12,167
Anyone?

1361
01:24:12,192 --> 01:24:13,192
Santiago?

1362
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:14,492
Physicist Witten, ma’am.

1363
01:24:14,948 --> 01:24:15,948
Very good.

1364
01:24:35,885 --> 01:24:39,507
Here in this group, we’re not looking
for who’s the best.

1365
01:24:39,732 --> 01:24:41,609
Although of course,
that’s important too.

1366
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,912
We’re more interested

1367
01:24:43,937 --> 01:24:47,343
in those who are good at what they do
and also want to say something to society.

1368
01:24:47,555 --> 01:24:52,232
And willing to hone their talent to express
artistically what they want to say.

1369
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:55,638
Now, we want to see your art.

1370
01:24:55,773 --> 01:24:58,107
I’m pretty sure all of you took
some photos of your artwork.

1371
01:24:58,132 --> 01:25:00,134
So, don't be shy.

1372
01:25:00,491 --> 01:25:01,658
Just show it to us.

1373
01:25:03,967 --> 01:25:05,886
We’re not going to judge. Promise.

1374
01:25:14,149 --> 01:25:16,442
Wow. Thank you, guys, for welcoming me.

1375
01:25:16,467 --> 01:25:19,387
- Of course. You’re really good.
- Thank you.

1376
01:25:19,412 --> 01:25:21,913
Wow. You’re all so welcoming.

1377
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:23,616
We can sense you’re a hard worker.

1378
01:25:23,641 --> 01:25:25,058
Oh, correct!

1379
01:25:25,389 --> 01:25:26,933
Thank you.

1380
01:25:28,618 --> 01:25:31,246
Ah, um, I actually have to go now.

1381
01:25:31,378 --> 01:25:34,586
See you around. Bye-bye.
Thank you. Thank you!

1382
01:25:34,611 --> 01:25:35,611
Take care!

1383
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:37,338
Raffy, hi!

1384
01:25:37,363 --> 01:25:39,416
Sorry, have you been waiting long?

1385
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:42,157
We agreed on 5 PM...

1386
01:25:42,744 --> 01:25:43,911
It’s 6:30 already.

1387
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:47,224
I’m really sorry.

1388
01:25:47,415 --> 01:25:48,895
I just had to take care of something.

1389
01:25:49,466 --> 01:25:50,925
I’ve been texting you for a while.

1390
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:52,076
You could’ve called instead.

1391
01:25:54,505 --> 01:25:55,505
Gosh.

1392
01:25:57,191 --> 01:26:00,457
I’m really sorry,
I put my phone on silent.

1393
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:04,212
Hey, this is really nice.

1394
01:26:04,435 --> 01:26:05,664
Is this for me?

1395
01:26:07,451 --> 01:26:09,322
Mmm! Smells good!

1396
01:26:09,347 --> 01:26:10,593
What do you want for dinner?

1397
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:12,541
It’s on me, to make it up to you.

1398
01:26:16,959 --> 01:26:17,959
You’re so mad!

1399
01:26:17,984 --> 01:26:18,984
Here, here.

1400
01:26:24,702 --> 01:26:26,620
They have so many things lined up!

1401
01:26:26,621 --> 01:26:28,372
There are weekly open studio nights,

1402
01:26:28,373 --> 01:26:32,042
plus 3D modeling workshops,
and sometimes there’s even an exhibit

1403
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:34,944
where members can
showcase their own work.

1404
01:26:36,898 --> 01:26:37,898
Nice.

1405
01:26:39,676 --> 01:26:40,968
No reaction from you?

1406
01:26:42,144 --> 01:26:43,144
Hmm?

1407
01:26:43,721 --> 01:26:44,764
I said, it’s nice.

1408
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:48,920
It’s Tuesday today, right?

1409
01:26:49,102 --> 01:26:50,901
Don’t you have a shift
at the coffee shop?

1410
01:26:52,438 --> 01:26:53,731
I already resigned.

1411
01:26:54,148 --> 01:26:55,148
Huh?

1412
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:56,274
Why?

1413
01:26:56,646 --> 01:26:59,003
So I’ll have more time for us.

1414
01:26:59,137 --> 01:27:00,304
But we still have weekends, Raf.

1415
01:27:00,329 --> 01:27:02,623
We don’t need to be
together every single day.

1416
01:27:05,098 --> 01:27:07,184
So you actually don’t want
to be with me every day?

1417
01:27:12,576 --> 01:27:14,719
Just kidding!
I’m just kidding.

1418
01:27:15,586 --> 01:27:17,949
I resigned so I could sleep longer.

1419
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:21,235
Let’s eat, give me your bowl.

1420
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:54,041
Sleep well. I love you.

1421
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:29,035
Geez, you totally ignored my chat.

1422
01:28:47,092 --> 01:28:49,218
- This, it’s here.
- Okay.

1423
01:28:49,347 --> 01:28:52,375
and then after, over here.

1424
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,109
Here, right here.

1425
01:28:54,143 --> 01:28:56,209
- Which one? This?
- Yeah, that one.

1426
01:28:56,234 --> 01:28:57,234
Oh, sorry.

1427
01:28:57,894 --> 01:28:59,602
- Sorry, sorry.
- Like this?

1428
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:00,794
Yes, make it even.

1429
01:29:00,819 --> 01:29:02,506
Oh, okay, okay.

1430
01:29:03,323 --> 01:29:04,323
Okay.

1431
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,816
Luns!

1432
01:29:07,918 --> 01:29:09,400
Someone sent you something.

1433
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,220
From whom?

1434
01:29:11,536 --> 01:29:13,531
I didn’t ask. They were in a rush.

1435
01:29:15,542 --> 01:29:16,752
Excuse me.

1436
01:29:31,276 --> 01:29:34,405
See you when you're not busy.

1437
01:29:40,618 --> 01:29:41,744
Good morning.

1438
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:43,448
Good morning.

1439
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:47,873
How are you feeling?

1440
01:29:48,757 --> 01:29:51,426
My head still hurts.

1441
01:29:55,944 --> 01:29:57,236
Maybe you got jinxed.

1442
01:29:57,967 --> 01:29:59,860
That’s what happens when you
keep brushing up with everyone.

1443
01:30:02,629 --> 01:30:09,011
But isn’t it true that when a baby
gets jinxed, they get to be tickled!

1444
01:30:09,124 --> 01:30:10,899
- I'm the tickle monster!
- Don't!

1445
01:30:10,924 --> 01:30:16,839
- I’ll put saliva on you!
- Don't!

1446
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:20,980
Wait! My head hurts so much,
I feel like I'm dying.

1447
01:30:27,622 --> 01:30:28,622
Are you okay?

1448
01:30:30,067 --> 01:30:31,067
No.

1449
01:30:33,826 --> 01:30:35,508
You’re lacking my affection.

1450
01:30:35,828 --> 01:30:37,413
That’s why you ran out of energy.

1451
01:30:42,209 --> 01:30:44,921
So, where do you want
to go on a date later?

1452
01:30:49,254 --> 01:30:51,780
I don’t think I can get up right now.

1453
01:30:51,974 --> 01:30:52,974
Aw.

1454
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:55,204
Is that so?

1455
01:30:55,653 --> 01:30:56,653
Yeah.

1456
01:30:58,935 --> 01:31:00,353
What if?

1457
01:31:09,737 --> 01:31:10,821
Hold on.

1458
01:31:24,069 --> 01:31:25,487
We should do this more often.

1459
01:31:27,908 --> 01:31:29,159
Just chill at home?

1460
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:33,719
No, like, cuddling.

1461
01:31:34,387 --> 01:31:36,174
Just spending more time together.

1462
01:31:37,515 --> 01:31:42,559
How I wish, but I have so many
things to do at school.

1463
01:31:46,844 --> 01:31:48,194
How can I support you?

1464
01:31:49,522 --> 01:31:53,264
If you want, I can do
the cleaning or cooking.

1465
01:32:13,989 --> 01:32:15,691
You’re already a sure win here.

1466
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,760
Claim it.

1467
01:32:17,179 --> 01:32:19,724
Oh stop it, there are so many
talented ones out there.

1468
01:32:20,116 --> 01:32:21,159
But it’s true.

1469
01:32:23,352 --> 01:32:24,352
Hey,

1470
01:32:24,566 --> 01:32:26,285
you better go,
you still have class.

1471
01:32:27,734 --> 01:32:30,779
I’ll just be absent,
it’s all reporting tasks anyway.

1472
01:32:31,693 --> 01:32:33,092
If you get dropped...

1473
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,188
Wait, Raffy.

1474
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,460
Oh, of course.

1475
01:32:39,485 --> 01:32:40,485
Oh, Luna!

1476
01:32:41,072 --> 01:32:42,208
Sir, here she is.

1477
01:32:42,234 --> 01:32:44,534
The woman that we've been
telling you great things about.

1478
01:32:44,866 --> 01:32:47,140
Luna, meet Sir Forsyth-Greene,

1479
01:32:47,446 --> 01:32:50,646
a professor from the Lysander
Arts Institute in California.

1480
01:32:50,896 --> 01:32:52,565
Very honored to meet you, sir.

1481
01:32:53,328 --> 01:32:54,413
You did that, huh?

1482
01:32:56,343 --> 01:32:57,372
Yes, sir.

1483
01:32:57,397 --> 01:33:02,923
Well, I do have a few nitpicks here and
there, but overall, it's pretty solid work.

1484
01:33:03,337 --> 01:33:05,464
Let's hope my fellow
judges feel the same way.

1485
01:33:09,142 --> 01:33:12,043
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

1486
01:33:13,513 --> 01:33:15,807
For its bold composition,

1487
01:33:16,086 --> 01:33:17,837
emotional clarity,

1488
01:33:18,268 --> 01:33:21,220
and innovative use of mixed media,

1489
01:33:21,728 --> 01:33:26,843
the judges and I are proud
to award the championship to...

1490
01:33:28,315 --> 01:33:29,733
Luna Cabigting!

1491
01:33:29,767 --> 01:33:32,897
[cheering, applauding]

1492
01:33:32,922 --> 01:33:34,722
- Go ahead, take it.
- Go on, you go in front.

1493
01:33:34,747 --> 01:33:37,057
Thank you! Thank you!

1494
01:33:37,873 --> 01:33:43,629
Wow! I would like to thank the board
of judges for recognizing my work.

1495
01:33:43,654 --> 01:33:46,864
And of course, to be honest,
all the entries were outstanding.

1496
01:33:46,889 --> 01:33:50,015
So, let's give them a round of applause.

1497
01:33:50,064 --> 01:33:51,402
Yeah!

1498
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:55,797
And of course, I also
want to thank my org mates

1499
01:33:55,822 --> 01:33:57,755
from PRU Samahang Sining!

1500
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,882
Yeah!

1501
01:33:59,907 --> 01:34:01,177
You’re the best—

1502
01:34:01,202 --> 01:34:02,987
because of your support and guidance,

1503
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:04,805
I couldn’t have made my
entry this way without you.

1504
01:34:04,829 --> 01:34:06,321
So, thank you so much.

1505
01:34:06,346 --> 01:34:07,902
You're super welcome.

1506
01:34:08,558 --> 01:34:10,893
Come here, let's take a photo together.

1507
01:34:10,918 --> 01:34:12,429
Hurry up.

1508
01:34:14,287 --> 01:34:15,580
Come here.

1509
01:34:18,465 --> 01:34:19,967
Once a Kasama,

1510
01:34:19,992 --> 01:34:22,114
always a Kasama!

1511
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:26,739
- Congrats, Luns!
- Thank you!

1512
01:34:26,764 --> 01:34:27,764
Congrats!

1513
01:34:33,263 --> 01:34:34,263
Raffy!

1514
01:34:36,135 --> 01:34:37,378
Raffy, look!

1515
01:34:37,694 --> 01:34:39,446
I got all of my class cards.

1516
01:34:39,471 --> 01:34:40,931
I'm on the Dean's List.

1517
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:42,710
Congrats!

1518
01:34:42,908 --> 01:34:43,908
How about you?

1519
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:46,119
What about me?

1520
01:34:46,829 --> 01:34:48,289
How are your grades?

1521
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,382
Hey, Luna!

1522
01:34:58,515 --> 01:34:59,807
I’ll just take a look.

1523
01:35:07,392 --> 01:35:08,643
What’s happening to you?

1524
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:11,961
You're barely passing, and you even
have two incompletes.

1525
01:35:12,786 --> 01:35:15,251
It’s because I don’t
have a rich dad like you.

1526
01:35:16,918 --> 01:35:17,918
What?

1527
01:35:18,956 --> 01:35:19,956
Nothing.

1528
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:22,379
Say that again.

1529
01:35:22,404 --> 01:35:23,404
I said, nothing.

1530
01:35:28,392 --> 01:35:29,477
Hey, Luna!

1531
01:35:30,986 --> 01:35:31,986
Luna, wait.

1532
01:35:32,422 --> 01:35:33,840
Luna, wait!

1533
01:35:34,515 --> 01:35:36,017
Luna, wait. I’m sorry.

1534
01:35:36,295 --> 01:35:37,546
I'm sorry, okay?

1535
01:35:37,724 --> 01:35:39,148
Let's talk, please.

1536
01:35:39,173 --> 01:35:40,526
I don’t want to talk to you

1537
01:35:40,551 --> 01:35:42,188
when you’re like this, worse
than someone on their period.

1538
01:35:42,881 --> 01:35:44,007
I'm sorry.

1539
01:35:44,032 --> 01:35:46,282
It's just that I'm afraid of losing you

1540
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:49,240
and as time goes by,
our time together is getting shorter.

1541
01:35:49,426 --> 01:35:51,303
That should be fine, Raffy!

1542
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:53,204
I have a life and so should you!

1543
01:35:53,229 --> 01:35:57,793
Our worlds don’t need to revolve around
each other, we’re too young for that!

1544
01:36:02,321 --> 01:36:03,321
You’re my world!

1545
01:36:04,573 --> 01:36:09,130
Raffy, if that means you’ll
sabotage yourself, I don’t want that.

1546
01:36:11,789 --> 01:36:14,458
You’re discarding me
because I’m useless to you?

1547
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:16,167
Wow!

1548
01:36:16,832 --> 01:36:18,375
That’s a harsh accusation!

1549
01:36:19,284 --> 01:36:21,703
What are you implying?
I’m a narcissist, is that it?

1550
01:36:22,329 --> 01:36:23,329
And you?

1551
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:28,628
You really want me stuck in life.
Struggling, lacking. For what?

1552
01:36:28,653 --> 01:36:30,586
So you can act like my
knight in shining armor?

1553
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:32,849
Why would I do that?

1554
01:36:32,874 --> 01:36:36,044
To make you feel good about yourself
because you’re so insecure!

1555
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,444
You know what?

1556
01:36:43,616 --> 01:36:45,618
Let’s just take a
break from each other.

1557
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,060
Let’s think about our lives.

1558
01:36:57,835 --> 01:37:05,133
♪ In my dream. We’re happily together ♪

1559
01:37:05,134 --> 01:37:10,805
♪ You accept me. Even if I’m not perfect ♪

1560
01:37:10,806 --> 01:37:19,939
♪ In the dream, all the
stars. Are aligned for us ♪

1561
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:23,943
♪ So I hope I don’t wake up. ♪

1562
01:37:23,944 --> 01:37:33,037
♪ In a dream only. In a dream only ♪

1563
01:37:41,776 --> 01:37:42,776
Hello?

1564
01:37:44,798 --> 01:37:45,798
Where are you?

1565
01:38:04,401 --> 01:38:05,401
I'm sorry.

1566
01:38:07,809 --> 01:38:09,175
I hope you can forgive me.

1567
01:38:13,177 --> 01:38:14,177
How are you?

1568
01:38:14,661 --> 01:38:15,829
Have you enrolled yet?

1569
01:38:19,083 --> 01:38:20,083
Not yet.

1570
01:38:20,376 --> 01:38:21,643
Tomorrow’s the last day,

1571
01:38:22,554 --> 01:38:23,696
want me to help you?

1572
01:38:29,666 --> 01:38:30,667
Raffy...

1573
01:38:32,304 --> 01:38:34,640
I talked to Dad last month.

1574
01:38:35,342 --> 01:38:39,300
He offered me a slot at a prestigious
animation school in America.

1575
01:38:39,794 --> 01:38:45,771
He’ll cover everything— tuition, airfare,
even living expenses until graduation.

1576
01:38:52,003 --> 01:38:54,366
I won’t accept it if
you’re not comfortable.

1577
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:57,422
Why is it suddenly all up to me?

1578
01:38:58,793 --> 01:39:02,922
Didn’t I tell you before, I don’t want to
be an obstacle to your dreams in life.

1579
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:04,639
If that's what you want, go.

1580
01:39:05,462 --> 01:39:10,092
But if I accept it, you’ll
say I’m discarding you.

1581
01:39:10,432 --> 01:39:12,744
That I have no consideration
for your feelings.

1582
01:39:13,799 --> 01:39:16,510
What’s your honest opinion
about this situation?

1583
01:39:26,332 --> 01:39:27,332
Honestly?

1584
01:39:28,689 --> 01:39:32,459
I can't bear the thought
to be away from you for...

1585
01:39:32,818 --> 01:39:34,736
Wait, hold on—how many years is it?

1586
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:38,222
- Four years.
- Four years!

1587
01:39:38,411 --> 01:39:39,924
That’s a lot.

1588
01:39:41,431 --> 01:39:44,745
If I'm going to be selfish, okay, fine.

1589
01:39:44,851 --> 01:39:46,669
No. I don't want you to go.

1590
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:49,106
There are good animation schools here too.

1591
01:39:51,464 --> 01:39:53,172
Alright, I won’t accept it anymore.

1592
01:39:53,256 --> 01:39:55,424
Wait, that’s just my opinion.

1593
01:39:56,705 --> 01:39:58,776
But you... what do you want?

1594
01:39:59,141 --> 01:40:00,434
What does your heart tell you?

1595
01:40:01,265 --> 01:40:04,977
I want to accept,
not at your expense.

1596
01:40:06,779 --> 01:40:09,406
If I go through with it,
can you wait for me?

1597
01:40:10,444 --> 01:40:11,987
That’s four years, Raffy.

1598
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:16,815
I'm willing to wait
if you are as well.

1599
01:40:17,467 --> 01:40:20,262
You said earlier you
couldn’t stand us being apart.

1600
01:40:20,287 --> 01:40:21,596
That’ll be my problem.

1601
01:40:26,172 --> 01:40:27,172
Alright.

1602
01:40:29,296 --> 01:40:31,590
Alright, I’ll call Dad.
I’ll tell him I’m in.

1603
01:40:40,703 --> 01:40:42,415
I’m always the one adjusting,

1604
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:44,746
so let’s go all the way.

1605
01:40:54,427 --> 01:40:56,273
You know what, to avoid complications,
let’s just break up.

1606
01:40:56,298 --> 01:40:58,020
- Fine!
- Asshole!

1607
01:41:00,577 --> 01:41:02,926
Luna! Do you know
your problem, Luna?

1608
01:41:03,001 --> 01:41:06,171
You want me to be honest,
but when I am, you take it against me.

1609
01:41:06,196 --> 01:41:08,702
- I hate you!
- I hate you even more!

1610
01:41:08,727 --> 01:41:10,562
You’re always throwing jabs!

1611
01:41:10,587 --> 01:41:12,909
You always make it look like
you’re the martyr in this relationship.

1612
01:41:12,934 --> 01:41:16,126
Then I’m the selfish bitch
who only thinks of herself.

1613
01:41:16,151 --> 01:41:19,363
I already said I won’t go if you don’t
want me to, yet you keep nagging!

1614
01:41:19,388 --> 01:41:22,249
Then what, if you regret
it in life, you’ll blame me?

1615
01:41:22,433 --> 01:41:24,745
You just want me to choose
so you don’t have to make the decision.

1616
01:41:24,852 --> 01:41:27,478
When you, yourself,
can’t handle the guilt.

1617
01:41:27,503 --> 01:41:29,334
You pretend to be strong, but you’re not.

1618
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,674
- Whatever, do what you want!
- Fine!

1619
01:41:31,699 --> 01:41:34,443
Go and leave me, Luna.
I’m useless to you anyway, right?

1620
01:41:34,444 --> 01:41:36,340
Go make all your dreams
come true without me,

1621
01:41:36,371 --> 01:41:38,111
after all, you’ve always felt...

1622
01:41:38,136 --> 01:41:39,856
that you’re a strong and independent woman!

1623
01:41:45,038 --> 01:41:46,038
You know what?

1624
01:41:46,249 --> 01:41:50,128
I hope you find a woman who needs
nothing else in her life but you.

1625
01:41:50,463 --> 01:41:52,882
Since you get no validation
unless someone needs you.

1626
01:42:48,818 --> 01:42:53,223
Once a Kasama, always a Kasama!

1627
01:42:53,609 --> 01:42:56,571
Botejyu delivery for Luna Cabigting.

1628
01:42:57,194 --> 01:42:59,215
- Here's your food.
- Let's go.

1629
01:42:59,363 --> 01:43:00,618
Thank you!

1630
01:43:00,643 --> 01:43:03,634
I can already hear
your stomachs, let’s eat.

1631
01:43:05,202 --> 01:43:06,837
Wow, Luna Cabigting!

1632
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:08,237
Big time!

1633
01:43:08,262 --> 01:43:10,532
[scoffs] Big time, you say.

1634
01:43:11,041 --> 01:43:13,543
I don’t even know if I
can handle life there.

1635
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:17,940
I could always visit you there, you know.

1636
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:20,279
Just kidding. As if!

1637
01:43:27,235 --> 01:43:28,664
- But Luns,
- Hmm?

1638
01:43:29,535 --> 01:43:30,996
from the bottom of my heart.

1639
01:43:31,853 --> 01:43:33,196
I’m so proud of you.

1640
01:43:33,855 --> 01:43:35,699
And I’m really happy for you.

1641
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:38,109
Thank you.

1642
01:43:42,989 --> 01:43:44,516
By the way, how about your boyfriend,

1643
01:43:45,663 --> 01:43:46,904
is he following you there?

1644
01:43:49,621 --> 01:43:50,679
We’re not together anymore.

1645
01:43:51,279 --> 01:43:52,279
What?

1646
01:43:52,710 --> 01:43:53,710
Since when?

1647
01:43:54,287 --> 01:43:55,288
Just recently.

1648
01:43:56,086 --> 01:43:59,421
Looks like we couldn’t handle
long distance, so that’s that.

1649
01:44:01,383 --> 01:44:02,592
I could handle it.

1650
01:44:04,933 --> 01:44:07,364
Just kidding... it’s a prank!

1651
01:44:07,462 --> 01:44:08,880
- Let’s eat.
- Okay.

1652
01:44:09,098 --> 01:44:10,659
I was just kidding,
don’t take it seriously.

1653
01:44:10,684 --> 01:44:11,684
Just kidding, okay?

1654
01:44:12,952 --> 01:44:14,870
I’ll miss you!

1655
01:44:16,648 --> 01:44:19,818
Call me when you land there, okay?

1656
01:44:21,469 --> 01:44:24,096
Promise to behave
while I’m gone, okay?

1657
01:44:24,507 --> 01:44:27,426
Don't you start dating assholes again.

1658
01:44:27,451 --> 01:44:33,333
Excuse me, I’m way too busy
with live selling to bother with that.

1659
01:44:33,476 --> 01:44:35,687
You’re allowed to love again,

1660
01:44:35,917 --> 01:44:40,468
just not with troublesome
guys please. I beg you.

1661
01:44:40,546 --> 01:44:42,458
- Promise?
- Yes.

1662
01:45:01,532 --> 01:45:02,532
Luna!

1663
01:45:17,818 --> 01:45:20,498
I just came to send you off
and wish you well on your journey.

1664
01:45:22,756 --> 01:45:26,009
I sincerely hope all
your dreams come true.

1665
01:45:30,555 --> 01:45:32,224
I wish the same for you.

1666
01:45:34,707 --> 01:45:40,843
Do even better, okay, so you
can save even more broken people.

1667
01:45:41,942 --> 01:45:43,109
Like me.

1668
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:02,212
But don’t forget to
save some for yourself.

1669
01:46:03,588 --> 01:46:04,965
Promise me.

1670
01:46:08,093 --> 01:46:09,302
Promise.

1671
01:46:17,238 --> 01:46:20,742
This is probably the last
flower I’ll ever give you.

1672
01:46:25,316 --> 01:46:30,790
But I think this counts
as a live agricultural product.

1673
01:46:31,113 --> 01:46:32,531
I can't bring it.

1674
01:46:33,321 --> 01:46:34,321
Is that so?

1675
01:46:36,204 --> 01:46:37,455
I understand.

1676
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:41,332
Anyway...

1677
01:46:42,626 --> 01:46:43,835
Have a safe flight.

1678
01:46:44,796 --> 01:46:48,758

Wait.

1684
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:23,126
Maybe I can sneak it through.

1685
01:47:24,623 --> 01:47:25,727

1691
01:48:10,924 --> 01:48:13,969
Having bid farewell to
each other as friends.

1692
01:48:14,798 --> 01:48:16,758
Or maybe best friends?

1693
01:48:18,098 --> 01:48:19,474
Ex-lovers?

1694
01:48:20,001 --> 01:48:21,405
I don't know.

1695
01:48:22,227 --> 01:48:27,924
Maybe, as souls who needed each other
temporarily to heal and grow...

1696
01:48:28,562 --> 01:48:33,859
But now, we need to go our separate
ways to achieve greater things.

1697
01:48:34,830 --> 01:48:35,830
Ah...

1698
01:48:36,488 --> 01:48:38,198
So that’s what love is.

1699
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:40,829
It's not forever,

1700
01:48:41,538 --> 01:48:44,908
but true while it lasts.
