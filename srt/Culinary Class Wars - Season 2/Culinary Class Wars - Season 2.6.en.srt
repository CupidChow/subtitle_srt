1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,967
Now, in this very place,

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,970
another culinary class battle
will take place.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,641
The third round of Culinary Class Wars…

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,520
…is the Black and White Spoons'
Team Battle,

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,772
All or Nothing.

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,190
-What?
-What?

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,734
What is it?

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,112
-What's that?
-So it's everything or nothing?

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,697
-Yeah.
-In this round,

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,782
winner takes all.

11
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,786
All members of the winning class
will survive.

12
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,498
All members of the losing class

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,209
will be eliminated.

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,087
…will be eliminated.

15
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,048
…will be eliminated.

16
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,552
No way.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,555
Everyone on the team?

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,933
Basically,

19
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,852
everyone gets eliminated or survives.

20
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,438
-Don't you think so?
-That's a bit…

21
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,981
Either the entire team survives or…

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,860
They wouldn't really do that, would they?

23
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,446
That's so harsh.

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,911
Wait, everyone's going home all at once?

25
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,789
When I heard that, I thought,
"That's a bit harsh, isn't it?"

26
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,998
It's a total wipeout.

27
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,583
Everyone gets eliminated.

28
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,754
It's a deathmatch.

29
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,381
Losers tell no tales.

30
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,383
If you lose,

31
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,718
you're just gone.

32
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,470
I loved it.

33
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,846
We can just survive then.

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,766
From then on, the show can just be
about Black Spoons.

35
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,979
The Black and White Spoons'
Team Battle, All or Nothing.

36
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,690
In this round,

37
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,984
a total of three culinary battles
will take place.

38
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,152
-Three?
-Three?

39
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,530
-Gosh, three?
-Three?

40
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,073
Each battle

41
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,616
will be worth 100 points.

42
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,409
SECOND BATTLE
100 POINTS

43
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,328
THIRD BATTLE
100 POINTS

44
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,913
The points will be tallied,

45
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:06,292
and the team
with the higher final score will win.

46
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,253
So we have to cook three times then?

47
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,172
The number of participants
in each battle is as follows.

48
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,424
The first battle will have

49
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,468
seven members from each team.

50
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,053
What?

51
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,054
Seven members?

52
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,640
So not all of us will cook.

53
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,560
We send seven people out
for the first battle.

54
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,812
The second battle will have

55
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,939
five members from each team.

56
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,066
We have to be strategic about this.

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,317
It's about strategy.

58
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,444
The third battle will have

59
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,322
the best three chefs from each team.

60
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,699
The battle of the best.

61
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,201
All contestants from each team

62
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,620
must participate in at least

63
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,582
one of the three battles

64
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,168
and may participate multiple times.

65
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,172
-This is interesting.
-Right? It's different.

66
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,674
I can't tell if we have
the upper hand or not.

67
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,301
We have more people than them.

68
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,219
If you think about a health bar,

69
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,890
times 12 is better than times 9.

70
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,975
On the other hand,

71
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,644
the other team might have better teamwork,

72
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,272
because when you keep working
with the same people,

73
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,648
you adapt more quickly.

74
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,400
More people only makes it harder.

75
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,735
-Right?
-You're right.

76
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,322
At the end of the day,
it all comes down to skill,

77
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,533
so it doesn't matter
if it's 9 versus 12 or 100.

78
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,579
Now, it is time to announce the mission.

79
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,373
The Black and White Spoons' Team Battle…

80
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,297
Your mission is…

81
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,800
-What is that?
-What?

82
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,220
-What on earth?
-What's that?

83
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,020
What is that?

84
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,189
-What's that?
-What is that?

85
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,690
-What on earth?
-What?

86
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,317
What is that?

87
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,277
It's a Ferris wheel.

88
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,322
God, this is crazy.

89
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,282
Hey, it's going around!

90
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,078
The Black and White Spoons' Team Battle.

91
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,205
Your mission is…

92
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,418
the Wheel of Fate.

93
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,254
We have to spin it.

94
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,421
We have to spin the wheel.

95
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,133
-Now, that's really something.
-That's cool.

96
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,927
It's a roulette wheel.

97
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,929
-There are the ingredients.
-What?

98
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,639
-Where?
-Inside?

99
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,182
They must be the ingredients.

100
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,684
That's a vegetable there.

101
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,185
Do we take them out from there?

102
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,645
In front of you now

103
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,022
are two wheels

104
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,067
that will decide your fate.

105
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,863
On the left is a wheel containing
ingredients from land called

106
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,573
the Wheel of Land.

107
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,327
This is next level.

108
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,954
So these two are different?

109
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,580
-They're different.
-Right, they are.

110
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,625
On the right is a wheel containing
ingredients from the sea called

111
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,169
the Wheel of the Sea.

112
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,422
So ingredients from the land and the sea?

113
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,756
This is so fun.

114
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,758
The Wheel of Land
and the Wheel of the Sea

115
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,012
each contain six ingredients.

116
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,849
The Wheel of Land contains
burdock root, chicken, peas,

117
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,600
veal bone-in sirloin,

118
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,477
spinach, and Korean melons.

119
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,939
The Wheel of the Sea contains
rockfish, gamtae seaweed, pollock roe,

120
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,065
-gaebul…
-The spoon worm?

121
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,276
…squid, and salmon.

122
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,445
-They prepared a lot.
-Yeah, it's so interesting.

123
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,864
-Maybe we have to pick them.
-Do we have to use all six?

124
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,115
In the three battles?

125
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,575
Each team

126
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,453
will use one ingredient
from the land and the sea each,

127
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,539
and they will use both ingredients

128
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,624
to complete one dish.

129
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,084
That's hard.

130
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,087
How the teams combine
two completely different ingredients

131
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,381
to create a well-balanced dish

132
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,342
will be the focal point of this round.

133
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,385
That's crazy.

134
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,887
One each from the land and the sea.

135
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,388
We need to use two ingredients.

136
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,931
-For the main ingredient?
-Yes, two.

137
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,059
Basically, the Wheel of Fate

138
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,477
all comes down to the pairing.

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,480
As a chef, there are always
pairings that go well together.

140
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,814
There's kind of a rule to it.

141
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,400
But there were some ingredients
that fell outside this rule.

142
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,278
So for example,
if we get salmon and bone-in sirloin,

143
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,030
I don't know what we could do with them.

144
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,324
Let's say you had chicken and fish.

145
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,909
There's no solution to that.

146
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,913
I think some people may be able to create
something amazing with that combination.

147
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,248
I just hope we don't get
the worst combination.

148
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,292
To decide your fate

149
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,586
in the Black and White Spoons'
Team Battle,

150
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,423
-we will now reveal…
-There's more.

151
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,674
What is it?

152
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,635
…the judging process.

153
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,345
What's happening?

154
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,934
That's scary.

155
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,228
Damn!

156
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,693
This is an impressive reveal.

157
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,032
It's like a masquerade.

158
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,121
They're so scary.

159
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,124
It's like The Phantom of the Opera.

160
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,963
Tasting your dishes for the first battle

161
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,466
will be these 100 mystery judges.

162
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,554
-There are people in there!
-Damn!

163
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,306
This is terrifying.

164
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,143
They're looking down at us
from all four levels.

165
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,108
This is so intense.

166
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,693
This is epic.

167
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,861
That's so cool.

168
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,905
Round three,
the Black and White Spoons' Team Battle…

169
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,826
The first battle will be

170
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,163
the seven-on-seven
Black and White Spoons' Team Battle.

171
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,789
The seven team members

172
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,834
must prepare 100 dishes

173
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,504
for these 100 judges to taste.

174
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,174
The time limit is 150 minutes.

175
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,301
-That's short.
-2.5 hours?

176
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,385
It's shorter this time.

177
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,429
-It's about making it in bulk.
-Yes.

178
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,014
Once the dishes are complete,

179
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,641
the mystery judges will taste them

180
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,686
and vote for the dish
they think is better.

181
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,190
Then, the results
of the first battle will be revealed.

182
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,442
We should try to win all three battles.

183
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,027
-We have to win all three.
-All three.

184
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,570
-All of them.
-Definitely.

185
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,530
And in this battle,

186
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,867
Judges Paik Jong-won and Anh Sung-jae…

187
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,077
-Where are they?
-They must not be here.

188
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,204
Ding-dong.

189
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,417
-They're not here?
-They're over there.

190
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,712
-They're over there.
-Oh, there they are.

191
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,258
They will join the mystery judges

192
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,220
in tasting and judging the dishes.

193
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,142
They're up there.

194
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,103
They blended right in.

195
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,941
As you saw, the theme for this round

196
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,361
is using ingredients
from the land and the sea.

197
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,740
The two ingredients shouldn't stand out
on their own, but work together.

198
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,575
The land and the sea.

199
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,370
Even the smallest mistake
when mixing the two

200
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,040
can mess up the identity of the dish.

201
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,458
They'll have to think it through.

202
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,338
The first Black and White Spoons'
Team Battle, the seven-on-seven face-off.

203
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,049
The fortunes of the two teams
will be decided

204
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,009
by the Wheel of Fate.

205
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,971
We will now begin
with selection of the ingredients.

206
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,558
First, Judge Paik Jong-won,

207
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,018
please choose either the Wheel of Land

208
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,812
or the Wheel of the Sea.

209
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,522
We don't get to pick?

210
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,357
The judges are choosing?

211
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,900
They pick for us.

212
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,111
I should pick the one
that has more of what I like.

213
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,821
-I'm picking this one.
-This one?

214
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,406
This one has more things that I like.

215
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,574
Please pick a good one.

216
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,117
Yes, please pick a good one.

217
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,911
I will pick from the Wheel of the Sea.

218
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,830
What will it be?

219
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,665
Judge Paik Jong-won,

220
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,751
please spin the Wheel of the Sea.

221
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,211
Please.

222
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,631
What should I pick for you?

223
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,342
-Salmon.
-Not salmon.

224
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,844
-Gaebul.
-Not gaebul.

225
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,762
-Gamtae.
-That's all of them.

226
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,055
So I'll avoid those.

227
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,183
Okay, here I go.

228
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,604
-It's turning.
-It's going around.

229
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,230
Here we go.

230
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,065
It's spinning.

231
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,734
It's really spinning.

232
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,653
First off, gamtae is something
I really love.

233
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,238
It's perfect with rice.

234
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,656
Gamtae.

235
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,033
I think he'll choose gamtae.

236
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,744
I'll pass on gamtae for now.

237
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,287
Please, not gaebul.

238
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,788
I might come back to it.

239
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,417
This is pollock roe.

240
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,127
Pollock roe.

241
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,462
That wouldn't be bad.

242
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,716
No, I'll pass on it for now.

243
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,925
He's passed on pollock roe.

244
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,427
I think we might get gaebul.

245
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,805
Is he going to stop at gaebul?
No, not there.

246
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,891
-It's gaebul.
-It's gaebul. For sure.

247
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,142
Please, no gaebul.

248
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,519
The one ingredient I didn't want was…

249
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,229
-Gaebul.
-Gaebul.

250
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,190
Gaebul.

251
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,070
Gaebul is something
they find fascinating abroad.

252
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,363
-It'll be gaebul.
-Please no.

253
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,658
All right.

254
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,784
Gosh…

255
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,620
But I don't want it.

256
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,374
After all, it's the first mission.

257
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,708
Ta-da.

258
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,585
He's slowing down.

259
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,212
I choose squid.

260
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:15,925
Squid.

261
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,430
The reason why I picked squid was

262
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,265
there are many ways to cook it.

263
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,518
You can grill it, dry it,
steam it, and fry it.

264
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,852
You can even eat it raw.

265
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,814
I think it will pair well with anything.

266
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,024
We need to balance it
with what we get from that one.

267
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,901
The pairing will be important then.

268
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,694
That's the hard part.

269
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,364
Burdock root doesn't pair well.

270
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,032
Chicken has to be on its own.

271
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,576
-Squid and veal?
-That's the worst combination.

272
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,328
Anything but Korean melon.

273
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,082
ANH SUNG-JAE'S WHEEL OF LAND SELECTION

274
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,043
I can't help but think about
how they pair.

275
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,379
-Peas.
-Peas.

276
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,131
-Peas would pair well, right?
-Yes.

277
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,132
They go well together.

278
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,299
He's passing on it?

279
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,009
Heave-ho.

280
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,138
No way.

281
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,265
Squid and veal would be tricky.

282
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,850
That one would be ridiculous.

283
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,810
An ingredient that goes with squid…

284
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,061
-Pass.
-That's right.

285
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,148
I'll go with what I have in mind.

286
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,649
I bet he'll choose something hard.

287
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,733
-Please.
-I choose…

288
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,779
an ingredient
that's coming into season now.

289
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,574
I choose Korean melon.

290
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,328
Squid and Korean melon.

291
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,956
It's squid and Korean melon.

292
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,208
Squid and Korean melon?

293
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,501
That won't be easy.

294
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,836
Squid and Korean melon…

295
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,130
The second one was the problem.

296
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,175
Korean melon was something
I never even thought about.

297
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,928
Korean melon, which we call chamoe,

298
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,473
maintains its crunch as it gets sweeter.

299
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,892
As an ingredient,
there's a lot you can do with it.

300
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,729
Paired with squid, which is an ingredient
you can get anywhere in the world,

301
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,773
I think it will make
for a delicious combination.

302
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,067
Now then,

303
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,197
the first Black and White Spoons'
Team Battle, the seven-on-seven face-off.

304
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,034
You have 20 minutes to select teams
and discuss what dish to make.

305
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,119
-Shall we get together?
-Yes.

306
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,039
I'm sure everyone has a dish in mind.

307
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,458
I want to use
the Korean melon seeds too.

308
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,168
-That'd be good.
-Also…

309
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,254
I'd like to use
the squid's skin or innards as well.

310
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,550
For me, they're ingredients
I have in my fridge at home.

311
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,386
I thought we should make a dish
you wouldn't find anywhere else.

312
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,097
Someone in Western cuisine
could use Korean melon to make…

313
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,058
-Pickles?
-Something like aguachile.

314
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,520
We can make a purée
and spread it underneath.

315
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,230
-Then, on top…
-On top, gim, squid…

316
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,023
-That'd be tasty.
-…and seasoned scallions.

317
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,399
-That sounds good.
-Sounds tasty.

318
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,692
-That's clever.
-A melon sauce.

319
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,611
Mixing in melon would be too much.

320
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,696
We'll soften the melon's texture a bit.

321
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,866
We wanted a bit of a unique punch,

322
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,369
so we decided on the Korean melon's aroma.

323
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,705
We plan on bringing out
the melon's aroma as much as possible.

324
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,376
So, we have squid
and Korean melon to work with.

325
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,712
We need to bring out
both of their flavors.

326
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,214
That's the key point, right?

327
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,425
But based on their judging process,

328
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,388
it seems they really like it
when everything has been used.

329
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:11,225
For example, if we find
that the squid ink is fresh,

330
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,895
how about we add some ink to the sauce?

331
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,690
In my view, and I'm sorry to say this,

332
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,441
but we only had the two judges last time,

333
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,110
and they're both professionals.

334
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,152
You're right.

335
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,654
-But these judges are…
-Right, okay.

336
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,073
I agree with him on that point.

337
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,868
We just need to ensure balance and flavor.

338
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,202
-Let's go mainstream.
-Exactly.

339
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,745
-Something they've had before.
-Yes.

340
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,748
What can win over
the palates of 100 people

341
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,710
is something that tastes delicious
on the first bite.

342
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,837
That first impression will be important,

343
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,881
so we decided on a more crowd-pleasing

344
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,133
and straightforward flavor.

345
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,843
The texture of Korean melon.

346
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,347
There are 100 people.
I think it will have to be something cold.

347
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,182
Let's make a salad with Korean melon.

348
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,226
-Korean melon salad.
-Thinly sliced.

349
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,227
A salad.

350
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,770
"We should make a cold dish."

351
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,106
That's the first thought
that came to mind.

352
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,900
With the squid,

353
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,818
we'll make a cold salad.

354
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,445
-That's better.
-A cold dish.

355
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,363
-We'll go for a cold dish.
-Yes.

356
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,867
Korean melon has the ability
to cool the body down.

357
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,162
And the same goes for squid.

358
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:18,292
After considering the aroma
and texture of the ingredients,

359
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,669
-we went for a cold salad.
-We chose a cold salad.

360
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,546
I think we should decide something fast.

361
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,006
And then, to this…

362
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,967
How about we add
something deep-fried on top of the salad?

363
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,553
-Fried in breadcrumbs.
-Fried squid?

364
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,138
-I like that.
-The reason is

365
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,806
if it's breaded, even after a while,

366
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,225
it stays crispy,
so the texture will be there.

367
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,144
-Good, I like that.
-With the body?

368
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,730
-With the body.
-A cold salad with fried squid.

369
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,731
We'll deep-fry it?

370
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,317
I believe the tentacles
should be included as well.

371
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,694
And we deep-fry the tentacles
to add as a garnish.

372
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,321
Deep-fried tentacles sound good.

373
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,490
-That sounds great.
-Yeah, it'll be tasty.

374
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,200
-To match the tanginess…
-Yeah, on top.

375
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,327
-Deep-fry the tentacles.
-Sounds great.

376
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,995
BOTH TEAMS CHOOSE
SALAD AND FRIED SQUID

377
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,122
Then, who's going to make the sauce?

378
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,084
Is it going to be Korean-style?
Japanese? Or Western?

379
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,252
-Personally, I think Chinese-style.
-Chinese.

380
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,629
-Me too.
-For the salad.

381
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,840
-The sauce itself…
-The sauce should be sweet and sour.

382
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,217
-If we add mustard…
-Yes.

383
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,760
Then, you can do the sauce for us.

384
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,012
I'll make the sauce. Yeah.

385
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,724
-No, Chef Hou will do the sauce.
-No, he said he'll do it.

386
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,518
-Yes, I'll do the sauce.
-He can do it.

387
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,270
The sauce doesn't take long.
I'll make it quickly.

388
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,522
It'll take about 15 minutes.

389
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,482
Then, Chef Im will make the sauce.

390
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,442
Yes, and I'll help
with the squid after that.

391
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,820
After you make it,
all seven of us will taste it.

392
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,489
If it doesn't go well,
we'll go Chinese-style.

393
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,117
We had someone who was really confident.

394
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,785
He also has a loud voice.

395
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,954
I thought, "He must be really confident."

396
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,832
So I agreed, but I added a condition.

397
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,710
If it doesn't taste good,
we'll go with mine.

398
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,921
To be honest, in terms of sauces,

399
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,716
if I exaggerate a little,
I know about 50,000 variations.

400
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,051
I've made all kinds of sauces.

401
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,595
A whole variety of them.

402
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,141
So I'm confident with sauces like this.

403
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,561
-You have five minutes remaining.
-That was fast.

404
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,396
-Too fast.
-Let's summarize.

405
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,107
Then, for this battle,
instead of Western cuisine chefs,

406
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,359
Korean, Chinese,
and Japanese cuisine chefs should go.

407
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,569
Then, Chef Kim,

408
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,279
-you do the salad.
-Me? Okay.

409
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,573
-Chef Jung will do the fried squid.
-Yes, I'll do that.

410
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,199
The deep-fried squid.

411
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,993
-I'll do the squid prep.
-Okay.

412
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,536
Then, I'll do the cutting.

413
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,538
Then, Chef Choi Yu-gang
will do the cutting.

414
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,498
Chef Hou and I can do it together.

415
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,791
-You two can do it.
-Yes.

416
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,461
I'll do the squid prep.
I'm from Taean, after all.

417
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,212
KIM SUNG-WOON
WESTERN CUISINE (FROM TAEAN)

418
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,714
-He'll be the leader?
-Yes.

419
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,674
-Okay, then.
-I think that would be nice.

420
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,967
Then, come to the front.

421
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,928
We have to win. It's the first battle.

422
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,098
We had Korean, Western, Chinese,
and Japanese cuisines all covered.

423
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,518
We sent out our strongest members
to win the first one.

424
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,645
The first dish will be Korean-style.

425
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,231
Those in Korean cuisine
should take part in this.

426
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,860
I should join the seven-on-seven
and also quickly serve the dishes.

427
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,862
-Here, here, and here.
-Yes, the three of us.

428
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,990
Then, shall I score the squid?

429
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,533
-I'm good with a knife.
-Then…

430
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,827
-The team leader should join too.
-Yeah, he should.

431
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,080
-We need two more.
-I'll do the vegetables.

432
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,290
Okay, then I can join too.

433
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,917
-It's everyone except for two.
-Right.

434
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,169
-Then, you two can sit this one out.
-Okay.

435
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,088
Culinary Monster
should be in the last battle.

436
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,589
-Save your strength.
-Yes, rest.

437
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,965
Whatever the ingredients may be,

438
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,343
-I'll join the next two battles.
-Okay, great.

439
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,594
Okay. Sounds good.

440
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,224
We decided on Korean cuisine
for the first dish

441
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,185
and put in all the Korean cuisine chefs.

442
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,104
I thought we had a great mix of chefs.

443
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,190
If we can coordinate well,
I think we can win.

444
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,903
FIRST BLACK AND WHITE SPOONS' TEAM BATTLE
7-ON-7 FACE-OFF

445
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,240
Now then, it's All or Nothing.

446
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,450
The first culinary battle

447
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,787
-begins now!
-Let's do this!

448
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,581
Hold on, Chef. Just a second.

449
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,999
-Just one moment, Chef.
-Hold on.

450
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,501
-Let's go over it first.
-Huddle up.

451
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,628
-Let's go over it.
-Yes.

452
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,880
-Wait, gather around.
-Gather around.

453
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,840
Hold on one second.

454
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,467
Bring 16 squids.

455
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,427
Bring as many Korean melons as we need.

456
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,513
-Bring the seasonings.
-We're doing the sauce.

457
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,682
Bring the seasonings,
and we'll work on the squid.

458
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,517
-And we'll start with the prep.
-Okay.

459
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,893
-Let's go.
-Coming through.

460
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,020
Take some trays with you.

461
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,689
They have trays in there.

462
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,441
-What I'd like to know is…
-Let's go over it first.

463
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,068
…what dish we've decided on

464
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,196
and whether we can taste
a portion or two of that.

465
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,240
I think we should do a test run first.

466
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,366
Okay, got it.

467
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,325
But that…

468
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,954
First, we each do what we're in charge of.

469
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,000
Then, we taste the sauce.
Maybe it's weak or needs something more.

470
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,210
If you give me feedback then,

471
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,712
we'll add something after.

472
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,757
What I'm trying to say is,
I'd like to make one completed dish first.

473
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,467
To do that, what should we do first?

474
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,345
But I can't make the sauce
for only a single portion.

475
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,973
I'll just set the basic outline for you.

476
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,766
He says it only takes around 15 minutes.

477
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,018
-Okay.
-To make the sauce.

478
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,102
The rest, we can…

479
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,855
-I want to taste a finished one.
-We can keep working on the squid.

480
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,273
Come on, get started!

481
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,525
Okay, get going now.

482
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,445
I think the other team's fighting.

483
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,448
I know. Things won't be
that easy over there.

484
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,452
There are some strong characters
among the White Spoon chefs.

485
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,704
They need to agree on something.

486
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,623
We can do the sauce halfway through.

487
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,416
We have a lot to prep right now.

488
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,584
-Yes, Chef.
-You're right.

489
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,877
Are you doing the melon alone?

490
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,795
-No, it's not that.
-I'll join her.

491
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,006
-I'll join her.
-Chef Kim is saying

492
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,257
she wants to taste test it.

493
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,508
-Just one portion.
-To see it.

494
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,094
I can't really picture it right now.

495
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,804
I don't think we should do that though.

496
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,015
I thought we had to cure the melons.

497
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,309
We'll have to cure them
and blanch one squid.

498
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,602
I think at the halfway point,

499
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,771
-we should check and taste it.
-Okay, you're right.

500
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,106
It may be hard to do
everything right now.

501
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,441
There are too many parts to it.

502
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,235
I was a little concerned at first

503
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,654
because things like
who is doing what and how,

504
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,155
when things need to be done,

505
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,865
and how the plating should be done

506
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,326
need to be at least roughly
decided on before starting.

507
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,119
That's what I thought.

508
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,997
With team battles,

509
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,084
you need to do well together
to advance together.

510
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,962
Friends, let's not fight

511
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,255
or curse at each other.

512
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,756
Okay, let's go!

513
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,424
Good luck!

514
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,343
-Okay.
-I'll take the cutting board.

515
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,227
They're big.

516
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,983
We'll be using them again, right?

517
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,818
They need to set up first.

518
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,611
Just taking out the knives takes forever.

519
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,656
They brought so many knives,
because you don't know what you'll need.

520
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,409
Hey, Chef Im!

521
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,536
When you do the salad,

522
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,830
how about adding some minari?

523
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,790
-Add some minari.
-Yeah, that sounds good.

524
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,166
How does minari sound?

525
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,502
-We can add some to the salad.
-Sounds great.

526
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,296
I'll go get the minari.

527
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,219
When you have 11 players for soccer,

528
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,597
they can't see the whole field.

529
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,393
But the coach can see
everything from above.

530
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,522
In the same way, we became their coaches.

531
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,870
I think the minari
will taste great in the salad.

532
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,747
They have minari too.

533
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,081
Maybe it's similar to ours.

534
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,625
Then, ours just needs to taste better.

535
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,795
The two teams have
such similar ingredients.

536
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,839
-It's okay. It doesn't matter.
-Are you kidding?

537
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,424
Ours can just taste better.

539
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,763
I think there really are 100 in here.

540
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,183
Are the squid fresh?

541
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,524
-The insides are sliding right out.
-The prince of Taean.

542
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,193
-The squid are big.
-Yes, they're good.

543
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,445
-There are 50 here.
-Fifty of them?

544
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,780
-Yes.
-That should do.

545
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,698
-Right?
-Yes. They're all big.

546
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,951
-We need to…
-Man, this squid skin.

547
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,203
I've peeled off plenty.

548
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,662
-We need to win this.
-What?

549
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,082
-The first battle's important.
-Right, that momentum.

550
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,958
-Things get chaotic.
-To intimidate them?

551
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,502
-Yes.
-Things will start to get messy

552
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,586
-if we lose here.
-Right.

553
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,463
Isn't 16 too small an amount?

554
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,131
This is…

555
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,342

-Yes, 20.

And take this out.

-Knife Omakase is great with seafood.
-Yes, he is.

561
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:18,939
Give me one.

562
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,901
See how many portions it'll make.

563
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,985
Okay.

564
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,237
Two pieces per portion.

565
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,489
With squid,

566
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,741
even when I cook at home,
I always score it.

567
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,911
It gives it a more tender texture.

568
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,248
The sauce also seeps into the cuts.

569
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,083
Those are the benefits.

570
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,837

00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,131
Wow, Witch with a Wok!

That's a work of art.

573
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,678
I think we'll win.

574
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,726
They gutted the squid
while maintaining its shape.

575
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,186
Where?

576
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,980
The White Spoons. Like squid sundae.

577
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,481
I see. The insides?

578
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,527
-In this tube form…
-Yes?

579
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,444
Is it possible?

580
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,238
-What?
-Could we score it?

581
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,573
No, it's difficult.

582
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,241
It's better to open it up in that case.

583
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,451
It might work with water. Should I try it?

584
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,539
-Because if we score it…
-It might work.

585
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,082
It does get more tender.

586
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,126
-It worked.
-Really?

587
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,171
-If I cut them…
-I'll put it here.

588
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,591
-Then, Chef, please cut off the heads.
-Okay.

589
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,218
Basically, with the squid,

590
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,553
if it's like this,

591
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,847
this is the outer side.

592
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,641
So to score the inside of the squid,

593
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,895
we turned it inside out,
like you would with a sock.

594
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,898
It's much better if it's tender.

595
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,151
They're going to score all of them?

596
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,153
Yes, then they'll deep-fry them.

602
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,388
The Korean melons are too big,
so the rind is tough.

603
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,556
-The rind?
-Yes.

604
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,725
I think we should use
only a tiny bit of it.

605
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,354
-It's way too tough.
-Yes, we can't use it.

606
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,147
Don't use it all. We'll have to peel them.

607
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,149
-Yes, this won't do.
-Yes, let's peel them.

608
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,359
It was really tough.

609
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,444

You're just going to cut them that way?

612
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,747
They're slicing them with the rind on.

613
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,504
How much are they planning per portion?

614
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,339
-They'll have like this much.
-Exactly.

615
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,095
It's like they're making
radish kimchi, or kkakdugi,

616
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,554
and filling that whole basin.

617
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,188
We sliced them very thin.

618
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,859
Then, we salted the Korean melons.

619
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,488
Is this texture okay?

620
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,698
I think it's good.

621
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,825
Too much will make them soft.

622
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,493
-This is good.
-Yes, right about now.

623
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,203
-Has it been three minutes?
-Yes.

624
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,830
-Then, we'll move on.
-It tastes great.

00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,463
-Mix it?
-Yes.

629
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,429
Please mix it up well.

630
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,975
They're curing the melons
with starch syrup.

631
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,728
If they do that, it'll be like seokkbakji.

632
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,813
-Like the kimchi you get with naengmyeon.
-Right.

633
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,273
-Radish kimchi.
-Yeah.

634
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,569
Okay. Today's outcome hinges on this.

635
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,738
This needs to be good.

636
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,448
It's no different from making kimchi.

637
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,284
It feels like we're making kimchi.

638
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,163
If you salt Korean melon,
and then rinse it,

639
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,915
the moisture drains out
and the aroma along with it.

640
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,419
And when curing in a short time like this,

641
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:14,257
using starch syrup
works much faster than using salt.

642
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,388

I've been making food in bulk

It's all about the ratio.

I go by what's inside those bottles

658
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,066

00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,573
He poured in the whole bottle.

662
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,743
As someone watching from the second floor,

663
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,871
he's a bit rough with his cooking.

664
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,540
To be honest, when I'm cooking,

665
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,874
I measure everything out.

666
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,043
But I told myself to have faith.

667
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,254
Nothing good will come of me
getting nervous.

-Where?

-The White Spoons.
-Yeah, he's smashing them.

00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,023
They're using a lot of garlic.

672
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,567
-What's all that for?
-The sauce.

673
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,944
I think it's for the salad sauce,
but it's too much.

674
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,659
That's too much garlic!

675
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,912
-They said it's too much garlic.
-Yeah.

676
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,914
Too much garlic.

677
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,708
Chef, there's also minced garlic inside.

678
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,418
-Minced garlic.
-That's too much garlic.

679
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,502
They have minced garlic.

680
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,004
This will add the kick.

681
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,257
-What?
-The garlic will add a spicy kick.

682
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,134
The aroma can't be too strong.

683
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,218
Right.

684
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,805
The way they use garlic
in Korean cuisine is different

685
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,015
from French cuisine.

686
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,021
He's using a Chinese cleaver.

687

-Right, he is.
-Yes.

688
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,690
-But he does Korean cuisine.
-No.

689
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,526
He's just using Chef Hou's.

-Oh, just any knife?
-Yeah, exactly.

00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,963
are really sweet.

699
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,176
-Those are the seeds, right?
-Yes, the seeds.

700
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,761
He's blending them.

701
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,138
When you blend them,

702
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,934
it comes out thick,
like the consistency of a banana.

703
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,478
You get a lovely aroma
and its natural sweetness.

704
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,109
That Korean melon aroma
goes into the sauce.

705
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,113
He must've cooked in big batches a lot.

706
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,616
-He's so quick.
-He moves like the wind.

707
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,370
MINCED GARLIC

708
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,083
Okay, the sauce is done.

709
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,919
Come have a taste, so I can finalize it.

710
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,921
He finished the sauce
and wants them to try it.

711
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,172
The sauce is done?

712
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,465
But if they try the sauce now…

713
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,925
It's too early, Chef!

714
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,683
I'm so curious about the sauce.

715
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,893
Then, after that…

716
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,484
It was an Asian-style sauce.

717
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,863
The key point was to bring out the flavor
and texture of the Korean melon.

718
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,323
A salad is a cold dish,

719
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,577
and cold dishes don't use any heat,

720
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,245
so the sauce is everything.

721
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,913
The sauce is really important.

722
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,164
Yes, the sauce.

723
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,250
-Don't worry.
-Seriously,

724
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,668
the sauce has to be delicious.

725
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,420
One bite and you'll say, "This is crazy."

726
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,505
-That kind of taste.
-Right. "This is insane."

727
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,598
That spicy kick keeps
coming out of the garlic.

728
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,184
Delicious? Good?

729
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,352
This is tasty.

730
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,563
-Done!
-The sauce is good.

731
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,480
It's over!

732
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:44,861
He's very cute.

733
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,784
-The sauce tastes great.
-Yes.

734
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,204
Chef Im Seong-keun is
totally carrying this round.

735
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,207
I'm an expert when it comes to flavor.

736
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,626
To be honest,

737
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,045
if I look at some boiling pots,

738
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,797
just from the steam,
I can tell which ones are done cooking

739
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,884
and which ones
are just boiling plain water.

740
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,929
I believe in my tongue and my senses.

741
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,430
What should I do, Chef?

742
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,350
-Well, we need to use the juice.
-Right.

743
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,517
So scrape them out?

744
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,853
Yes, and please save the seeds.

745
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,063
-The seeds?
-Yes.

746
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,230
Okay.

747
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,110
-Those are the seeds, right?
-Yes, the seeds.

748
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,785
We blended the Korean melons
to make the sauce.

749
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,829
When the juice is done,
please hand it to me.

750
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,916
-Seoul Mother, this juice is for blending?
-Yes.

751
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,167
-I think that's enough.
-Okay.

752
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,461
-What about the sauce base?
-I think…

753
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,506
How about we blend in
the Korean melon seeds?

754
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,424
-Some Korean melon juice.
-Korean melon juice.

755
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,301
I think adding the juice will taste good.

756
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,386
We have sesame seeds too.

757
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,346
-We can grind and add those.
-Sounds good.

758
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,516
They taste completely different.
Will it be okay?

759
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,977
Honestly, I'm not sure
about the sesame seeds.

760
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,813
-No, I think they'll be fine.
-You think so? Sesame seeds and…

761
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,649
I didn't think they'd pair well,
but I thought I'd give it a try.

762
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,901
-First, grind the sesame seeds.
-The sesame seeds.

763
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,236
We can add more as we go.

764
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,196
I think that's enough.

765
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,698
-Right? This much.
-Yes.

766
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,663
KOREAN MELON SEED CAVITY

767
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,004
-I'll taste it.
-Okay.

768
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,630
-I'll try it.
-Please try some.

769
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,966
Or we can add some water.

770
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,218
-I'll add water. That'd be better.
-Yes, some water.

771
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,014
-Add more? Or no?
-It needs more.

772
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,890
-Add more.
-More? Okay.

773
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,183
I'll add some more.

774
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,686
-Yes. I think we'll have to add all of it.
-Okay.

775
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,108
I think that's too much sesame.

776
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,819
Isn't the sesame aroma too strong?
Is it okay?

777
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:50,862
-Is it good?
-It's fine.

778
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,321
-We won't add any more.
-Okay.

779
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,531
We won't make it too strong.

780
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,076
MUSTARD

781
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,746
SUGAR

782
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,498
I think it will taste like

783
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,625
sesame dressing with an added twist.

784
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,378
Like a mustard and sesame dressing.

785
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,714
Mustard with the melon
will give it a refreshing kick.

786
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,717
-Is the consistency okay?
-It's a bit thin.

787
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,718
It's too thin, right?

788
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,719
-Slightly.
-No.

789
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,971
It can't be too thick. It'll taste bad.

790
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,431
I think it should be thicker.

791
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,432
Is it too thin?

792
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:20,975
It might be too runny.

793
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,019
Then, we'll add more sesame.

794
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,562
Yeah, let's grind more sesame seeds.

795
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,612
Here it comes.

796
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,660
I think the consistency's fine like this.

797
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,371
-The consistency's fine.
-Yeah.

798
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,623
This is good.

799
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,376
On top, we'll be adding some…

800
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,714
Is the mustard too strong? No, right?

801
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,882
It's okay.

802
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,300
-It's good.
-Isn't it a bit bland?

803
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,010
The melon aroma has to come through.

804
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,512
Can you taste the melon?

805
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,513
The melon aroma.

806
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,847
-The melon…
-Not really.

807
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,973
-Not much.
-It's just okay.

808
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,434
-It may have too much sesame.
-Otherwise, it's too thin.

809
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,020
We fixed the consistency,
but the sesame sauce isn't really

810
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,730
-that special.
-We'll make and taste one.

811
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,148
Then, we can season it.

812
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,026
I'm a bit hesitant to say anything.

813
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,030
-But we have to. Or we'll be eliminated.
-Right.

814
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,240
Squid fins.

815
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,492
Captain! Can we talk for a second?

816
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,036
Sorry.

817
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,081
We're both worried

818
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,541
that the melon aroma is too weak.

819
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,792
The melon aroma's in there.

820
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,001
-In the dressing?
-It's fine.

821
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,711
Is it okay? The sesame's not too strong?

822
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,713
It is, but you'll still get
a hint of the melon.

823
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,050
What if we blend a melon or two
and mix them in with the sauce?

824
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,844
No, it'll become too thin again.

825
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,471
I think just one or two will be fine.

826
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,933
In our discussion at the start,
we talked about adding some sesame.

827
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,061
But when the sauce was actually made,

828
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,689
too much sesame was added in.

829
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,401
But we can't taste it
from the second floor.

830
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,571
So we were really worried
about the sesame aroma.

831
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,698
We'll try making one and taste it.

832
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,950
We'll taste it and change it.

833
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,453
This is seriously not right…

834
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,631
-It tastes okay.
-Let's try mixing it.

835
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,175
Let's mix it and taste it.

836
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,759
-It's not bad.
-Yes, it tastes good.

837
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,802
What time is it?

838
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,763
Chef Hou, we have 110 minutes left.

839
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,349
They're all huddled together.

840
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,185
How many squids are we doing?

841
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,895
-We did 50.
-Fifty?

842
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,314
PREPPING THE SQUID FOR THE SALAD

843
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,524
They're scoring all of those? Goodness.

844
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,943
-They're going to score and blanch them.
-Really?

845
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,946
-They're really fast.
-That's amazing.

846
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,991
-You can do it!
-You got this!

847
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,159
Let's go!

848
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,497
After blanching,
I think they'll cut them to size.

849
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,291
He's so quick.

850
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,211
We need to cut the squid.

851
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,631
-Okay, we've agreed on this.
-Okay.

852
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,054
I think the prep's almost done.

853
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,973
Okay, here goes the sauce.

854
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,061
-Want me to mix it again?
-Yes.

855
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,855
We'll let it absorb the dressing.

856
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,399
Then, we'll add some more on top later.

857
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,652
We're moving faster than the other team.

858
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,820
Whatever the dish may be,

859
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,156
I believe it needs to be finished quickly.

860
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,659
If you miss that timing,
the flavor won't be as good.

861
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,036
We need to plate these now.

862
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,497
-Okay.
-They're going to make a plate.

863
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,290
They're plating a sample.

864
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,875
How are you going to plate it?

865
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,044
We'll put these in first.

866
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,297
The fried squid will go on the very top.

867
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,883
-Like this. And then…
-Okay.

868
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,719
-Like so.
-We need to add more of this.

869
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,804
KOREAN MELON SALAD SAUCE

870
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,597
Let's garnish with this and taste it.

871
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,976
Shall we add some tomatoes to this?

872
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,560
The color would be nice,

873
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,729
-but only if we have time.
-We have time.

874
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,773
-Let's taste this first.
-Yes, taste it.

875
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,860
-It's done.
-Try it, everyone.

876
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,363
I think it's all right.

877
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,577
The Asian sauce?

878
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,746
It was good, but…

879
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,624
On the whole, it was quite watery.

880
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,127
We had Asian pear and apple in there too,

881
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,254
so I thought
it might end up bland later on.

882
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:21,257
With the moisture that'll come out,
I think the sauce should be stronger.

883
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,425
-Just a bit.
-A bit more?

884
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,593
Right? Just a bit stronger might be good.

885
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,471
I think it's too weak at the moment.

886
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,556
The dressing.

887
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,183
I think a tiny bit more melon and this

888
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,351
-would be good.
-Yes.

889
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,395
They're just a tiny bit weak.

890
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,939
It seems the balance isn't quite right.

891
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,609
It's not pairing as well as they thought.

892
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,571
They're mixing it
since there's not enough.

893
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,615
Soy sauce.

894
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,451
The sauce on its own was fine.

895
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:52,038
But when you mix it, moisture comes out
and waters down the sauce.

896
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,249
-When we're done, let's taste it.
-Okay.

897
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,084
Captain, let's mix it all in here.

898
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,502
Shall we mix it all and taste it?

899
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,879
This, the melon, and…

900
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,173
A bit of minari.

901
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,132
MINARI, WATER CELERY

902
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,259
-It's salty enough.
-It is?

903
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,553
I think that's enough squid.

904
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,637
COLD SQUID FOR THE SALAD

905
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,641
The Korean melon aroma
really needs to come through in this.

906
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,018
SESAME AND KOREAN MELON SAUCE

907
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,645
I wish they'd add
a little more Korean melon.

908
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,230
I think the melon aroma's too weak.

909
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,817
-Let's try it.
-We should add more of this.

910
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,694
-Together.
-Yes, add more.

911
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,408
We made it and tasted it.

912
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,294
But the flavor was way too ordinary.

913
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,923
It's too plain, isn't it?

914
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:44,965
What do we do?

915
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,137
The sauce.

916
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,181
But at this stage…

917
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,933
-What's wrong?
-It's too plain.

918
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,102
Plain is fine as long as it's tasty.

919
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,231
The sauce wasn't bad,

920
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,983
but when mixed with everything,
the melon flavor was weakened.

921
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,612
I think adding more sesame
overpowered it.

922
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,656
We're not getting enough melon aroma.

923
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,451
How is the sauce?

924
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,577
We can't taste the melon.

925
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,121
-Blend in the melon.
-Quickly.

926
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,664
Blend it, mix them together,

927
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,958
-and add more lemon juice.
-Let's try adding one.

928
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,876
Three.

929
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,882
It was obvious
it would only taste like sesame.

930
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,759
I was so frustrated.

931
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,803
So we quickly changed course.

932
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,972
-Just blend the melon flesh.
-Okay.

933
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:37,143
Add mustard, sugar, salt, and vinegar.

934
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,937
Use that sauce instead.
There's too much sesame right now.

935
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,939
We have plenty of time.

936
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,650
-You can do the dressing again.
-Toss that. Start afresh.

937
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,153
Is the blender ready?

938
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,322
What matters most is handling the issue.

939
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,702
-We should season this melon juice.
-Okay.

940
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,371
And make it really taste like melon.

941
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,498
-Not melon and sesame.
-Okay.

942
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,126
We'll add some acidity and mustard to it.

943
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,467
Let's make this and taste it.

944
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,095
-This is the dressing, right?
-Yes, the dressing.

945
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,145
I think we have enough time.

946
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,897
-The problem is the taste.
-Right.

947
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,026
Let's mix it all
with the dressing I made

948
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,111
-and have a taste.
-Okay, let's taste it.

949
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,656
-This is the new dressing.
-Okay.

950
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,288
-I'll add some acidity and salt.
-It needs more salt.

951
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:41,957
It tastes like Korean melon.

952
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,501
Should we add mustard?

953
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,044
-It doesn't need it.
-I think so too.

954
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,712
-It's a little…
-They have mustard too.

955
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,340
-I don't want to add mustard.
-It really tastes of Korean melon.

956
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,050
-Okay.
-It just needs some vinegar.

957
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,343
-Vinegar.
-And salt.

958
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,054
It tasted much better.

959
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,306
This is pure melon.

960
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,433
-Exactly! That's it.
-Pure melon.

961
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,395
We ground all that sesame for nothing.

962
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,398
We scrapped all that sauce we'd made.

963
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,443
After changing the sauce midway,

964
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,195
the result was so much better.

965
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,739
We should add two more melons.

966
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,076
I'll add this much more to the dressing.

967
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,288
To really bring out all that melon aroma,
we also blended in the seeds.

968
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,124
The melon and squid have to stand out.

969
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,626
The more melon, the better.

970
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,255
I think adding more sauce on top
at the end will be good.

971
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,423
-It smells like melon.
-The aroma is great.

972
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,551
Like this.

973
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,804
If we make the melon aroma shine,
we have a good chance of winning

974
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,180
since the theme is Korean melon.

975
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,099
Captain, did you add mustard?

976
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,684
-We didn't.
-Not yet?

977
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,269
I think it's better without it.

978
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,815
Actually, I think it would taste good
with mustard too.

979
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,857
It's all right.

980
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:52,111
When I tried it,
I thought it only tasted of Korean melon.

981
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,281
I felt we needed to change it.

982
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,701
In that case, I need to add mustard,
make the dressing,

983
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,994
and persuade them.

984
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,664
Let's just have a taste of this.

985
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,207
Should we mix it in?

986
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,544
No need to slice it so finely.
Rough chunks will do.

987
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,589
-Just try a tiny bit.
-Okay.

988
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,135
-It's better without it.
-You think so?

989
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,138
-It's better without it.
-Yeah. Just make it pure melon.

990
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,472
Pure melon flavor.

991
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,515
-Pure melon?
-Yeah.

992
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,020
Just a bit more vinegar
and some lemon juice should do it.

993
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,772
That was what the majority decided,

994
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,275
so I have no choice but to follow.

995
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,986
I can't just throw everything down

996
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,280
and shout, "We can't go on like this!"

997
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,158
I still want them to add some mustard.

998
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,868
-Even just a little.
-Because right now,

999
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,413
this is drifting away
from what most people like.

1000
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,207
Should we squeeze
the water out of the melon?

1001
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,626
Yes, please.

1002
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,461
I was looking for some cheesecloth.

1003
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,796
-This is faster.
-We can do it like this.

1004
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,132
-This is fine.
-Gosh, you're strong.

1005
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,051
Well, of course. There we go.

1006
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,969
We're basically salad spinners.

1007
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,429
"Basically salad spinners."

1008
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,099
Squeeze out a bit more if you can.

1009
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,770
-You have to do it like me.
-With your hands. Exactly!

1010
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,230
-You need the basin.
-Do it like Chef Hou.

1011
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,774
Exactly. You need to really squeeze.

1012
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,192
Squeeze like this.

1013
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,943
We don't have any cheesecloths.

1014
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,196
So we need to use our hands.

1015
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,740
A taste of this and it's game over.

1016
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,908
It's guaranteed to be good.

1017
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,618
Chef Jung, you need to heat the oil.

1018
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,535
The oil.

1019
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,204
-It's in a big can in the pantry.
-Okay.

1020
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,956
-He said a big can.
-Right.

1021
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,416
-We need two.
-Okay.

1022
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,501
Let's each take one.

1023
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,128
Here we go.

1024
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,465
One fryer should be enough, right?

1025
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,134
I guess they're frying in a wok.

1026
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,969
She's not using a fryer.

1027
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,554
She's doing it there?

1028
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,182
Will it be okay?
Is there a thermometer?

1029
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,809
They don't use one in Chinese cuisine.

1030
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,689
So it's 50 to 25. Okay, 25.

1031
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,026
Witch with a Wok handled the frying
ever so secretly.

1032
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,237
It's 170 to… 8.

1033
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,697
-And 8 times 2 is 16.
-The batter seems special.

1034
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,579
POTATO STARCH

1035
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,373
What should we fry with?

1036
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,500
There's a crispy batter mix
used in Chinese cuisine.

1037
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,253
-It's really crispy.
-Let's go with that.

1038
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,130
-We need the texture.
-It needs to last long.

1039
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,548
-Good.
-It'll be crispy.

1040
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,757
I'll make it crispy.

1041
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,762
Chinese cuisine uses potato starch.

1042
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,264
It won't get as soggy.

1043
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,185
I have to mix this in.

1044
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,187
-I'll do it.
-Please add it in.

1045
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,860
She works really fast.

1046
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,487
Let's try frying some.

1047
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,783
If you fry it long enough,
it'll hold up better.

1048
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,784
I mean the batter.

1049
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,455
Our fried squid seems better.

1050
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,331
I know. I think so too.

1051
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,541
It won't even compare.

1052
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,505
I was going to fry it Chinese-style.

1053
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,009
I was confident.

1054
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,470
Taste this.

1055
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,181
Is it good?

1056
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,809
And the seasoning? It's okay, right?

1057
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,394
-Yes, it's fine.
-Okay, good.

1058
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,938
-The batter is something else.
-It's amazing.

1059
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,440
How did you make the batter?

1060
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,859
-It's a secret.
-A secret? It's so delicious.

1061
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,695
-Actually…
-Shouldn't we add almonds?

1062
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,656
I didn't even try the sauce
when they were all tasting it.

1063
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,242
Because what I was tasked with

1064
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,578
was cleaning the squid, scoring it,

1065
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,746
and deep-frying it.

1066
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:34,208
I thought, "They'll take care of it.
I should focus on my job."

1067
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,800
Witch with a Wok is the kind of person
you really need on a team.

1068
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,719
-Right.
-Seriously. She's fast.

1069
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,638
-She quietly does her work.
-Exactly.

1070
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,474
How long will the fried squid take?

1071
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,393
We can fry them
when we have 30 minutes left.

1072
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,230
-That's right.
-We just have to place them on top.

1073
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,691
We wanted to serve the fried squid warm.

1074
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,401
When do I start frying?

1075
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,569
When do you need them by?

1076
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,279
-Just tell me the time.
-Hold on.

1077
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,616
We'll start moving them
when there's 30 minutes left.

1078
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,284
So you need them done by then?

1079
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,744
Start frying with 30 minutes left.

1080
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,746
-With 30 minutes left? Okay.
-Yes.

1081
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,581
They're putting
the fried squid on top too.

1082
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,416
We were all thinking along the same lines.

1083
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,377
It comes down to the impact.

1084
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,590
I think this will be won
on the details and the taste,

1085
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,551
since their approaches are similar.

1086
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,594
I think it's going as planned.

1087
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,805
They're done prepping
and will be plating soon.

1088
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,892
I think adding shredded perilla leaves
at the end would be nice.

1089
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,686
-The aroma would be great.
-But the aroma

1090
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,187
might clash with the minari.

1091
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,815
But for minari,
I think the aroma is weak.

1092
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,151
We have to add the perilla leaves.

1093
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,279
Chef Kim Hee-eun suggested

1094
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,407
adding the aroma
of perilla leaves instead of minari.

1095
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,952
I just thought of this. Why not blend
perilla leaves with mayonnaise

1096
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,204
-to put on the fried squid?
-It lacks sauce, right?

1097
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,123
-We need more aroma.
-Yes.

1098
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,543
Why don't we make
a kind of tartar sauce with that

1099
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,336
and put it on the fried squid?

1100
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,922
I think that's good, but right now…

1101
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,340
-The time?
-Yes, it may be…

1102
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,718
They want to make
a mayonnaise sauce for…

1103
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,386
-With perilla leaves.
-…the fried squid.

1104
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,138
I had two things in mind.

1105
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,725
The perilla leaves

1106
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,938
and the touch of lime
in the tartar sauce I made

1107
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,315
will be what they taste first.

1108
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,152
Then, the other half will be
the cold salad underneath

1109
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,404
with plenty of dressing.

1110
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,948
In one dish,

1111
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,117
there would be two textures
and two flavors.

1112
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,620
I thought that would be a huge plus.

1113
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,413
They're making tartar sauce over there.

1114
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,956
That wasn't part of their plan.

1115
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,042
Something was missing from their flavor.

1116
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,669
They're making tartar sauce.

1117
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,965
It's for the fried squid.
That's quite a variety of things.

1118
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,176
We have 60 minutes left!

1119
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,510
-Okay!
-That's perfect.

1120
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,596
Okay, let's start plating.

1121
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,890
Hee-eun! You need to
clear that area for the plates.

1122
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,308
-I'll put out the plates.
-Okay.

1123
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,440
-Can you get ready for plating?
-Yes. I'll wipe it down

1124
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,483
and put out the plates.

1125
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,567
-Did you wipe here?
-Yes.

1126
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,278
They're starting to plate too.

1127
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,324
The cucumber aroma.
I mean, the Korean melon aroma.

1128
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,035
It's so fragrant.

1129
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,995
-No, it can't be appealing just to us.
-Right.

1130
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,247
The judges need to feel the same.

1131
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,292
Just eating the melon will be enough.

1132
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,337
Just the melon?

1133
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,713
That's all he's talking about.

1134
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,964
Hold it in, Ho-young.

1135
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,429
-The green color…
-Put in a lot of Korean melon.

1136
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:38,058
-There's plenty of melon.
-It needs to have a lot of Korean melon.

1137
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,649
The dish the White Spoon chefs made

1138
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,360
had melons with the rind still on.

1139
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,279
-Are we okay?
-We won.

1140
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,156
-You sure?
-The Korean melons

1141
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,076
are really firm,
but they used them with the rind on.

1142
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,204
I hope their melon is tough to chew.

1143
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,122
Me too. Please.

1144
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,377
The rind was a little firm,

1145
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,879
but we sliced them really thin.

1146
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,341
And as the sweetness soaks in
and the moisture comes out,

1147
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,804
I believe that is a key point.

1148
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,640
Is it one piece of squid?

1149
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,892
No, not one piece.

1150
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,645
Roughly, maybe four or five pieces?

1151
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,272
It can't be a rough number.

1152
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,816
The plates have to look identical.

1153
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,776
We can't have some people have less.

1154
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,279
-They need to be the same.
-The same? Then, do six.

1155
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,239
I think we can give them more.

1156
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,782
-Put more on.
-Okay.

1157
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,742
-We have a lot.
-Yeah.

1158
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,910
Please give me ten portions.
I'll plate them.

1159
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,204
We've done 30 now.

1160
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,414
Good, okay.

1161
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,666
-I'm moving them now.
-Okay!

1162
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,876
Currently,

1163
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,962
you have 30 minutes left.

1164
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,882
Witch with a Wok, if you're done,

1165
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,800
-please do the frying.
-Fry them? Okay.

1166
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,260
Start frying.

1167
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,645
If Japanese-style frying is done right,
Chinese-style frying can't win.

1168
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,814
Witch with a Wok, fry them up nice.

1169
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,442
Delicious and crispy.

1170
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:14,696
I think our fried squid will taste
much better without a doubt.

1171
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,239
-Ho-young!
-Okay.

1172
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,991
-We can't let them get hard.
-Right.

1173
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,285
Go, Witch with a Wok! So cool and quick!

1174
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,789
In Chinese cuisine,
100 servings is pretty common.

1175
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,543
Should we plate the fried squid?

1176
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,503
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

1177
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,837
We have 20 minutes left.

1178
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,925
-How confusing.
-You have fried squid too?

1179
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,093
After adding this one,
I got confused.

1180
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,678
Goodness, we're both so similar.

1181
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,515
Well, that's just the nature
of squid as an ingredient.

1182
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,184
The fried squid is the same.

1183
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,561
-This is crazy.
-Ours can just be tastier.

1184
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,021
-That's true.
-That's what counts.

1185
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,189
They did fried squid too.

1186
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,983
-I know. We had the same thought.
-This is crazy. Unbelievable.

1187
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,444
I can't believe they both made
fried squid on cold salad.

1188
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,362
Right?

1189
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,489
We have fried tentacles,

1190
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,200
and they have fried squid rings.

1191
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,368
Gosh, what do we do?

1192
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,245
Will this be a war of fried squid?

1193
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,497
We're almost the same.

1194
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,707
This plate isn't ours.

1195
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,459
-No, it's not.
-Why was this put here?

1196
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,003
-That's not our fried squid.
-That's ours.

1197
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:12,921
This is yours?

1198
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,339
Yes, it's our fried squid.

1199
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,633
-We both have fried squid.
-That's confusing.

1200
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,345
Currently, you have 10 minutes left.

1201
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,305
Wow, time really flies by.

1202
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,599
Lastly, please check if all the plates

1203
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,892
have all the components.

1204
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,770
You really can't compete with experience.

1205
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,235
-What is it?
-They're missing a squid ring.

1206
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,319
The White Spoons.

1207
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,445
Should I tell them or not?

1208
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,822
-Where?
-One, two, three.

1209
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,077
This one's missing a fried squid.

1210
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,164
How many minutes are left?

1211
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,875
-Five minutes.
-Five minutes?

1212
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,213
Five.

1213
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,548
-Four.
-All done.

1214
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:59,134
-Three. Two.
-Almost done.

1215
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,970
-One.
-All done!

1216
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,264
The first battle is over.

1217
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,145
-Well done, everyone!
-Good work!

1218
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,606
-Great job!
-Let's go!

1219
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,982
Go, Black Spoons!

1220
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,359
-Well done.
-Great job.

1221
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,570
We did it!

1222
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:20,322
Man, I'm exhausted.

1223
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:23,909
7-ON-7 FACE-OFF
END OF COOKING

1224
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,120
This looks really impressive.

1225
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,956
It's quite a sight to see
200 plates laid out like this.

1226
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,147
-Theirs is really similar to ours.
-You're right.

1227
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,899
A salad with fried squid on top.

1228
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,944
They were so similar
that people were worried,

1229
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,237
but it just means
the tastier one will win.

1230
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,283
We shouldn't care so much
about the other team.

1231
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,745
I wasn't particularly worried or anything.

1232
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,998
You can just tell by the shape
and color of the fried squid.

1233
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,708
We totally won.

1234
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,418
This is Korean melon and squid salad.

1235
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,379
TEAM WHITE SPOON
KOREAN MELON AND SQUID SALAD

1236
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:20,090
You can enjoy the squid
with two different textures.

1237
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,259
It's crispy as well as chewy.

1238
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,888
The Korean melon
was cured with the rind on,

1239
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,640
so it's nice and crunchy.

1240
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,769
We blended the seeds
and used them to make the sauce.

1241
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,521
We also made a tartar sauce,

1242
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,066
so if you eat the squid with it,
it'll be so delicious.

1243
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,693
There will be many different textures.

1244
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,529
I thought there was too much.

1245
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,781
Apples, Korean pears, and perilla leaves.

1246
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,534
It had a lot of ingredients
besides Korean melon.

1247
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,911
I thought, "We've definitely won."

1248
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,108
My fried squid.

1249
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,652
I hope they can bite through cleanly.

1250
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,239
They can.

1251
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:27,907
Right?

1252
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,039
It'll taste good.

1253
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,584
The salad is also perfect.

1254
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,796
Please enjoy our dish.

1255
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,007
The White Spoons

1256
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,885
left the rind on for the texture.

1257
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,387
As you just said,

1258
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,973
I think they really thought
about the texture.

1259
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,060
All sorts of things
are happening inside my mouth.

1260
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,353
I'm getting this, that,
and all kinds of flavors.

1261
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,732
I've never faced 100 people like this.

1262
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,362
They're really digging in.

1263
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,697
What are they enjoying so much?

1264
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,991
-They're digging in.
-They're really enjoying it.

1265
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,036
-I think the dish turned out well.
-Yeah.

1266
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,789
-It's a relief. We had enough time too.
-Yeah, the melon aroma.

1267
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,249
The dish we prepared is called

1268
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:22,087
"The Squid and Korean Melon Flower
Has Bloomed."

1269
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,798
We blended the Korean melons whole

1270
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,425
to make a dressing
packed with melon aroma.

1271
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,346
We prepped the squid delicately,

1272
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:39,062
so the dressing could cling on
to the squid as much as possible.

1273
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,774
To make the melon aroma
really stand out and enjoyable,

1274
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,320
we kept it simple
and focused on using the Korean melon.

1275
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,115
When I looked at their sauce,

1276
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,659
it was white in color.

1277
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,912
We might win because of the sauce.

1278
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,248
I got that feeling right away.

1279
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,597
The scoring on the squid is a work of art.

1280
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,267
They scored it really well.

1281
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,828
Their reactions are good.

1282
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,079
They're liking it.

1283
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,498
Nice. Let's go.

1284
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,097
I think this will come down to preference.

1285
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,183
-Yes, I think so too.
-Yes.

1286
00:57:59,100 --> 00:57:59,934
Or…

1287
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,936
things might lean to one side.

1288
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,522
That's quite possible.

1289
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,066
We need to either win big,

1290
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,943
or lose by a narrow margin.

1291
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,196
The first match is important.

1292
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,532
-The first one's important.
-It really is.

1293
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,452
The tasting is complete.

1294
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,664
Now, it's time to begin voting

1295
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,750
for the first battle.

1296
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:24,959
The moment of truth.

1297
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,419
Dear Lord.

1298
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,215
Oh, my gosh.

1299
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,966
Should we offer a deep bow?

1300
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,135
-Should I do it?
-Do it in your heart.

1301
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,470
Oh, god.

1302
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,681
Out of Team Black Spoon
and Team White Spoon,

1303
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,976
please choose the dish
that was more delicious

1304
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,811
and cast your vote.

1305
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,155
I think it could be a landslide.

1306
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,368
The voting is complete.

1307
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,245
7-ON-7 FACE-OFF
END OF VOTING

1308
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,705
Team Black Spoon
and Team White Spoon

1309
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:06,668
made similar dishes,
as if you had discussed with each other.

1310
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,419
But they tasted completely different.

1311
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,089
The White Spoon chefs highlighted

1312
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:13,633
the texture of the Korean melon

1313
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,343
and also the texture of the squid.

1314
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:20,181
In addition, the aromas
of apples and minari jumped out.

1315
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:25,478
There was a bold punch to the dish.

1316
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,022
Whereas the Black Spoon chefs

1317
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,066
created something more delicate.

1318
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,069
Especially with the blanched squid,

1319
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:36,781
the scoring was so good
that I told Chef Anh it was a work of art

1320
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,533
as soon as I tasted it.

1321
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:39,909
Using the same ingredients,

1322
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:44,330
you tried to really bring out the aroma.

1323
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:48,459
And the other team seems to have
really focused on texture.

1324
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,379
They were very different dishes
but shared some similarities.

1325
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,880
They were both very delicious.

1326
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,883
Now, for this first battle,

1327
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,470
we will reveal the results
of the two judges' votes.

1328
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,098
I'm going to lose it.

1329
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:06,561
First, please reveal the vote

1330
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,479
of Judge Paik Jong-won.

1331
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,691
JUDGE PAIK JONG-WON VOTED
FOR TEAM BLACK SPOON

1332
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,151
-Black Spoon?
-Yes!

1333
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,110
Oh, my gosh!

1334
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,075
I focused on which team brought out

1335
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:24,120
the aroma of the Korean melon
more naturally.

1336
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:27,332
I thought the Black Spoon chefs

1337
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:31,002
blended the aroma of Korean melon
into their dish much more naturally.

1338
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:36,424
Next, please reveal the vote

1339
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,092
of Judge Anh Sung-Jae.

1340
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,930
JUDGE ANH SUNG-JAE VOTED
FOR TEAM BLACK SPOON

1341
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,480
I'm worried.

1342
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,777
I thought there were too many textures

1343
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,613
in Team White Spoon's salad.

1344
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,782
In Team Black Spoon's dish,

1345
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,451
the subtle aromas that arose

1346
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:06,829
really awakened my palate,
and I really enjoyed it.

1347
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,123
We did it. Our subtle flavor.

1348
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:12,126
They recognized
the pure melon flavor we went for.

1349
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,712
We merely lost only two votes.

1350
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,298
We have 98 votes remaining.

1351
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,095
That's the hope I still have.

1352
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,388
Now,

1353
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,849
we will reveal
the votes of the mystery judges.

1354
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,269
Please.

1355
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,021
Gosh, I can't look.

1356
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,692
Please reveal

1357
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,070
the final results.

1358
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,364
I can't wait.

1359
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,415
There are more Black Spoons.
Or not? Is it the same?

1360
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,041
It's about even.

1361
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,801
The current score is

1362
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,554
Team White Spoon with 34

1363
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,472
and Team Black Spoon with 34.

1364
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,266
Goodness.

1365
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,396
The remaining judges

1366
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,065
all voted for either Team Black Spoon

1367
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:20,653
or Team White Spoon.

1368
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:24,240
THE REMAINING 32 SELECTED THE SAME TEAM

1369
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,616
-Oh, my god.
-That big of a gap?

1370
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:28,953
Damn.

1371
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:31,164
It's a 32-vote difference.

1372
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,499
It's 32 votes…

1373
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,709
It's a 32-vote difference?

1374
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,753
FINAL SCORE IS
WHITE SPOONS WIN 66 TO 34

1375
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,839
OR BLACK SPOONS WIN 66 TO 34

1376
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,174
We can't lose this.

1377
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:44,177
Losing this would be a huge blow.

1378
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,680
God, this is a disaster.

1379
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:49,724
Truly a disaster.

1380
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,393
Now, we will reveal the results.

1381
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,066
-Please be White Spoon.
-Black Spoon.

1382
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,780
The result of the first battle is…

1383
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,240
