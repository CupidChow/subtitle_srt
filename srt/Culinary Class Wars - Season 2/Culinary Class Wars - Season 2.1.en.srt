1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,970
Among those who cook,

2
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,139
I bet everyone has seen this show.

3
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,774
Season 1 was so popular.

4
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,568
I regretted not taking part in it.

5
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,945
I'd do well with those things too.

6
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:31,114
I've been waiting
while honing my knife.

7
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,616
The taste this show seeks.

8
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,827
The taste masters are here.

9
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,391
This is it. This one's mine.

10
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,769
Gosh, the ingredients…

11
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,356
In the end, it's for survival.
I need to win, of course.

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,193
I'm better than White Spoon Chef ***.

13
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,111
Do I look like weak competition?

14
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,280
I'm going to upgrade my class.

15
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,617
He's incredibly talented
with two Michelin stars.

16
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,370
If I beat them,
I can get my name out there.

17
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,082
This is Culinary Class Wars.

18
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,917
I need to defend my honor.

19
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:30,006
CULINARY CLASS WARS

20
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,893
BOSS IN THE KITCHEN

21
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,812
WITCH WITH A WOK

22
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,147
CULINARY MONSTER

23
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,873
I was more excited than afraid,

24
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,585
because I came here for the challenge.

25
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,883
FRENCH PAPA

26
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,389
I run a small bistro.

27
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,224
I'm French Papa.

28
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,270
At first, I think I felt
a little insecure about it.

29
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,981
Although I cook French cuisine,

30
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,191
I've never lived or trained in France.

31
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,862
I haven't really accomplished anything.

32
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,030
I just cook at a small bistro.

33
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,116
And I'm not a chef people know about.

34
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,746
But at the very least,
I'm confident in my cooking.

35
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,252
I realized I was doing
French cuisine properly.

36
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,255
Only one thing matters
with food a chef makes.

37
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,799
Is it a dish you'd eat again

38
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,967
or wouldn't eat again?

39
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,303
I plan to go all the way.

40
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,059
FRENCH PAPA
CHEF-OWNER OF BISTROT DE YOUNTVILLE

41
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,480
BLACK SPOON CHEFS
ARE ADDRESSED BY THEIR TITLES

42
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,448
This is amazing.

43
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,491
"Head chef"?

44
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,286
Gosh, this is unreal.

45
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,332
There it is.

46
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,336
I am

47
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,421
Barbecue Lab Director.

48
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:39,010
I run a restaurant that bears my name
in Namyeong-dong.

49
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,096
From day one,

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,475
we've never had a dinner service
that wasn't fully booked.

51
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,729
We've been quite popular.

52
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,484
Last year,
even Pharrell Williams praised our food.

53
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,363
Of all the wood-fired grill restaurants
in Korea,

54
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,864
we're probably the best.

55
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,952
Maybe even globally too.

56
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,039
BARBECUE LAB DIRECTOR
CEO OF IMOK SMOKE DINING

57
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,213
ONLY THE FINAL SURVIVING BLACK SPOON
CAN REVEAL THEIR REAL NAME

58
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,564
DWEJI-GOMTANG IN NY

59
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,691
Dweji-gomtang.

60
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,695
We took the authentically Korean
pork bone soup all the way to New York.

61
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,073
I'm Dweji-Gomtang in NY
from Okdongsik.

62
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,033
It blew up from the start.

63
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,703
We had a thousand people
on our waitlist in New York.

64
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,247
Whether they were
from Europe, Japan, or China,

65
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,623
everyone said it was delicious.

66
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,083
They easily wolfed it down.

67
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,754
We've earned a Michelin Bib Gourmand
every year since we opened.

68
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,674
And in addition
to Paris, Japan, and Hawaii,

69
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,719
we plan to continue expanding globally.

70
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,429
I'm sure we'll keep growing

71
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,306
because it really is delicious.

72
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,768
DWEJI-GOMTANG IN NY
CHEF-OWNER OF OKDONGSIK

73
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,149
I'm Boss in the Kitchen,
with 16 years of experience as a chef.

74
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,735
I've also been on TV a lot.

75
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,363
I was a judge
for the last show I appeared on.

76
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,616
There are plenty
of talented people in Korea.

77
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,494
But I think the competition
will be tougher this season.

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,038
"Dr. Eel."

79
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,125
I'm Fan Master, and I run
an eel rice bowl restaurant in Busan.

80
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,128
In 2024 and 2025,

81
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,714
we earned a Michelin Bib Gourmand,

82
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,258
so we've been welcoming
a lot of customers.

83
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,557
I'm Annyeong Bonjour.

84
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:54,103
I'm Seoul Mother. I run a restaurant
called Superpan in Apgujeong.

85
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,024
I'm Trendsetter. I run an American-style
pasta restaurant called Sam Sam Sam.

86
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,152
I'm Pasta Star.
I specialize in fresh pasta.

87
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,696
I'm Five-star Kimchi Master.

88
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,366
I'm Witch with a Wok.
I have 25 years of experience.

89
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,577
I received the highest score from judges

90
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,329
in the Korea Burger Championship.

91
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,207
My Swedish meatballs
are the best in Korea.

92
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,918
I'm here as an embassy chef.

93
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,796
We come from various fields

94
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,214
and different regions.

95
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,008
It's a real global mix here.

96
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,427
The seats are filling up one by one.

97
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,471
It's finally starting to feel real now.

98
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,432
Now,

99
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,478
there are more filled seats
than empty ones.

100
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,105
There are some big names here.

101
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,731
-I'm a bit worried.
-Yeah.

102
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,068
The thing is, the owners
of really popular restaurants are here.

103
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,321
He's from Heki,

104
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,782
a tonkatsu place in Mangwon-dong
that always has a line.

105
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:51,285
He's from Kiiro,
a tempura place with a year-long waitlist.

106
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,745
Hello.

107
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,913
ART OF DEEP-FRYING

108
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,498
I'm Unattainable Table.

109
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,917
I was introduced
on Sung Si-kyung's channel Grab a Bite,

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,503
so we currently can't take
any more bookings.

111
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,463
I'm even more unattainable now.

112
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,633
I make 1.6 billion won selling
chicken feet at Gwango Traditional Market.

113
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,760
We make around 5 billion won a year.

114
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,138
We're one of the three
best pho restaurants.

115
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,306
Braised butterfish is our signature dish.

116
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,394
Our customers say,
"This is crazy. It's so delicious."

117
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,813
We sell around 1,000 pieces
of katsu and the like.

118
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,648
Our daily sales are around 5 million won.

119
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:22,900
You know Tteoksan?

120
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,652
I know Tteoksan. I love tteokbokki.

121
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,570
Its owner is here.

122
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,863
She's here?

123
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,532
I met two of my customers here.

124
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,950
Honestly, they're the real deal.

125
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,827
They know what people want.

126
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,788
If everyone here starts cooking,

127
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,165
I'd like to taste it all.

128
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,291
-It'd all be tasty.
-Yes.

129
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,668
-They'll all do well.
-Everyone here is a great cook.

130
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,630
There are all kinds of characters here.

131
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,717
I like how diverse the cuisines are.

132
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,927
It's such a wide variety.

133
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,095
That's what makes it fun.

134
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,015
Everyone here is really good
at what they do.

135
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,184
In soccer, this would be the World Cup.

136
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,478
You're a Red Devil.

137
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,812
-Sorry?
-A Korean soccer fan.

138
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,771
Yes, a Red Devil.

139
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,066
I've known Son Heung-min

140
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,193
since he was young.

141
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,861
That's amazing. I'm so jealous.

142
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,572
Some of the best in the industry are here.

143
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,576
I thought, "Gosh, even he's here."

144
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,203
I felt so intimidated.

145
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:19,040
Then, I saw the people coming in,
and I honestly was gasping the whole time.

146
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,635
Oh, my gosh.

147
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,803
Why is he here as a Black Spoon?

148
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,641
-How is Chef Shin Dong-min a Black Spoon?
-Right?

149
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,768
I watched his channel just this morning.

150
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,269
That's insane.

151
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,647
He has years of experience.

152
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,315
He started molecular gastronomy

153
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,193
before anyone else did in Korea.

154
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,196
If this were Season 1, he'd be up there.

155
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,282
There's a lot of famous people
even among the Black Spoons.

156
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,452
Shouldn't you both be White Spoons?

157
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,870
-Not at all.
-You're so famous.

158
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,665
She has a show on EBS, right?

159
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,708
I can't believe Professor Shin is here.

160
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,419
They're all celebrity chefs.

161
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,462
SEOCHON PRINCE

162
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,130
A lot of the Black Spoon chefs

163
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,466
shouldn't be Black Spoon chefs at all.

164
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,343
What was even more impressive was…

165
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,933
I didn't expect him to be here.

166
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,227
I never imagined he'd be a Black Spoon.

167
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,272
"He's really here as a Black Spoon?"

168
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,023
Chef Lee Ha-sung is over there.

169
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,150
What's he doing here?

170
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,486
Shouldn't he be a White Spoon?

171
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,697
I've heard a lot about him.

172
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,951
He's worked for a really long time
at the French Laundry,

173
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,037
a legendary US restaurant
even among other Michelin three-stars.

174
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,748
He's at the top of the game right now.

175
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,001
Damn, I have to win.

176
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,920
Your goal is to win?

177
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,338
I might as well win if I'm here.

178
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,425
I just noticed your title.

179
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,552
It matches with your goal.

180
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,845
CULINARY MONSTER

181
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,680
-The Black Spoons are no joke.
-Seriously.

182
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,973
This is just crazy.

183
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,562
Everyone's so amazing.

184
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:09,358
There were so many people
who shouldn't have been there.

185
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,194
I'm a Pitch Black Spoon in terms of class.
I'm not even a Spoon.

186
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,781
Most people wouldn't even make it
past the door here.

187
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,701
This makes me even more curious
about the White Spoons.

188
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,537
If the Black Spoons are this high-profile,
then the White Spoons…

189
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,372
Maybe the White Spoons
aren't coming today.

190
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,208
-Yeah.
-They came up right about now in Season 1.

191
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,168
It's different.

192
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,462
-They're not here. Right.
-They're not here.

193
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,504
I'm nervous.

194
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:34,175
ALL 80 BLACK SPOONS HAVE ENTERED

195
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,512
It looks like they're coming.

196
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,264
The White Spoons.

197
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,351
-Oh, my gosh!
-Are they coming out now?

198
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,728
I'm dying to know who they are.

199
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,313
-I saw this on TV.
-Gosh.

200
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,565
-Is it different this time?
-What?

201
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,153
-Oh, my god!
-What is that?

202
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,864
My heart's pounding.

203
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,157
It's like The Matrix.

204
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,207
Is this a glass ceiling?

205
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,629
I got goosebumps.

206
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,014
Let's go!

207
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,643
Oh, my god!

208
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,561
This is so cool!

209
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,898
For real?

210
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,156
This is insane.

211
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,953
There's a monk.

212
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,204
I don't believe it!

213
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,332
They're terrifying.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,502
Look at this!

215
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,629
This is so cool.

216
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,265
-Unbelievable.
-This is awesome!

217
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,106
What an honor.

218
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,943
This is crazy.

219
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,111
Incredible!

220
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,822
This lineup is no joke.

221
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,825
It's basically a Michelin fest.

222
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,536
This season is just insane.

223
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,121
This is over the top.

224
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,038
Oh, my god.

225
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,373
This is brutal.

226
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,792
So brutal.

227
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,836
Now introducing

228
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,298
the chefs you will go up against

229
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,467
in Culinary Class Wars.

230
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,053
The epitome of fine dining,

231
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,556
with two Michelin stars,

232
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,433
Lee Jun.

233
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,894
LEE JUN
CHEF-OWNER OF SOIGNÉ

234
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,228
Wow, a two-star chef!

235
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,730
This is too much.

236
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,735
There are currently only nine restaurants
in Korea with two Michelin stars.

237
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,237
They don't just give out
two stars to anyone.

238
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:05,826
You could say he was the first
to bring bar-style restaurants into Korea.

239
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,622
He's been a trailblazer
in the Korean fine dining scene.

240
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,875
I couldn't believe
a Michelin two-star chef was here.

241
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,544
The only chef in Korea

242
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:20,174
with a Michelin star
in both Western and Korean cuisines,

243
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,967
Son Jong-won.

244
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,807
The chef I truly admire

245
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,185
received a Michelin star
for both of his restaurants.

246
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,189
L'Amant Secret is
a completely Western restaurant.

247
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,150
And Eatanic Garden is totally different.
It's a Korean restaurant.

248
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:43,072
The fact that he runs
two Michelin one-star restaurants

249
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,866
makes me think he truly is a genius chef.

250
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,244
A Michelin one-star

251
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,579
Korean fine dining chef,

252
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,373
Kim Hee-eun.

253
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,543
KIM HEE-EUN
CHEF-OWNER OF SOUL

254
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,920
It's not easy for a young chef

255
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,922
to maintain a Michelin star.

256
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,966
I think she's a chef who creates dishes

257
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,218
that are filled with
a lot of originality and soul.

258
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,264
Two-time Michelin-star winner in New York,

259
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,474
Shim Sung-chul.

260
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,142
CHEF-OWNER OF KOCHI AND MARI

261
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,520
A master of contemporary Japanese cuisine,

262
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:15,938
Kim Geon.

263
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,690
KIM GEON
CHEF-OWNER OF GORYORI KEN

264
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,358
It's literally a battle of the stars.

265
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,070
CHOI YU-GANG, KIM SUNG-WOON

266
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,364
There were so many Michelin-star chefs.

267
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,658
It's beyond comparison to Season 1.

268
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,579
I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't intimidated.

269
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,790
Winner of Korean Food War,

270
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,625
Im Seong-keun.

271
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,586
It's Chef Im Seong-keun.

272
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,256
He was the winner.

273
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,300
He's already won a competition.

274
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,929
Winner of MasterChef Sweden,
Jennie Walldèn.

275
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,432
JENNIE WALLDÈN
WINNER OF MASTERCHEF SWEDEN

276
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,643
She has a fierce presence.

277
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,062
She won in another competition show.

278
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,189
I thought it would give her an edge.

279
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,611
A judge on MasterChef Korea,
Song Hoon.

280
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,987
JUDGE ON MASTERCHEF KOREA

281
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,240
He should've been here as a judge.

282
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,785
He's a chef loved by the nation.

283
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,703
JUNG HO-YOUNG

284
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,204
Chef Raymon Kim.

285
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,999
I didn't think he'd be
on a show like this.

286
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,418
I remember the best meal I've ever had

287
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,337
was at Chef Sam Kim's restaurant.

288
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,175
Chef to the President for 20 years,

289
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:30,471
Executive Chef of the Blue House,
Chun Sang-hyun.

290
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,517
He's cooked for several presidents
at the Blue House.

291
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,311
He's someone who belongs here.

292
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,063
Korea's first

293
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:44,109
female executive chef at a luxury hotel,
Lee Keum-hee.

294
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,946
She's someone I truly respect.

295
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,407
In terms of skill,
Chef Lee is the one I fear the most.

296
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,160
I can't believe Chef Park Hyo-nam is here.

297
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,622
A first-generation
French cuisine chef in Korea

298
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,291
and the tenth Korean Master Hand,

299
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,169
Park Hyo-nam.

300
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,421
He's a legend.

301
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,632
He's a chef's chef.

302
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,301
They're all people
I've read about in textbooks.

303
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,638
He was a role model for people who cook.

304
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,650
Oh, my gosh.

305
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,237
Korea's first Master of Temple Cuisine,

306
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,616
Venerable Sunjae.

307
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,577
VENERABLE SUNJAE
KOREA'S FIRST MASTER OF TEMPLE CUISINE

308
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,958
-This is absolutely incredible.
-Unbelievable.

309
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,878
She's the best in Korea
in terms of temple cuisine.

310
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,797
Not just in Korea,

311
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,134
but even globally,
if you mention their names,

312
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,219
these people would be recognized.

313
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,057
It felt as if the White Spoon chefs
became Black Spoons

314
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,685
and she was
the one true White Spoon chef.

315
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,445
A legend of Chinese cuisine in Korea

316
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,867
and the master of Chinese cuisine
for 57 years,

317
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,957
Hou Deok-juk.

318
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,169
HOU DEOK-JUK
EXECUTIVE CHEF OF HAOBIN

319
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,466
What on earth is he doing here?

320
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,925
He's a Chinese cuisine god.

321
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,889
It felt like someone was banging
a gong inside my chest.

322
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,390
Master Hou Deok-juk

323
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,351
is a legend of Korea's Chinese cuisine.

324
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,104
Seriously, a legendary figure
is here with us today.

325
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,939
This is on a whole different level.

326
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,235
It's like they didn't consider a Season 3
when casting for this season.

327
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,238
This isn't a battle
between White and Black Spoons.

328
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,033
A fierce battle between Black Spoons
and Diamond Spoons

329
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,410
is about to happen.

330
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,040
And with this,

331
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,583
we conclude the introductions

332
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,629
of the 18 White Spoon chefs
who will compete with you.

333
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,090
It's 18 chefs?

334
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,883
Isn't it supposed to be 20?

335
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,927
-Really? You're right.
-Two are missing.

336
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,013
There and over there.

337
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,140
It's supposed to be 20.

338
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,600
Well, we're short two.

339
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,977
Why is it only 18?

340
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,312
I thought something was off.

341
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,440
Because I knew Season 1
had 20 White Spoon chefs.

342
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:29,942
We're not at 100.

343
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,819
"What's going on?"

344
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,654
I was sure they'd have up to 100 chefs.

345
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,867
The contestants of Culinary Class Wars

346
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,036
will now split into two classes,

347
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,622
Black Spoons and White Spoons,

348
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,542
to engage in culinary class wars.

349
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,087
The 80 Black Spoon chefs will go through

350
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,880
the Black Spoon Elimination Round

351
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,425
until the number of survivors match
the number of White Spoon chefs.

352
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,221
Only those who survive this battle

353
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,307
will be qualified
to challenge the White Spoons.

354
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,854
Basically, only 18 out of 80 will survive.

355
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,605
That won't be easy.

356
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,566
They thought even 20 was too many

357
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,067
and cut it down to 18?

358
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,697
Only the sole survivor

359
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,448
who stands alone at the very end

360
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,661
will win a prize of 300 million won.

361
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,164
The ones who are meant to advance
will advance anyway.

362
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,833
I came here with the goal of winning,

363
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,294
so whether it's 18 or 20,

364
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,962
starting with fewer would be better.

365
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,590
This makes it more intense.

366
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,925
Let's have a good battle.

367
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,974
But why

368
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,226
is it 18 people instead of 20?

369
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,946
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

370
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,286
Let's do this!

371
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,372
It's as big as a stadium.

372
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,708
This is amazing!

373
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,501
This is next-level stuff.

374
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,379
I feel like a soccer player.

375
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,256
Unbelievable.

376
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,307
I'm finally getting to see this.

377
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,516
Finally.

378
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,310
Wow, this is so cool!

379
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,646
Oh, my god.

380
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,605
It's huge.

381
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,565
It's really well put together.

382
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,067
It's a super modern kitchen.

383
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,528
Can we just take any station?

384
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,616
I'd only seen this kitchen
through a screen while watching Season 1.

385
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,785
Just to see it in person
was exciting enough.

386
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,580
It was so much grander
and more detailed than I thought.

387
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,207
It must've cost a fortune.

388
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,835
Look, there aren't even any sponges.

389
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,254
The White Spoons are here.

390
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,171
Oh, god.

391
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,423
Just like that…

392
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,384
What on earth?

393
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,346
This is incredible.

394
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,764
It really is.

395
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,732
I guess the chefs will watch us
from up there.

396
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,817
Looking down on us.

397
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,278
They're probably thinking,
"Those pathetic fools."

398
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,195
Right?

399
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,323
I'm a CEO as well,

400
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,200
and I also run a successful restaurant.

401
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,536
I've never had anyone
look down on me like that.

402
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:32,833
The mood there was quite tense,
and it made me more nervous.

403
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,672
Now, this is where the Black Spoon
Elimination Round will take place.

404
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,465
The Main Kitchen.

405
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,218
It is time

406
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,637
to introduce to you

407
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,682
the judges who will taste your dishes.

408
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,901
-Oh, my gosh.
-Looking good!

409
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,664
The Judges
of Culinary Class Wars Season 2.

410
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,291
Paik Jong-won.

411
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,584
JUDGE
PAIK JONG-WON

412
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,501
And…

413
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,086
Anh Sung-jae.

414
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,254
JUDGE
ANH SUNG-JAE

415
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,926
You're amazing!

416
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,511
Their presence was

417
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,638
so much more overwhelming in person.

418
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,141
I'd like Mr. Paik to be my judge.

419
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,602
He does casual, everyday food,

420
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,437
and that's what I make too.

421
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,773
He's an expert on taste.

422
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,734
He's like a walking food encyclopedia.

423
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,986
He's both knowledgeable and experienced.

424
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,573
He's had experience
with all kinds of ingredients.

425
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,742
He'll be fair about taste.

426
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,452
Hello, I'm Paik Jong-won.

427
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,703
Once again,

428
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:56,458
I'm very excited to see
just how many hidden masters we'll find.

429
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,088
Chef Anh Sung-jae is

430
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,632
someone who's strict and precise.

431
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,926
He's someone who has clear standards.

432
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,513
It's not evenly cooked.

433
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,557
To me, the most important factor
is how well the vegetables are cooked.

434
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,643
I want to say
they're cooked very nicely here.

435
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,603
He's well-known even in the US

436
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,814
as someone who's obsessed with cooking.

437
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,608
He's steadfast, honest, and perceptive.

438
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,360
He's the best in Korea.

439
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,655
He's like what every chef
dreams of becoming.

440
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,408
The chefs have changed,
and the dishes will change.

441
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,244
So, I should also

442
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,287
center myself

443
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,331
and be prepared to understand

444
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,208
their intentions.

445
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,626
The time has come.

446
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,962
I don't know who will be my judge,

447
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,171
but I want to do well.

448
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,132
Now,

449
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,800
we will reveal the theme

450
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:50,095
for the Black Spoon Elimination Round.

451
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,933
The theme
for the Black Spoon Elimination Round is

452
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,646
"The best dish you can cook."

453
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,607
The 80 Black Spoons

454
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:07,028
will be divided
into two groups of 40 to cook.

455
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,032
The time limit is 100 minutes.

456
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,326
If a dish is finished
before the time runs out,

457
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,204
it may be judged first.

458
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,543
The number of Black Spoon survivors
will match the number of White Spoons.

459
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,671
Once all the survivors have been decided,

460
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:28,175
the Black Spoon
Elimination Round will end.

461
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,012
If the survivors' table is not full

462
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,681
by the time all dishes have been tasted,

463
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:40,145
the deferred contestants
will have the chance to survive.

464
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,197
Goodness.

465
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,950
What is that?

466
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:54,868
Is something coming?

467
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,082
We suddenly heard a loud sound.

468
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,417
There was something more.

469
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,003
I knew it wouldn't be
the same as Season 1.

470
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,297
What was that sound?

471
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,215
What was that?

472
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,761
Before we begin the battle,

473
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,513
this season's
Black Spoon Elimination Round

474
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,059
has a new rule.

475
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,396
What's going on?

476
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,232
There must be something more.

477
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,358
-What?
-What is it?

478
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,443
What is it now?

479
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,361
What is it?

480
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,364
What's going on?

481
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,409
What on earth?

482
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,161
The floor's opening up.

483
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,829
What is that?

484
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,290
Of course, they'd change things up.

485
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,668
What is it?

486
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,046
The stage split apart
and pits appeared.

487
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,298
I thought,
"Do we fall in there if we're eliminated?"

488
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,718
I guess we'll disappear
into a fiery pit or something.

489
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,303
Wow, that's insane.

490
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,098
That looks scary.

491
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,017
This is crazy.

492
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,402
What on earth?

493
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,320
What's going on?

494
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,446
This is wild.

495
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,031
Unbelievable.

496
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,119
What in the world?

497
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,747
What's happening?

498
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,332
I was very shocked.

499
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,710
I'm sure most of us had no idea

500
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,129
that things would change
starting from the first round.

501
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,006
-What on earth?
-Are those stations?

502
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,590
-They're stations.
-They are.

503
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,094
Then, doesn't that make it 42?

504
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,556
-Are the White Spoons coming down here?
-Then…

505
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,516
But there were only 18 of them.

506
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,685
The other two are there.

507
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,437
Additional chefs are coming.

508
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,064
This season,

509
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,401
the new rule
in the Black Spoon Elimination Round is…

510
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,946
the Hidden White Spoons.

511
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:58,950
What?

512
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,245
-What? Will there be a death match?
-What?

513
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,457
I thought, "Are they choosing two
of the 80 Black Spoons

514
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,709
and moving them up to be White Spoons?"

515
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,003
There are 40 and 40, so…
They're back there.

516
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,463
Oh, my god!

517
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,214
-There are two more.
-Two more are here.

518
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,215
What on earth?

519
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,384
Oh, my god!

520
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,094
What's happening?

521
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,680
There were two chefs missing.

522
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,182
I knew there would be something,

523
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,100
but I never imagined it'd be this.

524
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,518
I stared hard like this.

525
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,105
What's going on?

526
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,482
What is it?

527
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,867
The new rule
in the Black Spoon Elimination Round is

528
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,535
the Hidden White Spoons.

529
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,454
Hidden White Spoons?

530
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,456
-Chef Kim Do-yun?
-Chef Kim Do-yun.

531
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,707
And Chef Choi Kang-rok.

532
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,127
It's Chef Choi Kang-rok
and Chef Kim Do-yun.

533
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,589
They're the Hidden White Spoons.

534
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,933
There are only 18 of us
because of those two.

535
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,561
It is time to introduce
the two Hidden White Spoons.

536
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,231
The winner of MasterChef Korea,

537
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,525
Choi Kang-rok.

538
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:17,654
CHOI KANG-ROK
WINNER OF MASTERCHEF KOREA SEASON 2

539
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,657
I know him as the master
of braised dishes.

540
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,119
He makes dishes
that never fail to taste good.

541
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,996
He's known for that famous quote.

542
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,165
"Hey, it's me. Perilla oil."

543
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,126
I never imagined he'd be back.

544
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,962
He's the type to wait it out
while the iron is hot.

545
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,672
Hello.

546
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,175
I'm Choi Kang-rok.

547
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,972
They say if you do nothing,
nothing will happen.

548
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,683
And it did seem like nothing would happen,

549
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,727
so I decided to come back.

550
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,937
Hey, it's me. Second try.

551
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:58,695
Chef-owner of a Michelin one-star
Korean restaurant,

552
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,363
Kim Do-yun.

553
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,199
KIM DO-YUN
CHEF-OWNER OF YUN SEOUL

554
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,701
Chef Kim Do-yun

555
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:08,747
is really serious
and has a clear philosophy about cooking.

556
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,290
He's really unique.

557
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,084
He has that special aura about him.

558
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,419
I'm Chef Kim Do-yun.

559
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,088
I approached Season 1 like it was a game.

560
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,006
However,

561
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,425
this time,

562
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,843
I came with determination.

563
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,512
I'm going to go for the win.

564
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,517
The two Hidden White Spoons standing here

565
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,187
will participate with you

566
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,023
in the first-round culinary battle.

567
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,193
What?

568
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,279
-Oh, come on.
-We have more competition now.

569
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,822
There are more competitors then.

570
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,740
Here?

571
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,534
It must be over there.

572
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,828
Just like the Black Spoon chefs,

573
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:53,750
the Hidden White Spoons
must present their best dishes.

574
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,294
If they survive, they move on to Round 2.

575
00:29:56,377 --> 00:30:00,757
If they're eliminated,
they will not make it to the next round.

576
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,676
That must be a lot of pressure.

577
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,637
They're basically Black Spoons.

578
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,556
They're competing in Round 1 with them?

579
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,308
-It seems so.
-Together with them.

580
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,393
They came here despite that risk?

581
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,106
Also, the Hidden White Spoons

582
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,650
will be subject to

583
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,612
a hidden judging criteria
that is different from the Black Spoons.

584
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,783
The Hidden White Spoons

585
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,953
will be judged by both judges,

586
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,747
Paik Jong-won and Anh Sung-jae.

587
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,875
Both judges

588
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,711
must approve their dishes

589
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,172
in order to advance to Round 2.

590
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,842
That is tough.

591
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,803
That's harsh.

592
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,264
That's a huge disadvantage.

593
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,181
That'll be hard.

594
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,599
Both judges have to approve.

595
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,767
That's so tough.

596
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,227
They're both so different.

597
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,354
That means

598
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,898
you have to persuade both judges.

599
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,526
To be honest, the Hidden White Spoons

600
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,862
seem to be in a tier
lower than the Black Spoons.

601
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,739
It won't be easy, but…

602
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,034
They're not the kind of people
to come out here and get embarrassed.

603
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,661
I think things should've been harder.

604
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,454
It should be much harsher.

605
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,916
I thought this rule was good to have.

606
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,461
So that this second try

607
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,590
doesn't feel all too sweet.

608
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,177
There is also one more important rule.

609
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,598
Depending on the survival

610
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,600
of the two Hidden White Spoons,

611
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,519
the number of Black Spoon survivors

612
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,148
will change in real time.

613
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,695
The current number
of possible Black Spoon survivors

614
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,489
is 18 people.

615
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,286
If one Hidden White Spoon chef survives,

616
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,080
an additional Black Spoon chef
will survive this round.

617
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,666
If both Hidden White Spoon chefs survive,

618
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,045
two additional Black Spoon chefs
will survive this round.

619
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,171
As such,

620
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,965
depending on the results
of the Hidden White Spoons,

621
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:10,553
up to 20 Black Spoon chefs may survive.

622
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,141
So if they pass this round,
20 of us will be chosen.

623
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,226
They need to advance.

624
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,686
-Then, two more can survive.
-Yes.

625
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,313
-Please.
-They're on our side.

626
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,731
-Please.
-Please.

627
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,232
I'm suddenly rooting for them.

628
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,609
They were allies, not enemies.

629
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,195
I found myself cheering them on.

630
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,321
They just have to win.

631
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,489
They need to advance

632
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,616
so two more
of the Black Spoons can advance.

633
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,784
Personally,

634
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,661
I want them both to be eliminated.

635
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,748
Then, only 36 people will
compete in the next round.

636
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,542
If we're eliminated,

637
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,588
then the Black Spoon chefs
can't advance either.

638
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,881
So, it was a lot of pressure.

639
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,219
I'm going to do my best
so this beginning doesn't become the end.

640
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,545
Are you ready?

641
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,796
-Yes!
-Yes!

642
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,554
Then, in that case,

643
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,098
the Black Spoon Elimination Round

644
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,851
begins now.

645
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,103
Let's go!

646
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,481
-Let's go!
-Good luck!

647
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,818
You can do it, Choi Kang-rok!

648
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,739
So it finally begins.

649
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,167
I absolutely must pass this round.

650
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,752
If I'm eliminated in the first round,

651
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,463
I even thought about
perhaps giving up cooking.

652
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,965
I'm not confident. About losing.

653
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,805
I'm dying to know what they'll make.

654
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,808
That's naengmyeon, right?

655
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,560
He's making cold noodles?

656
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,146
Can you make the broth
in such a short time?

657
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,774
"How is this possible
in that amount of time?"

658
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,318
That's what I want to hear.

659
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,737
He's here too. The tempura chef.

660
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,198
Isn't he the master of tempura?

661
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,659
I want to show
every technique there is to deep-frying.

662
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,746
They say he's the best in Korea
when it comes to eel.

663
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,836
I was awarded the first
Korean Master Hand in tteokbokki.

664
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,296
In terms of offal dishes,

665
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,715
I can confidently say
we're the best in the world.

666
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,510
I once made a name for myself in Korea
for hand-pulled noodles.

667
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,512
They're all masters at what they do.

668
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,057
He's the king of barbecue. That's him.

669
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,683
-He's here?
-Yeah.

670
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,852
She's making kimchi.

671
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,898
There's a famous tonkatsu place.

672
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,525
He must be from there.

673
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,277
I think they're all diving into
what they do best.

674
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,988
They're all masters of those foods.

675
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,907
They're not Black Spoons.

676
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,456
He's going to prepare
pufferfish right here.

677
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,460
I'm going to bring out
the unique texture of the flesh

678
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,630
you can only get from live pufferfish
in the dish I present.

679
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,465
He prepped that in just three minutes.

680
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,261
If he advances, we're in trouble.

681
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,473
That guy is a real culinary genius.

682
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,476
There were a lot of big names
in the industry present.

683
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,936
She's a really famous chef.

684
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,479
I see.

685
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,981
-Where?
-Chinese cuisine.

686
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,357
The motorcycle-riding professor.

687
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,360
He's too skilled to be down there.

688
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,238
He should've been a White Spoon.
What's he doing there?

689
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,115
Why were they down there?

690
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,535
Their techniques are unreal.

691
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,663
They've really honed
their knives for this.

692
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,251
That requires a lot of skill.

693
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,796
There isn't anyone here who's not famous.

694
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,339
They all are.

695
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,925
That chef should be up here.

696
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,303
Culinary Innovator should be here.

697
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,097
Chef Shin Dong-min is famous.

698
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,849
-Isn't that Chef Shin Dong-min?
-It is.

699
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,851
What's he doing down there?

700
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,145
He could've easily been a White Spoon.

701
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,355
I've been a fan of his since I was young.

702
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,065
But seriously,

703
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,651
he doesn't belong down there.

704
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,154
CULINARY INNOVATOR
JAPANESE CUISINE CHEF OF 25 YEARS

705
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,573
Practically everyone
in the industry knows him.

706
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,074
He's a highly-skilled chef.

707
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,786
I could see why he chose the title
"Culinary Innovator."

708
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,413
He really is an innovator.

709
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,082
In 2006, I first introduced

710
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,459
molecular gastronomy into Korea.

711
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,879
Molecular gastronomy

712
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,965
is about analyzing textures
and flavors scientifically

713
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,010
to transform them into something new.

714
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,596
I applied to be a Black Spoon on purpose.

715
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,348
I get to cook dishes I want to make.

716
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,271
I can't wait for his dish.

717
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,648
-Chef Shin Dong-min?
-Yes.

718
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,941
-Hello, Chef.
-Hello.

719
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,360
The innovator.

720
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,444
Culinary Innovator.

721
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,572
I plan to extract
all kinds of flavors with just apples.

722
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,241
With just apples?

723
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,951
-With only one ingredient?
-That's right.

724
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,160
Apples?

725
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,703
He must be making that dish.

726
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,498
I think he's going to make
his signature apple dessert.

727
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,291
-Apple dessert?
-Yes.

728
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,127
It's one of the first dishes I created

729
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,837
using molecular cooking in 2006.

730
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,464
-It's been 19 years now.
-Yes.

731
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,174
-So I upgraded that.
-Right.

732
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,884
Could I taste the apples a bit?

733
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:42,802
Of course.

734
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:44,929
It's a Fuji apple.

735
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,430
-Fuji?
-Yes.

736
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,104
-It's good.
-Yes.

737
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,606
There's only one ingredient,
so I'm eager to see

738
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,942
how things will change
from what I just tasted.

739
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,318
Yes. Please look forward to it.

740
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,611
-I will. Good luck.
-Thank you.

741
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,991
My first successful dish
using molecular cooking

742
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,076
was the "-196°C Apple."

743
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,745
When people first see it,
they think, "How did he make this?"

744
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,836
It's finally coming together.

745
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,756
The apple is made from sugar art.

746
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,636
He has to make a shape
of an apple out of that?

747
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,432
How do you make the shape with that?

748
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,435
He must've done this thousands of times.

749
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,253
It looks beautiful when you see it.

750
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,506
Then, I put apple ice cream powder inside.

751
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,509
After slicing the apples first,

752
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,677
I sauté them in butter.

753
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,512
Then, I blend that

754
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,182
and add nitrogen to turn it into a foam.

755
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,726
I put that into liquid nitrogen
to freeze it.

756
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,023
When you do that, it freezes everything.

757
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,566
Then, he'll grind it down again.

758
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,530
He made this apple dessert 20 years ago.

759
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,074
-It's incredible.
-20 years ago?

760
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,284
He's the best in Korea.

761
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,327
Exactly.

762
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,794
The visuals, temperatures, and tastes.

763
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,047
I'll do my best to bring out
as much as possible from one dish.

764
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,681
So that's how it becomes an apple.

765
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,603
I think the apple dish is ready.

766
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,063
-The apple dish?
-Yes.

767
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,899
We need to listen in on the feedback.

768
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,610
-Yes, of course.
-We can see what he likes and dislikes.

769
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,488
I wonder how it'll go.
I can't wait to see.

770
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,740
I'm dying to know.

771
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,160
This is the "-196°C Apple."

772
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,872
THE TASTE, WARMTH, AND AROMA
OF THE -196°C APPLE

773
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,457
It's a molecular gastronomy dish

774
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,711
that shows you can create
exquisite flavors with just apples.

775
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,215
To taste it, take this spoon first.

776
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,591
-This one? Okay.
-Take it.

777
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,843
And use that to crack it.

778
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,760
From the side.

779
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,724
Unbelievable.

780
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,767
That looks so cool.

781
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,228
-Okay.
-What was inside this?

782
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,813
Apples.

783
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,772
These are apples?

784
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,566
Yes, I cooked them in unsalted butter

785
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,819
and mixed them with apple juice

786
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,320
to make ice cream.

787
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,032
When you top it with hot apple jam,

788
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,243
you can also enjoy this dessert warm.

789
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,120
-I see.
-Yes.

790
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,832
For the jelly, I used the flesh and peel
to bring out the aroma.

791
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,749
Right.

792
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,064
So, 19 years ago…
Right? It was 19 years ago?

793
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,274
Yes, in 2006.

794
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,609
In 2006.

795
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:30,738
This molecular cooking style

796
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,491
was quite popular during the early 2000s.

797
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:39,079
I also worked really hard to study
and learn about molecular cooking.

798
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,040
There was a time
when I was really into it.

799
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,082
Right.

800
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,502
A lot of time has passed now,

801
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,004
and what you wanted to show

802
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,715
was something technical and new.

803
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,675
But this liquid nitrogen technique

804
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,719
and isomalt technique…

805
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,890
-They're old techniques now.
-Right.

806
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,808
They're very old techniques,

807
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,520
and they remind me of things

808
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,939
that I cooked 20 years ago.

809
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,776
So, Culinary Innovator,
you're eliminated.

810
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,319
All right, thank you.

811
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,036
Culinary Innovator has been eliminated.

812
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,916
If Chef Shin Dong-min was eliminated…

813
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,003
We're in big trouble then.

814
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,296
This is bad.

815
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,305
So that's the exit.

816
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,227
-This is so cruel.
-That could easily be me.

817
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,437
He's an icon of our generation.

818
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,108
CULINARY INNOVATOR

819
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,485
Basically, it was a bit dated.

820
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,655
The White Spoon chefs upstairs
are all people I know,

821
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,825
and I thought, "I'll advance quickly
and battle it out with them."

822
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,952
So, it's a bit disappointing.

823
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,996
That raw apple tasted the best.

824
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,666
There wasn't much change
from very outdated techniques,

825
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,793
and it didn't make
much of an impression on me.

826
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,712
Let's go, Lee Jae-hun.

827
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,841
He's the Seochon Prince.

828
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,342
He runs so many places in Seochon.

829
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:19,054
And we've been on TV together a lot too.

830
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,140
Chef Nam Sung-youl, good luck!

831
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,311
That guy is good.

832
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,354
I didn't expect him to be here,

833
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,272
but here he is.

834
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,607
They should really be up here.

835
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,191
-I know.
-Why are they down there?

836
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,404
I made cannelloni.

837
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,198
For the filling, I used cod and potato.

838
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,337
Within the allotted 100 minutes,

839
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,381
I wanted to make kimchi
that was undeniably delicious.

840
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,467
I prepared clam bossam kimchi.

841
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,515
The kimchi should enter your mouth first.

842
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,727
-So the kimchi touches my tongue first?
-Yes, that's right.

843
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,533
In this dish…

844
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:28,165
The flavors don't really come together.

845
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,292
That's what I tasted.

846
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,460
Seochon Prince,

847
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,337
you're eliminated.

848
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,381
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

849
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,885
Seochon Prince has been eliminated.

850
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,863
I believe you gave me
the most delicious bite.

851
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,657
The chef who made it would know best.

852
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,451
I chewed for a good while.

853
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,495
It was a bit rubbery.

854
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,831
I think it was the clam.

855
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,959
It stayed far too long in my mouth,
and chewing it was a challenge.

856
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,420
Golden Hands, you're eliminated.

857
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,380
Golden Hands…

858
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,840
-Thank you.
-…has been eliminated.

859
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:21,009
He's cold and ruthless.

860
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,220
-It should go down smoothly.
-He's scary.

861
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,471
It can't be salty.

862
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,515
It can't be predictable.

863
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:27,808
And it must have intent.

864
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,435
You're like a judge.

865
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,478
I'm analyzing.

866
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,897
We need to be tactical about this.

867
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,108
Exactly.

868
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,403
-Mr. Paik Jong-won focuses on taste.
-Right.

869
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,583
-This side?
-Yes.

870
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,302
That was satisfying to watch.

871
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,304
BURGER CHAMPION
OWNER OF RABBIT HOLE BURGER

872
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,807
MUSHROOM GARDEN BURGER

873
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,896
What a hearty bite.

874
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,690
What a hearty bite.

875
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,775
Why are you so amazed over me eating?

876
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:21,737
Seriously.

877
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,532
Right now,

878
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,951
from the first bite to when I swallowed,

879
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,871
the mushrooms were all over the place.

880
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,873
The deep-fried mushrooms
and braised mushrooms.

881
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,416
I think there was too much mushroom.

882
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,668
Burger Champion,
I'm afraid you're eliminated.

883
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,425
-Isn't it hot?
-It's hot.

884
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,220
PITCHSIDE CHEF

885
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,597
GOLDEN BAEKSUK (POACHED CHICKEN)

886
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,350
It's just a clear chicken soup.

887
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,019
-I'm afraid you're eliminated.
-Thank you.

888
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,270
PITCHSIDE CHEF ELIMINATED

889
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,732
He tastes everything so sincerely.

890
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,817
That's really admirable as a judge.

891
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,246
FRESH HAM BUDAE-JJIGAE

892
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,664
The sausage is delicious.

893
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,249
MASTER OF LINKS

894
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,084
Why is it so sweet?

895
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,168
Is it the green onions?

896
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,795
Yes, a lot of green onions and onions…

897
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,756
They don't go well with this stew.

898
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:23,924
-You're eliminated.
-Okay.

899
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,385
MASTER OF LINKS ELIMINATED

900
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,638
The broth of your galnaktang
is a little bitter.

901
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,764
CHEF ON HIGHWAY ELIMINATED

902
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,641
It's a bit unpleasantly gamey.

903
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,226
MUST-TRY TONKATSU ELIMINATED

904
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,603
The caramel note
in the sauce is a little strong.

905
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,854
TEPPAN CHAMP ELIMINATED

906
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,231
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

907
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:42,192
When it comes to judging taste,
he has clear standards.

908
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,362
Those two judges are the real deal.

909
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,031
The way they taste the dishes
and give feedback

910
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,116
is intense.

911
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,493
What do I need to do?

912
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,161
The sauce.

913
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:55,831
Are things going okay?

914
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,792
Yes! My mind just went blank for a bit.

915
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,128
What do I do?

916
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,380
Oh, my gosh. So many people have left.

917
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:04,881
What?

918
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,259
It felt like my death was looming closer.

919
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,803
If I'm eliminated,
I want to go out with honor.

920
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,056
I'm not someone
who really does things like this.

921
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,225
I'm not a CEO

922
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,728
nor am I a professionally trained chef.

923
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,646
So I thought about
how should I define myself.

924
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:24,192
BREWMASTER YUN

925
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,862
YUNJUDANG

926
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,199
BREWMASTER YUN
OWNER OF HAEBANGCHON YUNJUDANG

927
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,660
I've been brewing alcohol
for over ten years.

928
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,205
I also cook Korean dishes to go with it.

929
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,627
Even the non-Korean customers
call me "jumo."

930
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:46,840
I'm here to show everyone
what it means to be a Korean barkeep.

931
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,803
SOJU STILL

932
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,730
I brought this soju still today

933
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,607
to treat them to the finest liquor.

934
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,317
TRADITIONAL STILL
FOR DISTILLING SOJU

935
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,361
I'm going to distill it in real time.

936
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,071
You won't see it anywhere else.

937
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,282
I'm going to distill
the clear liquid part of makgeolli.

938
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,327
It turns into soju with a beautiful aroma.

939
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,668
You boil the liquid
and make the vapor rise.

940
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,128
She sealed the sides with dough
so that nothing leaks out.

941
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,089
And since it's cold at the top,

942
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,050
the liquor condenses, collects,
and flows down through the spout.

943
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,259
That's amazing.

944
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,981
You can't have a feast
without pyeonyuk or head cheese.

945
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,734
So a Korean tavern
must have boiled pork as suyuk.

946
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,448
I put makgeolli into the suyuk as well.

947
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,784
But I added only the clear liquid part.

948
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,035
That's my special ingredient.

949
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,665
The rich fruit notes
from the liquor I personally brew

950
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,917
is absorbed right into the meat.

951
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:08,922
Gosh, where did it go?

952
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,174
Where did the pork cheeks go?

953
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,301
For goodness' sake…

954
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:17,848
What are you…

955
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,850
Sorry, you just kept looking at something.

956
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,351
I need to fish out the pork cheek.

957
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,937
-Pork cheek?
-I put it in but can't find it.

958
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,147
It's hiding.

959
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,149
It's so heartless.

960
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,026
I wanted to stagger the time
it spends in the broth.

961
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,862
-Right.
-Yeah, that's what I was doing.

962
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,613
-Such a delicate process.
-Yes.

963
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,323
-I found it.
-Okay, you got it.

964
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,911
Chef Anh Sung-jae appeared
with a "tudum."

965
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,706
It was like a sound effect.
"Tudum" and he was there.

966
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,207
Even if he just stood there

967
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,418
without asking any questions,

968
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,421
I would've been nervous,
but he did ask a question.

969
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,631
I'm not cut out for competitions.

970
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,967
I get, like… really shaky.

971
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:04,144
But I came here
because I'm confident in what I can do.

972
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,146
And this is something only I can do.

973
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,536
I really want to know
how that soju tastes.

974
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,080
-Jumo.
-Yes?

975
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,707
Did it turn out well?

976
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,544
Yes, I think it turned out
the way I wanted.

977
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,837
JUMO'S SPREAD

978
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,172
This is Jumo's Spread.

979
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,089
-Jumo's Spread?
-Yes.

980
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,634
It's to serve the best meal
you can offer at a tavern.

981
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,135
I distilled soju

982
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:40,222
and made zucchini jjigae
with salted shrimp.

983
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,807
I also made suyuk.

984
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,518
-I prepared three cuts of the head cheese.
-Yes.

985
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,479
-How should I eat this?
-Okay, first…

986
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,480
The pork cheek.

987
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:51,483
-The cheek from earlier.
-Add a little bit of salted shrimp on top.

988
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,568
Yes. They're peak-season shrimp.

989
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:08,041
That one has a nice and chewy texture,
so dip it in the plum soy sauce.

990
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,095
Then, if you eat the rice
and have a drink of soju,

991
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,721
the flavors should be perfect.

992
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,229
That fruity aroma of makgeolli.

993
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,480
-It's still there.
-Yes.

994
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:42,576
The best tasting food paired with alcohol

995
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,911
-isn't about the meat being the main dish.
-Right.

996
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,163
-Nor is it about the rice.
-Right.

997
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,165
I think it's about the chef's touch.

998
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,334
-They have that special touch.
-Yes.

999
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,837
So even just a side dish
can complement the alcohol.

1000
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,424
-Yes, that's right.
-It's delicious food with that touch.

1001
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,556
Brewmaster Yun,

1002
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,391
you've survived.

1003
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,393
-Congratulations.
-What?

1004
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,529
-Brewmaster Yun survives.
-Thank you.

1005
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,072
No way!

1006
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,532
BREWMASTER YUN SURVIVES

1007
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,575
Thank you!

1008
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,659
Thank you so much, Chef!

1009
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,328
-I didn't even expect this.
-Well…

1010
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,287
I never imagined…

1011
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,830
They complement each other so well.

1012
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,333
-And everything tasted great.
-Thank you.

1013
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,502
That's how food with alcohol
should be made. It was so good.

1014
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,007
-Congratulations. My goodness.
-Thank you so much.

1015
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,134
-Thank you.
-Well done.

1016
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,011
Thank you.

1017
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:48,683
Oh, my gosh.

1018
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,352
What do I do?

1019
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:52,938
This can't be real.

1020
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,774
It really felt like a dream.

1021
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:59,152
Deep down,
I really wanted to receive recognition.

1022
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:00,403
It's a lonely feeling.

1023
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,573
But even if it wasn't full recognition,

1024
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,785
I wanted them to know
about what I'd been working on.

1025
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:10,163
I was really overwhelmed with emotion.

1026
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,456
BREWMASTER YUN

1027
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:14,417
Personally, the chefs I'm rooting for

1028
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:16,795
are those two.

1029
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,213
Those two?

1030
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,966
They wouldn't have taken it lightly
about coming here.

1031
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,425
It's tough. How could they…

1032
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:26,513
They returned
and now have to face both judges.

1033
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,684
They must regret not being able
to fully show their skills last time.

1034
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:34,062
This time, I'm going to really go in hard.

1035
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,735
It was a shame I couldn't show

1036
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,279
the dishes I wanted to create last time.

1037
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,698
KIM DO-YUN
OWNER OF YUN SEOUL

1038
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:45,949
So I came here determined.

1039
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,041
I just have to do what I've always done.

1040
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,586
And noodles are what I do best.

1041
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,880
-See that noodle machine?
-Yeah.

1042
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,257
He actually brought that?

1043
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:03,800
That's amazing.

1044
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:08,221
-That's insane.
-Incredible. Did you see that?

1045
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,558
Chef Kim Do-yun brought a noodle machine.

1046
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,021
He's planning to settle
that frustration from Season 1

1047
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,022
in this round.

1048
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,274
You brought this machine, right?

1049
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:20,608
-Yes.
-It's expensive, isn't it?

1050
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,360
This is…

1051
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,279
about 20 million won.

1052
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,989
-This costs 20 million won?
-Yes.

1053
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,076
I'm very curious to see
what the noodles will be like.

1054
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,079
I heard he's in the top three in Korea
when it comes to noodles.

1055
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,125
He's someone
who has redefined Korean noodles.

1056
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:41,087
He sought out, cultivated,

1057
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,672
and developed our native wheat.

1058
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,591
The taste of Korean wheat

1059
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,801
is fully encapsulated in his noodles,

1060
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,803
so they're truly Korean noodles.

1061
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,180
I mill it myself.

1062
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,140
I used Baekgang wheat.

1063
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,267
BAEKGANG WHEAT
A KOREAN WHEAT VARIETY

1064
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:57,979
I added soybeans

1065
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,231
and mung beans too.

1066
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,152
I made noodles

1067
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,279
with an aroma reminiscent of misutgaru.

1068
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,031
When you taste them,

1069
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,658
you'll be amazed that such noodles exist.

1070
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,667
Chef Kim Do-yun's making the noodles.

1071
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,469
But he can only do this with that machine?

1072
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,678
All noodles

1073
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,680
are actually made the same way

1074
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,182
for pressed noodles.

1075
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,518
If he needs the pressure
from that machine,

1076
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,938
he does have to use it.

1077
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,065
When kneading the noodle dough,

1078
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,692
the folding process
in that machine is really important.

1079
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,946
Without the folding,
you lose that chewy texture.

1080
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,497
THE TWO LAYERS OVERLAP

1081
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,415
How many times will you repeat this?

1082
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,542
-Four times.
-I see.

1083
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,129
Yes, I found that four times
made them nice and not get soggy.

1084
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,132
Honestly, Chef Kim Do-yun's noodles

1085
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,550
really are different.

1086
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,526
The noodles are coming out.

1087
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,012
It'll taste different
from what you've normally had.

1088
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,529
PRESSING PERILLA OIL

1089
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,324
PERILLA OIL

1090
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,457
I'll set the cured mullet roe alight
to remove the fishy taste.

1091
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,917
Then, along with pyogo mushrooms

1092
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,336
and soy-braised beef,
I'll garnish the noodles.

1093
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,512
I really want to ask
Chef Kim Do-yun something.

1094
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,805
-I think he made them like lasagna sheets.
-Wide?

1095
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,309
The aroma of perilla oil

1096
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:45,396
and the texture of the soy-braised beef
and roe when eaten together.

1097
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,316
It looks really simple,

1098
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:51,236
but I bet it'll have
an incredible depth of flavor.

1099
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:08,086
Hidden White Spoon
Chef Kim Do-yun's dish is finished.

1100
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,131
-He's done.
-He's finished.

1101
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,217
We should go watch up close.

1102
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,637
Judges, please make your way
to his station.

1103
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,099
Those two both need to approve.

1104
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,142
Chef Kim Do-yun must be so nervous.

1105
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:29,065
It's not easy to put everything at stake
with just one noodle dish.

1106
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,150
He probably came here
so determined to win.

1107
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,618
This is intense.

1108
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,125
-Great job.
-Thank you.

1109
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,627
-Great work.
-Thank you.

1110
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,259
PERILLA OIL NOODLES

1111
00:59:56,342 --> 01:00:00,138
I used Korean Baekgang wheat
and perilla oil to make noodles.

1112
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,601
In the dish, I added cured mullet roe,
pyogo mushrooms, and soy-braised beef.

1113
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,854
You wrap them together
with a fork and knife.

1114
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,356
I made it so you can enjoy it like a wrap.

1115
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,401
-With a fork and knife?
-Yes.

1116
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,822
Noodles eaten with a fork and knife.

1117
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,366
-Like a wrap?
-Yes.

1118
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,357
These perilla oil noodles were different
from what I've had before.

1119
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,817
It's not just different.
I've never tasted anything like it.

1120
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,737
I slurped the noodles and chewed them.

1121
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,365
As I chewed, I noticed
the aroma of the noodles

1122
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,659
mixed with the aroma of perilla oil.

1123
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,313
It was a single plate with just noodles.

1124
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,649
That's quite impressive.

1125
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,442
There's no soup or sauce.

1126
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,986
He presented a noodle dish
with nowhere to hide.

1127
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,530
With this single noodle dish,

1128
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,739
aroma,

1129
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,865
taste,

1130
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:43,783
and texture…

1131
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,868
He has to hit on all of those.

1132
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,509
They're judging it really carefully.

1133
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:03,803
This just has Baekgang wheat?

1134
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,138
No, with Baekgang wheat,

1135
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,306
I blended in soybeans and mung beans.

1136
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,975
I drink misutgaru a lot,

1137
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,977
so I added those for aroma.

1138
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,271
-How long were they cooked?
-4 minutes and 30 seconds.

1139
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,731
-Four minutes and 30 seconds?
-Yes.

1140
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,651
-Four minutes and 30 seconds.
-I made them 14 mm wide.

1141
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,778
You need to cook them
for 4 minutes and 30 seconds

1142
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,239
so that they're not too hard
when you chew them.

1143
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,491
Did you make them wide on purpose?

1144
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,826
-Yes, slightly wide.
-Why?

1145
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,829
Koreans especially
only like chewy noodles,

1146
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,790
so I wanted to change that
and went with wide noodles.

1147
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,042
It's that silky but firm texture.

1148
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,463
-Thank you.
-Of course.

1149
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:46,387
Now, please write down your decisions.

1150
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:52,727
However, you may not discuss
your decisions with each other.

1151
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,479
Instead of reaching an agreement,

1152
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:58,441
please make your own decisions
on the chef's survival or elimination.

1153
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,487
MUST BE APPROVED BY BOTH JUDGES
TO ADVANCE TO ROUND 2

1154
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,159
Watching this in real time is no joke.

1155
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,246
-Even I feel nervous.
-I know, right?

1156
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:43,194
Both judges have delivered
their decisions to the production team.

1157
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:47,156
Once delivered,
their decisions cannot be changed.

1158
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,956
First, Paik Jong-won,
please announce your decision.

1159
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:02,672
My decision is…

1160
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,054
you've survived.

1161
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,473
PAIK JONG-WON
SURVIVED

1162
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,812
When I ate it,

1163
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:22,149
I could taste the flavor of the soybean

1164
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,111
and the aroma
of the mung bean powder in the dough.

1165
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,363
The perilla oil wasn't overpowering

1166
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:30,366
and I could taste
the natural flavor of the noodles.

1167
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,159
-I was amazed by that.
-Right.

1168
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,786
I cut up and tried a big piece

1169
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,538
and also a small one.

1170
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:36,622
They were all great.

1171
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,458
Of all the perilla oil noodles
I've had until now,

1172
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,086
this was something
I've practically never tasted before.

1173
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:43,880
So I decided that you've survived.

1174
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:44,839
Thank you.

1175
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:47,550
Now,

1176
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,803
based on the remaining judge's decision,

1177
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,807
the Hidden White Spoon
will either survive or be eliminated.

1178
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,519
Depending on his fate,
it could be 19 Black Spoons,

1179
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,022
it could be 18, or even 20.

1180
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:01,939
That's right.

1181
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:06,235
And what's Judge Anh Sung-jae's decision?

1182
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,488
I asked about the texture
and aroma earlier.

1183
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:13,242
Baekgang wheat, mung beans, soybeans.

1184
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,286
I'm also someone

1185
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,163
-who makes noodles by hand.
-Right.

1186
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:20,374
The qualities of these noodles,

1187
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,834
such as their texture,

1188
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,753
aroma, balance of flavors,

1189
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,798
and this taste
that's still lingering in my mouth…

1190
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,800
When I take all of these into account…

1191
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:33,846
Chef Kim Do-yun…

1192
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:35,890
Yes?

1193
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,148
You're eliminated.

1194
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:49,190
