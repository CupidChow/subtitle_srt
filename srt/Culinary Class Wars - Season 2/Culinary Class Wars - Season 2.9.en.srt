1
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,264
I will announce the result.

2
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,765
Im Seong-keun

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,101
and Brewmaster Yun,

4
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,352
you two are…

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,652
survival candidates.

6
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,738
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,240
IM SEONG-KEUN, BREWMASTER YUN
SURVIVAL CANDIDATES

8
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,827
Great job.

9
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,454
They made it.

10
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,458
They did a good job.

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,003
Honestly, if you're not careful,
this could easily be ordinary

12
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,297
and an unremarkable dish.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,633
But for me, when I tasted
everything you had prepared,

14
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,677
it all came together perfectly
in my mouth.

15
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,472
-Thank you.
-When I ate the ssamjang, radish salad,

16
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,766
and pork all together in the lettuce wrap,

17
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:02,145
I thought, "I haven't had a lettuce wrap
this delicious in recent memory."

18
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,981
If the elements prepared by Brewmaster Yun

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,443
had been too elaborate or fancy,
it wouldn't have felt balanced.

20
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,029
They were rustic,
but that's exactly what was needed.

21
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,906
This galbi…

22
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,991
Without Brewmaster Yun's support,

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,618
-it would've been plain.
-Very plain.

24
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,329
The dish could've felt pretty ordinary,

25
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,291
but her elements lift up and highlight
what wasn't shining through.

26
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,543
-Especially the ssamjang.
-The ssamjang is very good.

27
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,922
It really brings out
the flavor of the meat.

28
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,882
-It's essential.
-Without her support,

29
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,759
this wouldn't have been possible.

30
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,678
It was the same for me,
and for the viewers watching this,

31
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,390
they also might wonder,
"What could be so special about that?"

32
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,769
But when I tasted everything
in the lettuce wrap with the ssamjang…

33
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,189
in my mouth,

34
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,650
it was as if the faces of the two chefs

35
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,569
were popping out
and were so clearly visible.

36
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,906
Achieving that through flavor
in Korean cuisine is really difficult.

37
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,284
But they brought out their styles
so vividly and harmoniously,

38
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,330
so their dish left
a really strong impression.

39
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,250
The team of Im Seong-keun
and Brewmaster Yun,

40
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,503
please make your way
to the Survival Candidate Zone.

41
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,213
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

42
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,592
Let's go!

43
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,511
Congratulations.

44
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,349
"It was more delicious
when eaten together."

45
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,476
That's what I really wanted to hear.

46
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,646
This is all thanks to Chef Im.

47
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,400
If I did anything right,
it was choosing a great partner.

48
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,237
Brewmaster Yun did a lot of things
unseen in the background

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,989
and gave her full support

50
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,449
to help create this synergy.

51
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,578
I think that's the reason
why we succeeded.

52
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,086
See? It's better
to get it over with quickly.

53
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,885
-You really did an amazing job, Chef.
-No, this is only the beginning.

54
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,804
I hope we can make it
straight to the finals.

55
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,476
Is this okay?
Should I scrape out more? Master Hou.

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,104
-Master Hou?
-It doesn't have to be too big.

57
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,232
Master Hou, please take a look.
Is this okay?

58
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,233
-This is fine.
-It is?

59
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,776
-Then, you just fill it up.
-Okay.

60
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,029
It's like when you eat
mangoes with a spoon.

61
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,449
That's it. Just push straight through.

62
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,409
There you go.

63
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,119
Yeah, just like that.

64
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,039
-Okay.
-Just like that.

65
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,665
-Okay.
-Yeah.

66
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,543
I mean, I was a Blue House chef
for 20 years,

67
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,337
but I was like a student.

68
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,131
That was the kind of duo we were.

69
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,135
Then, when we fill it up,
it'll seem fuller.

70
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,428
-Yeah, that's good.
-Okay.

71
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,472
Very nice.

72
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,141
He'd say, "That's it. Great job."
It felt good.

73
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,353
I'm pushing 60, but it still felt good.

74
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,688
If it weren't for Master Hou,

75
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,609
I probably wouldn't be here right now
doing this interview.

76
00:03:55,151 --> 00:04:00,073
I joined The Shilla 33 years ago,
and he was my mentor back then.

77
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,203
When he joined The Shilla, I trained him

78
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,996
and sent him to the Blue House.

79
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,875
Master Hou saw potential in me
and recommended me.

80
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,587
I left after serving five presidents
over 20 years and 4 months.

81
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,591
Master Hou helped me grow,

82
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,261
and now, on a show
where only the best chefs appear,

83
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,721
both my mentor and I get to take part.

84
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,889
I was really…

85
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,849
overcome with emotion.

86
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,810
This must be very meaningful for you.

87
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,270
If it were me,

88
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,230
and I was cooking
with someone like Chef Hou,

89
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,148
I'd be really scared and nervous too.

90
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,610
One of the reasons why I'm here
as a White Spoon chef

91
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,862
-is Master Hou…
-Really?

92
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,072
-Yes.
-You must be proud.

93
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,448
He's come a long way.

94
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,539
We have the opportunity to create
another amazing dish after 30-odd years,

95
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,251
which is fun and completely unexpected.

96
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,545
It's great to work with him again.

97
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,380
If I were to make a suggestion,

98
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,050
I think it should be a dish
people don't often come across.

99
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,678
So I was thinking…

100
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,180
-Lobsters. Live ones.
-Right.

101
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,892
Lobster and fruit. Mangoes.

102
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,229
There aren't many dishes
that pair lobsters and mangoes.

103
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,775
I always focus
on seasonal ingredients first.

104
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,738
It's peak season for mangoes right now.

105
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,575
Lobsters should also be
nice and plump now.

106
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,244
Our dish is the Mango Lobster Appetizer.

107
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,496
We thought this pairing

108
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,292
would truly highlight the natural flavors
of mangoes and lobsters.

109
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,169
Okay, time to steam.

110
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,966
We steam the live lobster
for about three minutes.

111
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,843
It's like going for a soft-boiled egg.

112
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,303
You get that perfect texture.

113
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,486
PARK HYO-NAM, CHOI YU-GANG

114
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,994
Could you check
how the head's been boiled?

115
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,287
-Give me the head.
-Yes, Chef.

116
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,373
Our main ingredient was spiny lobster.

117
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,042
Here.

118
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,169
Gosh, they're…

119
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,712
very nice.

120
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,172
-Really nice, right?
-So nice.

121
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,134
What matters most
is choosing good ingredients.

122
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,805
They had just four spiny lobsters
at Noryangjin Fish Market,

123
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,265
and we bought them all.

124
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,977
Spiny lobsters don't have claws,

125
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,816
and most of the meat
is concentrated in the body.

126
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,486
Compared to regular lobsters,
they're much more tender

127
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,864
and have that robust sweet flavor
you find in seafood.

128
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,621
We wanted to make a dish
that's faithful to the ingredient.

129
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,707
It's a lobster salad
with a Chinese-style sauce.

130
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,502
Chef Choi Yu-gang
is a Chinese cuisine chef,

131
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,839
and I cook French cuisine.

132
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,340
We'll do two things.

133
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,467
-A Chinese cuisine sauce.
-Right. Okay.

134
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,804
-And a vichyssoise.
-Vichyssoise. Okay.

135
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,849
There's a soup called
a vichyssoise in France.

136
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,475
It's a cold potato soup.

137
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,771
We'll be using lobster stock
to make the vichyssoise.

138
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,651
We take the heads of the lobsters

139
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,403
and make a broth.

140
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,824
We add potatoes,
large green onions, and onions.

141
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,868
Then, we blend that
until it's nice and smooth.

142
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,957
And then, we cool it down
and serve it as a cold soup.

143
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,461
Chinese and French cuisines

144
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,838
need to come together without clashing.

145
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,757
I made a Chinese-style cream sauce

146
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,135
and chilled it.

147
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,012
TRUFFLE OIL

148
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,349
CARROT EMULSION

149
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,977
The sweet flavor that bursts out from this

150
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,271
is really elegant and refined.

151
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:11,449
I made the mayonnaise sauce
for the mango lobster.

152
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,828
Our main ingredients
are mangoes and lobsters.

153
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,622
And since they're both very fresh,

154
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:22,376
it's all about retaining
that freshness and flavor.

155
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,171
In other words,
you can't make the sauce too strong.

156
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,173
That was what I was thinking

157
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,551
when I chose to go with a softer flavor.

158
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:36,766
I mixed mayonnaise,
yogurt, and lemon juice together

159
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,851
to make the sauce.

160
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,072
Yes, exactly. Okay.

161
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:52,740
All right.

162
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,702
It looks good.

163
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,330
Sprinkle more. It's fine.
The color is nice.

164
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,208
We worked together seamlessly.

165
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,295
Creating a dish together as a team
made me really happy.

166
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,755
It was also an honor.

167
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,967
It felt like
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

168
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,555
Like the friendship
between mentor and student,

169
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,766
I want to present a wonderful dish
with that kind of harmony.

170
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:36,117
MANGO LOBSTER APPETIZER

171
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,620
The softness of the mango,
the sweetness of the lobster,

172
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,039
and the savory flavor of the mayo sauce.

173
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,334
Those flavors come together
as one on the palate.

174
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,211
That is the dish we've created.

175
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,966
It's the first time in 33 years

176
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,260
that we've collaborated together.

177
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,636
So it's our first dish,

178
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,390
and we chose an appetizer
with that meaning in mind.

179
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,433
-An appetizer?
-Yes.

180
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,310
Thank you for the dish.

181
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,856
You should taste the mango
and a piece of the lobster together.

182
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:08,816
Like this?

183
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,927
I fully understand
the mango and the lobster,

184
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,429
but the choice of mayonnaise…

185
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,930
We used mayonnaise

186
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,974
because we wanted to
incorporate a softer flavor

187
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,602
and decided to go with a mayo sauce.

188
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,855
Thank you.

189
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,534
For me…

190
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,578
Since they specialize in Chinese cuisine,

191
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,706
it's much less about
how fancy the dish is and all that.

192
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,750
It's about highlighting
the ingredient's flavors.

193
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,213
The discussion time has ended.

194
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,508
Judges, please announce the result.

195
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,010
Chef Hou Deok-juk

196
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,471
and Chef Chun Sang-hyun,

197
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,389
you are…

198
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,812
elimination candidates.

199
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,189
Thank you for your dish.

200
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,774
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

201
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,735
So, when you introduced it as an appetizer

202
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,571
and I imagined eating this
as the first course,

203
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,574
the amount of mayonnaise
and the texture when I took a bite

204
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,452
felt a bit too rich.

205
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,995
So that's the decision we came to.

206
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,499
-Thank you for your dish.
-Thank you.

207
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,710
The team of Hou Deok-juk
and Chun Sang-hyun,

208
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,130
please make your way
to the Elimination Candidate Zone.

209
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,716
What the hell?

210
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,760
-Damn.
-This is scary.

211
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,150
The mayo sauce was a little…

212
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,614
Let's mix this

213
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,075
-with a bit of this.
-Okay.

214
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,373
We decided not to make
the sauce too strong,

215
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:33,127
so the natural flavors
of the main ingredient can come alive.

216
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,546
SPINY LOBSTER MEAT

217
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,510
We take that sauce
and drizzle it over the lobster.

218
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,723
What also go into the dish

219
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,143
are asparagus and avocadoes.

220
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,936
A SALAD WITH ASPARAGUS AND AVOCADO

221
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,822
VICHYSSOISE

222
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:07,703
We topped it with jelly made from almonds,

223
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,371
and that's how we presented it.

224
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,917
Here.

225
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,378
All done.

226
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,641
First, the name of our dish

227
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:34,522
is 1964 Silk Road Imperial Lobster.

228
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,649
The year 1964

229
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,945
is when France and China
first established diplomatic ties.

230
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:45,866
So we chose that meaningful year
and prepared our dish.

231
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,418
-It's vichyssoise underneath.
-Spoon it?

232
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,546
-On top like this?
-Yes.

233
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,477
The spiny lobster

234
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,980
is really good quality.

235
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,399
-You steamed it really well.
-Thank you.

236
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,860
Chef Choi Yu-gang,
which part did you make?

237
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,990
I made the backbone of the dish,
which is the sauce.

238
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,618
Blending the flavors smoothly
so they become one was what I went for.

239
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,538
Thank you. Please wait there for a moment.

240
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,086
Great job. You did well.

241
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,838
Well done.

242
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:46,010
The name and concept
of the dish are very good.

243
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,511
It's quite French in style.

244
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,973
But what matters more is…

245
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,814
The discussion time has ended.

246
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,400
Judges, please announce the result.

247
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,236
Park Hyo-nam and Choi Yu-gang…

248
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,742
I'm afraid you're elimination candidates.

249
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,246
PARK HYO-NAM, CHOI YU-GANG
ELIMINATION CANDIDATES

250
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,497
When tasting the dish,

251
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,167
I thought the element of Chinese cuisine,

252
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,003
even if it wasn't fifty-fifty,

253
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:27,009
should've come through a bit stronger
for this to have been a collaboration.

254
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,639
We thought that balance
was somewhat skewed to one side.

255
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,892
Did I steer us too far toward my style?

256
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,646
Maybe I should've been
a bit more ambitious.

257
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,773
Our friends are here to join us.

258
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,233
Our friends.

259
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,818
You did a great job.

260
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,114
-Good job.
-We're not eliminated just yet.

261
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,659
We could still advance from here.

262
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,543
SON JONG-WON, CULINARY MONSTER

263
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,421
I wanted to make a true fine-dining dish.

264
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,300
The skills that go into this dish
are beyond what the other chefs can do.

265
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,386
I can guarantee it.

266
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,721
If we put our heads together,

267
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,724
we need something that can surprise
even Chef Anh Sung-jae.

268
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,101
-He'll be expecting more.
-Yeah.

269
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,395
We gave it a lot of thought.

270
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,648
We didn't want to do anything
that was predictable.

271
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,026
We were both in the US,

272
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,114
-so something to reflect that…
-Something American would be good.

273
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,616
-And find that overlap.
-New York would be good too.

274
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,285
What about a Waldorf salad?

275
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,662
A Waldorf salad?

276
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,789
I've lived in New York as well,

277
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,959
and one of the dishes that represents
New York is the Waldorf salad.

278
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,546
It's a salad made with a base
of apples, celery, and walnuts.

279
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,508
I think we should have
at least one unexpected thing.

280
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,551
Exactly.

281
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,178
-If they taste it and go, "Oh."
-"It's what I expected."

282
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,596
-Then, it won't work.
-I agree.

283
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,642
We're going to adapt the Waldorf salad
and give it a witty twist.

284
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,604
We prepared a dish that's called a salad
but isn't actually a salad.

285
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,443
-There's no seafood in a Waldorf.
-Right. Apples, celery, walnuts.

286
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,778
-What if we add crab?
-It'll taste good.

287
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,905
We'll pick out the body meat

288
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,615
and make the salad.

289
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,159
-Then, we'll put that in here.
-Yes.

290
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:19,163
-So we'll spread it on and roll it up.
-Like rolling gimbap.

291
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,748
-Let it set and…
-Yes.

292
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,211
-We can just buy gelatin from anywhere.
-That's right.

293
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,671
We could even make gelée.

294
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,465
Jelly? I think that would be good.

295
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:33,260
This might taste heavier than expected,
so let's go with apple jelly balls.

296
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,180
I think using some caviar would be nice.

297
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,766
The two of us probably handle
caviar the best here.

298
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,768
I don't think anyone else will use it.

299
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,025
Yeah, I don't think anyone will use it.

300
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:52,237
After making the brioche,
we'll spoon a bit of caviar on top.

301
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,740
There are so many elements to the dish.

302
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,284
It's a very ambitious dish.

303
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,162
The time limit is extremely tight.

304
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,332
I want them to say, "I can't believe
they made something like this here."

305
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,545
First, we'll have to split the time
into five-minute blocks,

306
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,713
so we get 25 blocks.

307
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,633
-So we'll follow this timeline.
-Okay.

308
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,344
They should really be
two-minute intervals.

309
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,597
Five minutes feel like
we'll have to rush through things.

310
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,521
We'll finish at 90 minutes with 30 left.
Then, we'll taste it.

311
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,523
-From that, we'll plate it…
-Let's start early.

312
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,565
All done in 90 minutes.

313
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,486
TIMETABLE

314
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,280
If you look at it when things are hectic,

315
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,242
you realize
what you're supposed to be doing.

316
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:43,163
If everything goes to plan,
I think we'll have a really amazing dish.

317
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,250
As long as I do my job,
I think we'll get good results.

318
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,670
…begins now!

319
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,969
SON JONG-WON'S TASK
CUT CRABS IN HALF AND GRILL

320
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,804
CULINARY MONSTER'S TASK
CUT BRIOCHE

321
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,484
Chef Son took charge
of the crab meat salad.

322
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,990
Culinary Monster will cut out
flower shapes from the bread.

323
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,161
There's something called a tartelette,

324
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,705
and we'll press two pieces
between the tartelette molds

325
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,707
and bake them in the oven
until they're crispy.

326
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:38,385
SON JONG-WON'S TASK
GRILL ONIONS, CARROTS, CELERY

327
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:45,934
CULINARY MONSTER'S TASK
BAKE TART CRUSTS IN OVEN

328
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,856
If something goes wrong,
we don't have a plan B.

329
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,650
There's only plan A.
Failure isn't an option.

330
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,986
So, it's a huge risk.

331
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,077
We could play it safe,
but we're here for the challenge.

332
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,332
If we don't take on that challenge,
we won't achieve anything new.

333
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,384
That's cute. Is the texture okay?

334
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,677
Yes, it's fine.

335
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,430
BRIOCHE TART

336
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,432
I wanted to use caviar in the dish.

337
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:30,479
I thought its concentrated flavor
and texture would go well with the dish.

338
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,731
Alongside that,
we'll be making apple jelly.

339
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,525
Apples are a key component
in a Waldorf salad.

340
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,112
We'll juice the apples, add gelatin,

341
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,781
and let it set.

342
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,370
Large amounts of jelly don't have
great texture when eaten in spoonfuls, so…

343
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,045
I'm going to dice the jelly
into fine pieces

344
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,047
and make little balls out of it.

345
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,740
APPLE JELLY

346
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,701
Let's go with this size.

347
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,998
The first key thing was to make
the sheet to roll the crab salad in.

348
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,836
We didn't have much time,

349
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,299
and making that is time-consuming,

350
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,011
so Chef Son handled cooking the crabs.

351
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,556
Instead of steaming the crabs,
we'll grill them over charcoal.

352
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,224
The smell of grilled crabs is amazing.

353
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,832
By crushing the shells
of the charcoal-grilled crabs into bits,

354
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,043
I could draw out a richer sauce.

355
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,258
I'll put the crab bodies
and vegetables into a pot

356
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,053
and use them to make stock.

357
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,680
I add tomato paste…

358
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,517
and brandy.

359
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,228
Then, I light it to burn off the alcohol.

360
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,819
I'll boil it for 30 minutes
to really reduce it.

361
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,989
This reduction will become
the salad dressing.

362
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,043
It's time to Microplane
and juice the lime.

363
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,628
Yes, that's right.

364
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,089
Hey, don't look at our schedule.

365
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,802
Having a schedule
does give you that peace of mind.

366
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,930
What are you in charge of,
Culinary Monster?

367
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:13,517
I'm working on the genoise at the moment.

368
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,895
We're going to fill this
with our salad later

369
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,022
-and roll it up.
-Okay.

370
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:23,401
A genoise often refers to
sheets of sponge cake.

371
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,947
We're making a plain genoise sheet…

372
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,201
and one with herbs, making two in total.

373
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,703
A GREEN GENOISE INFUSED WITH HERBS

374
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,668
We're going to make a striped pattern
and bake it in the oven.

375
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,213
The genoise will add
a bit of sweetness to the dish

376
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:47,134
while enveloping the salad
in a soft, fluffy layer.

377
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,637
The baking time is short.

378
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,640
It needs to be checked
in three to five-minute intervals,

379
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,308
so I kept checking the oven.

380
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,688
Behind you.

381
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,794
THE GENOISE IS COMPLETE

382
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,297
REDUCED STOCK

383
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,609
The flavor is sweet
but also full of savory richness.

384
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,777
You get that concentrated flavor of crab.

385
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,365
Then, I add grapeseed oil,
and that becomes the sauce.

386
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,827
Have a taste.

387
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,333
We'll add the crab meat.

388
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,586
Should we start plating?

389
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,214
Let's mix these first.

390
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,134
SNOW CRAB MEAT

391
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,595
We went with this Waldorf salad,

392
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,224
because it's a reinterpretation
of the classic Waldorf salad.

393
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,558
After dicing the apples,

394
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,435
blanching the celery,

395
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,187
and finely chopping the walnuts,

396
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,732
we mix them with the sauce
we made earlier.

397
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,652
APPLES

398
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,367
Then, we place that
on the genoise and roll it up.

399
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,204
SPREADING THE SNOW CRAB SAUCE
ON THE GENOISE

400
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,708
-We need to roll it now.
-Okay.

401
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,212
-We have to roll it this way, right?
-Yes.

402
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,471
Lastly, the salad, oil…

403
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,391
-Will it roll up?
-Walnuts… What?

404
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,392
Will this roll up?

405
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,102
Lastly, the salad, oil…

406
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,146
-Will it roll up?
-Walnuts… What?

407
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,064
Will this roll up?

408
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,400
-I'm worried.
-Is it too dry?

409
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,943
-Yeah.
-Damn it.

410
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,503
We had to roll it up
with the crab meat in it, like gimbap.

411
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,047
The dried seaweed in gimbap is flexible,

412
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,883
but the genoise came out

413
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,553
halfway between a sponge cake
and a cookie.

414
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,224
So we had difficulties in rolling it up.

415
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,019
They're not ovens we're familiar with,

416
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,521
so it came out a lot drier
than we expected.

417
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,817
It made me flustered.
We didn't have that much time left.

418
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,862
There wasn't enough time to make it again.

419
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,657
But my role isn't to be flustered.

420
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,117
It's to find a solution.

421
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,454
Then, is it on steam right now?

422
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,496
Should we steam it?

423
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,460
Adding moisture would make it softer,

424
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,587
so we switched the oven to steam,

425
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,006
to make the genoise
be softer and easier to roll.

426
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,180
It'll be fine. A bit of steam will do it.

427
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,264
Yes, Chef.

428
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,060
First off, the biggest fault lies with me.

429
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,687
I wasn't able to do my part properly.

430
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,614
Should we get a cutting board?

431
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,823
-A cutting board?
-Yeah.

432
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:40,992
Please.

433
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,662
-Actually…
-With the paper on…

434
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,164
-Yeah, we should flip it.
-Cut it.

435
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,638
It happens all the time in the kitchen.

436
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,849
It'd be nice if things went as planned,
but there are always variables,

437
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,518
and the unexpected happens.

438
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,603
In a way,

439
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,106
I think I'm here
because I can perfectly handle that.

440
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,247
-I'm going to cut it.
-Okay.

441
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,958
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

442
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,381
Please save it.

443
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,509
It's working.

444
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,553
-It is?
-Yeah, hold on.

445
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,481
Currently, you have four minutes left.

446
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,737
God!

447
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,657
I intend to see things through.

448
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,790
-Did I miss anything?
-That should be everything.

449
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,128
Gosh.

450
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,339
I'm sorry, Jong-won. The damn genoise…

451
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,008
This is tough.

452
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,925
So…

453
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:26,473
the part I was responsible for
didn't come out as well as I'd hoped,

454
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,017
so I feel like I let Chef Son down.

455
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,977
We'll make it.

456
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,813
We really worked hard.

457
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,734
We have to make it.

458
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,819
The team of Son Jong-won
and Culinary Monster,

459
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,572
please make your way to the judges' table.

460
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,646
I think they had high expectations.

461
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:20,443
But I felt we hadn't lived up
to those expectations.

462
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,736
I was worried.

463
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:30,411
We prepared a dish
called the Waldorf salad.

464
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,956
WALDORF SALAD

465
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,042
We adapted the Waldorf salad,
and with a bit of wit,

466
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,003
we reinterpreted it in our own way
in the style of fine dining.

467
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,884
As for tasting it,
there are quite a few components.

468
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,428
As you can see,
there are three parts to the dish.

469
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,014
If you put all three components
together on a spoon

470
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,516
and eat it in one bite,

471
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,309
-they'll all come together.
-All at once?

472
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,269
Yes.

473
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,813
-If possible.
-It's possible.

474
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:57,939
All three all at once?

475
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,861
Should we tell them
to eat it all in one bite?

476
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,113
I think that might be hard to do.

477
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,948
But I think it'll taste better that way.

478
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,324
As the jelly melts

479
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,202
-with the salty caviar flavor…
-One big mouthful?

480
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,663
Let's ask them to eat it all at once.

481
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,333
I did think it was a pretty big portion,

482
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,752
but still, I thought
it'd be better to taste it

483
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,213
all together than separately.

484
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,508
Tell us if this is right.

485
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,846
Even with the caviar too?

486
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,433
This is fine dining, right?

487
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,560
Eat all three all at once?

488
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,477
Like this?

489
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,938
We're experts on doing this.

490
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,440
Even this?

491
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,067
-Like this?
-Yes, please.

492
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,314
Is this usually eaten in one go?

493
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,275
I don't know.
I'm sure there's a reason for it.

494
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,402
Why did you recommend
eating it all together?

495
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,864
Well, we thought
the saltiness of the caviar

496
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,409
and the tangy, sweet flavor
of the apple gelée

497
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,744
would melt in your mouth

498
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,790
and provide additional seasoning
to the main salad.

499
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,625
So, we suggested eating it all together.

500
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,548
I think you created a very daring dish.

501
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,675
Thank you.

502
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,551
Please wait there for a moment.

503
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,727
They don't look too happy.

504
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,411
In any case, these two chefs

505
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,038
come from the same culinary background,

506
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,874
so their use of ingredients and flavors…

507
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,138
I think they're done.

508
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,934
The discussion time has ended.

509
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,608
Judges, please announce the result.

510
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,155
Son Jong-won and Culinary Monster are…

511
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,418
Son Jong-won and Culinary Monster are…

512
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,588
survival candidates.

513
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,214
Congratulations.

514
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,382
…survival candidates.

515
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,468
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

516
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,553
SON JONG-WON, CULINARY MONSTER
SURVIVAL CANDIDATES

517
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,097
They made it.

518
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,475
-They survived.
-They survived?

519
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:25,229
As you're both chefs who work in
and pursue fine dining,

520
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,067
I tried to set a higher bar
and judge your dish more thoroughly.

521
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,987
Their use of ingredients and flavors,
even the balance, is really good.

522
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,239
Tasting it all at once
gives you a variety of textures,

523
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:39,202
and as you chew,
the flavors keep popping up.

524
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,954
I was shocked when they told us
to eat it in one bite.

525
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,414
"All this in one go?"

526
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:47,251
But when I ate it all at once,
the flavors just exploded.

527
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:51,005
I don't even need to ask who made what.

528
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,424
It all came through on the palate.

529
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,384
If that can be expressed through the dish,

530
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,513
I believe that is the best kind
of collaboration.

531
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,972
It was very delicious.

532
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,183
Thank you.

533
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,310
The team of Son Jong-won
and Culinary Monster,

534
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,396
please make your way
to the Survival Candidate Zone.

535
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,192
Great work. I told you we'd make it.

536
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,949
That was awesome.

537
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,202
-I've got goosebumps.
-Seriously.

538
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,995
I sighed like this.

539
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,123
It was a sigh of relief.

540
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,793
Congratulations.
I've been waiting for you.

541
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,336
Us two Black Spoons.

542
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,046
-I waited so long.
-We finally meet.

543
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,047
You did great too.

544
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,091
-Chef.
-Congratulations.

545
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,801
Chef Son.

546
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,428
So this is where

547
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,222
our fates…

548
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,058
I'm so relieved.

549
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,105
The rice came out well, Venerable.
Could you take a look?

550
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,441
It's cooked perfectly
and not soggy at all.

551
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,442
-It's good?
-Yes.

552
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,694
Shouldn't we scoop it out?

553
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,988
-Yes, I'll have it cooled quickly.
-Okay.

554
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,491
-The rice is delicious.
-Right?

555
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,077
Hee-eun, taste this braised burdock root.

556
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,459
It's great. The aroma is amazing.

557
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,461
-Is it okay?
-The texture seems good.

558
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,756
Venerable Sunjae and Chef Kim Hee-eun…

559
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,885
I'm looking forward
to their collaboration.

560
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,970
They both do Korean cuisine, right?

561
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,930
The Venerable does Korean temple cuisine,

562
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,475
and Chef Kim Hee-eun
has a lot of respect for that cuisine.

563
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,312
We might see a new and unexpected dish.

564
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:33,316
Your cooking is rooted in tradition,
and although I also do Korean cuisine,

565
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,026
I do modern Korean food.

566
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,195
And I need to respect that you're unable

567
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,779
-to use certain ingredients.
-Right.

568
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,656
Are you okay with dried seaweed?

569
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,782
Yeah, gim is great.

570
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,744
Are there any other ingredients
that you could eat with gim?

571
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,122
We add things like tofu and carrots
to make gimbap.

572
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,791
But gimbap feels a bit unoriginal.

573
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,585
Gimbap? It's not unoriginal.

574
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,628
-It's not?
-No.

575
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,839
Then, should we make tofu gimbap
and another kind of gimbap?

576
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,425
The food Hee-eun makes

577
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,802
includes ingredients
we don't use at the temple.

578
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,431
So, I suggested making
two kinds of gimbap.

579
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,351
Even at snack shops,
they don't give you just gimbap.

580
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,021
-They serve kimchi and pickled radish too.
-Right.

581
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,232
Sometimes, they even have miso soup.

582
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,443
So we would plate the gimbap here,

583
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:21,781
the soup here,
and the two side dishes like this.

584
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,951
In Korea, when they serve a dish,

585
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:28,246
they always include a small side dish
and a warm soup.

586
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,498
That kind of Korean virtue.

587
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,542
We wanted to express that virtue
of Korean cuisine,

588
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,004
so we decided to make a bansang
with gimbap as the main dish.

589
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,183
For most people,

590
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,061
gimbap contains
ham, sausage, eggs, and so on,

591
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,939
so it has a pretty soft texture.

592
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,775
But with my gimbap,
I want them to take their time and chew,

593
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,111
rather than to eat it quickly.

594
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,406
I usually fry the tofu when I make gimbap.

595
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,827
Tofu tastes delicious when fried.

596
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,246
I braise it with soy sauce and rice syrup.

597
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,331
SOY SAUCE AND RICE SYRUP

598
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,046
To complement
Venerable Sunjae's tofu gimbap,

599
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,133
my dish needs to blend in with hers.

600
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,968
You need to do what you're good at.

601
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,846
If you make gimbap,
what ingredient would you use?

602
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,223
Abalone…

603
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,559
-I'd like to use that.
-Then, next to it…

604
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,936
You should make gimbap with abalone.

605
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,230
My special ingredient is abalone.

606
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,110
I wanted it to come together
with Venerable Sunjae's braised burdock.

607
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,904
I thought the two
would pair well together.

608
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,116
After steaming the abalone,

609
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,454
I dressed them with soy sauce
and sesame oil to lightly season them.

610
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,293
Another thing the Venerable and I share
in terms of Korean cuisine is

611
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,004
we both make our own jang
to use in our cooking.

612
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:04,675
So we decided to use that connection
to make our own gimbap.

613
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,349
For the vegetables
that go into the gimbap,

614
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,768
some taste better when cooked quickly,

615
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,561
and others taste better
when cooked slowly.

616
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,813
Carrots need to be stir-fried
only a little

617
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,274
to get rid of its distinct smell.

618
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,945
Burdock root needs to be stir-fried
for a while to become sweet and tasty.

619
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,074
I added plenty of perilla oil

620
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,035
and stir-fried the burdock root
steadily over a low flame,

621
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,122
so its sweet flavor could come out.

622
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,419
At the end, after adding aged soy sauce
and rice syrup, I braised it.

623
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,765
The carrots should taste like carrots,

624
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,309
and the burdock root
should taste like burdock root.

625
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,020
I make sure the ingredient's
natural flavor can be tasted.

626
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,231
GIMBAP INGREDIENTS ARE READY

627
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,565
So should I roll the gimbap?

628
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,067
-Yes, that'd be good.
-Okay.

629
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:16,789
The Venerable and I
have completely different styles,

630
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:21,377
but we wanted to present Korean cuisine
in a new, fun, and comfortable way.

631
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,879
GIM

632
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,132
I ground the gim into powder.

633
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,259
MASCARPONE CHEESE

634
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,302
RICE SYRUP

635
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,432
I mixed the gim with mascarpone cheese.

636
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,272
Then, I mixed that together with the rice.

637
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,899
What each of us is good at

638
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,445
and the values we each hold
when it comes to food.

639
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,948
That's what we tried to infuse
into the dish we made.

640
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,741
TOFU GIMBAP
RICE, TOFU

641
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:57,580
BURDOCK ROOT, SALT-PICKLED RADISH, CARROT

642
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:01,625
KALE AND SPINACH, CUCUMBER

643
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,669
ABALONE GIMBAP
GIM AND MASCARPONE RICE, ABALONE

644
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,796
CARROT

645
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,548
BURDOCK ROOT

646
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,592
SALT-PICKLED RADISH

647
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:13,345
KALE AND SPINACH

648
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,513
Do I have everything?

649
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,308
Okay.

650
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,099
When you slice the gimbap,

651
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,393
you can see
the colorful ingredients inside.

652
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,021
A gimbap with an assortment of colors.

653
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,777
The harmony created
when everything comes together.

654
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,029
I think that's the highlight of our dish.

655
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,287
The doenjang soup…

656
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,997
How should we do it?

657
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,249
-It's a soup, so…
-Yes.

658
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,501
Instead of like a thick stew,

659
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,045
-just make it a clear, light soup. Okay.
-Okay.

660
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,172
The gimbap is the star of the dish,

661
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,757
so for it to have impact,

662
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,844
I thought one component
should be mild and clear.

663
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,432
For the doenjang soup, to highlight
the vegetables' natural flavors,

664
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,644
I scoop out the Korean zucchini
with a spoon instead of a knife.

665
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,062
They have to be very thin.

666
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,151
Then, I mix it with doenjang.

667
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,740
After making the broth
with radish and kelp,

668
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,160
I add the zucchini, green chili peppers,
and pyogo mushrooms and let it boil.

669
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,954
Nothing else is added in.

670
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,707
I just add the zucchini
to the radish and kelp broth,

671
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,500
but it's very sweet and tasty.

672
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,086
Let's start plating now.

673
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,297
-Should I plate the doenjang soup?
-Yes.

674
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,476
-Venerable.
-Yes?

675
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,895
-I'm sure we'll do well.
-Yeah.

676
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,856
I kept praying.

677
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,524
What's your religion?

678
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,693
I'm Christian.

679
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,821
God and Buddha are helping us,
so I'm sure we'll do well

680
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,281
since we both prayed.

681
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,118
Let's bring it together, Venerable.

682
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,328
-Together?
-Yes.

683
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,800
We made a Korean comfort food

684
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,803
and a dish everyone loves, gimbap.

685
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,223
I made gimbap with tofu,

686
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,977
and next to it is the abalone gimbap
made by Hee-eun.

687
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,981
The soup is a clear doenjang soup.

688
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,816
We have candied walnuts with gochujang.

689
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:19,406
Using Korean cabbage,
soy sauce, rice syrup, perilla oil,

690
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,659
vinegar, and a bit of lemon zest,

691
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,703
we made a refreshing
and clean-tasting geotjeori.

692
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,955
We used gochujang, doenjang, and ganjang,

693
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,502
applying each jang appropriately
according to its use.

694
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,379
ABALONE GIMBAP

695
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,182
TOFU GIMBAP

696
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,923
Then, in this dish you two prepared,

697
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:22,636
Chef Kim Hee-eun was in charge
of this abalone and cheese gimbap?

698
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,514
The gimbap and the geotjeori.

699
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,182
The doenjang soup was…

700
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,642
-That was me.
-The Venerable made

701
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:30,853
the vegetable stock
and balanced the flavors,

702
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,063
and she made
that delicious braised burdock root.

703
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,984
We'll discuss. Please wait for a moment.

704
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,193
-Okay.
-Thank you.

705
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:54,084
As I tasted it, I thought,
"It's a very restrained gimbap."

706
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,254
"This is how gimbap would be made
at a temple by monks."

707
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,380
Right, you can imagine it.

708
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,841
"Gosh, so gimbap
can be reinterpreted this way." Then…

709
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,344
So…

710
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,262
Okay.

711
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,889
The discussion time has ended.

712
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,100
Judges, please announce the result.

713
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,727
Venerable Sunjae

714
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,313
and Kim Hee-eun are…

715
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,032
elimination candidates.

716
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,576
…elimination candidates.

717
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:29,912
What a shame.

718
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,623
VENERABLE SUNJAE, KIM HEE-EUN
ELIMINATION CANDIDATES

719
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:36,376
The most important element
of this challenge

720
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,254
was to have two different chefs
come together

721
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,133
and create a dish with a lot of synergy.

722
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,886
That's what we're focusing on.

723
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,514
"Gosh, so gimbap
can be reinterpreted this way." Then…

724
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,767
When I tasted the gimbap
Chef Kim Hee-eun made,

725
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,061
-my eyes just popped open.
-Right.

726
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,688
For example, the geotjeori sauce
and the doenjang soup

727
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,190
don't go well together in my view.

728
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,776
The flavors don't mesh at all.

729
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,946
That's exactly why I asked
who had made what.

730
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,864
The dishes are completely different.

731
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,908
You can tell they were made
by different people.

732
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,076
I definitely felt that too.

733
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,161
It's not about
whether it tastes good or not,

734
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,039
but you could tell the dish
was made by two different people.

735
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,541
It felt too different.

736
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,377
It felt like Venerable Sunjae's
doenjang soup

737
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:22,506
was at odds with this gimbap.

738
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,091
This is a very light soup,

739
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,426
and it's just pure in flavor
with nothing complex,

740
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,720
whereas this gimbap is delicious
with complex flavors.

741
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,474
Conceptually, balance and harmony
between these two is key,

742
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,768
but it was clear
these were very different dishes,

743
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,436
so this was the decision we came to.

744
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,729
Great job today.

745
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,439
Thank you.

746
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,358
Thank you very much.

747
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,484
What a shame.

748
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,945
The team of Venerable Sunjae
and Kim Hee-eun,

749
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,281
please make your way
to the Elimination Candidate Zone.

750
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,495
Still, even with a 50% chance…

751
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,539
This is really tough.

752
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:00,627
They said it lacked harmony,
and it seemed different people made it.

753
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,838
Maybe I should've gone
right next to the Venerable

754
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,840
with my cutting board
and cooked alongside her.

755
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,509
I feel terrible about that.

756
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,304
I wouldn't have minded
if it had just been me,

757
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:14,099
but since she was with me,
I felt pretty bad.

758
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,144
What a shame.

759
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,939
We made the soup together though, right?
We cooked together.

760
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,733
You'll make it as an additional survivor.

761
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,526
-You'll be fine, Hee-eun.
-Come on.

762
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,488
Let's go together, Venerable.
We're partners.

763
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,781
We're in this together.

764
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,451
SURVIVAL CANDIDATE ZONE
ELIMINATION CANDIDATE ZONE

765
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,745
-Let's go over it.
-Okay.

766
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,121
-Let's say we start.
-First…

767
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,289
We prep the brown croaker.

768
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,207
-Prep the croaker.
-Prep the croaker.

769
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,376
-Okay. Then…
-And give me the head.

770
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,919
-I'll get the stock going.
-Then…

771
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:46,089
You blend.
I'll strain the stock and dice those.

772
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,761
First of all, regarding our team,
I couldn't be happier.

773
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,264
They said we were free
to choose our own partners.

774
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,683
…with another White Spoon chef
of their choice.

775
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,144
-We can freely pick?
-Yeah, that's right.

776
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,604
I linked arms with him right away.

777
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,314
All I need is Sam Kim.

778
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,692
I thought we'd be able to
easily accommodate each other.

779
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:10,447
Chef Sam Kim's strength is
he can draw out that depth of flavor.

780
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,116
I do feel at ease working with Chef Jung.

781
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,911
He's very good at Japanese cuisine
that packs a punch of flavor.

782
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,537
He does that well.

783
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:21,500
There are a lot of really charming
Japanese-style Italian dishes.

784
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,544
"I thought it was Japanese,
but it tastes Italian at the end."

785
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,754
That's what we're going for.

786
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,382
Delivering that experience
in a single bite

787
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,133
will make the biggest impression.

788
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,641
Chef Sam Kim and Chef Jung Ho-young
will work well together.

789
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,351
They've been on many shows together too.

790
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,478
-Then, take out the kelp.
-Okay.

791
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:44,314
-And add two handfuls of katsuobushi.
-Okay.

792
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,776
KIM SUNG-WOON, CHOI KANG-ROK

793
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,574
Chef Kim Sung-woon and Chef Choi Kang-rok…

794
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,660
Both of their styles are…

795
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:00,122
They're so quiet
you barely even notice them.

796
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,375
-Is this the abalone?
-That's the abalone.

797
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,127
And that is…

798
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,757
When these are done at the same time…

799
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,765
We communicated in our own way.

800
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,894
Yes, thank you.

801
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,646
Want me to grill them once? Or…

802
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,314
Well…

803
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,316
-Yes.
-Hold on.

804
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:29,943
So…

805
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,321
Using it raw would still be fine.

806
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,281
-Really?
-Yes.

807
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,407
Okay, then.

808
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,162
I think those two
will be a good fit though.

809
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:44,916
Chef Choi Kang-rok
does a lot of fish-based dishes,

810
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,545
and Chef Kim Sung-woon is known
for using ingredients from Taean

811
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,339
and cooking amazing dishes.

812
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:55,802
I realized they also were
an Italian and Japanese cuisine pair.

813
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,931
I was a bit wary that we might end up
with a similar combination of dishes.

814
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,063
-Was it always this big?
-Of course.

815
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,942
After considering
a variety of different fish,

816
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,113
I decided on brown croaker
since it's in season now.

817
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,868
It's miso-grilled brown croaker.

818
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:20,911
For the fish…

819
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,081
I mix Japanese white miso

820
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,253
with mirin, sugar, and rice wine.

821
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,091
It's slightly sweet and salty,

822
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,344
and this is used to marinate the fish.

823
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:43,391
We decided to grill
the miso-marinated fish over charcoal.

824
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,646
"Wouldn't it taste too Japanese
if only miso were used?"

825
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:50,607
So we decided to add an Italian aspect

826
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,361
by using an Italian ham called prosciutto.

827
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,200
I sauté the prosciutto, bacon, and onion.

828
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,205
Then, I add some fish stock to that…

829
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,254
to make a sauce full of that savory depth
you find in Italian cuisine.

830
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,423
We have the sweetness of Japanese cuisine,

831
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:19,135
so we decided to add that salty,
savory flavor of Italian cuisine.

832
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,180
But that didn't feel like it was enough.

833
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:26,852
We needed something
between the fish and the sauce.

834
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,270
Gosh, the swim bladder…

835
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,647
This is important.

836
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:41,366
The flesh of brown croaker is delicious,

837
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,119
but its swim bladder is exceptional.

838
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,329
It's big and well-developed,

839
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,624
so it has a fatty, savory taste to it.

840
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,753
We're going to make a sausage with it.

841
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,589
It's like an Italian-style sausage,

842
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,009
and we need to make the filling
that will go inside of it.

843
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,802
Could you finely chop this for me?

844
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,012
-Finely?
-Yes.

845
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,138
So I can blend it.

846
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,391
FILLING FOR SWIM BLADDER SAUSAGE
BROWN CROAKER

847
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,478
I need a sheet of paper towel.

848
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,355
-Here you go.
-Okay.

849
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,358
I need a pot.

850
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:16,776
Wait.

851
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,033
Wasn't there a spare pot?

852
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,327
You need it? It's down here.

853
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,120
-A small one? Okay.
-Here.

854
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,288
There's one more.

855
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,207
Swap this with that.

856
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:38,131
-Please give it to me once it's blanched.
-Okay.

857
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,342
Chef, can you peel more Chinese yam?

858
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:41,468
-Yam?
-Yes.

859
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,678
-You want me to peel more?
-Yes, we'll need more.

860
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,601
That was quick.

861
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,478
I've added the yam.

862
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,647
I take the grated Chinese yam…

863
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,691
It's blending nicely.

864
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,860
…with the rest of the brown croaker flesh

865
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,862
and blend them together.

866
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,531
GRATED CHINESE YAM
BLENDED BROWN CROAKER

867
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,201
I use that to make fish paste.

868
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,744
BLENDING TOGETHER TO MAKE FISH PASTE

869
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,621
Gosh, this is…

870
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,376
-What? It isn't working?
-It's a waste of time.

871
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,877
I have to hold onto it like this.

872
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,796
-It can't be helped.
-What do I do?

873
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,466
I wish someone
could hold this down for me.

874
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,848
At first, it seemed like Chef Jung
would be doing a task.

875
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,354
But then, they kept getting passed
onto me while I was doing my own.

876
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,441
While we were cooking,
our teamwork was very good.

877
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,652
-Blend it more?
-No, I think it's done.

878
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,570
We'll do the rest with that.

879
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,994
Using just fish paste can be boring,

880
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,622
so Chef Sam Kim prepped some bracken,

881
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,457
burdock root,

882
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,085
and bamboo shoots.

883
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,755
We then blanched them.

884
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,179
SWIM BLADDER SAUSAGE FILLING IS COMPLETE

885
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,306
-I'll open it just a little bit.
-Okay.

886
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,475
Wait. I'll open it just a little.

887
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,189
-Put it in deep. All the way in.
-All the way?

888
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,361
-Is it coming out?
-Yes, it is.

889
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,362
-It's coming out?
-Yes.

890
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,449
-Okay, it's going down.
-Wait, it burst here.

891
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,951
-Okay, it's going down.
-Wait, it burst here.

892
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,746
Leave it. It keeps bursting. Oh, no.

893
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:36,916
It just burst.

894
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,626
-Stop. Tie it.
-We'll have to tie it.

895
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,378
-Damn it.
-It burst.

896
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,672
It gave me a bad feeling.

897
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,841
-Let's try this first.
-Okay.

898
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,845
SECOND ATTEMPT
WITH THE REMAINING SWIM BLADDER

899
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,180
Okay, it's going in.

900
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,473
It burst again.

901
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,807
Push it down.

902
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:53,850
Stop.

903
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,603
It completely burst.

904
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,812
-Damn it.
-It burst.

905
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,314
-This is unexpected.
-Yeah.

906
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,777
The swim bladder
has to be properly steamed

907
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,820
to create a delicious dish.

908
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,949
But it just wouldn't go as planned.

909
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,785
Damn it.

910
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,954
I didn't expect it to burst.

911
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,707
We were both really thrown off.

912
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,210
I removed it perfectly earlier.

913
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:22,670
Damn it.

914
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,256
We're in trouble.

915
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,516
The main ingredients we're using are…

916
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:36,976
blue crabs,

917
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,395
abalone,

918
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,689
shrimp,

919
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,192
and monkfish.

920
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,736
Ingredients from the sea.

921
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,364
But there's also the land.

922
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:53,409
So I decided to cook a dish
using spring vegetables from the soil.

923
00:56:56,162 --> 00:57:01,417
It's a dish focused on seafood
and vegetables that are in season now.

924
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,627
The land and the sea.

925
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:06,548
It's kind of like a bouillabaisse
in Western cuisine or a stew.

926
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,926
The blue crab is the lead.

927
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,303
-Should we steam all of them?
-Sure.

928
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,139
We have a lot of crab meat.

929
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,265
They all fit.

930
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:16,933
This is plenty.

931
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,560
Let's do 30 minutes.

932
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,313
In a 100°C steamer,

933
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,817
we steamed thoroughly cleaned blue crabs

934
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,069
for about 28 minutes.

935
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,913
Every season back home,
when friends or guests come to visit,

936
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,169
we cut up the last blue crabs
and offer them to the guests first.

937
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,963
They're the last legs in the back.

938
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,381
The swimmer legs.

939
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,967
They're the easiest parts
of the blue crab to eat,

940
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,094
and they're packed with meat.

941
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,267
So, they're really tasty.

942
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,313
-With the blue crabs…
-Yes?

943
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,024
How about doing
the swimmer legs separately?

944
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:06,941
Which part?

945
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,194
In Taean, we call them swimmer legs.

946
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,487
-Here?
-Yeah.

947
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,071
What you just said

948
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,199
-made me think of this.
-Okay.

949
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,493
So there's this dish

950
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,328
where you coat them in egg

951
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,414
-and simmer them in broth.
-Okay.

952
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,625
And you don't keep simmering it…

953
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:28,546
To be honest, blue crabs tastes best
when they're simply steamed.

954
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,424
But let's go further and rework that.

955
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,009
But how?

956
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,428
With my touch.

957
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,640
Could we win with this?

958
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,683
I think we could.

959
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,479
We use the crab shells

960
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,814
to make the base of the broth.

961
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:54,113
Then, we make another broth
using katsuobushi.

962
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,534
Two different broths…

963
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,952
KATSUOBUSHI BROTH
BLUE CRAB BROTH

964
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,286
…are made.

965
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,625
BLUE CRAB BROTH
KATSUOBUSHI BROTH

966
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,213
JAPANESE MISO

967
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,799
Miso is added to both broths.

968
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,219
It's essentially miso soup.

969
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:24,143
These two are mixed
to make the final broth.

970
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,771
The ingredients will go in there too.

971
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,442
-Here are just the swimmer legs.
-Okay.

972
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,860
-I picked out the meat.
-Okay.

973
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,786
The blue crabs are battered in egg yolk

974
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,206
and poached in the broth.

975
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:52,714
The egg yolk absorbs
the flavor of the broth,

976
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,217
and it becomes similar to a braise.

977
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,388
And they don't stay in there.
We take them out.

978
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,643
Then, the shrimp goes in and out.

979
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:09,188
Everything passes through the broth.
Pass through.

980
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,024
Pass through.

981
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,029
How did you do this?

982
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,822
SHRIMP

983
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,741
The taste of blue crabs and abalone.

984
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:23,286
We discussed making
separate dishes for each.

985
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,081
After steaming them
Japanese-style with rice wine…

986
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,417
Chef, the abalone is done.

987
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,504
I take the prepped abalone,

988
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,592
and with sautéed pyogo mushrooms,
king oyster mushrooms,

989
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,344
and parsley,

990
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:46,267
I stuff the grooves
that are on the top of the abalone.

991
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:54,317
I place them stuffing-side down
in the pan and cook them thoroughly.

992
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,285
Then, we're going to make gnocchi.

993
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,453
POTATO DOUGH

994
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:10,333
We thought gnocchi stuffed with crab meat
would be better than just plain ones.

995
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:19,342
We made gnocchi in the style of ongsimi.

996
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:24,514
We're going to make
all the components carefully

997
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,099
and then try to plate it.

998
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,684
Damn it.

999
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,146
We're in trouble.

1000
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,857
Shouldn't we tie it at the end?

1001
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,361
-Or should we wrap them in plastic wrap?
-Is that possible?

1002
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,239
I'll go and try to wrap it.

1003
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,372
-No good? Should we give up?
-Giving up isn't an option.

1004
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:54,752
Here.

1005
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,963
Okay, try it.

1006
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,423
I'll put it in.

1007
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,341
-How long do we steam it?
-Fifteen minutes.

1008
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,386
The shape needs to come out right.

1009
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,268
Why am I just standing here?
Why did I stop?

1010
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,354
-What's wrong?
-I zoned out for ten seconds.

1011
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,480
For goodness' sake.

1012
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,693
-I think we need to grill the fish.
-Yeah, we need to do it now.

1013
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,616
The marinating time was a bit short,

1014
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:30,246
so I grilled them over charcoal
while basting them with the sauce.

1015
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,666
Now, as long as that turns out well…

1016
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,631
-Chef.
-Yes?

1017
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:42,425
What is it?

1018
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,676
-Look.
-Not good?

1019
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,471
-Take a look.
-What?

1020
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,939
I think it came out well.

1021
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,107
I'll give it a taste.

1022
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,871
-It's good, right?
-It's so good.

1023
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,206
-Isn't it great?
-It'll be good.

1024
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:17,001
I think I met the best partner,
Chef Sam Kim.

1025
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,586
We need to finish this now.

1026
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,464
Dressed with balsamic vinegar,

1027
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,842
we place a sweet,
tangy tomato slice on the bottom.

1028
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,763
The fatty and rich swim bladder

1029
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,349
supports the dish right in the middle.

1030
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,059
I'll take the fish.

1031
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,312
It's hot.

1032
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,691
Lastly, the sauce made with prosciutto

1033
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,237
envelops everything.

1034
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:52,078
MISO-GRILLED BROWN CROAKER
WITH PROSCIUTTO SAUCE

1035
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:56,165
There's a dish called misoyaki
in Japanese cuisine.

1036
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,710
We used white miso
to give it a touch of sweetness

1037
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,629
and grilled it over charcoal.

1038
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:05,174
And in the middle,
we used the brown croaker's swim bladder

1039
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,803
and filled it with fish paste
before steaming it.

1040
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:13,015
Lastly, we used Italian prosciutto
to add some savory flavor.

1041
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,267
PROSCIUTTO SAUCE

1042
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,393
Okay, take this…

1043
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,523
You should eat all three together.

1044
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:21,482
-Together?
-Yes.

1045
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:22,900
-Not separately?
-No.

1046
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:50,970
After eating the swim bladder,
I expected them to look pleased.

1047
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,064
I don't know for sure,

1048
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,359
but I bet you two
have cooked together a lot.

1049
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:09,280
This is the first time
we've cooked together as a team.

1050
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,948
-Really?
-Yes.

1051
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,700
Overall,

1052
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:15,828
the dish has Italian flavors
enveloping Japanese flavors.

1053
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,163
That was our intent.

1054
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,540
"Italian flavors
enveloping Japanese flavors."

1055
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,752
Thank you for the dish.

1056
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:23,794
Thank you.

1057
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,301
Brown croaker misoyaki,
prosciutto, and swim bladder.

1058
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,434
Seeing them sitting there was like

1059
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:42,480
when I listened to their feedback
as I stood in front of them in Round 2.

1060
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:45,608
The bad memories from back then

1061
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,568
resurfaced,

1062
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:49,820
and I became really nervous.

1063
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,742
The discussion time has ended.

1064
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,620
Jung Ho-young

1065
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,081
and Sam Kim are…

1066
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,043
survival candidates.

1067
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:05,753
Congratulations.

1068
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,421
…survival candidates.

1069
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,090
Congratulations.

1070
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:11,217
JUNG HO-YOUNG, SAM KIM
SURVIVAL CANDIDATES

1071
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:16,097
To be honest, I doubted
whether a slice of tomato

1072
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,724
could give off the feeling
of Italian cuisine,

1073
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:22,979
but it was truly the most ideal
and well-balanced taste.

1074
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,855
And at the end, Chef Jung Ho-young said

1075
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:28,234
it had Italian flavors
enveloping Japanese flavors,

1076
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,528
and that was what I had felt.

1077
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:32,154
I immediately thought, "Exactly."

1078
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,240
"Italian flavors enveloping
Japanese flavors,"

1079
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,658
just as you explained it.

1080
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,536
Your intent came across
to me very clearly.

1081
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,998
It was really delicious. You did great.

1082
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,499
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1083
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,338
The team of Jung Ho-young and Sam Kim,

1084
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,507
please make your way
to the Survival Candidate Zone.

1085
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:57,471
I really wanted this dish
to be appreciated.

1086
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,140
I was so proud.

1087
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,892
I survived.
I'm not being eliminated right away.

1088
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,146
Chef, should we start plating then?

1089
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:06,731
-We can start with this.
-Okay.

1090
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,649
-I'm done too.
-Okay.

1091
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:12,445
We're putting together
various components into one dish.

1092
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,322
We're combining Italian cooking techniques

1093
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:20,494
with Japanese cooking techniques.

1094
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:23,164
Even with the vegetables,
some were cooked in soy sauce.

1095
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,044
One was cooked in the oven.

1096
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,713
And another was cooked in the pan.

1097
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:36,469
We'll be adding them into a single dish
to create one finished product.

1098
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:41,015
Chef Kim Sung-woon's own cooking skills…

1099
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,355
and the type of skills I possess.

1100
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,150
I believe all of these

1101
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:52,985
can be brought together

1102
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,654
in one single dish.

1103
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:59,241
-We can pour a lot on.
-Okay.

1104
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,746
When they taste it, it'll feel like

1105
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,040
East and West

1106
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,334
coming together as one on their palate.

1107
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,878
THE LAND AND THE SEA

1108
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,345
-It's beautiful.
-I know. It looks delicious.

1109
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:23,224
Our dish is The Land and The Sea.

1110
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:27,228
First off, with his Italian cooking skills

1111
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,605
and my Japanese cooking,

1112
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:33,359
we considered what kind
of combination we could create,

1113
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,988
and I thought of a dish
using Japanese miso.

1114
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:43,661
By adding miso,
we have a sweet, crab-infused broth.

1115
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:45,871
Did you braise
all the vegetables together? Or…

1116
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,456
We divided them up.

1117
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,707
-Braised separately?
-Yes.

1118
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,626
Each vegetable cooks differently,

1119
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,044
-so you did them separately.
-Yes.

1120
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,379
Then, you put them together.

1121
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,298
-How should we eat this?
-When tasting it,

1122
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,425
I recommend starting with the swimmer leg.

1123
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,719
It's usually offered to honored guests.

1124
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,972
And we have such people here right now.

1125
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:06,183
Please start with the swimmer leg.
You can use your hands.

1126
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,644
-And the sauce?
-Add some sauce on top

1127
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:10,062
and take a large bite.

1128
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,192
Even with soy-marinated crab,

1129
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,319
there's that piece
that feels like the jackpot.

1130
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,654
That's the swimmer leg.

1131
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:22,950
When you take a bite,
all of that plump, juicy meat

1132
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,994
just comes right out.

1133
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,089
That expression.

1134
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,550
Is he hiding his feelings?
I couldn't tell.

1135
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:44,013
Next, if you taste the gnocchi,
you'll get a creamy texture inside.

1136
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,131
Thank you for your dish.

1137
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:21,634
-We'll discuss now.
-Yes.

1138
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:30,935
Well…

1139
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:35,606
-They did well.
-Yeah.

1140
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,524
-Very well.
-The broth was good and delicious.

1141
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:39,318
-Delicious and well-balanced.
-Yes.

1142
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:40,319
Also,

1143
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,489
it went from Japan to Italy,
and then Japan, and then Italy.

1144
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:44,823
-Back and forth.
-And that's…

1145
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,492
-Really fun.
-In a good way. Right.

1146
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,952
-Back and forth.
-Yes.

1147
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,955
Instead of wanting to stop,
I wondered how the next one would taste.

1148
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,623
I wondered what we'd try next.

1149
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:55,417
I think they did really well.

1150
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,878
Choi Kang-rok and Kim Sung-woon are…

1151
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:01,632
survival candidates.

1152
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:02,758
Congratulations.

1153
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:04,677
You're survival candidates.

1154
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,346
KIM SUNG-WOON, CHOI KANG-ROK
SURVIVAL CANDIDATES

1155
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:14,603
In terms of technique,

1156
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,147
every single ingredient,
such as the vegetables, the crab,

1157
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,816
the abalone, and the yam,

1158
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:20,776
they were cooked perfectly.

1159
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:24,530
I may be a judge,
but just as someone eating this dish,

1160
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:29,159
I wondered how the next bite would taste
and how the texture would be.

1161
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,413
It made me excited like a child.

1162
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:33,998
I wanted to taste each one.

1163
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:36,375
"I want another one.
Let's try this one now."

1164
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,335
I wanted to steal Mr. Paik's portion.

1165
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:40,754
If he'd missed one, I would have.

1166
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:43,424
I get very teary-eyed these days.

1167
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:44,508
Thank you.

1168
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:47,636
That kind of feedback
feels really good to hear.

1169
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,347
It was a perfectly balanced dish.
Thank you.

1170
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:55,853
Well done.

1171
01:11:58,355 --> 01:11:59,732
It really…

1172
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,734
I was so thrilled I got goosebumps.

1173
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,904
I thought, "Gosh, I might be able to
pull off something big."

1174
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,366
The tasting is complete.

1175
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,411
Now, the judges will discuss

1176
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:16,165
the team that will survive
and the team that will be eliminated.

1177
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,461
The first-place team
from the Survival Candidate Zone

1178
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,838
will advance to the Top 7.

1179
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:27,051
The last-place team
from the Elimination Candidate Zone

1180
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,552
will be eliminated.

1181
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:32,139
One team that will survive.

1182
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,475
They all did well.

1183
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:37,269
They were faithful to the basics, but…

1184
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,230
Bringing out your own style
isn't an easy thing to do.

1185
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,483
-The two of them did well.
-Yeah.

1186
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,528
I couldn't be entirely happy
that I was up there.

1187
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,739
Only one team will advance.

1188
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:51,241
I looked over at the people next to me.

1189
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,830
None of them deserved to go down.

1190
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:00,209
I don't want to do
another consolation round.

1191
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,627
The team to be eliminated…

1192
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,962
-Who do we pick?
-This is a difficult one.

1193
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,965
If I'd done as you'd said,
we would've made it.

1194
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:07,883
Not at all.

1195
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:09,343
-You did great.
-I'm sorry.

1196
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:10,260
No, not at all.

1197
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:14,098
It was tough, but it was still fun.

1198
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:18,519
The judges have made their decision.

1199
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,690
Now then,

1200
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,444
for the Two-Person Team Black
and White Spoon Alliance Battle,

1201
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,488
we will announce the results.

1202
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:37,454
First, in the Two-Person Team Black
and White Spoon Alliance Battle,

1203
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:40,290
we will announce the team
that will be eliminated.

1204
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,709
They're announcing last place team first.

1205
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,878
The teams
in the Elimination Candidate Zone are…

1206
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,922
The team of Park Hyo-nam and Choi Yu-gang.

1207
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:48,924
1964 SILK ROAD IMPERIAL LOBSTER

1208
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:54,596
There isn't a single thing
I regret about the cooking itself.

1209
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,890
The team of Hou Deok-juk
and Chun Sang-hyun.

1210
01:13:57,474 --> 01:13:58,976
MANGO LOBSTER APPETIZER

1211
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:01,895
It'd be nice if we could advance
to the next round.

1212
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,397
He's come a long way.

1213
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:07,901
And the team of Venerable Sunjae
and Kim Hee-eun.

1214
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,862
GIMBAP BANSANG

1215
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:12,531
I just do my best with the time I'm given.

1216
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:13,866
And I try to have fun.

1217
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,285
I keep getting my hopes up.

1218
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,787
In the Two-Person Team Black
and White Spoon Alliance Battle,

1219
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:20,664
the eliminated team is…

1220
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,004
the eliminated team is…

1221
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,883
Chef Choi Yu-gang and Chef Park Hyo-nam.

1222
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:33,927
-Thank you for your work.
-Thank you.

1223
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,513
PARK HYO-NAM, CHOI YU-GANG ELIMINATED

1224
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:43,729
We felt the level of harmony
between the two cuisines

1225
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,023
fell a bit short,

1226
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,442
so we selected your team.

1227
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,945
In the end, it's a competition.

1228
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,490
Except for one winner,
everyone will be eliminated.

1229
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,658
I was able to make it this far

1230
01:14:56,742 --> 01:15:01,205
and be in the same class as my mentor.

1231
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,415
"Yu-gang, you tried really hard
and cooked well."

1232
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,209
That's just what I want to tell myself.

1233
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,835
I don't have any regrets.

1234
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,505
Being eliminated
doesn't mean you're left behind.

1235
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:10,881
There's always a way forward.

1236
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:14,760
I'm truly happy that I made it this far.

1237
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,471
And I'm really grateful. I mean it.

1238
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:19,306
There are two spots here together.

1239
01:15:19,389 --> 01:15:20,933
Yeah, let's put them here.

1240
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:30,442
Let's go together.

1241
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,153
PARK HYO-NAM, CHOI YU-GANG

1242
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:35,155
Now, moving on,

1243
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:38,700
we will announce the one surviving team

1244
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:43,121
that will secure
their place in the Top 7 first.

1245
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,541
We need to go straight there.

1246
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:46,708
I really want to.

1247
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,126
We'll make it.

1248
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,419
It'll be us.

1249
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,588
The teams
in the Survival Candidate Zone are…

1250
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,174
The team of Im Seong-keun
and Brewmaster Yun.

1251
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,970
It was a perfectly balanced dish.

1252
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:01,390
I thought, "I haven't had a lettuce wrap
this delicious in recent memory."

1253
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,433
The team of Son Jong-won
and Culinary Monster.

1254
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:07,271
The apples, caviar,
buttery flavor, and all those things.

1255
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:10,524
It was a very delicious
and well-executed dish.

1256
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:12,609
The team of Jung Ho-young and Sam Kim.

1257
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:15,028
"Italian flavors enveloping
Japanese flavors."

1258
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,655
That was what I had felt.

1259
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:20,033
It was truly the most ideal
and well-balanced taste.

1260
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,494
The team of Kim Sung-woon
and Choi Kang-rok.

1261
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,581
It was like hopping between tasty Japanese
and Italian restaurants.

1262
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,708
It wasn't tiring, and it was really fun.

1263
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:29,668
I wanted to steal Mr. Paik's portion.

1264
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:32,212
In the Two-Person Team Black
and White Spoon Alliance Battle,

1265
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:33,422
the first-place team is…

1266
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:41,221
Im Seong-keun and Brewmaster Yun.

1267
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,682
Im Seong-keun and Brewmaster Yun.

1268
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,058
Congratulations.

1269
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:49,396
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

1270
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:50,439
Chef.

1271
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,524
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

1272
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,026
They were the first to finish too.

1273
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,277
Congratulations.

1274
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,945
-Very impressive.
-Very impressive.

1275
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,905
Their dish must've been really good.

1276
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:02,117
What we regarded as most important

1277
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,203
was the harmony and balance
between teammates.

1278
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,332
Would the pork galbi by itself
have been enough

1279
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:10,042
to draw a positive reaction?

1280
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,251
If they hadn't prepared

1281
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:14,755
their humble radish salad,
lettuce wraps, and ssamjang,

1282
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:17,466
we felt that synergy
would not have been there.

1283
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,177
After tasting Chef Im's pork galbi,

1284
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,056
I made a lettuce wrap
with the radish salad and ssamjang.

1285
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,557
But right when I ate it,

1286
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,059
without the need for words,

1287
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:30,062
both of your unique styles
came across to me so distinctly.

1288
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:34,274
They managed to blend
their own unique styles so naturally,

1289
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:35,817
which was quite moving.

1290
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:39,071
If they opened a restaurant together
and added that dish to the menu,

1291
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,947
I think I'd go quite often to eat it.

1292
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:43,200
From the first round until now,

1293
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:46,036
I just can't believe all the things
that have happened to me.

1294
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:50,999
For me, teaming up
with Chef Im in this round was…

1295
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:54,336
a great honor.

1296
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:57,047
-Thank you so much, Chef. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1297
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,591
-Thank you.
-She's about to cry.

1298
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,718
Don't cry. Why are you crying?
It's a good thing.

1299
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,554
Seeing how smoothly
they finished their dish in just an hour,

1300
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:06,973
I could tell they were pros
on a whole different level.

1301
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,023
They eliminate us, and they send us on…

1302
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,526
Then, are the remaining people
going to do something else?

1303
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:19,903
Probably.

1304
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:22,656
For the five teams
whose fates have not been decided,

1305
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,869
please return to your cooking stations.

1306
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,249
We have to cook again?

1307
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:33,333
What?

1308
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,379
Gosh, I'm tired.
We're doing something else?

1309
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:40,716
-Are we doing another battle?
-I think so.

1310
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:41,967
-Right away?
-Damn it.

1311
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,347
If they eliminate us at our stations,
that would be so cruel.

1312
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,893
Now, the remaining spots in the Top 7

1313
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:54,146
are down to just five.

1314
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:57,315
TEN REMAINING CANDIDATES

1315
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,278
Now,

1316
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:06,825
we will reveal how the rest
of the Top 7 finalists will be decided.

1317
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:12,831
What is it?

1318
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,129
What on earth?

1319
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,300
It's turning!

1320
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:26,928
They're turning.

1321
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:28,722
They're turning around!

1322
01:19:30,056 --> 01:19:31,266
They're turning!

1323
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:32,434
The stations are turning!

1324
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,649
This really is something else.

1325
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,401
This is what it was?

1326
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,237
Unbelievable.

1327
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,449
-They made the stations turn.
-I can't believe it.

1328
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,534
I did not see this coming.

1329
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:53,288
This is killing me.

1330
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,250
The second battle of the fourth round is…

1331
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,963
the one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle.

1332
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,346
Your opponent in this one-on-one battle…

1333
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:15,018
is standing right in front of you.

1334
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:19,356
Like this?

1335
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:21,191
I just got chills.

1336
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:22,275
What do we do?

1337
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:24,027
This is so annoying.

1338
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:26,321
We'll be facing each other.

1339
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,904
