1
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,060
The voting is complete.

2
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,356
The result is…

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,318
two to zero.

4
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,990
…two to zero.

5
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,284
…two to zero.

6
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,077
Please.

7
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,293
Judges, please remove your blindfolds.

8
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,091
Goodness, Venerable Sunjae.

9
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,009
Hello.

10
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,218
Goodness, Venerable Sunjae.

11
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,845
Hello.

12
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,638
I was so surprised.

13
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,183
Gosh, how did you two end up together?

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,895
So this was Venerable Sunjae's dish.

15
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,398
What was the crunchy ingredient?

16
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,691
It was Korean melon.

17
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,776
-Korean melon.
-Really?

18
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,236
-Korean melon with the rind on.
-With the rind on,

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,322
the aroma really came through.

20
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,699
Normally, with pine nut noodles,

21
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,701
there's an oiliness from the pine nut,

22
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,037
but every single bite was refreshing.

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,289
As I was eating this, I could tell

24
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,211
you put a lot of thought into this dish,
perhaps even more so than a chef would.

25
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,254
-Thank you.
-Yes.

26
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,798
Dweji-Gomtang in NY,

27
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,300
your dish really tastes
like temple cuisine.

28
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,136
If you weren't here
and we were told to guess,

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,224
we'd find it hard to tell
which was made by Venerable Sunjae.

30
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,477
I came to know about temple cuisine
from Venerable Sunjae,

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,103
and she is someone I truly respect.

32
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,688
Rather than consider this a match,

33
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,732
I cooked with the mindset
of a practitioner.

34
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,734
This dish also

35
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,695
brought out the aroma
of the vegetables so well.

36
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,452
It's time to announce the results
of the Gapyeong pine nut battle.

37
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,038
The survivor
of this one-on-one face-off is…

38
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,760
Black Spoon Chef Dweji-Gomtang in NY.

39
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,806
DWEJI-GOMTANG IN NY SURVIVES

40
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,769
Black Spoon Chef Dweji-Gomtang in NY.

41
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,646
-Really?
-That's crazy!

42
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,524
Black Spoon Chef Dweji-Gomtang in NY.

43
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,402
Goodness, Dweji-Gomtang in NY.

44
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,116
Both of these dishes

45
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,618
definitely cleanse the heart and mind,

46
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,289
but all the different flavors
coming through are what swayed me.

47
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,916
Still, both were delicious. Thank you.

48
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,752
When I tasted the noodles,

49
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,089
I thought,
"This is it. This can't be beaten."

50
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,508
It was so delicious in all aspects,

51
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,052
the aroma was perfect,
and I thought this was the one.

52
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,596
But when I tasted this,

53
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,057
it was like the taste of nature itself,
and I saw the care put into it.

54
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:07,353
I think the doneness
of the vegetables and such

55
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,522
was where I put more focus
in making my decision.

56
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,649
Thank you for giving us
this valuable experience.

57
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,234
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

58
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,195
-Thank you, Venerable Sunjae.
-Thank you.

59
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,156
It felt really strange.

60
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,911
Personally, my dish was influenced
by Venerable Sunjae.

61
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:27,165
With a practitioner's mindset,
I followed the teachings of the Venerable,

62
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,792
so I was grateful I had cooked in that way

63
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,836
and that I could have
that kind of attitude.

64
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,672
Monks aren't the only ones who train.

65
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,591
People who cook are also practitioners.

66
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,552
He cooked his dish with that mindset,

67
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,013
so I am very grateful for that.

68
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,600
I truly hope he becomes a happy chef.

69
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,481
VENERABLE SUNJAE

70
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,735
Gosh, that knife…

71
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,779
It must be so old.

72
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,406
Master Hou Deok-juk?

73
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,618
I can't believe I get to see
his cooking here.

74
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,371
I've never seen him cook either.

75
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,667
I doubt many in Korea have.

76
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,632
I never thought I'd see him in person,

77
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,676
especially here on Culinary Class Wars.

78
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,053
This is my first time. It's a real honor.

79
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,350
He was the first chef to be given
an executive position at a corporation.

80
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,977
He's the one who made Palsun.

81
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,771
Winner of the Michelin Guide Ceremony 2024

82
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,315
Mentor Chef Award,

83
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,817
Chef Hou Deok-juk.

84
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,111
In the world of Chinese cuisine,

85
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,904
we consider him to be the best.

86
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,656
When I first started cooking,

87
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,951
Chef Hou Deok-juk
is a legendary figure in Chinese cuisine.

88
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,079
Every word he's said
and every article about him

89
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,498
was like learning
about a historical figure for me.

90
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,917
They say you shouldn't even step
on your teacher's shadow.

91
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,294
That's how revered he is.

92
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,965
My name is Hou Deok-juk.

93
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,177
I have 57 years of cooking experience.

94
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,723
I worked at The Shilla for 43 years

95
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,435
and was the first chef to receive
an executive position at a corporation.

96
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,230
Back when I was at The Shilla,

97
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,691
I was trying to develop a new dish

98
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,152
and introduced
"Buddha Jumps Over the Wall."

99
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,238
PRAISED BY HU JINTAO AND JIANG ZEMIN
AS "BETTER THAN THE CHINESE VERSION"

100
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,782
When Korea and China
were establishing diplomatic ties,

101
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,118
I was in charge of the VIP dinner.

102
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,705
And this year,

103
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,832
for the second consecutive year,

104
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,918
we were awarded one Michelin star.

105
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,505
He's even more respected

106
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,883
because he's still active
in the industry at his age.

107
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,969
They call me "the master of
Chinese cuisine" or "the top authority,"

108
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,139
but that's not what I want to hear.

109
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,685
Cooking alongside
the rest of the kitchen staff…

110
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,355
That's what I think is important.

111
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,276
White Spoon Chef Hou Deok-juk,

112
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,278
please step forward.

113
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,782
This is incredible.

114
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,244
I think I'm probably the oldest here.

115
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,624
I made up my mind
and came here to set a good example.

116
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,088
Hello.

117
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,841
After 57 years as a chef,

118
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,220
today, I'd like to take on

119
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,474
one final challenge from my juniors.

120
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,475
Yes.

121
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,190
It sounds like he's warning them
not to step forward.

122
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,901
Who would dare to challenge Master Hou?

123
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,498
Right. She's a Chinese cuisine chef.

124
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,508
WITCH WITH A WOK
CHEF AT WALKERHILL HOTEL

125
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,801
Oh, someone is…

126
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,596
I will go out as well.

127
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,642
Oh, Fan Master!

128
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,437
-He cooks eel.
-Yes, eel. He's not in Chinese cuisine.

129
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,443
FAN MASTER
CHEF-OWNER OF TOKYO BABSANG

130
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,610
But that chef

131
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,737
does Japanese cuisine.

132
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,907
I'd like to write a new chapter
in the legacy

133
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,536
of Chinese cuisine's living legend.

134
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,500
I may not work in Chinese cuisine,

135
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,878
but I once worked at Palsun,

136
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,798
and you were tossing woks
while I was in charge of steamed dishes.

137
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,969
I guess they have a history.

138
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,387
At Palsun.

139
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,139
When he was tossing woks.

140
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,308
This was 20 years ago,

141
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,228
but I started my cooking career
with Chinese cuisine.

142
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,940
At the time, he was an executive there.

143
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,444
I wanted to remember that brief period

144
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,446
when we shared the same space.

145
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,991
You said you worked at Palsun in the past,

146
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,868
so I'd like to see

147
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,205
how much your skills have improved

148
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,332
over the years.

149
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,583
-Thank you.
-Yes.

150
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,171
We're as far apart as heaven and earth,

151
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,881
so with this opportunity,

152
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:30,384
I'll try to rise a little higher
off the ground

153
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,553
and do my best in today's match.

154
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,556
What is Chef Hou Deok-juk's
main ingredient?

155
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,683
It's blue crab from Taean.

156
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,061
Are they normally that big?

157
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,607
He's still lighting charcoal.

158
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,485
He's just going to cook them like that?

159
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,820
No way.

160
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,409
Blue crabs straight over charcoal?

161
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,119
He's grilling the crabs?

162
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,163
Yes, grilling them whole.

163
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,042
I wonder how that will taste.

164
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:07,630
Do people normally grill whole crabs
like that over charcoal?

165
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,799
Grilled blue crabs are really good.

166
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,053
Look at that wrist action.

167
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,222
The way his wrist moves is something else.

168
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,766
He really is a fan master.

169
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,021
That fan will hypnotize you
if you keep looking at it.

170
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,524
I see why he insists on using that.

171
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,945
I have some skills of my own.

172
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,200
It's about setting the dish apart

173
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,661
with the same ingredient.

174
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,665
How will you cook it?
Deep-fry it? Stir-fry it?

175
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,337
It seems Chef Hou is steaming them.

176
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,345
He's going to steam them with sake.

177
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,474
Chef Hou is steaming them,

178
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,477
while he's grilling them first.

179
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,564
It's that clean crab taste

180
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,150
versus that grilled flavor.

181
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,319
Grilled ones are much better?

182
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,904
Generally speaking,
grilled ones taste better.

183
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,740
-Generally speaking.
-Right.

184
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,908
What is Fan Master making?

185
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,201
What did he say he was making?

186
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,162
He wouldn't say.

187
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,624
I didn't want to limit myself
to just Japanese cuisine.

188
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,627
As a Korean, I wanted to make
Korean food with them.

189
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,045
Let's get started.

190
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,633
I'm using a Korean cast iron
cauldron lid as a grill.

191
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,885
I'll complete the dish with it.

192
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,388
What is he pouring in?

193
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,143
-What's that?
-What is it?

194
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,147
I'll cook the rice on the cauldron lid.

195
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,608
He's stir-frying the rice.

196
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,069
Is he making something like a paella?

197
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,446
It looks a bit like a paella.

198
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,573
It's based on Spanish cuisine.

199
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,992
Spanish paella.

200
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,369
But it's not paella.

201
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,579
It's like a paella, but it's not a paella.

202
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,873
I can't tell what he'll do
with the grilled crabs.

203
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,249
The innards are all still there.

204
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,419
Will he use them as a garnish?

205
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,762
I take out the meat
from the grilled blue crabs.

206
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,143
Damn, that looks delicious.

207
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,772
I add it to the rice.

208
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,110
Isn't that the stock he made earlier?

209
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,861
I see. The stock.

210
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,576
How much flavor was brought out
from the ingredient?

211
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,039
How much can you bring out?

212
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,166
That looks delicious.

213
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,627
I'm going to make a marinated crab sauce.

214
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,673
I'll make it clear that this dish
was made with blue crabs.

215
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,467
I think he likes to make dishes

216
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,344
where the ingredients really stand out,

217
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,679
like he did with the eel.

218
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,890
I want to make it obvious
it was made with blue crabs.

219
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,101
That's what I plan to serve.

220
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,687
Chef Hou's dish is bound to be good.

221
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,606
Crab meat.

222
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,818
First, I'll steam them.

223
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,781
Then, I'll pick out all the meat.

224
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,741
Shelling crab is the hardest job.

225
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,368
-Picking the meat is so hard.
-Yes.

226
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,706
It can make it easier for people
to eat the dish.

227
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,667
Making it enjoyable is what matters most.

228
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,753
You can eat a lot of just the meat,

229
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,047
so it's very convenient.

230
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,887
Then, I need to stir-fry
the picked crab meat dry.

231
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,140
He's keeping it very simple.

232
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,267
With his skills,
I bet he scoops with a ladle

233
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,894
and just knows how many grams he has.

234
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,605
I can't believe I'm witnessing…

235
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,399
a master's wok tossing.

236
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,361
After stir-frying, I plate the crab meat.

237
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,364
Do you know what he's making?

238
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,659
The dish I'm preparing today is

239
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,620
blue crab foo young.

240
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,372
The cooking method called foo young

241
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,500
essentially refers to egg whites.

242
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,336
You don't use the yolk

243
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,630
and separate the whites from them.

244
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,258
Add a little cream

245
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,053
and whisk thoroughly.

246
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,848
Then, you deep-fry
the egg whites in a wok.

247
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,648
The egg whites will slowly rise up.

248
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,735
Then, I take the fried foo young

249
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,279
and stir-fry it in the wok again.

250
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,784
I add the crab roe and make the sauce.

251
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,079
He's so relaxed.

252
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,832
I need to learn that dish.

253
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,584
-Right.
-That blue crab dish.

254
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,005
I think Chef Hou is basically done.

255
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,049
How does he make it so simple?

256
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,259
He's on another level.

257
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,843
One person steams,

258
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,805
and the other grills.

259
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,143
I think paella is a strong dish
in this competition.

260
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,522
That texture will taste really crispy
with the eyes closed.

261
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,816
He used a cauldron lid,

262
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,776
-so the rice would've formed a crust.
-Exactly.

263
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:21,819
You're right.

264
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,072
I'm confident when it comes to flavor.

265
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,370
Gosh, if I had a bite of that dish…

266
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,290
I bet it's so savory and delicious.

267
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,250
I'd never seen it done with blue crab.

268
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,628
Ding.

269
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,757
I'm sure I'll win.

270
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,720
I wonder who will win.

271
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,389
The battle of Taean blue crab.

272
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,974
Please enter.

273
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,737
Please taste the first dish.

274
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,629
It was made in a style I'd never imagined.

275
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,964
I thought,
"So it can be made this way too."

276
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,549
As a Korean,

277
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,844
I made a paella
using a cauldron-lid grill.

278
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,389
I'll mix the rice well with the crab meat,

279
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,643
add the marinated crab sauce on top,

280
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,686
and serve it to them for tasting.

281
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,534
It's rice.

282
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,709
It's not too overpowering.

283
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,919
-Yeah.
-What I mean is,

284
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,421
strong seasoning can overpower
the flavor of the crab,

285
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,215
but the taste of crab lingers.

286
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,510
It feels like the crab's been broken down
to make this rice dish.

287
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,928
I don't know how it was made,

288
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,264
but it feels like the flavor of the crab
was absorbed into the rice well.

289
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,100
-Yes.
-It's a little…

290
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,434
There was a sauce on top,

291
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,312
which helped bring out the crab flavor.

292
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,564
It tastes familiar but also…

293
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,192
kind of foreign.

294
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,113
He picked up the exact flavor

295
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,365
I had intended to create.

296
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,119
It has a Western base
and a Korean base too.

297
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,621
There's a bit of Japanese cuisine
in the process too.

298
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,291
Next, please taste the second dish.

299
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,551
BLUE CRAB FOO YOUNG

300
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,970
It has an intense blue crab flavor.

301
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,266
And its soft texture makes it easy to eat.

302
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,059
Once they taste it,

303
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:03,188
they'll think, "I didn't know
a dish like this existed."

304
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,668
It tastes really familiar.

305
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,092
If you go to Shanghai in late autumn,

306
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,928
they have a dish similar to this

307
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,890
using Chinese mitten crab and its roe.

308
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,684
Gosh, it takes a lot of work
to make this dish though.

309
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,728
But they made it with blue crab…

310
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,688
The flavor was really brought out.

311
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,149
If you add in a lot
of other flavors or aromas,

312
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,068
the crab meat…

313
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,987
loses its flavor, in a sense.

314
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,281
Or it may taste too much like seasoning,

315
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,700
but this is so clean.

316
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,080
I don't ever get nervous.

317
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,290
Now,

318
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,293
please select the dish

319
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:10,214
that is more delicious
and better utilized the main ingredient.

320
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,268
The voting is complete.

321
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,105
The result is…

322
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,857
one to one.

323
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,453
The result is…

324
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,206
one to one.

325
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,209
…one to one.

326
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,629
-It's one to one.
-They're split again.

327
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,673
That's incredible.

328
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,967
A tie with Chef Hou Deok-juk?

329
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,010
This is shocking.

330
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,097
It was a tie,

331
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,183
so my heart was pounding.

332
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,103
If I can defeat a master,

333
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,189
that's something I can take pride in.

334
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,444
I wasn't nervous at all before,

335
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,196
but I started to feel a bit uneasy.

336
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,409
It was one to one?

337
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,619
PAIK JONG-WON, HOU DEOK-JUK
ANH SUNG-JAE, FAN MASTER

338
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,579
Yes, it's this.

339
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,247
This dish,

340
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,501
is truly outstanding in terms of skill.

341
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,295
But…

342
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,882
This was in there, but to be honest…

343
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,633
Yeah.

344
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,511
-Really? Because of the shell?
-In this one.

345
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,888
Because of the shell, I…

346
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,516
-I made that choice.
-I got this from that one.

347
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,143
-Really?
-Yeah.

348
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,271
Really?

349
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,153
It's rice.

350
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,413
-I got one from that.
-Mine was from this.

351
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,956
-Wow.
-So for me,

352
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,416
I wasn't intending to criticize.

353
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,711
I thought this would be inevitable
with crab dishes

354
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,213
and just set it down.

355
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,048
To be honest,

356
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,551
snow crab and red snow crab meat
can be pulled out cleanly,

357
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,262
but Korean blue crabs
are very hard to prep.

358
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,430
Gosh.

359
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,684
There was no point
in talking about the shells.

360
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,144
So purely based on taste…

361
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,106
Contestants, please reenter.

362
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,566
END OF JUDGES' DISCUSSION

363
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,281
Goodness.

364
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,908
-Hello.
-Hello.

365
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,370
-Hello.
-Gosh, it was Master Hou.

366
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,042
I will announce the result.

367
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,213
In today's battle

368
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,757
of Taean blue crab…

369
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,643
White Spoon Chef Hou Deok-juk
has survived.

370
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,812
Congratulations.

371
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,064
Thank you.

372
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,400
-Congratulations.
-You did great.

373
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,361
So purely based on taste…

374
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,405
This tastes far better.

375
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,031
-Far better.
-It's on another level.

376
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,284
This one shows a completely
different skill level.

377
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,495
This is definitely something I'd order
at a Chinese restaurant.

378
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,122
It's on another level.

379
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,832
Who on earth is the chef?

380
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,292
-This is just…
-Gosh.

381
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,461
I could just taste it.

382
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,879
This was made by a true master.

383
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,508
If you find it hard to keep it simple
and continue to add things,

384
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,260
you can just tell.

385
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,637
You add more because you feel unsure.

386
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,681
But this dish was full of confidence.

387
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,016
The cooking was on point,

388
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,476
and the flavor and details
were carefully calculated.

389
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,937
Congratulations.

390
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,480
Good job.

391
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,860
He was truly a master.

392
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,362
True class never fades.

393
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,907
It's over.

394
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,789
FAN MASTER

395
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,461
We have another starred chef here
for the White Spoons.

396
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,087
How many stars does that make?

397
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,466
I think he'll make something
really high-end,

398
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,509
like what you get in fine dining.

399
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,054
He's the very definition of fine dining.

400
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,182
LEE JUN
CHEF-OWNER OF SOIGNÉ

401
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,725
He's truly a genius.

402
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,643
Like the Steve Jobs of the culinary world.

403
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,104
He has two Michelin stars.

404
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,647
AWARDED TWO MICHELIN STARS 2023-2025

405
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,940
"Soigné" means

406
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,735
"immaculately prepared"
or "flawlessly executed."

407
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,987
And Chef Lee Jun truly is soigné.

408
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,074
His kitchen walls are made of glass.

409
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,117
Everything is set up perfectly.

410
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,121
He strives for perfection.

411
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,669
To this day, one of the things
I'm still proud of is

412
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,714
I started fine dining

413
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,301
back during a time when the concept as we
know it today didn't even exist in Korea.

414
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,346
The texture is exactly halfway
between fish and chicken.

415
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,722
1 STAR IN 2016
2 STARS IN 2023

416
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,975
Since I'm maintaining
two Michelin stars right now,

417
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,354
I'll do my utmost,
whether it's technique or taste,

418
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,689
to show what I can do.

419
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,943
If anyone wishes to write

420
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,154
a small bit of history with me
in a fine dining battle,

421
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,447
please step forward.

422
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,535
Of course.

423
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,663
REBELLIOUS GENIUS
HEAD CHEF OF ORIGINAL NUMBERS

424
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,705
Of course.

425
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,083
This was bound to happen.

426
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,417
This will be interesting.

427
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,339
Chef Lee Jun was the only person
on my mind.

428
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,384
The one who wants to defeat me the most
stepped forward.

429
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,261
The one who's cooking rabbit over there.

430
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,972
He was my sous chef.

431
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,432
WORKED TOGETHER AT SOIGNÉ
AS CHEF-OWNER AND SOUS CHEF

432
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,852
The dish I prepared
is called "Rabbit and Rabbit Liver."

433
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,603
It's brave of you to do this here.

434
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,896
-You're rebellious.
-Yes.

435
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,524
My title has the word "rebellious" in it,

436
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,027
and I believe this is because of you.

437
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,281
Back then, he would always tell me,

438
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,908
"Hey, you can't do that.
That's going too far."

439
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,119
If his dishes had always
been balanced and delicious,

440
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,787
they'd be selling somewhere right now.

441
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,164
From my point of view,

442
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,126
he's a too much of a precise person.

443
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,046
He likes things to be exact,
as if measured with a ruler.

444
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,092
He likes to arrange things neatly,
like he's playing Tetris.

445
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,179
If he's the type
to aim for the perfect dish,

446
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,097
I'm not like that.

447
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,100
I'm going to take on this challenge
using what I learned from him.

448
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,311
I'd like him to surpass me,

449
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,189
but I also want to show him
the bar is higher than he thinks.

450
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,445
It's probably Uiryeong, right?

451
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,324
I had a region in mind.

452
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,535
Uiryeong would have an ingredient
we both could do well with.

453
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,912
I was 90% sure.

454
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,914
-Let's go.
-Okay.

455
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,042
-Uiryeong.
-Uiryeong.

456
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,835
When he mentioned that region,

457
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,047
there was one local specialty
that came to mind.

458
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,302
The main ingredient from Uiryeong
will now be revealed.

459
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,224
I knew it.

460
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,893
Your main ingredient is…

461
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,687
Uiryeong quail.

462
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,815
They got the perfect ingredient.

463
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,651
Uiryeong is known for quail.

464
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,738
Chef Lee Jun

465
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,783
uses quail in his dishes
for more than half the year.

466
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,662
Most of what he knows

467
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,248
will probably be close to what I know.

468
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:44,417
It's an ingredient
we're both familiar with.

469
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,212
It will be a fierce battle.

470
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,551
Quail is one of the many
quality ingredients

471
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,053
produced here in Korea.

472
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,513
But no one actually eats it.

473
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:01,268
So how can I get people
to appreciate this ingredient more?

474
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,938
I'm going to debone the leg
so it's easier to eat.

475
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,651
Like removing a sock,

476
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,070
I peel the skin down to the ankle.

477
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,740
I take all the meat off the bone,

478
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,327
lightly chop it,

479
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,329
marinate it,

480
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,124
and like putting the sock back on,

481
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,917
I stuff the skin with the meat.

482
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,171
From the outside,
it'll seem like it has a bone.

483
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,965
But when you actually eat it,

484
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,509
the leg will be boneless.

485
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,094
After coating the legs with a sauce

486
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,638
made from roasted garlic and doenjang,

487
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,598
I'll grill them over charcoal.

488
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,436
It'll be similar to yangnyeom chicken

489
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,146
and make you think, "This is familiar."

490
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,444
As for Rebellious Genius's dish,

491
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,654
if he makes exactly what I'm expecting,

492
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,115
that would be the biggest letdown.

493
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,075
If he can only offer what I taught him,

494
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,618
it means he has no potential.

495
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,387
First, I trim all the nails from the feet.

496
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,981
I wanted to make sure
the quail was the star of this dish.

497
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,818
I thought about how I could use
all the different parts

498
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,822
and decided to use the feet
by drying them in the dehydrator.

499
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,283
As for the quail breasts,

500
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,953
I'll coat them in a garlic glaze…

501
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,466
And I'll turn them into skewers.

502
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,260
It's a blind tasting,

503
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,805
so it has to taste good in a single bite.

504
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,349
That's why I made them into skewers.

505
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,601
I'll lay some brioche
over the quail breast.

506
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,521
And I'll put sautéed mushrooms
on top of that.

507
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,398
They look so peculiar.

508
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,441
-Right?
-Yes. They look like skewers.

509
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,362
On the very top,
I'll add a poached quail egg.

510
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,493
It'll feature every part of the quail.

511
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,039
I learned how to cook from Chef Lee Jun,

512
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,916
so I made a real effort

513
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:34,921
to make sure his influence
stayed out of my dish.

514
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,133
I thought about how I could create a dish
that was purely mine.

515
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,809
Whether it's chicken or quail,

516
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,937
I felt it was important

517
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,732
to eat every part of the bird.

518
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,817
I take all the breast meat

519
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,320
and roll it up like gimbap with the skin

520
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,782
to create a sausage-like shape.

521
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,618
Quail isn't a popular ingredient,

522
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,747
so I'll use elements
that will make it more accessible.

523
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,875
I glaze the quail with garlic butter

524
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,711
and coat it with ground pine nuts

525
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,091
to give it a distinctly
Korean flavor profile.

526
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,139
"Will it be more enjoyable
if I cook it this way?"

527
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,808
That's the kind of thought
that went into this dish.

528
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,280
What's that?

529
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,449
-What on earth is that?
-What?

530
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,620
What is that?

531
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,873
That's shocking.

532
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,960
On bowls that look like quail nests,

533
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,505
I'll layer the bottom with quail bones.

534
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,799
And I'll plate the food on top of that.

535
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,176
I'm not just serving quail meat.

536
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,386
Everything is made from quail.

537
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,309
My goal is to earn a tie.

538
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,478
I just want to avoid being swept.

539
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,356
-Let's go.
-Good luck!

540
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,484
Chef, one second.

541
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,363
Wait, this is tipping.

542
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:27,033
The quail eggs on top
were about to slip off.

543
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,701
My quail. I need to be careful.

544
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,372
That's not something you see every day.

545
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,791
Pushing the cart while holding the dish.

546
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,262
This is the battle of Uiryeong quail.

547
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,306
I'm curious to see
what they've done with the quail.

548
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,687
Now, please taste the first dish.

549
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,064
GARLIC-INFUSED QUAIL BREAST ROULADE
AND GRILLED QUAIL LEGS

550
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,734
The quail breast is paired
with the flavors of pine nut and garlic.

551
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,905
The quail legs were marinated
and grilled over charcoal

552
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,740
to bring out
that rich flavor of dark meat.

553
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,161
When you're blindfolded,
your other senses become more focused,

554
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,497
so I put a lot of thought
into the texture.

555
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,963
First, they'll taste the delicate texture
of the tenderly cooked breast.

556
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,308
I'll guide your hand for the second bite.

557
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,811
There's bone in the middle,
so be careful as you eat it.

558
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,896
Okay.

559
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,148
Is this it?

560
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,525
-Yes, that's the bone…
-My gosh, are these toes?

561
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,860
-Are these toes?
-Yes.

562
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,487
-The toes are all there?
-Yes.

563
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,822
You need to use your hand

564
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,241
to hold the leg and eat it,

565
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,160
so in addition to the sensation
in your mouth,

566
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,787
there's also the sensation you feel
with your hands.

567
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,726
They used garlic
to pair with Uiryeong quail.

568
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,563
He used garlic in his dish,

569
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,398
and I knew it would taste good.

570
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,984
It was very like him.

571
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,196
The doneness was well-executed.

572
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,617
The quail was made more approachable

573
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,620
by infusing it with garlic,
like the way you would with chicken.

574
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,413
That little bite
felt like the whole quail.

575
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,624
Very nice.

576
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:44,712
In a way, that's the kind of feedback
I want to hear the most from people.

577
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,173
It's an approach that satisfies everyone.

578
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,969
Next, please taste the second dish.

579
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,230
The name of the dish is simply "Quail."

580
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,148
It's quail breast

581
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,609
with a poached quail egg.

582
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,529
With one bite,
you get the burst of the quail egg

583
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,822
and the flavor of quail.

584
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,867
And though it may not
be an element of flavor,

585
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,954
the skewer I used was the quail foot.

586
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,040
And using quail bones for the plate

587
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,001
is like the story of the monk Wonhyo.

588
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,170
They'll consume something
without knowing what it is,

589
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,840
and when they see it
after taking off their blindfolds,

590
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,384
I thought that would be fun.

591
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,929
I saw it but couldn't figure out
what it was.

592
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,474
It was as if a quail
was holding a piece of bread.

593
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,143
It was very creative.

594
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,562
I wondered what kind of place
could do him justice.

595
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,440
Okay, and bite down.

596
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,650
I'll take this out.

597
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,173
I think this has quail egg inside.

598
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,427
Isn't that what this rich creaminess is?

599
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,679
I think there's a mix of things.

600
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,894
I've had quail many times,

601
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,604
but this is really unique.

602
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,568
The first quail dish

603
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,112
felt like a full-course meal,
whereas this one…

604
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,281
hits you all at once.

605
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,371
I've only ever had grilled quail,

606
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,415
but this way also works well.

607
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,625
Goodness.

608
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,419
Both have their own appeal.

609
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,841
The voting is complete.

610
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,012
The result is one to one.

611
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,482
PAIK JONG-WON, REBELLIOUS GENIUS
ANH SUNG-JAE, LEE JUN

612
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,858
The result is one to one.

613
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,905
He tied Chef Lee Jun.

614
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,658
One to one?

615
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,831
Judges, please remove your blindfolds.

616
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,000
What is this?

617
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,671
-What the hell is this?
-What on earth?

618
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,219
I was so startled.

619
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,390
That is so wild.

620
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,351
This dish delivered a big punch.

621
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,687
It was bold, so I liked it.

622
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,523
This one was really subtle and delicate,

623
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,816
while this one was bold.

624
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,277
But the overall…

625
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,654
doneness is better in this dish.

626
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,905
This was better.

627
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,657
But both tasted good.

628
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,700
-Both were good.
-Yeah.

629
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,618
But for this one, when I tasted it,

630
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,412
it was pretty wild.

631
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,914
I've already achieved my goal.

632
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,832
Really?

633
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,001
-I've achieved my goal.
-But…

634
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:10,918
It looked good.

635
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,297
I was really happy that he did well.

636
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,050
But at the same time, I wanted to win.

637
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,927
-Well done.
-You too, Chef.

638
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,220
Really, you did so well.

639
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,930
Seriously, who…

640
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,099
-Whose is that?
-I really want to know.

641
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,894
We've decided.

642
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,189
Contestants, please reenter.

643
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,653
Hello.

644
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,574
You made a dish that suits your title.

645
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,534
It's rebellious.

646
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,577
Were these…

647
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,330
Did we put these in our mouths?

648
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,706
Why did you do this?

649
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,499
The theme was quail,

650
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,377
and my goal was to express
every aspect with quail,

651
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,963
so I wanted to use everything.

652
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,173
Very rebellious.

653
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,426
In contrast, this felt like
a textbook quail dish.

654
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,971
I thought this was
what a classic quail dish would be.

655
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,348
-Thank you.
-It was solid.

656
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,099
As for the result…

657
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,147
the survivor is…

658
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,737
Congratulations,
Black Spoon Chef Rebellious Genius.

659
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,366
REBELLIOUS GENIUS SURVIVES

660
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,408
Thank you!

661
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,410
Rebellious Genius.

662
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,831
Thank you!

663
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,461
Black Spoon Chef Rebellious Genius
has survived.

664
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,338
This is insane!

665
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,423
Black Spoon Chef Rebellious Genius
has survived.

666
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,884
That's insane.

667
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,636
-Oh, my gosh.
-He beat Lee Jun.

668
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,804
He did well though.

669
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,472
A two-star chef was eliminated.

670
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,725
When I tasted it, it was pretty wild.

671
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,811
But now seeing this, I'm more certain.

672
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,812
That's what he wanted.

673
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,313
He had a clear vision.

674
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,399
-And we felt it.
-Because we see it now.

675
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,858
It came through in the flavor.

676
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,027
If this had been done clumsily,

677
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,779
it would've been a foolish attempt.

678
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:05,157
But it was bold and daring,
yet harmonious within.

679
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,618
Rebellious Genius,
you really are rebellious.

680
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,995
We were reminded of that.

681
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,081
-Congratulations.
-Well done.

682
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,251
Thank you.

683
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,420
Thank you, Chef.

684
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,213
I really felt validated.

685
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,924
I like cooking,

686
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:27,221
because it's a great way of being able
to express what I envision.

687
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,765
What I thought would be a fun idea

688
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,767
was appreciated by the judges,

689
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:36,314
so it was the happiest I've ever felt
in my entire life.

690
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,691
Well, you got what you wanted.

691
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,235
Thank you so much, Chef.

692
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,238
Of course, I'm disappointed.

693
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,616
I'm disappointed,
and I did a lot of self-reflection.

694
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,076
I think perhaps

695
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,121
I was a little too conservative.

696
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:58,502
I think this has given me a chance
to think about what it means to cook,

697
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,379
so it was a job well done.

698
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,214
LEE JUN

699
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,342
I hope he continues to be rebellious,

700
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,594
but leading up to winning the competition,

701
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,263
I want him to stay the course
without wavering.

702
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,893
This is the battle of Paju cheonggukjang.

703
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,896
I've prepared a dish that's heavenly.

704
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,733
I'll show you why Im Seong-keun
is the biggest name in Korean cuisine.

705
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,735
I'm an expert when it comes to flavor.

706
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,487
He's a Korean Food War winner.

707
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,863
He knows all about competitions.

708
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,615
The dish I've prepared is called

709
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,868
"Cheonggukjang Jingujeol."

710
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,162
There's a Korean appetizer dish
called gujeolpan,

711
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,456
consisting of pancakes
and eight kinds of vegetables.

712
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,168
This is something
no one has ever thought of before.

713
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,463
You eat the cheonggukjang,
or fermented soybeans, raw in a wrap.

714
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,756
THE CHEONGGUKJANG IS USED RAW

715
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,466
That pungent aroma of cheonggukjang

716
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,010
will be toned down
by the nuttiness of sesame oil.

717
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:52,431
I prepared
cheonggukjang mukeunji dumplings.

718
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,519
After mixing mashed cheonggukjang
into the dumpling filling,

719
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,272
I wrap that in mukeunji and steam it.

720
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,776
I add warm cheonggukjang sauce

721
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,362
and garnish with basil and herbs.

722
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,365
It's a cold cheonggukjang dish,

723
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,033
but it awakens your appetite.

724
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,619
The survivor
of this one-on-one face-off is…

725
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,205
White Spoon Chef Im Seong-keun.

726
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,581
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

727
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,793
The more you chew,
the more the aroma of cheonggukjang

728
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,545
lingers in the mouth.

729
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,673
In the end, it was so fragrant
I didn't want it to escape my mouth.

730
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,383
They're no match for me.

731
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,634
I'm good at everything.

732
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,888
This is the battle of Yeosu gat-kimchi.

733
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,266
BOSS IN THE KITCHEN VERSUS

734
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,350
KIM SUNG-WOON

735
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,644
He has a lovely bob.

736
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,522
Local cuisine

737
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,858
is an area I consider my strong suit.

738
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,693
The reason why is

739
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:51,157
I use the produce my parents grow
in my hometown of Taean,

740
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,075
as well as various herbs and vegetables,

741
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,287
to cook contemporary dishes.

742
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,456
-That green onion looks good.
-It does.

743
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,833
-Is it homegrown?
-He's originally from Taean,

744
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,668
so he brought everything from there.

745
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,214
I prepared cubed snailfish
and sour kimchi soup.

746
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:12,428
Taean locals eat a lot of cubed snailfish.

747
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,804
MOUSSE MADE FROM CUBED SNAILFISH

748
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,558
With gat-kimchi, or mustard green kimchi,
I put a twist on cubed snailfish soup.

749
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:24,940
The dish I'm preparing today
is gat-kimchi agnolotti.

750
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,567
It's similar to dumplings.

751
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,611
Finely chopped gat-kimchi,

752
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,696
ricotta cheese, and Spanish sausage.

753
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,740
I'll mix those to make the filling.

754
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,825
I put kimchi into everything.

755
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,952
Even the pasta dough
is made with kimchi juice.

756
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,459
This first dish

757
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,669
feels like kimchi dumplings
made by a foreign cook.

758
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,756
The second dish feels like
grandma's home cooking.

759
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,175
The survivor
of this one-on-one face-off is…

760
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,928
White Spoon Chef Kim Sung-woon.

761
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,347
Great job.

762
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,974
The White Spoons are on a roll now.

763
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,559
I think experience equals skill.

764
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,561
-That's so true.
-Yeah, experience is a skill.

765
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,716
But he's famous for that show, MasterChef…

766
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,177
He was a judge on that show.

767
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,220
-Was he?
-Yes.

768
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,097
Hello.

769
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,934
I'm in my 23rd or 24th year now.

770
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,770
I've worked hard as a chef in New York.

771
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,772
I'm Chef Song Hoon.

772
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,442
It was around 15 years ago.

773
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,612
At Eleven Madison Park,
a Michelin three-star restaurant

774
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,073
and the top-ranked restaurant
on The World's 50 Best list,

775
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,450
I worked there as the sous chef.

776
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,287
I was the first ever
Korean sous chef there.

777
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,497
During my nine years here in Korea,

778
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,666
I've been a judge many times.

779
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,087
I applied as a contestant
this season because…

780
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,840
I'm looking for a partner

781
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,676
who will awaken my culinary instincts.

782
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,012
I'd be grateful if you'd join me.

783
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,362
I became really nervous in that moment.

784
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,534
Culinary Monster.
I heard he was exceptional.

785
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,829
If I face him,
it'd be a Western cuisine showdown.

786
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,956
I thought it could be fun.

787
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,668
I heard someone had worked as a sous chef
at The French Laundry,

788
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,880
a leading Michelin three-star restaurant
in California,

789
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,050
so I was interested to see
who that person was.

790
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,593
And it was Culinary Monster.

791
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,804
I've tasted all kinds of porridge,

792
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,767
but this is the first time I've had one
that gives me a new experience.

793
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,394
I'd like to go up against this guy too.

794
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,563
We're basically the old and the new.

795
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,774
I'm the old, and he's the new.

796
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,026
This should be interesting.

797
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,112
Our careers didn't overlap,

798
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,490
but when I worked at a place
he used to work at,

799
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,825
I heard about Chef Song Hoon
a few times.

800
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,620
I've heard a lot about you.

801
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,249
At the time, Chef Mike Anthony told me,

802
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,878
"You're better than Song Hoon."

803
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,966
I wanted to find out

804
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,678
whether that was true or not,
so I came forward.

805
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,012
Thank you.

806
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,019
I thought I should really settle the score

807
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,981
with Culinary Monster once and for all.

808
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,484
I stepped up,
because I believed I could win.

809
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,236
He has years of experience.

810
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,738
He's been doing this
for much longer than I have.

811
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,991
But from my experience
of working in restaurants,

812
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,036
seniority and experience
doesn't guarantee skill.

813
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,704
I'll be able to find out

814
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,666
whether he really is a culinary monster
or just a monster.

815
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,751
Your main ingredient is…

816
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,837
Changwon stalked sea squirt.

817
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,967
That's crazy.

818
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,385
As soon as I saw the sea squirts,

819
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,554
I thought, "What can you do with that?"

820
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,056
That is tough.

821
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,768
As far as I know,
even in the US and Europe,

822
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,479
it's an ingredient
that usually gets tossed out.

823
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,773
Seriously, what can you make with that?

824
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,568
This isn't right.

825
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,737
Aside from Japan and Korea,

826
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:44,074
no other country really eats sea squirts.

827
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,868
I was really thrown off,

828
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,954
but I didn't let it show.

829
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,708
But I saw the expression
on Culinary Monster's face.

830
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,961
He didn't seem flustered at all.

831
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,088
Actually, I was pleased.

832
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,924
They don't have them in the US.
You can't get sea squirts anywhere.

833
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,261
When I was in New York and California,
I never saw it.

834
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:08,348
Since neither of us
has had much experience with it,

835
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,641
I think it's fair.

836
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,944
Will it be Culinary Monster?

837
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,198
Or will it be Chef Song Hoon?

838
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,329
I gave it a lot of thought.

839
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,123
I saw sea squirt in a new light.

840
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,791
I thought about

841
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:40,297
what technique I could use as a chef
to breathe new value into sea squirts.

842
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,887
When you look at them, you'd think,
"How are these sea squirts?"

843
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,014
That's the kind of twist I'm going for.

844
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,851
I think this recipe may be the first
of its kind in the world.

845
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,816
Is that sea urchin roe?

846
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,527
That's the sea squirt.

847
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,863
He added something and blended it, right?

848
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,118
It's sea urchin roe made from sea squirt.

849
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,287
To be honest, everyone thinks

850
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:16,458
sea urchin roe is an expensive ingredient.

851
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,001
In the same vein,

852
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,463
I want to breathe new value
into sea squirts.

853
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,591
Rather than its rubbery, chewy texture,

854
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,218
I want something completely different.

855
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,846
In other words, I want that creamy,
gentle flavor of sea urchin roe.

856
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,140
But at the same time,
I'll keep that sea squirt flavor

857
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,685
and the scent of the ocean.

858
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,273
How is he going to make that
look like sea urchin?

859
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,024
-I don't get it.
-What's he making?

860
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,192
I really think

861
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,445
he's making something
unlike anything he's cooked before.

862
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,780
That's my belief.

863
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,116
"Is it sea urchin or sea squirt?"

864
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,118
I hope it turns out well.

865
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,081
He was busy at work.

866
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,210
He's hardly used any heat so far.

867
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,170
Look at Culinary Monster.

868
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,590
-I'm scared.
-What?

869
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,674
-I'm scared.
-Yeah.

870
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,301
I think he's up to something.

871
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,595
I kept the cooking to a minimum.

872
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,848
I personally think that sea squirt

873
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,019
tastes best when you prep it
and eat it fresh right away.

874
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,438
The more you work it,

875
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,564
the more flavor it loses,

876
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,859
especially since it has a delicate
and pleasant aroma.

877
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,153
So the dish I've prepared today

878
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,739
is actually quite simple.

879
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,575
I prepared raw sea squirt.

880
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,537
It's often eaten cooked,
but it has a great aroma,

881
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,707
so I thought it would be
much better eaten raw.

882
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,960
-It's raw sea squirt.
-Yes.

883
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,087
-A tartare.
-A tartare?

884
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,672
That's so cool.

885
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,800
I finely chopped the sea squirt,

886
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,387
trying to keep as much of the aroma
and texture as possible.

887
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,557
He's so relaxed.

888
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,478
-He's as cool as a cucumber.
-Yes, exactly!

889
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,984
Don't be nervous. There's plenty of time.

890
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:11,198
Then, I mixed minari,
Korean mint, and arugula

891
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,034
to combine fresh ingredients of spring

892
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,536
and create a new blend of flavors.

893
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:22,417
And I placed sea squirt tartare
on top of that.

894
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,130
What's he doing?

895
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,758
He's going to put flowers on top.

896
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,302
Chef Anh Sung-jae dislikes flowers.

897
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,429
-So he's going to…
-Try it anyway?

898
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,722
-Right.
-To win him over?

899
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,099
Yes, because they only taste it.

900
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,684
MONK'S CRESS
FLOWER WITH PEPPERY TASTE

901
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,435
I used a lot of flowers.

902
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,647
I had a reason for using those flowers,

903
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,400
so I believe Chef Anh
won't be averse to it.

904
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,986
Trimming flowers with a beard like that
somehow suits him.

905
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,158
-I think he's…
-You see guys like that in flower shops.

906
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,077
There are florists like that.

907
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,081
I think he'll put a fair amount.

908
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,084
Lots of flowers.

909
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,837
Gosh, this is so funny.

910
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,720
He must be starting it now.

911
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,228
I wonder how it'll turn out.

912
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,360
I see. So that's how you do it.

913
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,320
That's cool. I learned something.

914
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,240
He turned sea squirt into sea urchin roe.

915
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,994
That really does look like sea urchin roe.

916
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:43,331
When you put it through the sieve,
they come out looking like sea urchin roe.

917
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,876
Right. It's a really good idea.

918
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,336
He seems super determined.

919
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,588
The vibes have changed.

920
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,216
It's sea urchin made from sea squirt.

921
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,513
He turned sea squirt
into something like sea urchin,

922
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,600
but I wasn't particularly impressed.

923
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,438
We went different ways with it,
so it should be interesting.

924
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,067
A harmony of Korean
and Western techniques.

925
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,573
I'd say that's my strength.
It's different from Culinary Monster's.

926
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,956
I want to hear, "Just as we expected."

927
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:29,252
"That's Song Hoon for you.
Exactly as we expected."

928
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,303
It's like a fastball versus a curveball
in this sea squirt battle.

929
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,822
I prepared raw sea squirt
with herbs and edible flowers.

930
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,050
I'm really curious.

931
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,469
I want to know how it tastes.

932
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:21,596
I'll feed you after that.

933
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,432
Now, I'll place it in front of your nose.

934
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,288
What's this?

935
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,668
There are flowers.

936
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,253
Well…

937
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,423
The flavor is bold.

938
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,383
The flavor is hard to put into words.

939
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,677
I ate sea squirt, but…

940
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,721
Gosh, how did they do this
with sea squirt?

941
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,807
The aroma that sea squirt has…

942
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,018
that smell of the ocean.

943
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,437
And I'm not exactly sure
which herbs were used,

944
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,481
but the greens and that sharp taste.

945
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,902
As you said, the flavors feel bold.

946
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,446
And daring.

947
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,406
-It's daring.
-Yeah.

948
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,870
Rather than looking pleased,

949
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,789
I think they looked amused.

950
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,210
He's good. His idea was good.

951
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,547
Still, compared to him,

952
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,466
in terms of taste,

953
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:43,011
I'm confident my dish is much better.

954
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,721
SEA URCHIN BIBIMBAP MADE WITH SEA SQUIRT

955
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:08,620
The two judges will be blindfolded,

956
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,623
so I figured their senses of smell

957
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:14,709
and hearing would be
especially heightened.

958
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,505
I want to bring them to Changwon.

959
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,548
So for my dish,

960
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:25,428
I made seawater with the smell
of the ocean using tot seaweed and clams.

961
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,977
Next, I heated some stones.

962
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,645
And then…

963
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,653
I pour that seawater over the stones

964
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,698
so they can hear the sound of waves
and smell the ocean.

965
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,159
This isn't the texture of sea squirt.

966
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,122
The sea squirt is somewhat…

967
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,292
It has the aroma and flavor
of sea squirt, but…

968
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,336
-It doesn't feel like sea squirt.
-I thought it wasn't sea squirt.

969
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:42,589
The texture too.

970
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,968
The sea squirt was deliberately made
to not be like sea squirt,

971
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:51,056
but it was done in a very refined way.

972
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,932
People are divided on sea squirt,

973
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,644
so the chef put a slight twist on it

974
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,939
to make it seem somewhat different.

975
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:03,401
In terms of flavor,
the taste of sea squirt is still there,

976
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,570
but only the good stuff was retained.

977
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:12,202
One dish tries to hide and obscure
as much as possible,

978
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,372
while the other brings out
the original qualities of sea squirt.

979
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,501
The voting is complete.

980
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,711
The result is…

981
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,339
two to zero.

982
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:36,017
You didn't make uni, did you?

983
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:40,396
I tried to turn sea squirt
into sea urchin.

984
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,274
I would've been fooled
if I'd seen this first.

985
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,402
Could you explain this dish?

986
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,154
There seems to be a lot going on.

987
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,324
In my opinion, with sea squirt,

988
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,993
the more you work it,

989
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,454
the more its aroma and flavor disappear.

990
00:56:57,038 --> 00:57:00,542
I added chopped sea squirt
and some salted sea squirt, or jeotgal.

991
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,210
There's an intent behind the flowers.

992
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,130
I wanted to give it a spicier note.

993
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,590
I personally think kale and arugula

994
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,427
have a slightly nutty flavor,

995
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,720
so I finished it with flowers.

996
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,599
Gosh, you two were

997
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,769
on completely opposite ends
of the spectrum.

998
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:25,275
It's time to announce the results
of the Changwon sea squirt battle.

999
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,736
I could probably win this.

1000
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,864
I stayed true to the basics

1001
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,533
but added an interesting technique
to the dish.

1002
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,911
Sea squirt is delicious on its own,

1003
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,872
and it's the same for sea urchin.

1004
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,040
If I were the judge,

1005
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,251
I wouldn't have accepted that.

1006
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,797
The survivor
of this one-on-one face-off is…

1007
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,135
Black Spoon Chef Culinary Monster.

1008
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,304
CULINARY MONSTER SURVIVES

1009
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,680
Thank you.

1010
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:57,974
Thank you, Chef.

1011
00:57:58,892 --> 00:57:59,726
Thank you.

1012
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,020
Black Spoon Chef Culinary Monster.

1013
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,442
That's incredible.

1014
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,320
-Incredible.
-The Culinary Monster.

1015
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,990
A lot of people say I dislike flowers,

1016
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,160
but using kale blossoms, arugula,

1017
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,953
nasturtium, and such

1018
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:22,499
in this dish was the perfect move.

1019
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,418
The flowers all did their part.

1020
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,963
The more you chew, the sweeter it gets,
making it more interesting.

1021
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,965
And it makes you want to keep chewing.

1022
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,760
It all came together inside the mouth.

1023
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,845
I was surprised sea squirt
could be made like this.

1024
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,181
My dish had to be seen with the eyes

1025
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:41,434
for the visual impact
to have really come through.

1026
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,647
Unfortunately, I think I went
in the wrong direction.

1027
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,863
This stings a little.

1028
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,907
SONG HOON

1029
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,162
He really is a culinary monster.

1030
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:19,389
It's a barbecue showdown
between the old and the new.

1031
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,058
Who cooks meat the best in Korea?

1032
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,935
RAYMON KIM VERSUS

1033
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,645
BARBECUE LAB DIRECTOR

1034
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,117
They're both cooking meat.

1035
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:42,161
He runs a really famous
barbecue restaurant.

1036
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,205
BARBECUE LAB DIRECTOR
CEO OF IMOK SMOKE DINING

1037
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,419
You can't leave out Chef Raymon Kim
when it comes to meat.

1038
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,797
-He has a YouTube channel about meat.
-Right.

1039
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,551
I've been a chef for 28 years.

1040
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:59,053
I learned to cook in Canada,

1041
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,597
so I'm pretty versatile.

1042
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,057
I was grateful he stepped forward.

1043
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,392
I'm a big fan of his.

1044
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:06,477
-I'm a fan.
-Me too.

1045
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,772
I wanted to go head-to-head with him.

1046
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,108
I'm grateful I get to cook with him.

1047
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,444
I think I'll probably win
by a narrow margin.

1048
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,487
Your main ingredient is…

1049
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,032
pork neck.

1050
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,700
MUNGYEONG MINERAL-FED PORK NECK

1051
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:31,711
It's actually one of the more
difficult cuts to work with.

1052
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,922
It's hard to cook perfectly.

1053
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,050
It's really fatty and the meat's thin,

1054
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,178
so if you overcook it, it becomes tough.

1055
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,555
It can become much too firm.

1056
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:48,227
But I want to bring out
the best possible texture.

1057
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,063
It's going to be very tender

1058
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,522
but still with a nice bite.

1059
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:55,443
I'll sear it once
to get that Maillard reaction.

1060
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,363
MAILLARD REACTION: THE BROWNING PROCESS
THAT CREATES RICH FLAVOR

1061
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:02,533
I'll make stock
with tomato paste and pork neck.

1062
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:06,162
Then, I'll cook the meat in it
at around 80°C.

1063
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,789
So I'll be poaching it.

1064
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,250
When you poach, you're not boiling it.

1065
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,919
I'll be cooking it slowly.

1066
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,756
COOKING SLOWLY WHILE KEEPING
THE TEMPERATURE JUST BELOW BOILING POINT

1067
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:20,385
The inside temperature
should be between 65 and 70°C.

1068
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,472
It means the meat will be pink inside.

1069
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,725
It'll have a different texture
from grilled meat.

1070
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,353
That firm bite typical of pork neck
will still be there,

1071
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,521
but it'll be tender.

1072
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,402
I can already smell
that aroma of barbecue.

1073
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,911
The special ingredient is the smoky aroma.

1074
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:47,954
For sure.

1075
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,916
In the first 15 to 20 minutes of smoking,

1076
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,962
pork neck gives off that smoky aroma
you get from bacon.

1077
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,968
I infuse that aroma first…

1078
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,684
and then grill it over charcoal.

1079
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,774
That looks delicious.

1080
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,276
-I want a taste.
-Yes, I'm hungry.

1081
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,819
His barbecue is insane.

1082
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,112
-I want to eat it.
-The smell…

1083
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,366
The starting point for this dish
was when I thought,

1084
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,994
"What do I think is the best way
to enjoy pork neck?"

1085
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,496
Grilling it to a nice golden brown

1086
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,791
and eating it in a lettuce wrap
can't be beat.

1087
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,502
But I can't just grill the pork neck

1088
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,962
and serve them lettuce wraps.

1089
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,507
So I thought about using carbs
instead of lettuce,

1090
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,468
like in the form of bread.

1091
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,766
I'll make thin corn tortillas

1092
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,894
to serve bite-sized tacos.

1093
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,438
I fit the tortillas into a mold

1094
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,317
and fry them until they're very crispy

1095
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,819
to make U-shaped taco shells.

1096
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:04,781
I wanted to use ssamjang

1097
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,158
for the sauce,

1098
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,493
so I decided on ssamjang mayo

1099
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:11,162
but with a little more aroma.

1100
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:14,999
I drop a piece of blazing-hot charcoal
into some sunflower oil.

1101
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,709
When you close the lid,

1102
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,336
the charcoal reacts with the oil

1103
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:21,005
and releases a cloud of white smoke.

1104
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,635
That adds a really smoky aroma to the oil.

1105
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,644
I'm going to blend the oil to make aioli.

1106
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:38,189
I'll also mix in a bit of meju doenjang.

1107
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,901
That ssamjang mayo
will be the main sauce for the taco.

1108
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,987
They'll think, "What?
How did the sauce get this smoky aroma?"

1109
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,948
You get a kind of smoky flavor
that's different

1110
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,699
from the smoky aroma in the meat.

1111
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:54,080
Before serving,
I'm going to sear it again.

1112
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,874
If you sear it over high heat without oil,

1113
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,793
the Maillard reaction happens again.

1114
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,420
That will add a rich, savory taste.

1115
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,469
I wanted to bring out the good qualities
of Mungyeong mineral-fed pork.

1116
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,727
Sweet and sour sauces
go really well with pork.

1117
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:18,688
I'm going to make the sauce

1118
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,190
with Mungyeong apples, honey,
and magnolia berry.

1119
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,780
The ssamjang-infused sauce,

1120
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,699
then the pork neck,

1121
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,034
and then the apple and tomato salsa.

1122
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:36,747
Finally, I'll finish by adding a sauce
made with spicy Cheongyang chili pepper.

1123
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,207
Geez, why are my hands shaking?

1124
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,375
Damn.

1125
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,380
Thank you.

1126
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,799
Go, Chef Raymon!

1127
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,801
-Go, White Spoon!
-Good luck, Chef!

1128
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,553
-Good luck!
-Let's go!

1129
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,223
You got this!

1130
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,101
-You can do it!
-Go, Black Spoon!

1131
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,061
-You can do it!
-I'll come back with a win!

1132
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,396
-You can do it!
-Let's go!

1133
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,273
I'll come back with a win. Let's go.

1134
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,911
Now, please taste the first dish.

1135
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,413
PORK NECK WITH MUNGYEONG MAGNOLIA BERRY
AND APPLE HONEY SAUCE

1136
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,211
I think they'll find
the texture interesting.

1137
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,255
They'll say it's unique.

1138
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,383
The outside is crispy,
but the inside will be tender.

1139
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,915
A lot of effort was put
into cooking this pork.

1140
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,876
I'm really curious
about how this was cooked.

1141
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,878
To achieve this
with this kind of thickness…

1142
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,005
This wasn't just seared.

1143
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:12,051
I get the feeling
it was cooked very delicately.

1144
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,052
Extremely delicately.

1145
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,763
How did they do this with pork neck?

1146
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,019
Next, please taste the second dish.

1147
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,104
MUNGYEONG PORK NECK TACO

1148
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:25,898
The texture in the beginning is important.

1149
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,317
The crispiness of the shell.

1150
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:36,450
Then, the texture of the pork neck
and the smoky aroma of the sauce.

1151
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:46,877
I want them to feel
all those layers of flavors in that order.

1152
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:06,147
And then, you need to chew slowly.

1153
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:09,608
Like this?

1154
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,466
There's a subtle charcoal aroma.

1155
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,634
Wow, the aroma of the meat.

1156
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,930
That smoky aroma really comes out.

1157
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:43,309
This is…

1158
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:47,063
a flavor you only get
from direct contact with the charcoal.

1159
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,482
That smokiness is really…

1160
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,609
This tastes like a taco.

1161
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:52,985
-Right? A hard-shell taco.
-Yes.

1162
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,737
-Not a soft taco, right?
-Right.

1163
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,239
Again, the two are so different.

1164
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,201
What did they do to the meat?

1165
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,661
Gosh, this is a hard decision.

1166
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,998
-I really want to hear about the dishes.
-It's too hard.

1167
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,959
It's clear they both put a lot of effort
into the meat.

1168
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:11,253
They were really delicious.

1169
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,139
The voting is complete.

1170
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,351
The result is…

1171
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,355
one to one.

1172
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,861
…one to one.

1173
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:37,863
Really?

1174
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,282
I wonder what will happen to Chef Raymon.

1175
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,450
I know, right?

1176
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,160
I'm so nervous right now.

1177
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,412
PAIK, RAYMON KIM
ANH, BARBECUE LAB DIRECTOR

1178
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,082
Contestants, please exit for a moment.

1179
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,218
The reason was

1180
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,554
technique-wise, this one is…

1181
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,264
I mean, the way this was cooked.

1182
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:05,850
This shows some serious skill.

1183
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,393
In terms of flavor,

1184
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,104
more technique and so on
was put into this dish.

1185
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:12,815
And in some ways,
this dish may seem a bit simple.

1186
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:15,067
But with that taste of pork neck,

1187
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,236
especially when it's grilled,

1188
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,697
this dish went with a flavor
that's more crowd-pleasing.

1189
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:23,784
I'm so nervous.

1190
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,744
I haven't been eliminated yet.
I'm still here.

1191
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,581
I was able to dodge a bullet for now,

1192
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,875
so I was thinking, "I really want to win."

1193
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,259
I'm afraid I'll be the one
taking the win today.

1194
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:42,761
Going forward,

1195
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,181
I think he'll do better than me.

1196
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:47,183
But today, I have to win.

1197
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:50,186
Contestants, please reenter.

1198
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,448
Gosh, one person is the master of meat
and the other is…

1199
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,950
I could tell your pork neck grilling
was on another level.

1200
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,035
Thank you.

1201
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:09,496
What technique went into this?

1202
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,539
Poaching.

1203
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:11,707
-Poaching?
-Yes.

1204
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,375
Seared, poached, and seared again.

1205
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,336
-Seared again? Two times.
-You seared again.

1206
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:19,381
Did you put something in the creamy sauce?

1207
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,175
I put hot charcoal into oil

1208
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:22,968
-to get charcoal oil.
-Right, charcoal oil.

1209
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,136
And I made charcoal aioli.

1210
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,554
You made aioli yourself on site?

1211
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:26,722
Yes.

1212
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:29,433
I was wondering why it had
all this smoky aroma.

1213
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,897
The survivor of this battle is…

1214
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:40,110
I think that cream has been smoked.

1215
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:46,617
There's only so much smokiness
you can get from the meat.

1216
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:48,994
He smoked the sauce…

1217
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:49,912
Yes.

1218
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:51,080
From a diner's perspective,

1219
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:53,958
I think this is more satisfying
and will keep you wanting more.

1220
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,210
Barbecue Lab Director.

1221
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,419
Congratulations.

1222
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,631
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1223
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:01,590
Black Spoon Chef…

1224
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,926
-Barbecue Lab Director.
-There we go!

1225
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,304
Black Spoon Chef Barbecue Lab Director.

1226
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:10,307
What a shame.

1227
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:12,476
-Great job.
-Thank you.

1228
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:13,686
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1229
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,314
-Well done.
-Thank you, Chef.

1230
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:20,276
-I'll visit your restaurant. Not at all.
-It was an honor.

1231
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,069
I was so happy.

1232
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:25,239
I guess I really did give my all
to cooking.

1233
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:30,411
I made a straightforward dish,
and they would've taken it that way too.

1234
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,205
At least one person liked my dish.

1235
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,206
RAYMON KIM ELIMINATED

1236
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,083
As a fan, I lost to someone

1237
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,919
who's truly talented,
so that much is a relief.

1238
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,506
-What do we do?
-Seriously.

1239
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:45,217
Yeah.

1240
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,261
-What do we do?
-It was one to one.

1241
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,846
Gosh, what do we do?

1242
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,139
It was one to one.

1243
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:51,640
Oh, no.

1244
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,059
I swear he brought out
all the flavor he could.

1245
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,103
Chef Choi, give us some tips.

1246
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:57,730
Don't you have any?

1247
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,398
I'm so nervous.

1248
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:01,317
It's nerve-racking.

1249
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,904
It's different from anything
I've done before.

1250
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,449
It feels completely different.

1251
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:16,707
I will really try my best.

1252
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:18,167
I don't want to go home.

1253
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,211
It feels like

1254
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:25,174
I've been waiting all 26 years of my life
as a chef for this moment.

1255
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:27,343
JUNG HO-YOUNG
CELEBRITY CHEF OF JAPANESE CUISINE

1256
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,845
I think he really wants to show

1257
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:31,305
that although he does a lot of TV,

1258
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:34,516
he's serious about cooking,
and he's good at it.

1259
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,354
There were some people
who thought of me as like a comedian.

1260
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,899
They even doubt
if I'm really good at cooking or not.

1261
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:44,151
But when it comes to cooking,

1262
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:45,986
I take it very seriously.

1263
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,198
I haven't been able to show
that side of me,

1264
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:50,574
which I felt was a shame.

1265
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:54,286
I didn't just appear out of nowhere

1266
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,746
to become a celebrity chef.

1267
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,123
I started out earning 500,000 won a month,

1268
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,376
working 15, 16 hours a day

1269
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,544
and taking just a day or two off a month.

1270
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,297
That's what I went through to get here.

1271
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,549
After watching Season 1,

1272
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,802
I regretted not taking part
and came here determined.

1273
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:12,262
-Please begin cooking now.
-You can do it!

1274
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,057
-Go, Jung Ho-young!
-Go, Jung Ho-young!

1275
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:16,809
Let's go!

1276
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:18,852
Go, Seoul Mother!

1277
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,854
SEOUL MOTHER
CHEF-OWNER OF SUPERPAN

1278
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:24,900
Just like me, I think Chef Jung Ho-young

1279
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,194
cooks mainstream food that people love,

1280
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:29,571
so I thought it'd be good
to compete with him.

1281
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,240
Chef Jung Ho-young's dishes

1282
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,575
can be enjoyed by all ages,
from babies to the elderly.

1283
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,911
The same applies to my cooking.

1284
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,540
These dishes work so well together.

1285
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:41,291
-You've survived.
-Thank you.

1286
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,627
As chefs who make that kind of food,

1287
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:46,672
what would Japanese and Korean cuisine
going head-to-head be like?

1288
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,966
I'm confident when it comes
to bringing out flavor.

1289
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:50,384
I'll stay true to the theme

1290
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,261
and make something so delicious

1291
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:55,931
they'll wonder, "Was this ingredient
always this delicious?"

1292
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,810
I'm really curious about that.

1293
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,105
That wooden thing?

1294
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:04,440
Isn't that for hanging noodles?

1295
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:06,024
I don't know.

1296
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,450
He's hanging the monkfish?

1297
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,493
Oh, my gosh!

1298
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,954
Even my prep work of the monkfish
will be impressive.

1299
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,080
My goodness.

1300
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:21,915
POHANG MONKFISH

1301
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,004
I wanted to show the proper way
of preparing it.

1302
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:29,214
I'll use the method I learned in Japan.

1303
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,677
Not many would have seen it,

1304
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,722
but now they'll know Jung Ho-young
can really handle monkfish.

1305
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:46,648
He's a pro at skinning.

1306
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,192
Very impressive.

1307
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,737
I set up a stand
so I could hang the monkfish.

1308
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,283
I hook it so it hangs in the air,

1309
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,368
and I prep it while it's like that.

1310
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:01,914
I've never seen monkfish like that.

1311
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:03,999
Goodness, that looks insane.

1312
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,418
He came with a purpose.

1313
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,004
Monkfish have a lot of slime,

1314
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:12,174
so it's tough to prep it
on a cutting board.

1315
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,306
To separate the flesh,

1316
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:23,352
skin, and bones precisely,

1317
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,604
hanging it is the best approach.

1318
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:33,362
-He's on another level. That's amazing.
-He is.

1319
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,614
Nice and clean.

1320
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:37,199
I'll be winning today.

1321
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,538
He broke down that monkfish so skillfully.

1322
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,040
My goodness.

1323
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:46,750
I was a bit shocked.

1324
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:51,838
To be honest, I'm not very good
at handling fish.

1325
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:53,298
Monkfish.

1326
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,299
Monkfish?

1327
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,055
Now, I'm really worried.

1328
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:02,849
Monkfish as an ingredient

1329
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,768
is only good for its texture.

1330
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:08,021
The flesh doesn't have
any natural richness or flavor.

1331
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,024
It's a difficult fish to get flavor from.

1332
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,698
But surprisingly,

1333
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:21,034
once you skin it,
the flesh is really tender.

1334
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,872
With the skin on,
it has a nice chewy texture

1335
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,916
that people enjoy with a drink of soju.

1336
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,794
But with the skin completely removed,

1337
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:32,879
the meat is incredibly soft,

1338
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:36,216
and it doesn't have much of a fishy smell,

1339
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,010
so it absorbs seasoning well.

1340
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:42,139
And so, I thought I should braise it.

1341
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:43,765
When I braised it,

1342
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,809
it was more appealing than other fish.

1343
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:50,188
I'll make a Seoul-style braise
with a satisfying and spicy taste.

1344
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,612
I strain everything through a sieve,

1345
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,697
so the broth has nothing in it,

1346
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,991
not even bits of garlic or ginger.

1347
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,538
It's a very clean and delicate taste.

1348
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,373
Monkfish…

1349
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:11,960
doesn't have much of an aroma or flavor.

1350
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,296
-It'll be hard to make it stand out.
-It's not easy.

1351
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:16,256
With monkfish,

1352
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,676
I think the liver
is the most appealing part.

1353
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:23,138
It's called the "foie gras of the sea"

1354
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:24,848
for its buttery richness.

1355
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:27,559
Right, you have to go for the liver.

1356
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,812
In Korea, the meat is cheap,
but the liver is expensive.

1357
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,272
Monkfish liver is more expensive.

1358
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:36,318
I'm going to accentuate the flavor
of this precious monkfish liver.

1359
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,072
I'm making monkfish chawanmushi.

1360
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:43,533
Chawanmushi is a dish
steamed in a chawan, a tea bowl.

1361
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:47,287
In general, steamed egg custard
is referred to as chawanmushi.

1362
01:17:47,954 --> 01:17:51,708
It will perfectly match the rich,
buttery flavor of monkfish liver.

1363
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,461
I'll gently simmer the monkfish liver

1364
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:57,381
in Japanese cuisine style.

1365
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,386
That's the monkfish loin.

1366
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,138
As for the flesh,

1367
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:10,143
I'll use a soy sauce-based marinade
and grill it over charcoal.

1368
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,605
The chewy texture will be infused
with the aroma of charcoal.

1369
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:15,941
Silky, whisked eggs

1370
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,151
and buttery monkfish liver.

1371
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,113
I hope they can taste
how beautifully they come together.

1372
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:25,409
The liver may become
the highlight of his dish.

1373
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,035
Is she using the liver too?

1374
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,250
I'm only using the flesh.

1375
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,711
I made the bold choice not to use…

1376
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:37,504
the liver.

1377
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:38,547
Let's just go Korean.

1378
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:41,299
Korean cuisine doesn't use the liver.

1379
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,926
-That's true.
-Yeah.

1380
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:45,220
-She's really good at creating flavors.
-Yes.

1381
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:47,305
There's something special about her.

1382
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:50,809
She always has a unique way
of using ingredients.

1383
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,686
What can I add

1384
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:56,148
to pair with the monkfish
in a special way?

1385
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:58,191
She's using something else.

1386
01:18:58,775 --> 01:18:59,693
Is that shrimp?

1387
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:01,445
I mince the shrimp

1388
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,573
and make a sandwich
with the shrimp in the middle.

1389
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:05,699
Like menbosha.

1390
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:08,785
With the addition of shrimp,

1391
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:10,746
the bland taste of monkfish

1392
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,457
will be elevated
by the richness of the shrimp

1393
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,959
to create a refined flavor.

1394
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:26,595
It will be that Korean braise
our mothers used to make for us.

1395
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:27,846
A very elegant braise.

1396
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,391
The smell of that braise is amazing.

1397
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:34,561
I just want to mix it
with white rice and eat it.

1398
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:40,233
I figured they'd want rice,
so I made rice with oats.

1399
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,279
If they soak it in the hot broth
and eat it,

1400
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:45,947
it'll be really delicious.

1401
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:55,081
This is a flavor you can only create
with years of experience.

1402
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,042
I think I might have a chance at winning.

1403
01:19:58,752 --> 01:19:59,753
For me,

1404
01:19:59,836 --> 01:20:01,630
this is a dish that really brings out

1405
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,840
that umami in Japanese cuisine.

1406
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:07,886
I add the monkfish flesh
and then the eggs.

1407
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,931
Then, I steam it.

1408
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:16,603
I place the gently simmered liver
on top of that.

1409
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,483
Then, I pour a slightly sweet, salty,

1410
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:23,652
and thick sauce over the top.

1411
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,488
That's a tough one to beat.

1412
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:28,824
It looks delicious.

1413
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,784
Jung Ho-young is a man on a mission.

1414
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,829
So that one bite makes you go,

1415
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,206
"Now that's good monkfish."

1416
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:41,711
-Impressive!
-Great job!

1417
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:48,009
It's a very Korean monkfish dish
against a very Japanese monkfish dish.

1418
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,431
This is the battle of Pohang monkfish.

1419
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,100
Please enter.

1420
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:57,936
Monkfish.

1421
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:00,689
A blank canvas of a fish.

1422
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:03,275
It changes depending
on the seasoning you use.

1423
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,778
Isn't it the fish most affected
by seasoning?

1424
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,029
Yes, that's right.

1425
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,869
Now, please taste the first dish.

1426
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,385
When I saw the rice, I thought,

1427
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:32,721
"It's a dish that'll make you
devour bowls of rice."

1428
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,519
It's a big spoonful.

1429
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:41,938
Yes, that's it.

1430
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:52,991
Wider…

1431
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:04,461
It really was a big spoonful.

1432
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,047
The biggest bite today.

1433
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:17,057
It's spicy.

1434
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:26,650
The dishes so far haven't been spicy.

1435
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:29,069
I can't even talk properly.

1436
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,196
I was so shocked.

1437
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:33,448
I was panicking.

1438
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,367
I can't even talk properly.

1439
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:40,664
But it's pleasantly spicy.

1440
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:44,334
This spiciness isn't the heavy,
cloying kind.

1441
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,836
It has a clean, fresh kick

1442
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,255
that kind of hits you right away.

1443
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,050
Usually, with braised monkfish,
you get skin and things

1444
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,344
-that are chewy.
-This is just flesh.

1445
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:56,137
This was made with just the flesh,

1446
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:59,099
so it feels clean without any collagen.

1447
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:02,560
It's a spicy braise using monkfish,

1448
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,105
but it's very elegant in its spiciness.

1449
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:07,774
They truly understood my dish.

1450
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:13,321
Next, please taste the second dish.

1451
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:28,378
In that one spoonful,
you get the richness of monkfish liver,

1452
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,006
the chewiness of the flesh,

1453
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,133
and the silkiness of the egg.

1454
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:37,262
That dish was on a whole new level.

1455
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,764
I know that adding ankimo
to steamed egg custard

1456
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,350
is as delicious as they come.

1457
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:43,601
It looked really delicious.

1458
01:24:01,244 --> 01:24:03,121
You need to open wider.

1459
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,040
This is a wooden spoon.

1460
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:15,842
It's monkfish liver.

1461
01:24:15,925 --> 01:24:18,136
Very sweet monkfish liver.

1462
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:22,390
It's like the garnish
is stealing the show.

1463
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,934
That's exactly it.
There's more liver than flesh.

1464
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:28,897
-But the doneness of the liver is perfect.
-Yes.

1465
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:34,486
The flesh was also cooked perfectly,
so it melts in your mouth with the liver.

1466
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,447
Very different styles again.

1467
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:40,492
Completely different.

1468
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:44,412
But they both brought out the best
in the monkfish.

1469
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:45,580
Man…

1470
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,709
They're both really talented chefs.

1471
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,671
When I tasted the first dish,

1472
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,924
after eating Korean soups,

1473
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:59,594
we usually describe them
as satisfying and clean.

1474
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:00,929
It was exactly that.

1475
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:03,098
When I tasted the second dish,

1476
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:05,183
it was the complete opposite.

1477
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,434
They went all out.

1478
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:09,229
While maintaining that deep, rich flavor,

1479
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:11,439
it was paired with the egg and the sauce,

1480
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:13,525
and they fit perfectly.

1481
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:17,195
I was really torn
because the two were so different.

1482
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,410
The voting is complete.

1483
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:26,496
The result is…

1484
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:28,790
one to one.

1485
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:32,502
PAIK JONG-WON, SEOUL MOTHER
ANH SUNG-JAE, JUNG HO-YOUNG

1486
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:33,753
…one to one.

1487
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,676
Yet again.

1488
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:41,219
I hope Ho-young wins.

1489
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:43,471
He even had that stand made.

1490
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,932
What if he has to carry that
straight home?

1491
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,185
-I didn't know I'd be standing here.
-I know.

1492
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:53,106
THE NAMEPLATES OF THE ELIMINATED

1493
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:54,232
It's torture being here.

1494
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,901
Were there that many?

1495
01:25:58,444 --> 01:26:00,488
-Gosh, seriously.
-Gosh, seriously.

1496
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:01,739
I just want to cling to this.

1497
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,367
Both are something else.

1498
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,829
The monkfish liver was cooked perfectly.

1499
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:09,789
But for me,

1500
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:12,250
the reason I chose that dish is…

1501
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,085
It kind of felt like cheating.

1502
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,503
Cheating?

1503
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:17,422
I said the garnish was stealing the show.

1504
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:19,507
If you've used this much liver,

1505
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:21,843
it'd be weird if it didn't taste good.

1506
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:23,803
That's true, but the liver is also…

1507
01:26:24,637 --> 01:26:28,308
-part of the monkfish in my view.
-That's true.

1508
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:31,019
With the overall intent,
the way it melts in your mouth,

1509
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:33,188
and how everything comes together,

1510
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:36,274
I feel this is better.

1511
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:37,483
For me…

1512
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,777
this was the better one.

1513
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,487
It wasn't just monkfish.

1514
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:42,864
They put something in between.

1515
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:44,616
I think it's shrimp.

1516
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:47,827
The taste was very clean,

1517
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:49,537
but it wasn't simple.

1518
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:50,622
A lot went into it.

1519
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,583
This is also very heavy.

1520
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:55,335
It went for richness.

1521
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:56,961
The idea for this one was really good.

1522
01:26:57,045 --> 01:27:00,840
The chef put a lot of thought
into the techniques used.

1523
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:08,223
But this isn't a point made to persuade.

1524
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,809
-True.
-This is simply a matter of style.

1525
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,270
It's hard. I'd eat this
in a Japanese restaurant

1526
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:16,064
and this in a Korean restaurant.

1527
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:18,483
-Separately, they're both at the top.
-That's true.

1528
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:21,569
But we have to put them side by side
and compare them.

1529
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,086
They're not announcing a decision.

1530
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,505
It's taking a really long time.

1531
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:43,383
It must really be hard to choose.

1532
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,553
-Why is it taking so long?
-What's going on?

1533
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:52,767
This is tougher than I thought.

1534
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:53,977
I thought I was going crazy.

1535
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:56,104
Time really dragged on.

1536
01:27:57,313 --> 01:27:59,857
The problem is there's nothing
to fault with either of them.

1537
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:01,693
What should we do?

1538
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,452
Let's taste them again.

1539
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:13,204
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

1540
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,623
A fork, spoon, or chopsticks, please.

1541
01:28:16,165 --> 01:28:17,583
-Let's forget what was before.
-Yes.

1542
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:18,960
Let's decide from this tasting.

1543
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:20,169
-One more time.
-Yeah.

1544
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:23,381
Let's say it's a tie

1545
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:24,924
and taste them again.

1546
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:02,045
Shall we vote again?

1547
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:05,048
Okay.

1548
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:05,965
Hold on.

1549
01:29:06,549 --> 01:29:08,051
This is number one, and this is two?

1550
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:09,218
-Right?
-Yes.

1551
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:12,638
Damn.

1552
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:30,281
The revote is complete.

1553
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:32,992
I voted based on this tasting.

1554
01:29:33,076 --> 01:29:34,702
-Me too.
-Based on what we just tasted.

1555
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:35,828
-Again.
-I forgot the past.

1556
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:37,413
The first dish versus

1557
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:39,791
the second dish.

1558
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:42,752
The revote result is…

1559
01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:45,838
The revote result is…

1560
01:29:46,964 --> 01:29:48,007
The revote result is…

1561
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,218
one to one.

1562
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:57,558
-What in the…
-What is this?

1563
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:01,229
The third round of Culinary Class Wars

1564
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:04,899
is the Black and White Spoons'
Team Battle,

1565
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:07,652
All or Nothing.

1566
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:11,989
All members of the winning class
will survive.

1567
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,033
-We have to win.
-Don't lend them any.

1568
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:15,952
We're doomed.

1569
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:18,996
All members of the losing team
will be eliminated.

1570
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,164
It's a deathmatch.

1571
01:30:20,706 --> 01:30:21,582
We didn't click well.

1572
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:24,168
Will it just be "The White Spoons Show"?

1573
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,963
-Sorry about earlier…
