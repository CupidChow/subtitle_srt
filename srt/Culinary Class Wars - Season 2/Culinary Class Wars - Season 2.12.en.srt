1
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:11,469
Now, please reveal

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,596
Chef Choi Kang-rok's score.

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,941
CURRENT FIRST PLACE
BREWMASTER YUN, 180 POINTS

4
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,405
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 95 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 90 points.

5
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,783
Chef Choi Kang-rok.
With a total of 185 points,

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,785
the chef has set a new high score.

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,705
Chef Choi Kang-rok.
With a total of 185 points,

8
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,915
the chef has set a new high score.

9
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,419
And with that, first place
in the Endless Cooking Paradise,

10
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,088
with 185 points,
the highest score from the judges,

11
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,048
goes to Chef Choi Kang-rok!

12
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,801
WINNER OF ENDLESS COOKING PARADISE,
CHOI KANG-ROK

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,719
Congratulations.

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,304
Thank you.

15
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:00,018
Chef Choi Kang-rok.
With a total of 185 points,

16
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,936
they have set a new high score.

17
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,775
That could've been me.

18
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,234
I was so close. Just five points!

19
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,778
If only Chef Anh had given me

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,946
five more points.

21
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,366
It was so beautiful
that I felt bad about taking a spoonful.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,077
My heart kept pounding with excitement.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,704
I'd think, "Which one should I eat next?"

24
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,624
"Which two should I try together?"

25
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,084
It was enjoyable,

26
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,669
and it made me anticipate
the flavor of the next bite.

27
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,464
That singular impact

28
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,759
made me forget everything else.

29
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,763
In all my life,
I don't think I've ever thought so hard

30
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,391
or moved around so much
in terms of cooking.

31
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,655
I kept feeling like I was going to cry.

32
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:58,827
I think I closed my eyes for a moment
to stop the tears from falling.

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,161
First place…

34
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,123
with 185 points,
the highest score from the judges,

35
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,666
goes to Chef Choi Kang-rok!

36
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,543
I'm really happy.

37
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,421
Chef Choi Kang-rok,
please take your nameplate

38
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,924
and make your way to the survivors' table.

39
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,137
I'm so jealous!

40
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:27,772
Congratulations.

41
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,316
He made just one dish.

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,943
You're unbelievable, Kang-rok.

43
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,533
I think I've found purpose
in being here now,

44
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,827
so I'm very happy.

45
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,672
FIRST PLACE, CHOI KANG-ROK

46
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,634
But…

47
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,846
I need to be the last one standing

48
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,726
for my survival to mean something.

49
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,606
After Paradise,
I think something punishing will come.

50
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,748
Now then,

51
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,375
it's time to reveal the second mission

52
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,629
of the last challenge
before the final round.

53
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,467
The theme of the second mission

54
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,929
that will determine the last finalist is…

55
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,348
Endless…

56
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,267
Cooking…

57
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,812
Hell.

58
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,983
ENDLESS COOKING HELL

59
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:54,984
Hell.

60
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,904
Hell.

61
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,623
Cooking Hell?

62
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,710
Seriously, it was tofu hell in Season 1,

63
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,005
but these damn people
are at it again in Season 2.

64
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,509
In Endless Cooking Hell,
you will use one main ingredient

65
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:25,348
to repeatedly create new dishes
every 30 minutes.

66
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,812
One chef will be eliminated
every 30 minutes,

67
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:36,442
and anyone who doesn't complete their dish
in that time will also be eliminated.

68
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,320
This challenge

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,698
will continue…

70
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,159
until the last finalist is chosen.

71
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,706
This really is Hell.

72
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,046
I had a feeling Hell
would come after Paradise.

73
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,299
They have to persevere.

74
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,842
They all chose to come here.

75
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,803
By five points!

76
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,306
I should've tried harder.

77
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,977
Now, it's time to reveal

78
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,146
the ingredient for Endless Cooking Hell.

79
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,907
I looked up, but nothing was hanging
from the ceiling.

80
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,723
It's coming up from there.

81
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,627
This is crazy.

82
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,255
I did not see this coming!

83
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,257
Last time, it came down from above.

84
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,385
But this time, it rose up from the ground.

85
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,763
I was so shocked.

86
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,680
What is that?

87
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,600
What kind of greens are they?

88
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,478
At first, I thought, "What is that?"

89
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,355
What's that?

90
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,317
I thought, "What exactly is that?"

91
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,154
Judges,

92
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,740
please reveal the ingredient.

93
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,631
The ingredient you have to cook with…

94
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,804
is carrots.

95
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,565
They're freshly dug carrots!

96
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,241
MAIN INGREDIENT FOR ENDLESS COOKING HELL
CARROTS

97
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,371
They're always used in Korean cuisine

98
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,082
but never as a main ingredient.

99
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,959
It's not used as a main ingredient.

100
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,211
It's not really eaten
as a main ingredient.

101
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,797
It's usually added for its color.

102
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,341
In terms of taste? We rarely use carrots.

103
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,302
I would much rather have tofu.

104
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,930
Most people would think that carrots

105
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,642
are just accompaniments
that are always on the side.

106
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,104
But if you think about
an ingredient's natural qualities,

107
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:04,275
it has sweetness
and that earthy aroma from the soil.

108
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,152
Carrots are different when they're cooked.

109
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,987
There's a sweetness that gently comes out

110
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,156
that's different from a sweet potato's.

111
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,326
When cooked,
they still have great texture,

112
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,828
which gives them an appealing quality.

113
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,873
It will be hard though. It won't be easy.

114
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,001
For people who cook,
it will be an interesting challenge.

115
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,711
It'll feel like hell though.

116
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,218
Carrot hell.

117
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,471
When I watched tofu hell happen,

118
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,723
something was lit inside me.

119
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,768
But if you asked, "Would you
like to go down and join them?"

120
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,685
I'd say, "No."

121
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,272
Carrots are delicious.
It's an ingredient I like.

122
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,857
We only have 30 minutes,

123
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,360
but I want to show
that I'm an excellent chef.

124
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,487
I was confident.

125
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,283
I have years of cooking experience,

126
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,746
so I can come up
with a lot of ideas on the spot.

127
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,208
I'll tie my apron tight,
and I'll make sure

128
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,877
to rise up from Hell and into Paradise.

129
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,297
Now then, it's time to begin

130
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,760
the first carrot dish battle
of Endless Cooking Hell.

131
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,178
Let's go to Hell!

132
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,721
-Let's go to Hell!
-Let's go!

133
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,519
Gosh, look at these carrots.

134
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,898
I'll take just three.

135
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,495
First, some sugar.

136
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,958
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,459
I shouldn't have brought it.

138
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,464
Things were seriously hectic.

139
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,177
Cooking oil!

140
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,599
Where's the cheese?

141
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,935
I was already completely out of it.

142
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,937
I was in Paradise and then in Hell.

143
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,148
It's a real test of willpower.

144
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,901
Geez, I forgot the sesame oil.
For god's sake.

145
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,028
Damn it.

146
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,251
Although they're just carrots,

147
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,254
unless they're using them raw for a salad,

148
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,965
using various cooking methods
will make 30 minutes fly by.

149
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:33,924
That's right.

150
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,347
The carrots need to be cooked
in the given time,

151
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,516
so I made good use of deep-frying them.

152
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,605
Personally, I think carrots develop
a really nice sweetness when cooked.

153
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,982
It has a distinct aroma.

154
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:02,078
I deep-fried the carrots and sliced them
to prepare a warm carrot salad.

155
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,876
I wanted to bring out
the natural flavor of carrots.

156
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,422
I didn't add any seasoning
and just stir-fried the carrots in oil.

157
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,050
To make sure they can eat
a lot of carrots,

158
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,177
I prepared a similar amount of noodles

159
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,138
and tossed them in soy sauce
before combining everything.

160
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,028
When the carrots rose up,

161
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,949
the carrot tops were all leafy and green.

162
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,452
I knew they were meant to be used
and that they'd be fresh.

163
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,334
I blended the carrot tops
with olive oil to make pesto.

164
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,211
It's something the others wouldn't make.

165
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,505
So I thought I should make it.

166
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,723
Sometimes, when you witness
an awe-inspiring scene,

167
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,268
you end up focusing on that.

168
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,063
He was kneading dough.

169
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:16,569
White powder was rising up
and drifting into the air behind Chef Hou.

170
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,575
It felt like his energy
was ascending to the heavens.

171
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,996
I just stared and was mesmerized.

172
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,962
Chef Hou, what are you making?

173
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,673
I'm going to make carrots with carrots.

174
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,925
-Make carrots with carrots?
-Yes.

175
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,095
With carrots?

176
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,889
He likes to speak in riddles.

177
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,860
I was absolutely certain.

178
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:03,616
There is no chance of me
getting eliminated.

179
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,745
What? Already?

180
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,289
What? Already?

181
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,126
-As expected.
-Gosh, he's fast.

182
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,045
He works quickly.

183
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,006
DISH COMPLETION ORDER
1. IM SEONG-KEUN

184
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,967
I don't think he's ever
not finished first in these battles.

185
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,596
With cooking,

186
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,848
you need to do it quickly.

187
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,435
If you keep playing around with it,
the flavor gets ruined.

188
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,651
I used ingredients
that go well with carrots

189
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,861
to make carrot japchae.

190
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,127
The carrots are what
will bring them all together.

191
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,798
If an ingredient stands out
when making japchae,

192
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,132
that's all you'll taste.

193
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,052
So if you get the balance
of ingredients right,

194
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,638
you can make the flavors
come together as one.

195
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,606
I thought, "I won't be the first to go."

196
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,692
"As long as it's not me, I'm fine."

197
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,361
Currently, you have five minutes left.

198
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,238
Damn, this is nerve-racking.

199
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,326
For my first dish, I decided to go bold

200
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,161
and make a deep-fried dish.

201
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,890
2. VENERABLE SUNJAE

202
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,605
3. BREWMASTER YUN

203
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,993
4. JUNG HO-YOUNG

204
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,537
Currently, you have one minute left.

205
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,003
5. CULINARY MONSTER

206
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,721
6. HOU DEOK-JUK

207
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:34,767
The first carrot dish battle
of Endless Cooking Hell is over.

208
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,983
Time goes by really fast.

209
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,777
Too fast.

210
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,404
-I blinked and 15 minutes were gone.
-It didn't feel like 30.

211
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:55,412
The judging criteria for this round
is the same as it was last season.

212
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,706
-First, how they highlight carrots.
-Right.

213
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,333
-Next, creativity.
-Yes.

214
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,001
-Third is execution.
-Execution.

215
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,461
Taste is a given.

216
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,754
If it doesn't taste good,

217
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,130
-nothing else matters.
-Exactly.

218
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,675
I'm sure they all know this too.

219
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,635
-Last year…
-Yes, if they watched last season.

220
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,178
-They'd keep that in mind.
-Right.

221
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,597
So we should judge the dishes
more carefully.

222
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,726
-Great work, Chef.
-Great job.

223
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,981
The first carrot dish I've made

224
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,067
is carrot japchae,
where carrot is the star of the dish.

225
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,985
CARROT JAPCHAE

226
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,655
Japchae is essentially
a mix of various vegetables.

227
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,909
I mixed seven ingredients
that complement carrots well

228
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,160
to make the japchae.

229
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,851
Carrot is the main ingredient,

230
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,729
so I kept the secondary ingredients
under 50%

231
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,564
by going with a 60-40 ratio.

232
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,400
-Are carrots the 60%?
-Yes.

233
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,403
Not just the carrots

234
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,406
but you brought together
various ingredients as one.

235
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,575
It has this concentrated, focused flavor.

236
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,535
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the dish.

237
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,583
Great work, Venerable.

238
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,671
CARROT BIBIM NOODLES
AND CARROT KIMCHI JUICE

239
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,090
I used an equal amount
of noodles and carrots.

240
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,385
I stir-fried the carrots
without any seasoning.

241
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,720
For the noodles underneath,

242
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,556
I added stir-fried peppers
and tossed them in soy sauce.

243
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,560
I blended kimchi
and carrots together to make

244
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,395
this carrot kimchi juice.

245
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:48,108
When I was ill and my eyes were unwell,
I was told to eat carrots.

246
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:52,196
But carrot juice is really nutritious,
so I'd pass out and sleep when I drank it.

247
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,614
So the senior monk said,

248
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,116
"If you can't even handle juice,
how can you eat food?"

249
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,953
They suggested mixing in soy sauce
or kimchi juice with the carrot juice.

250
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,831
Since then, I'd feel better
when I drink carrot juice.

251
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,880
I blended carrots with white kimchi
and squeezed the juices out.

252
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,353
HONEY

253
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,316
When you drink it with kimchi mixed in,
it goes down gently.

254
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,613
-Should I mix it?
-Yes.

255
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,323
-Shall I mix it for you?
-Please.

256
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,962
Please take plenty of carrots.

257
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,048
I didn't add any seasoning.

258
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,009
-In here?
-I didn't season the carrots.

259
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,138
I just added soy sauce to the noodles.

260
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,245
-Mixing carrots and kimchi is interesting.
-Yes.

261
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,791
When you imagine that juice,

262
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,418
you might think it would be strange.

263
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,295
But it paired so well with the noodles.

264
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,838
It was fine to drink on its own,

265
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:36,425
like the broth of radish water kimchi,
or dongchimi, but a bit sweeter.

266
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,260
Usually, we season with salt.

267
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,428
-Right.
-However,

268
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,597
you didn't use salt,

269
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,931
so there's a lot more texture.

270
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,850
-And the carrot flavor really comes out.
-Yes.

271
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,227
That's why I only seasoned
the noodles with soy sauce.

272
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,229
Thank you.

273
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,860
What's your dish?

274
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:59,656
I used carrot tops to make cold sujebi.

275
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,950
I blended some grilled carrots

276
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,454
and made dough to make sujebi.

277
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:14,296
I chilled the sujebi and then mixed it
with the carrot top sauce.

278
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,133
I wanted to show that a barkeep
can even make something like this.

279
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,136
COLD SUJEBI WITH CARROT TOP SAUCE

280
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,513
So you made pesto with the carrot tops?

281
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,807
-I thought of it when I saw those.
-Saw what?

282
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,767
-Those?
-Yes.

283
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,435
They looked so fresh when they came up.

284
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,229
-So I thought I could use them.
-I see.

285
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,898
Yes, so nothing went to waste.

286
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,877
In Korea, we don't really eat carrot tops.

287
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,128
-No, not at all.
-Right.

288
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,171
In other countries,

289
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,881
-they use it in salads.
-Yes.

290
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,675
They use it in various ways.

291
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,093
Yes, so I gave it a try.

292
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,886
Thank you for the dish.

293
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,471
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

294
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,270
Hello.

295
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,774
I made cream croquettes with carrots.

296
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,444
CARROT CREAM CROQUETTES

297
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,612
What's inside?

298
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,365
First, I made a béchamel sauce.

299
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,324
BÉCHAMEL SAUCE

300
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,576
I scooped out and cooked
tiny round pieces of carrots.

301
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,621
I mixed them with corn
and a sauce made of blended carrots.

302
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,210
As you chew the crispy parts,

303
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,422
the sweet carrots will come out.

304
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,798
That's what you'll taste.

305
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,968
It's a flavor that will appeal to anyone.

306
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,113
It tastes very luxurious.

307
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,032
Thank you for the dish.

308
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,747
-Hello.
-Your dish name, please.

309
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,956
What's your dish name?

310
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,458
Warm carrot salad.

311
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,751
-Warm carrot salad?
-Yes.

312
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,252
WARM CARROT SALAD

313
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,880
I deep-fried the carrots

314
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,590
and mixed them with anchovy butter.

315
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,507
ANCHOVY BUTTER

316
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:28,347
I mixed carrot jam with orange marmalade
and spread that on the bottom.

317
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,973
I also added butter made with carrots.

318
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:30,891
CARROT BUTTER SAUCE

319
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:36,772
I added some raw carrots
and a citrus element as well.

320
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,904
I finished with shallots and chilis.

321
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,495
There's a lot in here.

322
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,709
-There are raw ones too.
-Yes, there are raw carrots too.

323
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,336
-Do we eat them together?
-Yes.

324
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,589
There are tangerines in there too.
I recommend tasting them together.

325
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,918
You turned carrots into a proper dish.

326
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,882
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

327
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,183
I think I survived,

328
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,145
so I should quickly decide on
what carrot dish to make next.

329
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,818
You really did make carrots.

330
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,030
I used the real things to make fake ones.

331
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,991
But these look more real.

332
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,787
MINI FRIED CARROTS

333
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,587
I juiced some carrots
and used that to make dough.

334
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,882
I cut it into small pieces.

335
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,049
RED BEAN PASTE

336
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:33,221
And I filled each one with red bean paste.

337
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,643
I rolled them out with my hand

338
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,563
until they turned into carrot-like shapes.

339
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:50,322
Using the dough cutter,
I gently scored the carrot dough.

340
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:54,659
Next, I deep-fried them in oil.

341
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:05,212
Carrots have leaves at the top.

342
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,129
CILANTRO STEM ENDS

343
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,964
I cut the ends of cilantro stems off

344
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,135
and tuck them into the tops
of the deep-fried carrots.

345
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,981
-I guess it's a kind of dim sum dish.
-That's right.

346
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,983
You can think of it
as a kind of dim sum dish.

347
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,402
The glutinous rice pastry
is nice and soft,

348
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:33,073
and the red bean paste
gives it a slightly sweet flavor.

349
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,659
You don't need to eat the leaves.

350
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,497
It really feels like I'm eating a carrot.

351
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,263
Even kids who don't like carrots
would enjoy this.

352
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,264
Right.

353
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,810
Thank you for the dish.

354
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,396
Aren't you tired? Are you okay?

355
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,605
No, I'm fine.

356
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,190
I'm enjoying myself.

357
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,692
Thank you.

358
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,028
And with this,

359
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:17,701
all dishes in the first carrot dish battle
have been tasted.

360
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,378
-So first place is…
-First place is…

361
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,463
-This one was good too.
-Yes.

362
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,673
Culinary Monster's was good.

363
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,758
-He used a variety of ingredients.
-Yeah.

364
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,803
Venerable Sunjae's was good too.

365
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,305
It was very good.

366
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,931
-I loved it.
-Yeah.

367
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,599
It wasn't seasoned, so it was better.

368
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,685
From a chef's point of view,

369
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,689
not seasoning something
is actually really difficult.

370
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,733
It was only slightly cooked,

371
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:53,611
so all the crunch and freshness
were still there.

372
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,530
So first place is Venerable Sunjae.

373
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,324
-I wanted to eat it again.
-Yes, exactly.

374
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,950
But this one was…

375
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,703
It was delicious. It was good but…

376
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,955
Although I could see
the carrots in the dish,

377
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,790
-I couldn't really taste them.
-Right.

378
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,250
-For some reason, I couldn't.
-Yes.

379
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,378
It's fine.

380
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,088
Everything's fine.

381
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,262
We will now reveal the results.

382
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:24,642
The chef eliminated
in the first carrot dish battle…

383
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,812
I don't want to be the first to go.

384
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,108
I'm sure I didn't make
any mistakes flavor-wise.

385
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,486
…is…

386
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,489
White Spoon Chef

387
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,783
Im Seong-keun.

388
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,996
Im Seong-keun.

389
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,208
IM SEONG-KEUN ELIMINATED

390
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,093
It was a difficult decision,

391
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,553
but carrots are the main ingredient.

392
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,931
They weren't as prominent
as they were in other dishes,

393
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,933
so we chose Chef Im Seong-keun.

394
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,311
Even without the carrots,
it would've been a delicious dish.

395
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,897
If they were replaced with something else,

396
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,399
it still would've been delicious.

397
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,360
We felt it didn't quite meet
the judging criteria

398
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,946
that we had established at the start.

399
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,782
I tried my best to present Korean cuisine.

400
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,868
I will continue to work hard to contribute

401
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,579
to the development of Korean cuisine.

402
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,580
It's been a pleasure.

403
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:37,048
Chef Im Seong-keun, please take
your nameplate and leave the kitchen.

404
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,888
Good luck!

405
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,682
You did great.

406
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,142
Great job, Chef.

407
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,351
I'm off!

408
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,312
During the entire time I was here,

409
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,065
I think I felt alive again.

410
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:59,279
Until the day I put down my knife,
I'll continue to cook good Korean food.

411
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,365
Well, this is it for me.

412
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,538
IM SEONG-KEUN

413
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:13,585
I hope you've been enjoying
Culinary Class Wars Season 2 thus far.

414
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,380
This is the end for me,
but there are still people left,

415
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,298
so stay tuned!

416
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,225
Now then, it's time to begin

417
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,313
the second carrot dish battle
of Endless Cooking Hell.

418
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,150
We're starting right away?

419
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,527
Oh, no.

420
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,871
There's no break. We just jump right in.

421
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,248
What do we do?

422
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,210
I'm going to break this door down.

423
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,712
God, I'm losing my mind.

424
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,631
-What do I do?
-Hold on.

425
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,590
The battle began,

426
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:04,177
but I was like, "What do I do?
Where am I?" and started to scream.

427
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,262
What was I about to do?

428
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,514
What did I come to get?

429
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,350
This really is a crazy competition.

430
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,061
The croquettes are still here,

431
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,688
but we're starting right away.

432
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,528
This mission requires quick thinking.

433
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,780
It's about who can best highlight carrots

434
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,032
using the available ingredients,

435
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,867
so it wasn't too difficult.

436
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,454
My build may say otherwise,
but I'm very quick on my feet.

437
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,345
My second dish is steamed carrot
and soy milk custard.

438
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,515
For the garnish,
I prepared a smoky carrot tartare.

439
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:56,145
I boiled the carrots in soy milk
to infuse the flavor into the milk.

440
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,903
Then, I added eggs
with a higher ratio of yolks,

441
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,072
so the texture would be creamier.

442
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,543
My first carrot dish was about
accentuating the sweet flavor of carrots.

443
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,464
So for my second dish,
I wanted to highlight the savory

444
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,967
and earthy flavor of carrots.

445
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,262
For the carrot tartare,

446
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,098
I grilled carrots over charcoal
until they were charred.

447
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,811
I wanted to show that carrots
can be used creatively like this

448
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,898
and that their flavor
can be presented in new ways.

449
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,568
I was quite sure
I'd make it through this battle too.

450
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:50,033
My second dish
is Japanese-style braised carrots.

451
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,035
Generally speaking,

452
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:56,247
they don't really braise
just carrots in Japanese cuisine.

453
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,000
To borrow the sweetness of Kabocha,

454
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,712
I cooked them with the carrots
and made them as soft as possible.

455
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,844
For my second dish,
I prepared carrot gimmari.

456
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,723
I wanted to try making a fun carrot dish

457
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:17,101
that you could also make at home.

458
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,899
For the second dish, I made carrot jeon.

459
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,485
I wanted to show

460
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,904
that even the same jeon dish
can have different recipes.

461
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,616
Normally, people mix the ingredients
in flour batter when making jeon.

462
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,076
But I didn't add any water.

463
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,203
I just used grated potatoes.

464
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,956
I also added some julienned potatoes.

465
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,420
I didn't add any water,
so the carrots' sweetness is still there.

466
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:49,968
Carrots have a naturally sweet flavor.

467
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:55,640
I think that will pair well
with the tenderness of shrimp.

468
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,101
I thought of a new idea

469
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,895
and tried something
I've never tried before.

470
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,899
I sliced the carrots into thin strips,

471
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:10,947
finely minced some shrimp,
and then shaped them into balls.

472
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,244
I used shrimp,
and the carrots are sweet as well,

473
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:22,291
so a slightly spicy sauce
would complement them nicely.

474
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:27,714
I mixed equal parts of the sauce
with carrot juice.

475
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:33,720
The carrots' sweetness
matched well with the sauce.

476
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,807
-They're staying true to their styles.
-Right.

477
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,269
I think they truly shine
when cooking in their own styles.

478
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,906
Currently, you have five minutes left.

479
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,783
Five minutes. Just one more minute.

480
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,084

Currently, you have one minute left.

484
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,775
Almost done.

485
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,693
Ten, nine,

486

5. HOU DEOK-JUK

492
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,955
The second carrot dish battle
of Endless Cooking Hell is over.

493
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,924
Damn, what a mess.

494
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,218
Great work.

495
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:02,517
I made carrot jeon and pickled carrots.

496
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:07,063
I added soy sauce, vinegar,
and grain syrup to water and boiled it.

497
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,399
Then, I poured that over sliced carrots.

498
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,402
If you pour over hot liquid
and let that sit, it becomes pickles.

499
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,719
-I can eat it with the brine too?
-Yes, of course.

500
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,523
These pickles would taste great
when they ferment.

501
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,567
-Yes.
-They're good for being just made.

502
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,196
Thank you for the dish.

503
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,281
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

504
00:35:59,031 --> 00:35:59,866
Hello.

505
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,534
Hello.

506
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,163
This time, I made steamed carrot
and soy milk custard.

507
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,332
On the bottom is carrot-flavored
steamed soy milk custard.

508
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,959
It was only lightly seasoned.

509
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,006
On top is a smoky carrot tartare.

510
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,643
For the garnish,
I used a carrot juice reduction,

511
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,769
horseradish…

512
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,021
ALSO KNOWN AS WESTERN WASABI

513
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,441
…and croutons to finish the dish.

514
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:39,071
STEAMED CARROT SOY MILK CUSTARD
WITH SMOKY CARROT TARTARE

515
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,618
-We eat this all together?
-Yes.

516
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,157
-You used grilled carrots, right?
-That's right.

517
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,617
Since you grilled them, the aroma…

518
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,495
The texture's nice,
and the aroma is great too.

519
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,412
By the way,

520
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,081
-you said it's a carrot tartare.
-Yes.

521
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,124
Is it because you seasoned the carrots?

522
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:36,837
Yes. For starters, I finely chopped them,
so you can eat this in one bite.

523
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:42,802
Tartare is usually made by mincing beef
and mixing it with seasonings.

524
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:46,430
I finely chopped the carrots

525
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,518
and dressed them with other ingredients,
so I called it a tartare.

526
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,729
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

527
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,316
It's deep-fried glass noodles
in dried seaweed,

528
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,026
or gimmari, with carrots inside.

529
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,487
CARROT GIMMARI

530
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,699
I used carrot purée
to make a gochujang sauce

531
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,575
to use like a dipping sauce.

532
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,964
-It goes well with the gochujang.
-Really?

533
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,215
Thank you.

534
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,050
They're braised carrots.

535
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,553
I braised them in katsuobushi broth.

536
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,681
Please take the carrots and fried tofu
with a bit of broth

537
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,182
and taste them all in one bite.

538
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,282
It tastes pretty unique
when you cook carrots this way.

539
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,993
-It's nicely braised.
-They go well with fried tofu.

540
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,122
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

541
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:58,878
Hello.

542
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,592
LA-MI CARROT AND SHRIMP BALLS

543
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:09,513
"La-mi" essentially means "spicy flavor."

544
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,683
I steamed the carrot and shrimp balls.

545
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,355
Then, I poured the la-mi sauce on top.

546
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:23,819
Carrots are pretty sweet,
so I added a bit of a spicy kick.

547
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:47,968
Without this sauce,

548
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,639
this pairing wouldn't have worked
since the carrots are so sweet.

549
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,767
The doneness of the carrots and shrimp,

550
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,519
even though you steamed them together,

551
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,146
-was perfect and well-balanced.
-Right.

552
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,315
These carrots were really delicious.

553
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,608
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

554
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,318
Thank you very much.

555
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:10,199
SECOND CARROT DISH BATTLE
TASTING IS COMPLETE

556
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,537
Let's see.

557
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,539
First place is…

558
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,417
-Right?
-Yes, Culinary Monster.

559
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,335
-For this battle.
-Yes, I think so.

560
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,337
-It was packed with flavor.
-Exactly.

561
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,924
The top and bottom had different flavors,
and his idea was really good.

562
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,634
Then, in last place is ***…

563
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,971
Yes, you're right.

564
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,556
Carrots were used,

565
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,976
-but they didn't really do much.
-Right.

566
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,565
-This dish was a bit…
-Disappointing.

567
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,191
Yes, it was a little disappointing.

568
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,490
We will now reveal the results.

569
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,536
The chef eliminated
in the second carrot dish battle is…

570
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,832
White Spoon Chef…

571
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,545
White Spoon Chef…

572
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,923
Venerable Sunjae.

573
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,262
Venerable Sunjae.

574
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,390
VENERABLE SUNJAE ELIMINATED

575
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,976
-Creativity was…
-It was lacking.

576
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,769
-It lacked creativity.
-In this battle.

577
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,188
It was just…

578
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,772
-too much like a potato jeon.
-Yes.

579
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,899
Just a potato jeon…

580
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,901
-With just a slight variation.
-Right.

581
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,363
Everyone here works so hard
in the kitchen,

582
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,115
so I thought it was only right

583
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,202
that they should make it
all the way to the end.

584
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,747
I'm so grateful to have shared

585
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,416
this long journey with you all.

586
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,667
Thank you.

587
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,798
You did great.

588
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,218
-You did great, Venerable.
-Thank you.

589
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,222
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

590
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,723
-Thank you.
-You did a great job.

591
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,350
-See you next time.
-Yes.

592
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,937
Great job, Venerable.

593
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,021
Thank you.

594
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,232
-Thank you.
-Great job.

595
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,316
Thank you.

596
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,737
When I was in pain
and struggling the most,

597
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,990
temple cuisine
was the turning point in my life.

598
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,494
I wanted to show that temple cuisine
could bring out these kinds of flavor

599
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:22,039
and show people
how delicious these flavors could be.

600
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,876
I was able to share
this culinary culture with others,

601
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,462
and it felt like
it gained some recognition.

602
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,380
VENERABLE SUNJAE

603
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,715
So it made me feel so grateful.

604
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,009
Thank you so much.

605
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,432
The third carrot dish battle
of Endless Cooking Hell.

606
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,018
NUMBER OF CHEFS REMAINING IS 4

607
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,358
My third dish is carrot katsu sando.

608
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,654
After coating carrots in batter
and breadcrumbs, I deep-fried them.

609
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:59,368
Like the katsu-sandos in Japanese cuisine,
I made a carrot katsu-sando.

610
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,995
CARROT KATSU SANDO

611
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,621
Just like the texture of meat,

612
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,374
it will taste crispy on the outside
and tender on the inside.

613
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,838
It's a delicious katsu-sando.

614
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,132
You could easily sell this
as a carrot katsu.

615
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,341
Thank you.

616
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,510
I prepared a deep-fried dish.

617
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,345
I fried them like Homerun Balls,

618
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,014
the Korean cream puff snacks.

619
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:24,393
I added cumin and chopped raw carrots
into the mixture.

620
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,444
I prepared a dipping sauce
made with curry powder.

621
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,695
CARROT CHOUX WITH CURRY SAUCE

622
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:43,662
You leverage a lot of ingredients
that can highlight the flavor of carrots.

623
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,040
-Did you succeed?
-Yes.

624
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,541
CARROT AND EGG TORTILLA

625
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,792
It's like an omelet.

626
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,503
A Spanish tortilla
is usually made with potatoes.

627
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,755
POTATOES

628
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,548
So I tried making it with carrots.

629
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,008
CARROTS

630
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,218
It's not my specialty,

631
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,180
but I tried it anyway
since I've come all the way to Hell.

632
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,351
I've come this far,
so I wanted to test myself.

633
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,936
I can tell you worked hard.

634
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,943
I decided to cook a carrot dish
using a kkanpung sauce.

635
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,823
As you taste the tangy flavor
of the kkanpung sauce,

636
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,285
the sweetness of the carrots come out.

637
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,377
I can taste the kkanpung sauce,
but the carrot aroma is also there.

638
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,713
The chef eliminated
in the third carrot dish battle is…

639
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,340
Black Spoon Chef…

640
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,468
Brewmaster Yun.

641
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,932
BREWMASTER YUN ELIMINATED

642
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,102
It wasn't too different
from a basic omelet with lots of carrots.

643
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,561
But it was a great attempt.

644
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,230
We'll keep on rooting for you.

645
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,150
I really can't believe I made it this far.

646
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,944
I survived

647
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,988
many more times…

648
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,367
than I expected to.

649
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,327
I gave it my all.

650
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,835
I'm really grateful to Chef Anh Sung-jae

651
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,087
for recognizing my potential
during the first round.

652
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,173
I didn't have much confidence before.

653
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,344
I hadn't even followed
the traditional path.

654
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,807
But they recognized, discovered,
and acknowledged me.

655
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,852
I think this will stay with me
as I go through life.

656
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,939
I hope you can keep believing in me,

657
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:37,025
and I'll do my best.

658
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,070
BREWMASTER YUN

659
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:43,115
ENDLESS COOKING HELL
NUMBER OF CHEFS REMAINING IS 3

660
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,451
I was having so much fun.

661
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,872
I thought it was pretty fun
to power through like that

662
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,499
with such limited time and circumstances.

663
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,377
Chef Hou was right next to me,

664
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,506
so how could I frown and complain
about being tired?

665
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,134
Physically,

666
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,052
it wasn't too demanding.

667
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:09,183
I was confident I could make it
to the end of the carrot mission.

668
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:15,439
After we started making the carrot dishes,
I somehow felt more energized.

669
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,649
I realized we only had
a few battles left now.

670
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,651
Just you wait, Choi Kang-rok.

671
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,200
Now then, it's time to begin

672
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,953
the fourth carrot dish battle
of Endless Cooking Hell.

673
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,477
I didn't run out of ideas.

674
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,942
Citrus and carrots
go really well together.

675
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,948
I prepared a carrot soup.

676
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:09,034
Saffron. That was the key.

677
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,035
SAFFRON

678
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,666
TANGERINE

679
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,044
ORANGE ZEST

680
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,926
For the garnish on the bottom,
I used orange segments, poached shrimp,

681
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,678
cooked carrots,

682
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,181
shallots, and dill.

683
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,934
As each battle progressed,

684
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:38,522
I felt the quality of the carrot dishes
I made every 30 minutes got better.

685
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,275
I thought I had a good chance
of making it to the end.

686
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,948
Chef Hou is running around.

687
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,118
Gosh, his stamina is amazing.

688
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,954
Since he's been a chef his whole life,

689
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:57,624
in a way, this moment might be
an exciting and precious moment

690
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,836
where he truly feels alive.

691
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,214
It's the same with everything.

692
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,550
At first, you think,
"How do they expect us

693
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,052
to keep cooking dish after dish?"

694
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:14,141
But once you decide to do it,
new ideas keep popping up along the way.

695
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:49,134
Making a jjajang sauce

696
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:52,638
to accompany the carrots could work well.

697
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,598
That idea suddenly came to mind.

698
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,518
Carrots are the main ingredient.

699
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:24,044
When I used a spiralizer
to cut the carrots into strands…

700
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,758
I thought I could use them as noodles.

701
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,429
Instead of wheat noodles,
these are carrot noodles.

702
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,858
When pairing with carrots,

703
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,277
I thought the jjajang sauce
should be a bit different.

704
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,615
Since the carrots came out
in long noodle-like strands,

705
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,744
I decided the jjajang sauce ingredients
should be cut into long strands too.

706
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,123
There's something called a rou si.

707
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,916
"Rou" means meat,

708
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:06,837
and "si" refers to shredding the meat.

709
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:11,508
These thin strips match nicely
with the carrot noodles.

710
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,637
I also decided to use red onions.

711
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,098
RED ONIONS USED TO MATCH THE FLAVOR
AND COLOR OF CARROTS

712
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,435
I cut them into thin slices

713
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,062
and stir-fried it all
in the jjajang sauce.

714
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,704
With the carrot noodles in mind,

715
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:44,374
I made this jjajang sauce
to complement them.

716
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:04,603
My fourth dish
is a sweet carrot castella-like dish.

717
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,063
I julienne the carrots,

718
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,858
season them with just salt and pepper,
and sauté them.

719
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,987
I flatten a slice of bread

720
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,364
and roll everything up in it.

721
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,247
It's a carrot

722
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,333
rolled omelet.

723
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,461
As you would when making cake,

724
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,546
I made it sweet.

725
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,631
It's so hot.

726
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,383
I have to bear it though.

727
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,471
It's my reinterpretation
of a Japanese-style rolled omelet.

728
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,560
It's so hot.

729
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,146
Just bear it.

730
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,572
DISH COMPLETION ORDER
1. CULINARY MONSTER

731
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,782
He's already finished?

732
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,216
2. HOU DEOK-JUK

733
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,488
Almost done.

734
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,077
3. JUNG HO-YOUNG

735
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:48,665
The fourth carrot dish battle
of Endless Cooking Hell is over.

736
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:55,964
What a pretty color.

737
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,926
CARROT SOUP

738
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,221
I made it with carrots,
saffron, and oranges.

739
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,725
The garnish underneath
is made of shrimp, cooked carrots,

740
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,852
and also orange segments,

741
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:12,188
dressed with dill and lime juice.

742
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:17,944
Please enjoy.

743
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,577
Do I eat it like this?

744
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,745
Yes. Make sure you mix it.

745
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,397
Carrots can taste like this?

746
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,404
A variety of ingredients
went into this small dish,

747
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,697
but they work well together.

748
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,658
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the dish.

749
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,784
Thank you.

750
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,248
It's beautiful.

751
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,588
CARROT JJAJANGMYEON

752
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:28,348
If this wasn't carrot hell,
I wouldn't have known these were carrots.

753
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,980
I mixed some miso into the sauce.

754
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:46,157
-You didn't use just black bean paste.
-No, not just that.

755
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,998
I bet these noodles won't get soggy.

756
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,377
-Carrot jjajangmyeon is a first for me.
-Right.

757
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,378
Truly a first.

758
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,922
It's my first time making this too.

759
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:01,923
Is that so?

760
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,844
Today's the first time in my life
I've cooked this many carrot dishes.

761
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,622
Who knew I'd be slurping
carrot noodles like this?

762
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:54,768
The texture of the carrots
aren't too different from actual noodles.

763
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,478
I steamed the carrots.

764
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,856
I steamed them for about five minutes.

765
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:05,862
Wheat noodles are all blanched
or boiled in water,

766
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:10,283
but if you boil carrots in water,
you'll lose all that flavor.

767
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,832
The steaming time
was absolutely crucial here.

768
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,752
Had they been slightly overcooked,

769
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,379
they would've broken apart
as you ate them.

770
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,549
If undercooked,
they would've been too crunchy.

771
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:30,053
But he steamed them just right,
so we could slurp them like noodles.

772
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,686
Seeing him perfect that really shocked me.
I got goosebumps.

773
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,357
I wasn't sure if this
would work well with carrots.

774
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,234
-Right.
-But they go well with jjajang.

775
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,819
The doneness of the carrots

776
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,738
made it feel like noodles.

777
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,324
The sweet flavor of the carrots come up

778
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,618
and tones down the saltiness
of the black bean paste.

779
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,161
Right, it does.

780
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,247
I keep reaching for more.

781
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,836
Thank you for the dish.

782
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,338
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

783
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,881
Thank you.

784
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,096
-Please explain your dish.
-This is a kind of carrot castella.

785
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,098
It's a sweet tamagoyaki.

786
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,057
CARROT TAMAGOYAKI

787
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,184
There's bread in the middle.

788
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,936
-I flattened it and rolled it up.
-Bread?

789
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,689
I also blended the carrots
and mixed them into the eggs.

790
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,640
As you said, it feels like
I'm eating a dessert.

791
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:02,687
Yes, given the 30-minute time limit,
I couldn't really bake a castella,

792
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,565
so I pan-fried and rolled it up,
like a rolled omelet.

793
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,693
Carrots and eggs really do
go well together.

794
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:09,944
Thank you for the dish.

795
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:19,078
FOURTH CARROT DISH BATTLE
TASTING IS COMPLETE

796
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:25,210
This one was just perfect.
I even gave them an extra point.

797
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,670
Chef Hou Deok-juk was… I mean, wow.

798
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,340
-He was hiding a secret weapon.
-Right.

799
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,468
-In that case, this one is a bit…
-Yes, ***.

800
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,554
-I get what it is.
-Right.

801
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,555
But comparatively…

802
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,265
-I get the intent.
-Yeah.

803
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,767
I get it too.

804
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,436
We will now reveal the results.

805
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:48,233
The chef eliminated
in the fourth carrot dish battle…

806
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,533
…is…

807
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,079
White Spoon Chef Jung Ho-young.

808
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,707
Jung Ho-young.

809
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:08,545
JUNG HO-YOUNG ELIMINATED

810
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,678
I've never experienced a competition

811
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:20,098
this thrilling and fun before.

812
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:25,603
I was so invested in this
I'd even dream about it every night.

813
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:30,191
I think I was able to show
all the Japanese cooking I could,

814
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,694
so I gave it my all with no regrets.

815
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,070
Thank you.

816
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,664
Still, I made it to the top four.

817
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm sad to go, but I'm happy.

818
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:47,917
So today,

819
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,420
I want to enjoy a cold glass of draft beer

820
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:51,963
and get a good night's sleep.

821
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,633
I could've faced off against Kang-rok.
What a shame.

822
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,469
Kang-rok, I hope you win.

823
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:05,143
JUNG HO-YOUNG

824
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,936
Hell is back.

825
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,064
Carrot hell?

826
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:13,109
CARROT DISHES MADE SO FAR

827
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:18,698
18 IN TOTAL

828
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,367
ENDLESS COOKING HELL

829
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,288
2 HOURS IN

830
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,916
NUMBER OF CHEFS REMAINING IS 2

831
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,920
In any case, there's one final match left.

832
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:36,966
To our first finalist, Chef Choi Kang-rok,

833
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,135
who would you like to see advance?

834
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,475
With Culinary Monster,

835
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,352
even his name sounds terrifying.

836
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,857
This time, I think
a White Spoon face-off might be nice.

837
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:59,489
I've been cooking my entire life
and have come this far,

838
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:03,368
but I'm reminded again
there's no end or limit to cooking.

839
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:06,204
Every time you cook,
new dishes continue to be created.

840
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:09,415
Anyway, since I've come this far,

841
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,709
I will try my best.

842
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,128
Chef Hou Deok-juk
has essentially been cooking

843
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:18,549
for as long as my father's been alive.

844
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:22,136
I really do respect
and admire Chef Hou, but…

845
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,599
But there's only one more match
before the finals.

846
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,726
So I'm sorry, Chef Hou,

847
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,104
but I'll be giving it my all to win.

848
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,939
I didn't feel like losing.

849
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:37,568
He mentioned
how I was around his father's age.

850
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,321
But this is a game of survival.

851
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,782
There are no fathers or sons here.

852
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,618
Fine, let's do this again
and see where it takes us.

853
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:49,080
Now, it's time to begin

854
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:53,084
the fifth and final carrot dish battle
of Endless Cooking Hell.

855
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:00,925
Good luck, Chef.

856
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,802
-Do your best.
-Thank you, Chef.

857
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,470
-Don't feel pressured.
-Yes, sir.

858
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,513
Let's enjoy it.

859
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:06,514
All right.

860
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:23,740
Culinary Monster's cooking style
and Chef Hou Deok-juk's cooking style

861
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,033
aren't just at odds.

862
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,035
There's an entire 60-year gap.

863
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,372
Does the one with more experience
have the upper hand?

864
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,833
Or does the one with new ideas
have the advantage?

865
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,126
There's no telling.

866
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:38,671
Because this battle
isn't about who does better.

867
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,923
It's about who can take hold
of this moment.

868
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:47,555
That means how they use
these 30 minutes is very important.

869
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,391
I was dying to know what they chose to do.

870
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:06,324
Soyang is a cooking term.

871
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,369
I take the main ingredient

872
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,581
and cut down the middle of a piece
without cutting all the way through.

873
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,000
I'm basically making an opening.

874
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:26,093
I stuff the insides with minced shrimp.

875
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:29,931
That's what soyang refers to.
It means "stuffed in the middle."

876
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,938
After steaming them,

877
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:42,026
their shapes look
like flowers or butterflies.

878
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:46,864
I'm exhausted.

879
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,993
It's physically tiring,

880
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,455
but I realized
I could make another new dish.

881
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:01,045
After so many matches,
I was feeling worn out too.

882
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,465
I was craving something sweet,

883
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:06,968
so I prepared a dessert.

884
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,763
I had some brioche left,

885
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,432
and I thought it might be delicious

886
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,560
if I soaked it in syrup, like a cake.

887
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,275
I made a carrot syrup.

888
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,906
I soaked the brioche slices
in the carrot syrup.

889
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:35,705
I mixed ricotta cheese,
yogurt, and lime juice

890
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,499
to make a cream base.

891
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,129
I layered them, and for the final step…

892
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:48,301
I added carrot and orange jeonggwa,
a Korean confection,

893
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,014
and deep-fried shredded ginger on top.

894
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,184
Currently, you have ten minutes left.

895
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,355
You're already finished?

896
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:04,442
We were about to ask what you're cooking.

897
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:05,860
-You're already done?
-Yes.

898
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:12,283
There's the sweet flavor of carrots
and the tangy taste of the sauce.

899
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:18,831
And when you eat the shrimp,
there's a hint of cilantro as well.

900
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:26,797
This is delicious, so I'm not worried.

901
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:36,974
The fifth and final carrot dish battle
of Endless Cooking Hell is over.

902
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,565
-Well done for making it this far.
-Thank you.

903
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,484
Please explain your dish.

904
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,153
My final dish is carrot cake.

905
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,446
CARROT CAKE

906
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,531
-It's a carrot cake?
-Yes, it's a dessert.

907
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,533
It looks like a carrot pudding
on the outside.

908
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,411
-Like this?
-Yes.

909
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,081
He said it was carrot cake,
but at first glance,

910
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,500
it didn't look like
carrot cake from above.

911
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:05,419
I assumed it'd have bread inside
and things like that,

912
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,129
but it was completely different.

913
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,882
He made the carrot seem like a fruit.

914
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,468
I turned the carrots
into a Korean confection.

915
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:16,389
I reduced them in syrup,
like in Korean cuisine.

916
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,433
I also added some oranges.

917
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,898
Are they carrots or fruits?

918
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,650
I played a bit of a trick.

919
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,862
I essentially brought out the sweet
and fragrant flavor of carrots.

920
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:47,294
I was low on energy,
so I made something I wanted to eat.

921
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,215
He was low on energy
and wanted to eat something sweet?

922
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:53,634
If he did that intentionally,
he really is a monster.

923
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:54,969
Because we felt the same too.

924
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,139
I was running low on energy too.

925
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,853
Sugar went into my mouth
exactly when I needed it.

926
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:05,771
Of course, it was highly satisfying.

927
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,314
This may not seem like much,

928
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,900
but that's part of being a good chef.

929
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:12,653
"The response will be better
if I serve this at this time."

930
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,239
Diners might enjoy it much more
if you change up the order.

931
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:16,866
It's delicious.

932
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:20,327
The carrots don't feel like vegetables.

933
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,872
-It felt more like eating a fruit.
-Exactly.

934
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,290
The texture was great too.

935
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,375
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

936
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:33,090
I thought, "Okay, let's be objective
and save this flavor in my memory."

937
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,889
-You've done amazingly, Master Hou.
-Thank you.

938
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,223
This is the last dish.

939
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,059
-The 20th carrot dish.
-Yes.

940
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,979
YUXIANG CARROTS

941
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,441
When you're stuffing something,
you don't usually use a hard ingredient.

942
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:54,487
As far as I'm aware,
lotus root is as hard as it gets.

943
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,990
-It must be your first time using carrots.
-Yes, it's my first time.

944
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,117
-Thank you for this.
-Of course.

945
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,455
It's not easy to make yuxiang sauce
come out so light in color.

946
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,999
Yes, I made it lighter on purpose.

947
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,056
I ate it…

948
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:27,603
And it was delicious.

949
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:32,483
The amount of shrimp,
the sauce, and even the broccoli.

950
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,485
Everything was centered
around the carrots.

951
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,738
They were all there just for the carrots.

952
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,241
Usually, yuxiang sauce

953
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,410
-is sweet, sour, and spicy.
-That's right.

954
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:46,455
So it could've overpowered
the flavor of the carrots,

955
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,374
-but you made it lighter.
-Yes.

956
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:49,959
The carrot flavor really stands out.

957
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:52,169
The rich flavor of the yuxiang sauce

958
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:55,381
and the sweetness of the carrots
and shrimp all came together.

959
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,008
It was delicious.

960
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,927
I really enjoyed it.

961
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,389
Thank you.

962
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,724
-Great work, Chef.
-Thank you.

963
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:07,560
Are we done for today?

964
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,021
I'm content.

965
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,149
I thought I'd be able to
advance to the finals.

966
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,526
I had that confidence.

967
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,319
Both of them…

968
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,654
JUDGES' DISCUSSION

969
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,990
They both

970
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,368
did an excellent job
of using the ingredient.

971
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:27,621
-Execution was also very good.
-Almost… Yes, you're right.

972
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,623
The carrot cake was…

973
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,584
It wasn't the kind
of carrot cake we expected.

974
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,626
No, not at all.

975
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:33,586
I was so shocked.

976
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,547
It was a bit watery, so I thought
it was carrot pudding at first.

977
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,924
I was so shocked after taking a bite.

978
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,968
Chef Hou also used carrots well.

979
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:43,053
-He highlighted their qualities.
-He did so well.

980
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,806
-And it was well-executed.
-Everything was on point.

981
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,350
So in terms of flavor, execution,

982
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,561
and use of the carrots, they're both…

983
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:51,770
We were at a loss.

984
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,064
They're both perfect. What do we do?

985
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:57,234
The ingredient? They both used
the ingredient really well.

986
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:00,154
Level of execution was very high too.
They were pretty equal.

987
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,864
They both did so well.

988
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,407
How do we choose?

989
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,159
This is a tough one.

990
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:10,789
Before we announce the result,
you both did a fantastic job.

991
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:14,585
And thank you for presenting
such amazing dishes.

992
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,923
In this Endless Cooking Hell,

993
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,343
the final survivor is…

994
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,223
He made the carrot seem like a fruit.

995
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:30,142
If he did that intentionally,
he really is a monster.

996
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:36,565
The sweetness of the carrots
and shrimp all came together.

997
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,860
They were all there just for the carrots.

998
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:43,280
The final survivor is…

999
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:50,746
The final survivor is…

1000
