1
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,469
The qualities of these noodles,

2
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,929
such as their texture,

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,889
aroma, balance of flavors,

4
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:18,101
and this taste
that's still lingering in my mouth…

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,769
When I take all of these into account…

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,604
Chef Kim Do-yun…

7
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,773
Yes?

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,775
You're eliminated.

9
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:28,528
You're eliminated.

10
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,530
PAIK JONG-WON, SURVIVED
ANH SUNG-JAE, ELIMINATED

11
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:31,656
You're eliminated.

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,034
Oh, dear.

13
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,077
I don't think he made it.

14
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,121
Oh, no.

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,959
From your dish today,

16
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,879
there's still a chalky aftertaste.

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:47,922
And for me,

18
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,427
it wasn't what I consider
delicious noodles.

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,097
Thank you for your dish.

20
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,349
Hidden White Spoon Chef Kim Do-yun

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,185
has been eliminated.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,605
…has been eliminated.

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,734
Damn…

24
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,029
That's like AI-level analysis.

25
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,990
You can really feel
his presence as a judge.

26
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,493
It was a truly difficult decision.

27
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,162
He's a chef I respect so much,

28
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,248
and he's an important figure
in our industry.

29
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,875
But aside from all of that,

30
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:28,171
in that moment when I tasted
the dish he had made,

31
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,591
I fully understood
why the dish was special.

32
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:35,929
But I felt the noodles
were slightly undercooked.

33
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,724
I felt he had made a mistake,
so I was disappointed too.

34
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,937
With the elimination
of Hidden White Spoon Chef Kim Do-yun,

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,358
the number of Black Spoon survivors
did not get an increase.

36
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,195
-…did not get an increase.
-Oh, my god.

37
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,660
-Thank you for your efforts.
-Thank you.

38
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,036
You were amazing.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,496
You did great.

40
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,167
This is seriously tough.

41
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,503
-He even brought his noodle machine.
-I know.

42
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,715
Eliminated Hidden White Spoon
Chef Kim Do-yun,

43
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,801
please take your nameplate
and leave the kitchen.

44
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,845
You did great.

45
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,473
-You did great!
-You did a great job!

46
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,694
It's his second elimination.

47
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,952
Honestly, I don't feel great.

48
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,620
I'm sure I'll be fine after today,

49
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,664
but I really tried my best,

50
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,834
so that is what's a little disappointing.

51
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,044
It is what it is.

52
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,339
In any case, even for a single bite,

53
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,218
I tried to serve something healthy.
I didn't use any additives either.

54
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,100
I just want to go home,

55
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,728
have a glass of soju, and go to bed.

56
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,021
KIM DO-YUN

57
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:13,860
It's so hard to make an impression
on people with just a single dish.

58
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:18,281
-Culinary Class Wars is brutal.
-Seriously.

59
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,451
What did that chef make?
It looks like Korean food.

60
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,788
Isn't that some kind of braised fish?

61
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,124
I think they do Korean cuisine.

62
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,293
That looks like classic Korean food.

63
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,337
-That's a Korean cuisine chef too?
-Yes.

64
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,631
That looks like Korean cuisine too.

65
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,051
-Korean food is popular this season.
-Yes, there's a lot.

66
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,387
Korean food is all too familiar
to Korean people.

67
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,767
It's the most commonly consumed
and most accessible food, but…

68
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,062
It's predictable.

69
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,815
It won't be easy
unless it tastes really good.

70
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,610
-Braised butterfish?
-Yes.

71
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,821
HIT-THE-SPOT POCHA
CEO OF EUNJIN POCHA

72
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,790
-Which one should I taste?
-You can try whatever you want.

73
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,837
PAJEON QUEEN
CEO OF OEAM PAJEON SANGJEON

74
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,882
It's lacking a little bit
in crispiness though.

75
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,510
I'm sorry to say
it's not particularly special.

76
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:24,013
I can't really see
what sets it apart from others.

77
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,390
You're eliminated.

78
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,933
I'm afraid you're eliminated.

79
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,436
It's a typical meal you find
at diners for taxi drivers.

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,562
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK MEAL

81
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,110
KISA FROM NEW YORK
HEAD CHEF OF KISA

82
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,445
It's too ordinary for us.

83
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,656
-What?
-It's too ordinary.

84
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,286
TTEOKBOKKI MASTER
FIRST OWNER OF TTEOKSAN

85
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,997
The artificial savoriness
was a bit too strong for me.

86
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,832
I'm afraid you're eliminated.

87
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,750
-You're eliminated.
-Okay.

88
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,252
You're eliminated.

89
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,628
You're eliminated.

90
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,754
You're eliminated.

91
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,589
There are less survivors than I thought.

92
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,759
-It's harder to do Korean cuisine well.
-It's true.

93
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,303
Korean food seems easy,
but it's not.

94
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,513
We have certain expectations.

95
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,434
To survive, I think there has to be
something really special to move them.

96
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,394
I wonder what the trick is.

97
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,771
It's a very ordinary dish,

98
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,898
but I made it my way.

99
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,401
I'm going to make my food the way I want.

100
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,069
It's the dish I make best.

101
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,656
Yes, it's the dish I make best,
dweji-gomtang.

102
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,117
Dweji-Gomtang in NY. He's famous.

103
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,787
-The gentleman with the shaved head?
-He has a restaurant in New York.

104
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,790
He was in The New York Times.
He's very well-known.

105
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,466
Do they really like
dweji-gomtang in New York?

106
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,135
In New York, we're fully booked,

107
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,846
so people go on the waitlist
in case a spot opens up.

108
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,639
That waitlist had 1,000 people.

109
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,600
I'd never seen a number that high.

110
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,520
There aren't many restaurants in New York
that serve only one dish.

111
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,646
Right.

112
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,565
What he's done is really impressive.

113
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,903
She's really famous as well.

114
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:09,827
What's that?

115
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,497
-She's pounding something.
-Yeah.

116
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,251
She does Seoul-style food
at a place called Superpan.

117
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,921
I've heard a ton about Superpan.

118
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,925
She does Korean food
in a really elegant way.

119
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,345
Isn't she a cooking teacher
for celebrities?

120
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,097
-That's right.
-Especially around Gangnam.

121
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,348
SEOUL MOTHER

122
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:34,268
For over 20 years, I was pretty well-known
as a cooking teacher

123
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,145
for prestigious families.

124
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,357
Then, I was lucky enough to write a book.

125
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,526
-I remember she published a book.
-Yes, she did.

126
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,736
-A long time ago.
-She's very cool.

127
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,279
So many impressive people are here.

128
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,492
-Let's go, Korean cuisine.
-Let's go, Korean cuisine.

129
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,080
Chef Ok is going to make gomtang, right?

130
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,082
-I think so.
-Yes.

131
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,973
I purely use pork meat.

132
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,101
I use only the shoulder and leg cuts

133
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,061
to make a clear broth.

134
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,817
After I boil the pork,
I use that as broth.

135
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,907
When the weight starts rattling,
I turn off the heat and let it rest.

136
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,328
Then, the broth will become richer.

137
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,877
He's really good at bringing out
that rich, savory flavor.

138
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,128
He doesn't use chicken,

139
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,213
but he brings that flavor out
with just pork.

140
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,883
"You can get
this kind of flavor from pork?"

141
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,177
That's the biggest advantage I have.

142
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,390
It's ready.

143
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,894
I take out the meat…

144
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,356
and remove the vegetables from the broth.

145
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,319
Gosh, that broth is…

146
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,821
It's a clear broth.

147
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,073
The clear broth is what makes it distinct.

148
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,660
I bet the broth will taste outstanding.
That rich flavor…

149
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,206
I put perfectly cooked rice
into a brass soup bowl.

150
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,000
And then, I top it
with thinly sliced pork.

151
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,764
DWEJI-GOMTANG

152
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,812
Wow, what is she making?

153
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,818
It's a very neatly prepared meal
that you serve

154
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,613
when you have guests
or on a day of celebration.

155
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,740
It's "A Meal of Seoul Specialties."

156
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,119
With the neobiani,
the key is to pound it thoroughly.

157
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,831
It makes it really tender.

158
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,001
I mix in a lot of Korean pear juice…

159
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,214
so you have to grill it
just right in the pan.

160
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,800
That looks delicious.

161
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,345
I cook rice with oats mixed in
until it's perfect.

162
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,056
Then, I make beef brisket and radish soup.

163
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,395
The ingredients
aren't overly fancy though.

164
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,774
They're very simple.

165
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,780
It has a graceful taste, like the kind
that reminds you of your mother's cooking.

166
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,491
NEOBIANI

167
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,159
BEEF BRISKET AND RADISH SOUP

168
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,370
COLD SPRING VEGETABLE SALAD

169
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,082
A MEAL OF SEOUL SPECIALTIES

170
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,251
She made a traditional Korean meal.

171
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,961
-With rice and side dishes.
-Five total.

172
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,213
This is a traditional Seoul meal.

173
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,216
-This is what Seoul folks ate?
-Yes, but fancier.

174
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,470
On birthdays or when you have guests,
this is what you would serve.

175
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,765
I wish we could go down and taste it too.

176
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,309
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you.

177
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,393
Please eat them together.

178
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,686
Wow, these spring vegetables…

179
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,563
I'm really excited to try them.

180
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,158
She's such a talented chef, so…

181
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,926
He ate slowly.

182
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,721
He tasted everything very carefully.

183
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,350
I'm not sure if the rice came out well.

184
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,604
-This makes me nervous too.
-It's scary.

185
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,898
She's a cooking teacher to celebrities.

186
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,572
After eating this…

187
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,453
I think I've lost my accent.

188
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,413
I'm a Seoulite now.

189
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,541
-You've survived.
-Thank you.

190
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,880
These dishes work so well together.

191
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,052
-I feel like a Seoulite right now.
-Thank you.

192
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,388
This is despite
being from the Chungcheong region.

193
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,972
Thank you.

194
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,226
Seoul Mother has survived.

195
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,981
-She survived.
-She made it.

196
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,655
Strictly speaking, Seoul cuisine
originated from Korean royal cuisine.

197
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,366
It's simple, delicate, and clean.

198
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,076
She captured that perfectly.

199
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,876
SEOUL MOTHER

200
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,380
Please explain your dish.

201
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,843
I used Berkshire pork shoulder
to make dweji-gomtang with a clear broth.

202
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,303
I recommend tasting the broth first.

203
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,263
-Should I?
-Yes.

204
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,230
When you taste the clear broth,
it'll be very rich and savory.

205
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,481
That's the pork flavor.

206
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,543
The broth on its own

207
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,797
-and broth with the rice taste different.
-Yes.

208
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,055
-Dweji-Gomtang in NY.
-Yes?

209
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,976
-You've survived.
-Thank you.

210
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,440
Dweji-Gomtang in NY has survived.

211
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,738
When I heard people were lining up
for a rice and soup place in New York,

212
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,448
I thought it was due to sheer luck.

213
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,743
-But it wasn't luck.
-Thank you.

214
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,744
It's delicious.

215
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,914
It had that savoriness of a broth
simmered with only meat.

216
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,707
It wasn't greasy. It was delicate.

217
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,504
I understood why people around the world
were going crazy for dweji-gomtang.

218
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,551
Dweji-Gomtang in NY has survived.

219
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,722
I think four have survived now.

220
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,766
-Is it three?
-Yes.

221
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,645
Oh, no. I'm all done though.

222
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,606
Damn, why isn't he coming?

223
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,194
I'd like Mr. Paik Jong-won to be my judge.

224
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:45,366
Chef Anh and I have always been

225
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,619
at opposite ends.

226
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,164
So I didn't want to face him
in the first round.

227
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,339
"Three Star Killer."

228
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,093
Please explain your dish.

229
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,928
Well, I better just go home.

230
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,222
80 MINUTES EARLIER

231
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,767
Hello.

232
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,229
He's very famous for being a great cook.

233
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,982
What does "Three Star Killer" mean?

234
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,569
Three Star Killer?
Why did he pick that name?

235
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,070
Why is it Three Star Killer?

236
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,197
He worked at Monsieur Benjamin.

237
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,285
I used to run a French bistro

238
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,997
called Monsieur Benjamin
with Michelin three-star chef, Corey Lee.

239
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,916
He was also at Per Se for a long time.

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,586
I worked about six years at Per Se,

241
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,422
Chef Thomas Keller's
Michelin three-star restaurant.

242
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,384
I've also worked
with Chef Anh Sung-jae before.

243
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,136
Over the last decade,

244
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,681
I've only worked with chefs
who have received three Michelin stars.

245
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,725
He has a lot of experience.

246
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,394
-He's really good.
-He's so good.

247
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,733
But why is he a "killer"?

248
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,611
Maybe he wants to take down
all the three-star chefs.

249
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,696
But Chef Anh is
the only three-star chef here.

250
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,448
He's here for the kill.

251
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,867
He came to take Anh Sung-jae down.

252
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,286
I'm Three Star Killer.

253
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,831
I've worked with a lot
of outstanding individuals,

254
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:20,794
but the only person I had difficulty
catering to was perhaps Chef Anh Sung-jae.

255
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,549
When I had doubts about something,
he would say it was spot on.

256
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,261
When I'd think something was perfect,
he would hate it.

257
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,933
We always tended to have
the complete opposite opinions.

258
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,310
Still, I have to win.

259
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,565
Okay, let's see what he'll make.

260
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,822
-That looks like cuttlefish.
-Isn't that cuttlefish?

261
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,117
He'll wash it next, right? Oh, he's not.

262
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,620
I thought about what I wanted to make.

263
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,292
I'm going to make squid ink risotto
in my own unique way.

264
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,633
It's the sauce
that forms the base of the risotto.

265
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,218
It's the broth and sauce.

266
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,723
-He's reducing it all the way down.
-Yeah, he is.

267
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,934
It looks like he's making it really thick.

268
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,814
I start cooking the risotto.

269
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,735
Then, I make it into a squid ink risotto.

270
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,155
It looks delicious.

271
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,706
Next, I wanted to add
some crispiness to the dish.

272
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,333
-Fried squid.
-The fried squid is…

273
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,668
He deep-fried it.

274
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,714
I garnished it with deep-fried squid.

275
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:53,721
But I thought it would become soggy
when placed on top of the risotto.

276
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,227
So I thought of using Parmesan cheese

277
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,939
to make a lacy crisp

278
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,442
to place over the plate.

279
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,486
I place the crisp over the risotto.

280
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,740
Then, I put the deep-fried squid
on top of that.

281
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,534
That way, they won't get soggy
in the risotto.

282
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,412
-It's a good tactic.
-Really?

283
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,706
To prevent them from getting soggy,

284
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,417
he created something of his own.

285
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,048
I've always strived
to find my own unique style.

286
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,175
I just have to go for it.

287
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,972
SQUID INK RISOTTO

288
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,106
Please explain your dish.

289
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,569
Sure. So I used cuttlefish
to create this dish.

290
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,988
To match the concept
of Black and White Spoons,

291
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,698
I focused on these two colors.

292
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,533
I made a cheese foam,

293
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,285
which is white.

294
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,372
And the squid ink represents the black.

295
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:06,126
I also deep-fried some squid
and made a tuile,

296
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,462
so the crispiness is retained

297
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,507
until the diner breaks the tuile
into the risotto.

298
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,968
-I wonder if it's good.
-I'm sure it is.

299
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,889
Please try it with the deep-fried squid.

300
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,140
-Like this?
-Yes.

301
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,088
The risotto…

302
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,220
Compared to the risotto I've tasted
in high-end restaurants in the US,

303
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,598
this has that kind of taste.

304
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,518
It's very well made. The risotto itself.

305
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,814
"He's really complimenting me?"

306
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,733
-What's going on?
-How the rice is cooked

307
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,778
and the way you used
the Parmesan and such.

308
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,321
They come together very well.

309
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,408
But the overall composition of the dish,

310
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,369
where you added something crispy
to give it more texture,

311
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,913
does feel like you were overthinking it.

312
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,292
You made something
that's been perfectly executed.

313
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:33,130
So honestly, I don't really understand
why you added this.

314
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,340
I think you went a bit overboard.

315
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,760
You added too much.
You were too absorbed in your idea.

316
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,762
-Three Star Killer.
-Yes?

317
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,849
-I'm deferring my decision.
-All right.

318
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,687
If you already have a well-made risotto
and cheese sauce,

319
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:54,193
the wafer and squid on top
and things like that

320
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,653
are not necessary.

321
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,823
It's such a well-made risotto,
but he added those things.

322
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,867
I saw that he overcomplicated things.

323
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,995
In that regard, I'll need a second opinion

324
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,413
and we'll have to discuss things.

325
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,958
-Sometimes, less is more.
-Yes, Chef.

326
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,252
Great work.

327
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,466
In that case, he should've deferred me
without the praise.

328
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,969
Why give all that praise only to defer me?
It was a bit…

329
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,472
-Do I eat these together?
-Yes, if you…

330
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,640
-Do I break it?
-Yes.

331
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,308
-Like this?
-Yes.

332
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,948
Thank you.

333
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,532
Great job.

334
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,537
I still had a chance at surviving.

335
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,457
So I was still holding on
to a thread of hope.

336
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,793
IF THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SURVIVORS
BY THE END OF TASTING

337
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,836
SURVIVORS WILL BE CHOSEN
FROM DEFERRED CHEFS

338
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,463
I think it's really close.

339
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,465
It's whether you have
something special or not.

340
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,635
Expectations are higher
for people like him.

341
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,973
Is there anyone you know here, Hee-eun?

342
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,977
The woman at the very front
wearing the brown apron over there.

343
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,109
She was my student.

344
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,571
-She was your student?
-Yes, the one in the brown apron.

345
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,325
-She's quick.
-She's very good with her hands.

346
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,415
She's very polite too.

347
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,750
What's her title?

348
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,590
What's your title? I can't see.

349
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,175
Little Tiger.

350
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,885
-Little?
-Tiger.

351
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,387
LITTLE TIGER
CHEF AT SOLBAM

352
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,555
It's perfect for you.

353
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,141
LITTLE TIGER

354
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,146
People said that despite not being
known to the world yet,

355
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:59,943
I was a chef
with the sharpness of a tiger,

356
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,862
so I chose the title "Little Tiger."

357
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,742
-What is she making right now?
-I'm not sure.

358
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,870
I think she's cooking Korean food.

359
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,999
-I see a lot of namul.
-I see. Seasoned vegetables.

360
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,546
As someone who loves namul…

361
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:27,512
I gave a lot of thought as to how I could
most effectively present these vegetables.

362
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,182
What's your dish?

363
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,809
I'm preparing a table of alcohol
and namul side dishes.

364
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,102
-Alcohol and sides?
-Yes.

365
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,479
-With namul?
-Yes.

366
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,772
Will you be okay without meat?

367
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,191
-You're pairing namul with alcohol?
-Yes.

368
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,235
My dish is called "Bakju Sanchae."

369
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,363
It's a phrase that captures
the Korean attitude of,

370
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,742
"It's not much, but I hope you enjoy."

371
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,453
I want the namul to be the main dish.

372
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,206
Not just a side dish, but the star.

373
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,959
That's the kind of spread
I wanted to serve.

374
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,381
I think she's prepared a juansang,
a table of drinks and small dishes.

375
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,967
But it overlaps with his theme.

376
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,260
-Him?
-Yes.

377
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,720
LONER IN A HOLE-IN-THE-WALL

378
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,181
I think it's a juansang.

379
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,143
I prepared my dishes
around the theme of juansang.

380
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,395
An alcoholic drink that's enjoyed

381
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,773
with traditional Korean food.

382
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,735
LONER IN A HOLE-IN-THE-WALL

383
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,571
"Loner in a Hole-in-the-wall?"
What an interesting name.

384
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,992
Hello. I'm…

385
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,162
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

386
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,292
Hello. I'm Loner in a Hole-in-the-wall.

387
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,630
I run a Korean bar in Seochon
called Dokdo 16 Celsius.

388
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,884
I started out in this tiny space
in Cheongun-dong.

389
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,511
It's been about four years.

390
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,388
During that time,

391
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,558
I've spent most of my time alone,
like a loner.

392
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,477
So, I chose the title
"Loner in a Hole-in-the-wall."

393
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,897
There were so many famous chefs.

394
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,651
It was a gathering of exceptional people.

395
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,946
I think I've been to your restaurant.

396
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,948
-Really?
-Yes, I think I saw you.

397
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,450
-I took a full lap.
-Really?

398
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,453
Why are you being a loner,
Loner in a Hole-in-the-wall?

399
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,164
-Talk with us.
-Right.

400
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,082
-Don't be nervous.
-Okay.

401
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,834
What do I do?

402
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,961
Will they like my cooking?

403
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,631
I don't make any fancy
or complicated dishes.

404
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,051
I personally think
I make plain, ordinary food.

405
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,430
First, Korean beef tteokgalbi.

406
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,309
After mincing beef from a female cow…

407
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,901
I mix it with tteokgalbi marinade.

408
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,613
I portion it out.

409
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,574
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten…

410
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,204
Then, I grill them over charcoal.

411
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,209
I also smoke them with applewood.

412
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,050
The second dish is mackerel bibimbap.

413
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,597
Mackerel is very popular in Korea,

414
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,850
and this bibimbap makes it
comfortable and easy to enjoy.

415
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,356
It has a light yet savory flavor.

416
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,817
Did he make rice too?

417
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,861
Over here…

418
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,655
Does she have rice?

419
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,240
No, there's no rice.

420
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,533
I'm sure she'll make some.

421
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,703
"Will it be okay without rice?"

422
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,622
I did think about that a lot.

423
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,125
But I thought,
"I can enjoy a drink with namul,"

424
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,585
and decided to press ahead.

425
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:52,801
I guess you could say
it was a daring or reckless move.

426
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:58,139
But I want to convince them
that you can enjoy some alcohol

427
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,476
with just namul and no rice.

428
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,311
It might not be special,

429
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,022
but I want to stay true
to what I've been doing.

430
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,150
And I want to confirm
whether the flavors I create

431
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,443
are indeed right or not.

432
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,779
LITTLE TIGER

433
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,702
This should be interesting.

434
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,039
-Loner in a Hole-in-the-wall.
-Hello. Yes.

435
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,582
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

436
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,003
This is what I call
"The Modern Korean Juansang."

437
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,921
-A modern juansang?
-Yes, that's right.

438
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,381
Food paired with alcohol.

439
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,591
The dishes are so neat and pretty.

440
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,551
MACKEREL BIBIMBAP

441
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,554
I was wondering why you randomly had
truffles on the tteokgalbi.

442
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,764
-Is it to match the acorn soy sauce?
-Yes.

443
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,809
-Do I just eat it? Or is there a dip?
-You can just eat it like that.

444
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,243
-And then?
-This is a bibimbap made with mackerel.

445
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,122
-Mackerel is a very popular fish in Korea…
-But it has a fishy smell.

446
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,624
-Mackerel is known for…
-Yes.

447
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,168
-its strong fishy smell.
-Yes.

448
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,294
And it has a lot of bones.

449
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,589
Personally, I think fresh mackerel
doesn't have that fishy smell.

450
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,507
And that's true in practice too, so…

451
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,533
It keeps making me circle back.

452
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,789
-Loner in a Hole-in-the-wall.
-Yes?

453
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,716
There's no fishy smell. No bones, either.

454
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,718
-It's very nice.
-Right.

455
00:27:58,802 --> 00:27:59,803
You've survived.

456
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,514
Thank you!

457
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:15,985
You made it!

458
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,030
Congratulations!

459
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,034
Thank you.

460
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,620
Loner in a Hole-in-the-wall had survived.

461
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,007
Of course, you'd cry.

462
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,843
-He worked so hard on his own.
-Exactly.

463
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,430
-I'm starting to tear up.
-I heard he runs his restaurant alone.

464
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,142
I've always managed everything by myself.

465
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,644
It was all worth it in the end.

466
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,022
I'm just so grateful.

467
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,401
That's all.

468
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,113
-Hello.
-Hello.

469
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,199
-Are you done?
-Yes.

470
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,285
-It's a table of alcohol.
-Yes.

471
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,454
-It is, isn't it?
-Yes, you're right.

472
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,122
COW PARSLEY
SALT SANDSPURRY

473
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,290
COASTAL HOG FENNEL

474
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,333
DAYLILY

475
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,543
MUGWORT

476
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,295
SHEPHERD'S PURSE

477
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,256
I prepared a selection of namul
in a dish I call "Bakju Sanchae."

478
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,049
-Bakju Sanchae?
-Bakju Sanchae.

479
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,637
She's prepared a juansang too.
They're both dishes that go with alcohol.

480
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,181
There's no meat.

481
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,266
No, not a single piece.

482
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,684
Which one should I try first?

483
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,978
I recommend tasting the tofu first.

484
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,314
I tossed mugwort with tofu.

485
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,524
MUGWORT AND TOFU SALAD

486
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,748
-This one next?
-Yes.

487
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,166
-Shepherd's purse and squid?
-Yes.

488
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,376
When I cooked the shepherd's purse,

489
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,087
I picked up a flavor similar to squid.

490
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,174
So I mixed the two together
with hapjajang, mussel soy sauce.

491
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,030
And then?

492
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,491
Next is the coastal hog fennel
and blue crab.

493
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:30,829
I tossed tender coastal hog fennel
from Tongyeong with blue crab roe.

494
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,221
-He's probably tired.
-Right, a little…

495
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,098
So, this could be refreshing and nice.

496
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,081
I guess you can have a drink with namul.

497
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,542
-Thank you.
-Little Tiger.

498
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,086
You've survived.

499
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,630
Thank you.

500
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,722
Well done! Kim Little Tiger!

501
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,479
You're good.

502
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,065
-Little Tiger has survived.
-Congratulations.

503
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,527
-Thank you.
-It was delicious.

504
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,114
Seasoning each namul right
is really hard to do.

505
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,657
They weren't side dishes for rice.

506
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,660
They were just salty enough
to complement the alcohol.

507
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,245
She's very talented.

508
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,372
She knew what she was doing.

509
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:58,917
Thank you.

510
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,377
It felt like

511
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:05,965
I was acknowledged for being good
at cooking the type of food I love.

512
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,010
I was grateful more than anything.

513
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,473
Good luck, French Papa!

514
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:14,933
You got this!

515
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,267
FRENCH PAPA

516
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,102
French Papa. Hello.

517
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,855
I'm getting really nervous
with you guys watching me.

518
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,273
Don't be nervous.

519
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,775
We're all rooting for you.

520
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,109
You can do it.

521
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,653
-Good luck.
-You'll do well.

522
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,908
All the chefs are rooting for him.

523
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,409
He's a really nice person.

524
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,495
-Yes, he's really kind.
-He's an angel.

525
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,624
Hello. Nice to meet you.

526
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,168
Let's do our best.
Hey, I guess we're neighbors.

527
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,962
Good luck.

528
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,254
Best of luck.

529
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:49,509
He always looks out for people.
When I think of him, I'm grateful.

530
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,969
-I see.
-Yes.

531
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,972
The chef I'm rooting for the most
is French Papa.

532
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,432
I'm praying he survives.

533
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,602
He's someone
who is very sincere about cooking.

534
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:03,189
His French restaurant in Cheongdam-dong
has been there longer than any other.

535
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,775
He's the best
in terms of classic French cuisine.

536
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,862
He's the very foundation.
The pillar of French cuisine in Korea.

537
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,907
I really hope he goes far
in this competition.

538
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,705
He has monkfish,

539
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,123
lobsters,

540
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,917
and clams.

541
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,502
-Bouillabaisse?
-Bouillabaisse.

542
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,879
His signature dish.

543
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,718
It's essentially a French seafood stew.

544
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,223
The word "bouillabaisse"
means "to boil and simmer."

545
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,227
If you let it slowly simmer,

546
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,688
the broth develops
a subtle yet rich flavor.

547
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:48,484
I think the greatest thing food gives us
is comfort and warmth.

548
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,361
That's especially true of soups and stews.

549
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,489
I want my dish
to bring warmth and comfort.

550
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:00,872
-That's a textbook bouillabaisse.
-Definitely.

551
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,710
Forty-six minutes? Wow. Time is short.

552
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,881
Forty-one minutes.

553
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,050
Forty-one minutes is okay.

554
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,301
Thirty-eight minutes.

555
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,927
Twenty-eight minutes.

556
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,931
-He seems really nervous.
-Of course, he is.

557
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,185
He hasn't been
continuously active in the industry.

558
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,438
I wanted to challenge myself.

559
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,315
I wanted to give it a shot.

560
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,277
I took a momentary break from my cooking,

561
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,696
and left my restaurant

562
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,241
to go abroad with my kid
for his treatment.

563
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,536
He has a developmental disability,

564
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,373
so when I was with my family
for his treatment,

565
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,959
I think that was a turning point
in my life.

566
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,882
He staked his life on that.

567
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,427
It breaks my heart.

568
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,682
Whenever I cook for my son,

569
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:06,020
I feel nervous and also happy.

570
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,524
I'm going to prepare today's dish
with that same mindset.

571
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,487
Let's taste it one last time.

572
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,325
It's done. No regrets.

573
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,622
-Tommie!
-Really? We have to go see.

574
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,457
-Oh, my god.
-I have to see this.

575
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,839
-Are you ready?
-Yes, I'm ready.

576
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,014
Bouillabaisse is a traditional dish
from the Marseille region.

577
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,642
And I prepared my own version of the dish.

578
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,104
I think cooking comes from the heart.

579
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,982
I hope you find warmth in my cooking.

580
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,235
Right.

581
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,630
It's hot.

582
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:16,966
You should've told me.

583
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,342
-I wanted to…
-That's hot.

584
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,677
serve you warm food.

585
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,095
-Thank you.
-Sure.

586
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,265
-In France, they eat this lukewarm.
-That's right.

587
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,976
But in Korea, if it's not hot,

588
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,687
people pick up on the fishy smell
quite acutely.

589
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,063
Did you read my mind?

590
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,107
The first time trying this
can be a real shock.

591
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,817
The temperature must be spot on.

592
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,820
I really hope he survives.

593
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,293
I hope he survives.

594
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,884
Marseille.

595
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,469
Marseille.

596
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,680
I can't watch.

597
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,432
You have to.

598
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,894
You've survived.

599
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,563
Yes!

600
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,940
Thank you.

601
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,283
-That was incredible!
-Thank you so much.

602
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:26,994
Marseille.

603
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,914
French Papa has survived.

604
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,210
-Great job!
-Thank you.

605
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,461
I'll see you all later.

606
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:37,880
All right.

607
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,304
When I was cooking down there,
I desperately wanted to do well.

608
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,848
When I was leaving,
I thought a lot about my son.

609
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,398
There's something…

610
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,404
I want to show my son as a chef.

611
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,072
So I was really…

612
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,907
I don't mind if I'm eliminated.

613
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,784
Just being here
is a huge challenge for me.

614
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,246
But the fact that
I can show this to my son,

615
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,831
thinking about that made me so happy.

616
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,085
My son loves to cook.

617
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,921
Even though he's 12, he can't talk yet.

618
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,424
He can't express himself well.

619
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,177
But I think he'll be excited
his papa is on TV.

620
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,056
I'm so happy.

621
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,768
Do you know anyone here?

622
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,729
Over there at the end.

623
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,941
That guy is a real culinary genius.

624
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,944
He even picked the title
"Culinary Monster."

625
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,406
But in the industry,
people call him a culinary genius.

626
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,908
He's well-known for his talent.

627
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,494
I heard Culinary Monster is really good.

628
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,955
Among everyone here
doing Western cuisine,

629
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,457
-he's probably the best.
-The best?

630
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,833
-Yes.
-Of Western cuisine?

631
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,877
I heard he's an exceptional cook.

632
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,047
Me too. I've heard so much.
It made me curious, so I came to watch.

633
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:06,302
Over here, Culinary Monster
is really famous in New York.

634
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,511
-Right here?
-Yes.

635
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,138
He has an impressive résumé.

636
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:14,810
Experience doesn't equal skill,
but you also can't overlook experience.

637
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:19,648
I'm sure the experience I've had
is more diverse than anyone else's.

638
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,152
There's a restaurant in Denmark
called Geranium.

639
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:27,198
Around three years ago, it was named
the best restaurant in the world.

640
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:32,119
I was the first Asian chef
to be hired there as a permanent employee.

641
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,915
After that, I went to a restaurant
called Atomix.

642
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,709
I was part of the opening team
as the head chef,

643
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,961
and we earned two Michelin stars.

644
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,963
-It's called The French Laundry.
-Okay.

645
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,174
It's pretty much at the top in the US.

646
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,675
-Top of the top.
-Really?

647
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,636
-He was the sous chef.
-A former head chef?

648
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,305
-For a Korean to make it to sous chef…
-True.

649
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,682
He's one of the chefs I don't want to face

650
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,267
-in the next round.
-He's that good?

651
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,853
-He's the main one to watch out for.
-So he's that skilled.

652
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,814
I came to win it all.

653
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,859
I've only worked
at the best restaurants in the world.

654
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,946
I believe I have an honor to defend.

655
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,120
It's chicken feet.

656
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,248
Maybe he'll use them make a broth.

657
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,211
I guess he'll make something
with button mushrooms.

658
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,798
He added mushrooms.

659
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,218
He's probably trying to make
mushroom stock quickly.

660
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,095
That's a great idea.

661
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,722
Because he has limited burners.

662
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,855
I have a way of approaching ingredients
and the relevant cooking techniques.

663
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,233
If there's anything I can utilize,

664
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,277
I try to put them to use.

665
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,658
He's made a lot of stock
using chicken feet,

666
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,995
but I don't know what it's for.

667
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,623
It looks like he needs soup.

668
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,177
He's blending some ingredients together.

669
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,222
That's some serious stock.

670
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,142
I think he'll use that
to boil something in it.

671
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,227
But I don't see a main dish.

672
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,192
I have no idea what he's making.

673
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,360
There's a lot going on though.

674
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,365
I can't wait to see what it is.

675
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,202
-Culinary Monster.
-Hello.

676
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,787
Did you make a monster of a dish?

677
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,122
Please explain your dish.

678
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,374
Today,

679
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,793
I've prepared a porridge.

680
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:49,298
I used spring vegetables,
which are wild chives and chamnamul,

681
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,175
and finished it
with black truffle shavings.

682
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,969
SPRING VEGETABLE PORRIDGE WITH TRUFFLES

683
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,137
He said it's porridge.

684
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,138
What?

685
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,306
Porridge?

686
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,975
It's nothing like the porridge we know.

687
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,773
I prepared a porridge
that I could make in my own style.

688
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,526
After blanching wild chives,
chamnamul, and spinach,

689
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,111
I squeeze the water out.

690
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,951
I strain the chicken broth…

691
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,166
and blend everything together
to prepare béchamel sauce.

692
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,630
It's a smooth and creamy sauce
used in Western cuisine.

693
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,552
I use that broth to cook the rice.

694
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,890
I made a really rich chicken broth

695
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,476
and added butter and cream to that.

696
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,479
It's very rich and heavy,

697
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,940
so I scooped only three spoonfuls
into the bowl.

698
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,944
I finished by shaving
black truffles on top.

699
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,281
I thought if I made the effort,
it seemed doable.

700
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,366
I'd say my confidence is justified.

701
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,411
I've tasted all kinds of porridge,

702
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:47,458
but this is the first time I've had one
that gives me a new experience.

703
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,004
There's a bit of a crunch,

704
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:55,257
the aroma of truffles,
and notes of the spring vegetables too.

705
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,760
If you had given me any more than this,

706
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,638
I would've said something bad.

707
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,931
You knew the amount that should be tasted

708
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,185
and the level of seasoning
needed for that set amount.

709
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,686
-Things like that.
-Right.

710
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,399
And by drawing from your own experiences,
you're striving to create something new.

711
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,402
-I could see that effort here.
-Thank you.

712
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,489
Culinary Monster.

713
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,576
You've survived.

714
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,078
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

715
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,871
-Thank you.
-It was delicious.

716
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,416
Culinary Monster has survived.

717
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:34,588
When I mixed them together and tasted it,
the porridge and the spring vegetables

718
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,132
blended together perfectly.

719
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,301
I've never tasted anything like it.

720
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,929
I think he intended to create a porridge

721
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,890
that you can look at
from a completely different perspective.

722
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,517
"A new kind of chef has arrived."

723
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,937
I thought, "A rising star
of the new generation is here."

724
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:54,274
A very formidable opponent has advanced.

725
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,111
Oh, no.

726
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,447
-There's certainly a lot of talent here.
-Yes.

727
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,699
-Even how they move is different.
-Yes.

728
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,992
Aren't you worried?

729
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,203
I am worried.

730
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,289
We shouldn't have watched.

731
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,208
-Seeing them has me worried.
-Indeed.

732
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,377
They're all very skilled.

733
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,549
Chinese cuisine really is fiery.

734
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,970
All the pros are here.

735
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,639
HOU DEOK-JUK
57-YEAR MASTER OF CHINESE CUISINE

736
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:30,310
They had enough skills
to rival the White Spoon chefs.

737
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:34,565
It's also a great opportunity
to learn from the younger chefs.

738
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,983
This looks like Chinese cuisine.

739
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,192
-It is.
-Yes.

740
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,278
She's a really talented cook too.

741
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,488
She's on the same level
as Jung Ji-sun in a way.

742
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,490
The only difference is media coverage.

743
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,703
I work magic in a wok.

744
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,580
I'm Witch with a Wok.

745
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,250
I've been working for 25 years
as a chef at a hotel.

746
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,585
As a witch,

747
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,463
be it the Queen
or the Goddess of Chinese Cuisine,

748
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,465
I came here ready to take them all down.

749
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,265
She's very efficient using two knives.

750
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,434
By the look of her hands,
she's an expert.

751
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,607
Look at how she's cut the meat.

752
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,859
-This person?
-Over there.

753
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,152
The motorcycle chef…

754
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,239
Isn't that pork?

755
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,117
But she put something red in it.

756
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,370
She's really famous too.

757
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,332
-The motorbike.
-The chef who rides the motorbike.

758
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,792
-It's her?
-She's not someone

759
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,836
who should be down there
as a Black Spoon.

760
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,047
WOK RIDER

761
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,590
I'm a Chinese cuisine chef.

762
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,134
While riding a Harley-Davidson,

763
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,513
I filmed four seasons
of a documentary program

764
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,181
called "Food Diary."

765
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,518
I heard they were making
Culinary Class Wars Season 2,

766
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,854
and I thought, "This is what
I'll stake my life on this year."

767
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,898
I'm going full throttle
with Chinese cuisine.

768
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,655
You can do it, Chef!

769
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:05,989
Be careful!

770
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,164
The dish I prepared today
is a pork belly dish.

771
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,874
I boil it,

772
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,668
fry it with oil,

773
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,295
freeze it,

774
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,923
and then I slice it very thinly.

775
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,686
Her knife isn't going down all the way.

776
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,729
-Yes, it catches.
-The chopsticks are there.

777
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,023
-She turns it.
-She keeps turning it.

778
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,994
Look at that. She cut the meat like that.

779
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,454
She cut a whole piece like that?

780
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,123
I think she's happy with it.

781
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,249
She likes it.

782
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,464
It'll tear! Don't do that!

783
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,473
Culinary Class Wars
deserves a dish of this level.

784
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,355
I'm going to turn everything
about Chinese cuisine upside down.

785
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,526
The dish I've prepared is Quan Jia Fu.

786
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,778
As it wishes happiness
for the whole family,

787
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:30,699
it's a special dish
made with the finest delicacies.

788
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,492
-The Korean style…
-Yes.

789
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,911
-and the Chinese style are different.
-Yes.

790
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,914
-Which are you doing?
-Both Chinese and Korean styles.

791
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,374
I'm combining the two.

792
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,877
You're mixing Chinese-style
and Korean-style Quan Jia Fu?

793
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,338
-Yes, it's my take on it.
-Will they mix well?

794
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,465
The dish came to Korea
and was reinterpreted

795
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,507
as a stir-fried dish.

796
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,010
THERE IS NO SET STYLE
BUT IT IS USUALLY STIR-FRIED IN KOREA

797
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,803
Quan Jia Fu in China

798
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,222
can be a hot pot dish.

799
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,433
They add something called egg dumplings.

800
00:48:56,516 --> 00:49:00,937
I reimagined these two dishes
and created my own version.

801
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,691
First, I use
the stir-frying method of Korea

802
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,943
to cook the ingredients
with a smoky flavor.

803
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,613
Then, I make stuffed pouches with eggs,

804
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,740
like the Chinese egg dumplings.

805
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,701
I cook a thin sheet of egg

806
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,496
and turn it into a golden pouch.

807
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,748
She's filling it.

808
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:26,588
It looks like she'll fill that egg sheet
with the ingredients she stir-fried before

809
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,923
and form it into a pouch.

810
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,259
It must be her invention.

811
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,689
That's right. You need to tie it.

812
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,359
Time was running out.

813
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,153
The final step was to tie it closed
and submit my dish.

814
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,867
This is hard.

815
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,496
-Oh, no.
-It's come undone.

816
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,957
There's only four minutes left.

817
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,043
What should I do?

818
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,018
She's wrapping it up again.

819
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,396
She's making a tower.

820
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,691
Layer by layer, she's building a tower.

821
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,994
-It's pointy at the bottom.
-Yes.

822
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,329
-So you press down layer by layer.
-Okay.

823
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,875
It requires a lot of skill.

824
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:49,212
I fill the inside of the mold
with stir-fried siraegi.

825
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,631
After that, I steam it.

826
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,643
She made that really well.

827
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,188
That's impressive. She made a pyramid.

828
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:09,399
The cooking process
looks very complicated,

829
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,402
but that's how much care and effort
was put into it making

830
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,945
this steamed pork belly.

831
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,989
It's in the shape of a tower,

832
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,783
so it's called "Pagoda Pork."

833
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:23,246
PAGODA PORK

834
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,542
It's almost a shame to eat it.
How can we cut this?

835
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,586
-This used to be one whole piece, right?
-Yes.

836
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,964
-So you have no choice but to cut it?
-That's right.

837
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,455
How long was it steamed for?

838
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,582
For 20 minutes.

839
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,630
-It's so beautiful and intricate.
-Right.

840
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,092
But you probably sensed it too.
The pork belly…

841
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,135
-It needed more time.
-Yes.

842
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:22,055
-It should melt in your mouth.
-Right.

843
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,807
-But I had to chew it a lot.
-Right.

844
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,517
I'm sorry.

845
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,435
-You're eliminated.
-Okay.

846
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:28,979
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

847
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,522
-But still, it was really…
-Right.

848
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,566
You did great!

849
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,359
Thank you.

850
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:41,700
I didn't have enough time to steam it,
and that really bothered me.

851
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,328
But he picked up on that exact issue.

852
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:54,963
If only I'd done a bit better.
I'm so disappointed.

853
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:57,465
WOK RIDER

854
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,302
It's okay. Stay calm.

855
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:01,970
Be calm.

856
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,559
Focus on the dish.

857
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,894
Be calm.

858
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,979
Don't get greedy
and just do what you always do.

859
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,119
I breathed a sigh of relief
and thought, "I did it."

860
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,997
It's a Chinese dish called Quan Jia Fu,

861
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,625
which means
"happiness for the whole family."

862
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,418
I'll cut it for you.

863
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,256
So you break it up to eat it?

864
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,175
-Inside, there are vegetables…
-Seafood.

865
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,426
Stir-fried seafood.

866
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,136
There's sauce on the side.

867
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,722
-Crab meat and egg whites.
-I think after she opens it,

868
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,515
-she'll pour it in.
-Yeah, that's right.

869
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,768
Then, you pour in the crab meat sauce?

870
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,269
Yes, the crab meat sauce.

871
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,441
I intended for this sauce, the egg,

872
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,444
and the stir-fried ingredients
to come together as one.

873
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,454
She really did combine the two.

874
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,499
She made the dumpling bigger

875
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,793
and wrapped it
around the Korean-style Quan Jia Fu.

876
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,587
As I tasted it, I thought,
"Is this Quan Jia Fu?"

877
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:27,973
This is just Quan Jia Fu.

878
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,519
Just Quan Jia Fu.

879
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,647
Delicious Quan Jia Fu.

880
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,525
-Witch with a Wok.
-Yes?

881
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,068
-You've survived.
-Thank you!

882
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,862
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

883
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:43,989
Congratulations!

884
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,995
Witch with a Wok has survived.

885
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,080
The taste is Korean-style Quan Jia Fu,

886
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,915
but it's a dumpling,
so it's Chinese-style.

887
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,418
What is this? Chinese or Korean?
But it's all delicious.

888
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,504
It was a Quan Jia Fu
that satisfied both sides.

889
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,423
Since he's the best of the White Spoons,

890
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,425
I'd like to battle Chef Hou Deok-juk.

891
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:07,512
My goal is to go up against
the best of the best.

892
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,810
I'm someone who cooks with fire and wood.

893
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:24,404
BARBECUE LAB DIRECTOR
CEO OF IMOK SMOKE DINING

894
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:38,293
I doubt anyone here is better than me
at cooking meat with fire.

895
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,587
The director.

896
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,881
He's the king of barbecue. That's him.

897
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,215
-He's here?
-Yeah.

898
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,802
That's his specialty.

899
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,138
They sell out
and have to turn people away.

900
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,932
I heard he worked an office job before.

901
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,809
He's really impressive.

902
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,979
He's not someone who's always
done this professionally like we have.

903
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,899
-Right. He made a career change.
-Yes.

904
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:04,110
But he only started it
because it was his passion.

905
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,738
I used to be an office worker.

906
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,823
I worked at CJ CheilJedang.

907
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,325
When I cooked as a hobby,

908
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,869
my passion for it was immense at the time.

909
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,288
I'd come home after work
and put the kids to sleep.

910
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:18,083
Then, I'd keep testing
and trying techniques I studied.

911
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,628
I experimented a lot with barbecue
at my weekend farm.

912
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,006
I can't really call myself a chef.

913
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,009
I see myself as someone
who researches and studies,

914
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,886
so I took on the title of "lab director."

915
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,138
I'm a fan.

916
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,766
Hello.

917
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,268
-I'm a fan.
-Me too.

918
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,732
-Are you making barbecue today?
-Yes, beef ribs.

919
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:43,858
-Beef ribs?
-Yes.

920
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,610
Like this.

921
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:50,031
-But in terms of time, that's impossible.
-Yes, it usually takes around ten hours.

922
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,200
-But in 100 minutes…
-In an hour and a half?

923
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,078
He's very talented,

924
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:57,372
but with the pressure of time…

925
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,749
To be honest, out of everyone here,

926
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,086
that meat takes the longest,
so it comes down to what happens in there.

927
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,839
This usually takes
a really long time to cook.

928
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,759
It takes around 12 to 13 hours.
But I think I can pull it off.

929
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,679
What I thought about and practiced
over and over again

930
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,264
was cutting down the time.

931
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,569
But is this possible within the time?

932
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,991
He's well-known for having the meat
just fall right off the bone.

933
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,409
That's his signature move.

934
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:38,121
But it won't be easy if he can't bring out
that barbecue flavor.

935
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,999
-He has to smoke it and everything.
-That's the problem.

936
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:50,175
Searing the outside of the meat
and putting it in the pressure cooker

937
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,344
was to create the right texture.

938
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,474
The special ingredient of this dish
is the flavor of oak.

939
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,143
The flavor of the smoke.

940
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,103
It's completely different
from oven cooking.

941
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,068
I'll give it a smoky flavor,

942
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,403
just like real barbecue.

943
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,822
I'll turn it into real barbecued meat.

944
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,869
I wonder if he was able to
capture the right flavor.

945
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,586
-That barbecue chef seems to be done.
-Yes.

946
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,172
-His signature move is removing the bone.
-Yes.

947
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:36,554
That barbecue looks so good.

948
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,065
Right now, I call myself a lab director.

949
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,358
BARBECUE LAB DIRECTOR

950
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,735
I haven't been able to give myself

951
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,655
that title of "chef."

952
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,616
If I pull this off, then maybe…

953
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,118
I can consider myself a chef.

954
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,504
-Over there. The barbecue.
-The barbecue.

955
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,047
-The barbecue.
-Really?

956
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,258
-It's a must-see.
-We have to see this.

957
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:14,968
I'm dying to know.

958
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,513
-Were you able to manage in time?
-Yes, I was.

959
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,306
BARBECUE LAB'S SIGNATURE BEEF RIBS

960
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,058
These are my signature beef ribs.

961
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:25,019
It's presented in the style
of a Texas beef rib barbecue,

962
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,272
but it's marinated
with a Korean-style soy sauce

963
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,232
to give it a savory and sweet flavor.

964
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,734
-The key is…
-Yes?

965
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,072
Just like Texas barbecue,

966
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,324
will it melt…

967
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,284
In your mouth?

968
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,786
Did you achieve that within the time?

969
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,674
When he tasted it, he bit into it.

970
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,178
When he bit into it,
I could see the meat cutting away softly.

971
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,681
In my head, I was about 70% sure.

972
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,725
The possibility of getting
that desired texture.

973
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,521
-First of all…
-Yes?

974
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,773
-It's perfectly smoked.
-Okay.

975
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:12,942
But the key is…

976
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,695
-The texture.
-Right.

977
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,453
How was this possible?

978
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,872
-Thank you.
-You've survived.

979
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,458
-Thank you!
-He did it.

980
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,209
BARBECUE LAB DIRECTOR SURVIVES

981
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,003
I guess it was possible
in the given time.

982
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:36,424
He tenderized it with a pressure cooker
and added a smoky flavor,

983
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,011
so it really tasted like barbecue
that had been slow-cooked.

984
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,137
I was quite shocked.

985
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,683
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

986
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:48,269
Thank you.

987
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,980
-Great job.
-Well done.

988
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:54,150
Barbecue Lab Director has survived.

989
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,946
I finally have the chance
to show that I'm a real chef too.

990
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,741
My true cooking skills will get to shine.

991
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:02,909
BARBECUE LAB DIRECTOR

992
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,243
There are a lot of meat dishes.

993
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,663
I think they're doing
what they feel most confident in.

994
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,665
That's pork.

995
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:09,666
And beef.

996
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,502
-It's chicken.
-Yes, it's chicken.

997
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,962
It can work in your favor
in a competition.

998
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,589
An established flavor is best.

999
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,680
What's that? Chef, what's that meat?

1000
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,682
REBELLIOUS GENIUS

1001
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,270
-It's rabbit.
-Yeah.

1002
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,189
-There's rabbit too?
-Yes.

1003
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,858
I haven't seen a rabbit dish in a while.

1004
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,194
I've never tasted rabbit before.

1005
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,988
-We don't really eat it.
-It's not popular in Korea.

1006
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,450
It's just chicken and beef.
Chicken, beef, and pork.

1007
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,830
It might feel really unfamiliar.

1008
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,542
But I thought, "This is good.
It's delicious, so it could work."

1009
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:56,546
If there's something I want to try,
I just do it.

1010
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,091
REBELLIOUS GENIUS

1011
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,886
-He picked a difficult meat.
-He needs a bigger pressure cooker.

1012
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,684
I'm most curious about this dish.

1013
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:10,643
-The rabbit?
-Yes.

1014
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,446
Chef Lee Jun is basically my boss.

1015
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:25,450
I worked my way up to sous chef
at his restaurant, Soigné.

1016
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:29,036
I became a rebellious genius

1017
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,705
because of him.

1018
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,166
Why do you call yourself rebellious?

1019
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,793
I've always attempted to try new things.

1020
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:39,505
So I've been told that I don't listen
or follow instructions.

1021
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,175
-The type who wears out their coworkers?
-Well, not coworkers.

1022
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,885
-Maybe just a superior.
-One superior?

1023
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,511
-Yes, that's right.
-I see.

1024
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:50,308
He has a lot of fascinating ideas
that even I couldn't think of.

1025
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:53,686
You don't know
what kind of results you'll get though.

1026
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,939
I try a lot of different things
and also end up failing a lot.

1027
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:01,694
"Let's make the cod milt
look like the cod's brain."

1028
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,572
It may look really unappetizing,
but it's good when you try it.

1029
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,741
That's never been served to a customer.

1030
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:10,995
I thought it never would've been accepted,

1031
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,830
so I had to give up halfway.

1032
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,124
-I'm a bit anxious.
-What?

1033
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,919
I'm anxious. He likes to try new things.

1034
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:24,467
I wrap the rabbit tenderloin
in prosciutto.

1035
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,723
Next, I use crépine,
which is pork caul fat.

1036
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,977
It's a net-like membrane
that surrounds a pig's internal organs.

1037
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,188
I wrap the meat in that as well.

1038
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,234
Then, I grill it like a steak
before serving.

1039
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:45,238
When you work at a restaurant,
customers always want Korean beef.

1040
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,281
They think steak equals beef.

1041
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,660
"Other meats can become main dishes too."

1042
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,578
That's what I wanted to show.

1043
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,247
-What is that?
-Rabbit.

1044
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,331
-What?
-Rabbit.

1045
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,083
That won't be easy.

1046
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,670
Rabbit isn't an easy ingredient to use.

1047
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:05,466
Unlike beef, rabbit doesn't have
that rich, meaty aroma.

1048
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,678
It tastes similar to chicken breast,

1049
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:12,348
so to give it that special something,
the sauce needs to stand out.

1050
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,059
He's using rabbit offal too?

1051
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:16,936
It looks like liver.

1052
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,604
-Rabbit liver.
-Right.

1053
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:22,817
If I use rabbit liver to make the sauce,

1054
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,235
that would be interesting.

1055
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:28,698
I first got this idea
from the Korean folktale, Byeoljubujeon.

1056
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,409
I asked myself, "What's related
to the rabbits in the story?"

1057
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:33,160
"Then, let's try using rabbit liver."

1058
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,998
I blend the pan-fried rabbit liver.

1059
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,084
There's a distinct flavor you get
from the offal.

1060
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,628
So I used that to create the sauce.

1061
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:47,258
It's not a common ingredient
you see these days,

1062
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,928
so they might find it daring
and interesting.

1063
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,976
I'm curious about the rabbit.

1064
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,480
All I can see are the greens from above.
Please explain the dish.

1065
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:06,402
The dish I prepared
is called "Rabbit and Rabbit Liver."

1066
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,284
-Okay, I'll have a taste.
-Yes, thank you.

1067
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:50,863
He was rebellious.

1068
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,782
As a chef, I thought,

1069
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,116
"Look at you."

1070
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,452
"You did it like this?"

1071
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,831
I doubt many people in Korea today
have tried it before.

1072
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,708
LIkewise, since coming to Korea,

1073
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,877
I don't think
I've used rabbit meat either.

1074
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,296
It might not be
the easiest ingredient to use.

1075
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,131
But even if it's a challenge,

1076
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,759
the look in his eyes showed
he was going to prove himself.

1077
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,764
So this is what Korean rabbit tastes like.

1078
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,854
I've actually never had
Korean rabbit meat before.

1079
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:26,941
It tastes somewhat different.
Very different.

1080
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,693
But whether that's because of the rabbit,

1081
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,737
or because of you as the chef,

1082
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,573
I can't really tell.

1083
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,158
With this dish,

1084
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,077
I'll have to think about it.

1085
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,830
Rebellious Genius,
I'm deferring my decision.

1086
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:41,914
Thank you.

1087
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,792
-Deferred?
-Deferred.

1088
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,002
-Deferred?
-Yes.

1089
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,591
The rabbit meat and liver tasted good,

1090
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:56,220
but that unique rabbit flavor I know
wasn't really there.

1091
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:59,432
But there could be flavors and aspects
I don't know about.

1092
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,726
I thought Mr. Paik
would've tasted it before,

1093
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:04,729
so I deferred my decision
to essentially seek his advice.

1094
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,648
I feel like the Dragon King
eating this rabbit liver sauce.

1095
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,281
Yes, it's rabbit meat.

1096
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:19,452
He brought out that exact texture
of rabbit meat I ate as a child.

1097
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,954
He brought a rabbit dish to a competition.

1098
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,958
I can't tell if it's confidence
or provocation.

1099
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,752
It's brave of you to do this here.

1100
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,378
Usually, if we ask for your best dish,

1101
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,338
-people do what's popular.
-Right.

1102
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,424
-You're rebellious.
-Yes, thank you.

1103
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:36,635
Good job.

1104
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:40,014
-I'm sorry.
-Getting deferred is a big deal.

1105
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:42,641
-Is it?
-Yeah, it's a really big deal.

1106
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:48,105
IF THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SURVIVORS
BY THE END OF TASTING

1107
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,982
SURVIVORS WILL BE CHOSEN
FROM DEFERRED CHEFS

1108
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,737
Hidden White Spoon
Chef Choi Kang-rok's dish is finished.

1109
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,995
I want to pass,
but it might not work out that way.

1110
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,126
Being on that second floor
is the sweet life.

1111
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,586
Choi Kang-rok.

1112
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,423
Come meet us upstairs.

1113
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:16,592
"Why was I burdened with this?"

1114
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:24,600
I've been given an opportunity,

1115
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,894
so let's hold onto it no matter what.

1116
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:32,483
CHOI KANG-ROK

1117
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,068
What will Chef Choi Kang-rok make?

1118
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:37,279
I'm really curious about his dish.

1119
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,490
He has to prepare his best dish.

1120
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,993
I wonder what he's going to make.

1121
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:46,580
Chef Choi needs to survive
for one more Black Spoon chef to make it.

1122
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,874
If he can't, it'll be 18 survivors.

1123
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,459
I was praying for him to make it.

1124
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,752
-Please pass.
-Please.

1125
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,838
-Please.
-Please! You can do it.

1126
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,381
You can do it, Choi Kang-rok!

1127
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,341
When they shout encouragement,

1128
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:01,053
and I do this from below,
it makes me cringe a little.

1129
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,515
I was only thinking of doing my best.

1130
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:08,018
Because one more person
could survive from my efforts.

1131
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:17,736
-He must be using eel.
-Eel?

1132
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,113
Chef Choi brought eel.

1133
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,573
-What kind?
-Freshwater eel.

1134
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:21,740
-Freshwater eel?
-Yes.

1135
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,742
But he's prepping it very differently.

1136
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,413
Usually, with freshwater eel,

1137
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,373
people like to grill it.

1138
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,625
It's cut and split open.

1139
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:35,379
Then, it's grilled before eating.

1140
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:40,342
But I'm going to take it whole,
chop it into chunks,

1141
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,927
grill it once…

1142
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:48,267
I'll grill it and steam it,

1143
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,854
cool it down again,

1144
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,231
and then I'll braise it.

1145
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,700
The whole chunks have gone in.

1146
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,747
Chef Choi is making braised eel.

1147
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,583
He really is the king of braised dishes.

1148
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,295
Freshwater eel is often grilled,

1149
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:18,380
so I thought braising it

1150
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:20,174
would be nice to introduce.

1151
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,676
I keep going down the path of braising.

1152
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,638
My inner self is telling me,
"Don't do anything else."

1153
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,224
"You need to braise it. Braise it."

1154
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:32,645
"Braise it this time too."

1155
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,813
So I braised it.

1156
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:36,690
That's my winning move.

1157
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:40,569
It's the process of turning them
into big boneless chunks of meat.

1158
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,115
Since I'm cooking it in whole chunks,
they'll have very thick bones inside,

1159
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,951
so I need to take them out.

1160
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,955
It makes a difference
when you eat them in one bite.

1161
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:54,500
They need to be free of bones.

1162
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:57,253
Eating that whole chunk of eel…

1163
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:58,879
That satisfaction.

1164
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:03,259
And I'll braise some tofu as well.

1165
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,387
That'll be a fun factor too.

1166
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:08,764
That softness.

1167
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,808
Next, I'll cook various vegetables

1168
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:12,476
and make sure they keep their texture.

1169
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,688
I'll simmer them one by one…

1170
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:18,274
and plate them on the side.

1171
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,192
Braised freshwater eel

1172
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,196
with lightly simmered vegetables
on the side.

1173
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:28,117
I wanted to try making that dish here.

1174
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:29,868
CHOI KANG-ROK

1175
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,912
I'm making it because I wanted to.

1176
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:38,502
Hidden White Spoon
Chef Choi Kang-rok's dish is finished.

1177
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:40,087
Choi Kang-rok's finished.

1178
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,213
It's Chef Choi Kang-rok.

1179
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:45,426
Judges, please make your way
to his station.

1180
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,148
Great job, Chef.

1181
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:03,193
Wow, it's so…

1182
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,280
BRAISED FRESHWATER EEL
WITH SEASONED TOFU AND VEGETABLES

1183
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:09,533
I want the plating to look unique.

1184
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:11,243
Pointy and standing upright.

1185
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,539
Usually, people assume freshwater eel

1186
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:17,082
-will be grilled.
-Yes.

1187
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,876
Why did you braise it?

1188
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:23,005
When it's cut into chunks
and still has the skin attached,

1189
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:27,134
applying heat changes the texture,
which is quite interesting.

1190
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,803
It gets a soft and fluffy texture…

1191
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,265
which is…

1192
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,809
what I wanted

1193
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,020
to have you taste.

1194
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:43,942
Choi Kang-rok looks really nervous though.

1195
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,278
They both have to approve.

1196
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,738
-That's right.
-Both judges.

1197
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,551
I felt he presented a risky dish.

1198
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,430
The vegetables were piled
separate from the braised eel.

1199
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,432
They weren't cooked in the sauce.

1200
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,018
"Wouldn't they be bland
when eaten together?"

1201
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:21,647
Eel is fatty and firm in texture,

1202
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:25,901
whereas vegetables can become mushy
if simmered incorrectly.

1203
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:28,070
I was skeptical
about the pairing as I tasted it.

1204
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,341
Just out of curiosity,

1205
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,136
is there a reason why
you didn't braise the vegetables together?

1206
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,555
The eel is really soft,

1207
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:39,516
but in contrast,
the vegetables are crunchy.

1208
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,560
I thought it'd be better to separate them.

1209
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,437
That was my reasoning.

1210
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,358
So I just simmered each vegetable lightly
to bring out its flavor.

1211
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:50,569
Then, I put them together.

1212
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:58,660
Thank you for the dish.

1213
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,665
Now, please write down your decisions.

1214
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:10,088
However, you may not discuss
your decisions with each other.

1215
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:15,177
Please make your own decisions
on the chef's survival or elimination.

1216
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:17,888
What will it be?

1217
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:19,723
He must be so nervous.

1218
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,645
CHOI KANG-ROK
SURVIVED, ELIMINATED

1219
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:36,740
They're thinking it over.

1220
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:38,575
-Oh, no.
-It must be hard to decide.

1221
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:58,345
Both judges have delivered
their decisions to the production team.

1222
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,308
Once delivered,
their decisions cannot be changed.

1223
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:07,896
Come meet us upstairs.

1224
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,024
First,

1225
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,402
Paik Jong-won,
please announce your decision.

1226
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:21,159
Hidden White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok.

1227
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:26,164
You've survived.

1228
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:27,583
You've survived.

1229
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:31,253
PAIK JONG-WON
SURVIVED

1230
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:35,966
Let's go.

1231
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:40,095
I've tasted a lot of braised dishes,

1232
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:41,972
but this was perfect.

1233
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:46,602
Especially the eel,
which you braised in whole chunks.

1234
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,562
The tenderness was pretty much…

1235
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,733
But the seasoning had seeped in perfectly.

1236
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:54,985
It was great, so you've survived.

1237
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:57,529
Now,

1238
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,116
based on the remaining judge's decision,

1239
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:06,246
the Hidden White Spoon
will either survive or be eliminated.

1240
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,837
Having even just one more chef
would be good for us.

1241
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,506
But from what we've seen
of Chef Anh Sung-jae today,

1242
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,800
-he won't consider that at all.
-Right.

1243
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:23,472
During Season 1,

1244
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:28,185
I could tell
they clearly had different tastes.

1245
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:30,562
But is there a common ground

1246
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:36,401
where those differences in taste
can come together?

1247
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,946
If I advance today,
it means that common ground does exist.

1248
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:42,491
Now then,

1249
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,409
Anh Sung-jae,

1250
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:46,953
please announce your decision.

1251
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:52,751
When you said
you were making braised eel,

1252
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,546
I wondered if the dish would be
what I was thinking of

1253
01:17:57,297 --> 01:18:00,634
or if it would be something
carrying your own distinct style.

1254
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:03,637
The braised dishes

1255
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,305
that you make

1256
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,308
have a very clear style.

1257
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,435
…have a very clear style.

1258
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,730
Hidden White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok.

1259
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,314
