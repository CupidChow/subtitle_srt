1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,593
Judges, please announce the result.

2
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,015
I chose Chef Son Jong-won.

3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,183
PAIK JONG-WON
SON JONG-WON

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,144
Chef Son Jong-won.

5
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,815
I chose…

6
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,534
This is seriously just a tiny detail.

7
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,787
By a seriously fine margin, I chose…

8
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,468
Culinary Monster.

9
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,013
ANH SUNG-JAE
CULINARY MONSTER

10
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,230
I really liked the way
the ingredients just burst forth.

11
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:09,152
It felt more balanced,
so I gave you my vote.

12
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,236
-Thank you.
-Yes.

13
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,364
-I guess we'll need to discuss again.
-Geez.

14
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,161
I mean, it's all or nothing at this point.

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,413
So I was a little scared.

16
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,418
-They both tasted good.
-Yeah.

17
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,836
They both did well,

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,379
but I chose Culinary Monster

19
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,423
because his dish was better balanced

20
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,217
and brought out

21
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,303
the qualities of the ingredients better.

22
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,722
-I chose very carefully.
-For me,

23
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:43,228
the sabayon in Culinary Monster's dish
was a bit too strong.

24
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,397
I felt the flavor leaned
a bit too much to one side.

25
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,067
I think the sabayon should serve
its purpose as the sauce.

26
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,984
That's true.

27
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,362
If you eat something
with Thousand Island sauce,

28
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,156
you need to be able to taste
the Thousand Island sauce

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,867
for the intent to be
clearly reflected in the dish.

30
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,078
The dish definitely did have character.

31
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,038
-Yes.
-Culinary Monster's dish

32
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,541
was bursting with unique character,

33
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,376
whereas Son Jong-won's dish had

34
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,503
a smooth, steady flavor
all the way through.

35
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:12,966
-I thought both dishes had real charm.
-I enjoyed both too.

36
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,518
When we were waiting
for the result after being tied,

37
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,688
that was the most nervous I've been
during this whole competition.

38
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,247
Judges, please announce the result.

39
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,751
For this one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle,

40
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,920
the winner is…

41
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,256
I have to win.

42
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,466
It's a match I know I have to win.

43
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,600
The winner is…

44
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,606
Culinary Monster.

45
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,065
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

46
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,317
Culinary Monster.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,860
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

48
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,614
Culinary Monster.

49
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,115
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

50
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,161
Thank you.

51
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,755
To be honest,
there wasn't much to criticize.

52
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,257
So we had to be even more strict.

53
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,927
In any case,
they both work in fine dining,

54
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,095
so it comes down
to showcasing the ingredients.

55
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,181
Son Jong-won's dish had

56
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,141
a smooth, steady flavor
all the way through.

57
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,769
Earlier, we saw him add
Cognac to his dish.

58
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,896
-Right.
-In my view, adding Cognac

59
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,774
was his way of adding depth.

60
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:56,819
But he'd already used
snow crabs, Champagne, and such,

61
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,407
so it felt a bit too much
along with everything else.

62
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:06,454
The thing is, explaining it like this
makes it seem like a big difference.

63
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,123
But honestly, this isn't even
a hair's breadth of a difference.

64
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:13,086
Culinary Monster used the same ingredients

65
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,256
and highlighted them well in his dish.

66
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,466
The one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle.

67
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,344
Black Spoon Chef
Culinary Monster survives.

68
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,931
CULINARY MONSTER ADVANCES TO THE TOP 7

69
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,147
I feel bad that I advanced,
but it doesn't mean I can afford to lose.

70
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,691
I worked really hard.

71
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,152
I'm going to push myself harder
and with more focus this time.

72
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,655
Eliminated chef, Son Jong-won,

73
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,116
please take your nameplate
and leave the kitchen.

74
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,659
I'm sorry, Jong-won.

75
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,622
-Great job.
-I'm sorry.

76
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,581
Don't be.

77
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,917
I'm sorry we couldn't win the team battle.

78
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,043
You were great.

79
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,128
Thank you.

80
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,965
Great job, Chef.

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,593
Of course, I don't feel great
since I lost.

82
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,139
But I made the dish
just as I had planned it.

83
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,183
So in all honesty,
I think I did everything I set out to do.

84
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,688
SON JONG-WON ELIMINATED

85
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,023
I feel very relieved.

86
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,191
It was really…

87
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,527
enjoyable.

88
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,779
I'm so sad and sorry to leave this soon.

89
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,451
SON JONG-WON

90
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,328
Sitting here does feel different.

91
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,832
-I saw the view from up here.
-That's why these seats are good.

92
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,750
And with this,

93
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,961
we have the Top 7
who will advance to the semifinals.

94
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,800
CULINARY CLASS WARS SEASON 2 TOP 7

95
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,888
The main competition
of Culinary Class Wars

96
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,723
actually begins with the Top 7.

97
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,810
This time, the Top 7 includes
contestants of different ages,

98
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,647
different culinary fields,
and different experiences,

99
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,857
so I'm very excited.

100
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,569
Now,

101
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,074
it is time to introduce the chefs
who have made it to the Top 7.

102
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,326
First,

103
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,827
a rising star with monstrous talent

104
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,205
who honed his skills
at Michelin three-star restaurants,

105
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,083
Black Spoon Chef Culinary Monster.

106
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,376
He's a strong favorite to win.

107
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,004
True to his title,
he's a culinary monster.

108
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,006
I'm going to the finals.

109
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,009
The second Top 7 finalist

110
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,262
bridges the past and present
with her culinary touch.

111
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,431
Black Spoon Chef Brewmaster Yun.

112
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,059
Her cooking skills are exceptional.

113
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,521
I'll have to trust my intuition and hands
to do my best today.

114
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,816
Third, the winner of MasterChef Korea,

115
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,859
White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok.

116
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,948
Since this is his second time competing,
he must have a lot of expertise.

117
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,867
If I lose, I'm gone.

118
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,079
The celebrity chef of Japanese cuisine
beloved by the nation,

119
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,414
White Spoon Chef Jung Ho-young.

120
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,709
Now that I've made the Top 7,
I can't stop here.

121
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,714
Winner of Korean Food War,
White Spoon Chef Im Seong-keun.

122
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,424
I have to win, no matter what.

123
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:10,513
Sixth, Korea's first Master
of Temple Cuisine,

124
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,473
White Spoon Chef Venerable Sunjae.

125
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,396
I'll cook with the mind
of a practitioner until the very end.

126
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,940
The seventh Top 7 finalist.

127
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,112
A legend in the world
of Korean-Chinese cuisine,

128
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,364
a culinary master of 57 years,

129
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,534
White Spoon Chef Hou Deok-juk.

130
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:37,415
I've been cooking for almost 60 years,

131
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,959
but it seems there is no limit
to the world of cooking.

132
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,546
I'll try my best until the very end.

133
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,260
Of the seven survivors here right now,

134
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,014
the number of survivors

135
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,142
to advance to the final round is…

136
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,979
only two.

137
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,157
I thought this time would be different
and they'd maybe allow three.

138
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,074
But it figures.

139
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,660
We're almost there. Almost.

140
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,456
The Top Two to compete in the final round

141
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,460
will be decided through two missions.

142
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:27,089
And in this first mission,
the chef who comes in first

143
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,469
will immediately advance
to the final round.

144
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,056
I definitely want to win
so I can easily advance to the finals.

145
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,642
I have to win the first mission.

146
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:42,688
Now, it is time to announce
the theme of the first mission.

147
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,610
The theme of the first mission is…

148
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,990
Endless…

149
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,659
It can't be…

150
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,745
Cooking…

151
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,372
I guess he'll say "Hell" next.

152
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,668
Paradise.

153
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,128
What on earth is that?

154
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:11,175
ENDLESS COOKING PARADISE

155
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,510
Paradise.

156
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,430
As soon as I heard it,
all I could do was laugh.

157
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,314
What on earth?

158
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,607
What's going on?

159
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,943
What's happening?

160
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,002
It was covered at first
and then started sliding up.

161
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,130
Gosh, and it kept going up!

162
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,354
Holy cow, that's amazing.

163
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,856
Wow, look at those ingredients…

164
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,109
It's unlike any pantry we've used before.

165
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,827
This is what you will use
for the Endless Cooking Paradise.

166
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,371
The Endless Pantry.

167
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,755
The pantry you see before you includes

168
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,799
premium Korean beef

169
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,884
and various cuts of meat.

170
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,679
Ribs and all kinds of meat…

171
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,597
Seafood.

172
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,016
Incredible.

173
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,312
Spanish mackerel,
flounder, sea bream, salmon.

174
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,939
All kinds of good fish were there.

175
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,775
Vegetables and fruits.

176
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,403
There were so many fresh
and high-quality ingredients.

177
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,822
Various seasonings.

178
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:01,243
There are around 500 different kinds
of ingredients in total.

179
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,871
To have access
to every ingredient imaginable,

180
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,373
it truly is a cooking paradise.

181
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,625
I figured we'll see
some legendary dishes made.

182
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,543
In this Endless Cooking Paradise,

183
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,921
you will use these ingredients
as you please

184
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,674
to cook during the 180-minute time limit

185
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,718
and attempt to receive
the highest score from the judges.

186
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:23,682
There is no limit on how many times
you cook or the number of dishes you make.

187
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,976
You may make a single attempt…

188
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,480
or multiple attempts.

189
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,817
The dishes will be judged
immediately after completion.

190
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,403
The results will be revealed in real time.

191
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,487
FIRST PLACE, CHEF A, 180

192
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,781
They have failed to set a new high score.

193
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,992
They have set a new high score.

194
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,996
First place can change at any time.

195
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,997
Damn.

196
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,294
Before the clock runs out,
you must make endless attempts

197
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,132
to achieve the highest score
and claim first place.

198
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,719
The person who ends up
with the highest score from the judges

199
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,721
will advance to the final round.

200
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,517
Today, I have to become ice itself.

201
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,353
There's no room
for even the slightest error,

202
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,524
so I plan to be
very cold and objective in my judging.

203
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,984
ENDLESS COOKING PARADISE

204
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,345
Now, the Endless Cooking Paradise…

205
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,515
ENDLESS COOKING PARADISE

206
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,351
…will begin!

207
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,532
Gosh.

208
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,367
There's no time to lose.

209
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,168
There's a lot of stuff here.

210
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,922
I'll run out of time
just looking for the things I need.

211
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,132
They're all inside here.

212
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,556
When I saw the pantry,

213
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,559
it had various meats,
like pork, beef, and chicken.

214
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,688
I think it had everything.
You could pretty much cook any dish.

215
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,151
Actually, there were too many ingredients,

216
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,072
so it made it difficult
to decide what to cook.

217
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,075
If this weren't a competition,
it would be Paradise.

218
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,869
It felt like Hell inside my head.

219
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,664
It made my head hurt, so…

220
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,041
I just kept staring at the ingredients.

221
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,418
Having too many is a problem too.

222
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,004
They're live crabs.

223
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,884
Octopus.

224
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,886
One octopus.

225
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,515
Flour.

226
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,725
Do I need flour?

227
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,228
Deep-fried food.

228
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,230
Am I going to deep-fry stuff? Or not?

229
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,567
If there are too many ingredients,

230
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,944
you can become greedy.

231
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,531
And if you become greedy,
you can't make a proper dish.

232
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,367
To be honest, this isn't Paradise.

233
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,789
I welcomed it with open arms.

234
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,499
I was actually laughing inside.

235
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,128
The more ingredients there are,
the better it is for me.

236
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,504
Black pepper.

237
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,300
I've had years of practical experience,

238
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,344
so in terms of ingredient combinations,

239
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,847
I think I'm pretty quick on the draw.

240
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,848
Okay.

241
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,808
Let's go!

242
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,947
Make one single dish
and go straight to the finals?

243
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,407
No one can guarantee that.

244
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,162
With any dish that can be done quickly,

245
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,582
I thought I should make
as many as possible and score some points.

246
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,627
As quickly as possible.

247
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,796
That's my strategy.

248
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,720
To be honest, with 180 minutes,

249
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,722
I can make at least ten
if I cook continuously.

250
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,557
Damn it, I need to go again.

251
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,145
Jesus Christ.

252
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,813
All this running is killing me.

253
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,821
Flour, vinegar, black pepper.

254
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,452
The first dish I'm making

255
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,495
is called pogye.

256
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:58,123
Pogye is a dish from the Joseon Dynasty
that was enjoyed by Sejong the Great.

257
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,334
It's considered
the origin of Korean fried chicken.

258
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,919
JOSEON-ERA CHICKEN DISH
IN SANGA YOROK

259
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,095
I'll be using beef fat,
which goes especially well with chicken.

260
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,682
During the Joseon era,
vegetable oil was very rare.

261
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,977
So I used animal fat

262
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,478
to cook the chicken.

263
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,777
Next, I made flour slurry…

264
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,663
and added it to the pan
so it coats the chicken like batter.

265
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,962
The taste is a little tangy,

266
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,216
and the flavor is just incredible.

267
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,976
It was the quickest dish I could make.

268
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,563
Cooking quickly is
how I like to do things.

269
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,608
It'll take about 15 minutes.

270
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,485
Okay, the sauce is done.

271
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,987
Come have a taste.

272
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,658
This is tasty.

273
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,118
-Done!
-The sauce is good.

274
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,119
It's over!

275
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,787
We'll finish as quickly as possible.

276
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,956
Then we'll have a taste.

277
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,297
-What?
-It's really good.

278
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,215
-Really good.
-All done?

279
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,134
Let's plate it up.

280
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,136
That's what I love to do.

281
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,181
Food tastes best when you eat it hot.

282
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,601
So, I served what was ready quickly.

283
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,729
That's how I divided up my time.

284
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,112
I wanted to finish my dish first,
no matter what.

285
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:53,989
What on earth?

286
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,407
He must have been flying around.

287
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,204
Chef Im Seong-keun's
first dish is complete.

288
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,330
Gosh, he's fast.

289
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,414
Chef Im Seong-keun,

290
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,334
please take your dish
and proceed to the tasting room.

291
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,665
This is Chef Im Seong-keun's first dish.

292
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,877
POGYE
IM SEONG-KEUN'S FIRST DISH

293
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,966
The first dish I've prepared

294
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,092
is one that was enjoyed

295
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,803
by Sejong the Great
during the Joseon Dynasty called pogye.

296
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,638
You finished it in just 35 minutes.

297
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,725
-Was this part of your strategy?
-Yes.

298
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,061
I'll try to win with quantity
in addition to quality.

299
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,521
-You have more coming up?
-Pardon?

300
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,480
There's more to come?

301
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,732
I'll see you every five minutes.

302
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,650
Then, I'll quickly…

303
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,361
We should taste it quickly
so he can get going.

304
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,656
A lot of people
are curious about this pogye.

305
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,160
It's a recipe from an old cookbook,
which is essentially…

306
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,955
the original Korean fried chicken.

307
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,962
He knew what pogye was,

308
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,548
and he mentioned its origins,

309
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,425
which was really nice.

310
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,552
Traditional fried chicken.

311
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,277
Then, did you use the suet
from around the intestines as the oil?

312
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,278
Yes, that's right.

313
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,531
The suet contains some unsaturated fat,

314
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,993
so its savory flavor
is a lot better than other fats.

315
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,371
This aroma is definitely different
from chicken fried in oil.

316
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,666
Yes, the flavor is different
since it's animal fat.

317
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,378
I didn't know such a precious recipe
existed in an old cookbook.

318
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,296
Yes.

319
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,382
For me, recipes from old cookbooks
always feel new.

320
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,635
-Right.
-Thank you for the dish.

321
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,178
Thank you.

322
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,888
The tasting is complete.

323
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:27,100
Judges, please enter your score
for Chef Im Seong-keun.

324
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,021
RANKING IS DECIDED
AFTER ADDING BOTH JUDGES' SCORES

325
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,942
THEY WILL EACH GIVE A SCORE OUT OF 100
FOR A TOTAL POSSIBLE SCORE OF 200 POINTS

326
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:42,032
Now, it is time to announce
Chef Im Seong-keun's score.

327
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,785
Please reveal

328
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,869
the judges' scores.

329
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:54,127
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 82 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 83 points.

330
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,172
Chef Im Seong-keun received
a total of 165 points.

331
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,758
Currently in first place
is Chef Im Seong-keun.

332
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,469
-Thank you.
-You're currently in first.

333
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,596
Right! I'll do my best!

334
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,681
Good luck!

335
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,560
In any case, he's in first.

336
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,063
For me, the idea was great,

337
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,441
but if he'd spent a bit more time
brining the chicken…

338
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,860
-It was bland, right?
-Yes, I think he rushed it.

339
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,154
If he'd spent even 20 or 30 minutes more…

340
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,157
-A bit more on brining.
-It would've been so much better.

341
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,955
It was a bit disappointing.

342
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,250
On my way back, I thought
I should put another dish out quickly.

343
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,175
The others are using premium ingredients.

344
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:46,930
But for me, every ingredient
is precious and valuable.

345
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,642
I made vegetable stir-fry
with Chinese toon shoots and mushrooms.

346
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,771
They're called Chinese toon shoots.

347
00:21:56,023 --> 00:22:00,235
They help warm up the body
and strengthens your immune system.

348
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:09,036
The dishes we make bring out
the natural flavors of the ingredients.

349
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:15,083
I wanted to show how easily
you could make these kinds of dishes.

350
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,216
I added some chili oil.

351
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,225
Then, I stir-fried it with gochujang.

352
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,483
Even just stir-frying makes it
fragrant and delicious.

353
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,319
This is enough to bring out the flavor.

354
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,739
I wanted to show them
what this taste is like.

355
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,085
VEGETABLE STIR-FRY
WITH CHINESE TOON SHOOTS

356
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,087
VENERABLE SUNJAE'S FIRST DISH

357
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,755
For my first dish,

358
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:06,093
I stir-fried mushrooms
and Chinese toon shoots.

359
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,553
I don't see a lot of Chinese toon shoots,

360
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,515
-but the aroma really hits you.
-Yes.

361
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,725
It's an essential food
in a vegetarian diet.

362
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,644
It warms you up, and it adds flavor.

363
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,563
-It's used in place of seasoning.
-Right, I see.

364
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,483
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

365
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,861
There's a variety of mushrooms in here.

366
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,822
-Yes.
-Maybe around five different kinds.

367
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,809
There are mushrooms and chili oil in here,
but as you said,

368
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,979
the aroma of the Chinese toon shoots
envelopes everything,

369
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,107
giving it a steady, balanced flavor.

370
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,860
-People who like meat will also like this.
-Yes.

371
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:09,239
Judges, please enter your score
for Chef Venerable Sunjae.

372
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:17,831
Now, it is time to announce
Chef Venerable Sunjae's score.

373
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,668
Please reveal the judges' scores.

374
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,008
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 87 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 80 points.

375
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,427
With a total of 167 points,

376
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,804
the chef has set a new high score.

377
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,813
Currently in first place
is Venerable Sunjae.

378
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,858
Congratulations.

379
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,654
It's a vegetable-only dish,
which some people may dislike,

380
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,656
but this dish can easily
appeal to everyone,

381
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,617
so I gave you a higher score.

382
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,248
The time I'm spending here
is both a form of practice

383
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,710
and a chance to bring
joy and happiness to others.

384
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,758
FIRST PLACE, VENERABLE SUNJAE

385
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,265
Is he planning to win with quantity?

386
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,767
Chef Im Seong-keun's

387
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,685
-second dish is complete.
-Again?

388
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,189
One spot in the finals
will definitely be mine.

389
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,109
-I'm back again.
-Already?

390
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,780
I want to show you as much as I can today.

391
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,032
I think we might become best buddies.

392
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,660
So, the second dish I've prepared

393
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,079
is chicken breast salad
with pine nut dressing.

394
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,288
IM SEONG-KEUN'S SECOND DISH

395
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,417
You can't go without pine nuts
in Korean cuisine.

396
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,421
I added some pine nuts and apples.

397
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,723
Then, I poached chicken breast
and prepared it as an appetizer.

398
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,062
Pine nuts have
an incredible aroma and flavor.

399
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,232
Please taste it with the chestnuts.

400
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,275
CHESTNUTS

401
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,548
Did you use the same chicken?

402
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,342
Yes, I only used the drumsticks earlier.

403
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,220
This time, I poached
and used the chicken breast.

404
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,724
It is time to announce
Chef Im Seong-keun's score.

405
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,351
Please reveal the judges' scores.

406
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,939
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 81 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 78 points.

407
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,567
Chef Im Seong-keun received
a total of 159 points.

408
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,861
The chef has failed to set
a new high score.

409
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,031
The chicken breast was overdone.

410
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,615
-Right.
-It was overcooked.

411
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,077
The sauce was very well made,
but as for the composition of the dish…

412
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,663
-It's simple, but with a bit more effort…
-Right.

413
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,207
-It would've been a lot tastier.
-Right.

414
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,208
I'll be right back.

415
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,835
-See you in a bit.
-See you soon.

416
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,172
I wasn't fazed in the slightest.

417
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,051
I still had a lot of time left,

418
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,844
so I knew I could turn it around.

419
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,558
This and…

420
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,942
I was brainstorming inside my head,

421
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,446
but even as the clock started,
I didn't have a dish in mind.

422
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,077
I think the hardest part was deciding
what to use as the main ingredient.

423
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,418
For the first dish,
I chose to use seafood.

424
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,130
I decided on something
straightforward and tasty.

425
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,257
If you had king crabs

426
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,719
and could take big bites of them,
it'd be pretty delicious.

427
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,724
I saw minari there

428
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,143
and some fresh bamboo shoots.

429
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,314
It's late spring, so I wanted to use
some spring ingredients.

430
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,109
I prepared a soup.

431
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,778
CLAMS

432
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,034
I made a clam broth.

433
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,166
Then, I blended it
with chamnamul and minari.

434
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,965
That formed the soup.

435
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,560
I wanted to bring out
the natural sweetness of the king crab.

436
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,531
I sliced the bamboo shoots
and sautéed them in butter.

437
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,827
I added some clam meat

438
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,871
and topped it with slices
of cured mullet roe

439
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,540
to complete the dish.

440
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,213
I hope the all flavors
come together nicely.

441
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,298
SEAFOOD SOUP

442
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,884
FIRST PLACE, VENERABLE SUNJAE

443
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,680
Clam broth, minari, and…

444
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,224
And chamnamul.
I also used rice to thicken it.

445
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,019
-Do we just eat it with a spoon?
-Yes.

446
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,228
Should we thoroughly mix it?

447
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,734
King crab, bamboo shoot, cured mullet roe,

448
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,736
and clam.

449
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,316
You can really taste
the seasonal flavors in this dish.

450
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,736
As you eat it, you keep tasting spring.

451
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:29,410
Currently in first place
is Venerable Sunjae with 167 points.

452
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,415
Now, please reveal
Culinary Monster's score.

453
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:39,462
Chef Anh gave 90 points
to Napoli Matfia last year

454
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,839
and explained his reason.

455
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,800
JUDGE ANH SUNG-JAE HAS NOT ONCE
GIVEN A SCORE OVER 90 YET

456
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,970
It's impossible for a dish
to score 100 points.

457
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,098
If a dish tastes delicious,
the highest I'd give

458
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,267
is probably around 90 points.

459
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,895
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 92 points.

460
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,022
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 90 points.

461
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,567
I gave it 90 points,
which is 100 points by my standards.

462
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,571
I wanted to receive 90 points too.

463
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,406
If I got 90 points from him,

464
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,867
I figured Mr. Paik would give me
a score higher than 90.

465
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,078
Please reveal Culinary Monster's score.

466
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,500
CULINARY MONSTER
PAIK JONG-WON, ANH SUNG-JAE

467
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,212
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 93 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 65 points.

468
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,799
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 93 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 65 points.

469
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,013
Culinary Monster received
a total of 158 points.

470
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,599
The chef has failed to set
a new high score.

471
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,773
I didn't know I'd get such a low score.

472
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,775
CULINARY MONSTER
158

473
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,279
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 93 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 65 points.

474
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,906
Gosh, that much of a gap?

475
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,199
The chef has failed to set
a new high score.

476
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,577
Currently in first place
is Venerable Sunjae.

477
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,206
I gave you a high score,

478
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,042
because you'd think the star of the dish

479
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,669
would be the king crab, the clam,
or the bamboo shoot.

480
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,671
But when you taste it,

481
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,674
you realize the star
is the minari and chamnamul soup.

482
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,637
I kept wanting to experience
the aroma of the greens in the soup.

483
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,849
It was nice
how each bite felt more refreshing.

484
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,393
-I thought it was delicious.
-Thank you.

485
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,188
-I gave you quite a low score.
-Right.

486
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,439
The reason was

487
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,193
when you make a soup like this,
it needs to be well-balanced.

488
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,530
But to my taste,
the clam broth had the strongest flavor.

489
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,700
And so, I should be tasting
the sweetness of king crab,

490
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,619
but even the king crab felt salty.

491
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,622
And when I ate a bamboo shoot,
I couldn't taste its flavor.

492
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,458
The savory and salty flavors
dominated the dish,

493
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:44,045
so although the aroma of the greens
as Mr. Paik mentioned was there,

494
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,838
the balance was completely broken.

495
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:52,345
I didn't expect the saltiness
to stand out so much.

496
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,472
I didn't add any extra seasoning.

497
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:58,226
I think it was because the clam broth
came out too strong.

498
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,603
You're in Paradise.
You have all these ingredients.

499
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,147
You throw in
all of these quality ingredients,

500
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,817
and as the flavors build up in layers,

501
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,569
they should come together as one.

502
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,905
But the more I chewed,
the saltier it became,

503
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:15,076
and it kept breaking up that balance.

504
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,411
I was very disappointed.

505
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,209
The score was so low it hurt my pride.

506
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,253
I felt a lot of pressure.

507
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,424
I was annoyed.
I wanted to present a second dish quickly.

508
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,389
For my first dish…

509
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,393
I used bird's nest

510
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,273
and also sea cucumber.

511
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,819
Dried sea cucumber and dried bird's nest
are luxurious ingredients.

512
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,364
They were used for dishes often served

513
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,408
when entertaining important guests.

514
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,580
Bird's nest is an ingredient

515
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:06,502
where edible-nest swiftlets eat things,
like seaweed from the ocean,

516
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,506
and they spit out their saliva
onto the walls of cliffs.

517
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,843
That's how they build their nests,

518
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,721
which then dry and harden.

519
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,682
So you can say it's a precious ingredient.

520
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:26,773
For the sea cucumber,
I added soy sauce and oyster sauce.

521
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:33,154
I simmered them
to let the seasoning soak in.

522
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:42,038
I'll be using one whole sea cucumber.

523
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,293
I filled the inside with bird's nest.

524
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,836
After filling it…

525
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:56,177
I finely chopped various vegetables,
stir-fried them,

526
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,054
and spread them
on the bottom of the plate.

527
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,808
I placed the sea cucumber on top of that.

528
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,812
I cut up the other sea cucumber,

529
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,440
topped it with bird's nest,

530
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,739
and then finished with a little caviar.

531
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,620
As the ingredients come from the sea,

532
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:26,040
in order to get rid of the fishy smell,

533
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:31,462
I added a sweet and sour yuxiang sauce.

534
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,756
A SPICY, SWEET, AND SOUR SAUCE
FROM SICHUAN, CHINA

535
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,552
BIRD'S NEST AND SEA CUCUMBER
HOU DEOK-JUK'S FIRST DISH

536
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,763
So, this is a Cantonese-style dish.

537
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:44,767
Sea cucumber grow in the deep sea
on the ocean floor,

538
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,228
so the vegetables
underneath the sea cucumber

539
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:52,150
represent grains of sand.

540
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,694
I plated it to have it look
sand on the bottom.

541
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,779
Take this and…

542
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,324
-Should we drizzle the sauce?
-Drizzle a bit of sauce. Yes.

543
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,578
-Is something inside the sea cucumber?
-Yes, there's bird's nest inside.

544
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,288
-There's bird's nest inside too?
-Yes.

545
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,877
-The vegetables are the sand.
-Yes, the grains of sand.

546
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,045
I also added some caviar.

547
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:36,027
To be honest, bird's nest doesn't have
a unique flavor of its own.

548
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,988
Depending on the texture
and what flavors are used,

549
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,364
it can even become a dessert.

550
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,451
-It's often used for soups or desserts.
-Yes.

551
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,829
That's right. Bird's nest itself
doesn't have any flavor.

552
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:51,500
So instead of making a soup,
I combined it with another ingredient

553
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,919
to create this dish.

554
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:59,050
Currently in first place
is Venerable Sunjae with 167 points.

555
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:03,304
First place will only change hands
if a score surpasses 167 points.

556
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:08,726
Now, please reveal
Chef Hou Deok-juk's score.

557
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,946
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 87 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 84 points.

558
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,490
Chef Hou Deok-juk received
a total of 171 points.

559
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,909
The chef has set a new high score.

560
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,828
The chef has set a new high score.

561
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,790
Currently in first place
is Chef Hou Deok-juk.

562
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,000
…received a total of 171 points.

563
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,628
The chef has set a new high score.

564
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:40,800
Since he put in the effort,
I think it's only right to applaud him.

565
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,468
And I have another chance.

566
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:47,348
CURRENT FIRST PLACE
HOU DEOK-JUK, 171 POINTS

567
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,811
I could really taste the natural flavor
of the sea cucumber,

568
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,604
-and the texture was there.
-Right.

569
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,731
It was also free of unwanted smells.

570
00:37:55,815 --> 00:38:00,027
The texture of sea cucumber
and the unique appeal of bird's nest

571
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,946
-made for a delicious dish.
-Thank you.

572
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,117
-It was an incredible experience.
-It was my pleasure.

573
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,703
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

574
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,205
I thought, "Oh? I'm in first place."

575
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,749
I was pleased,

576
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:18,379
but I knew someone else could overtake me,

577
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,132
so I felt some pressure.

578
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,801
I should make the next one.

579
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,727
KALGUKSU NOODLES

580
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,154
I think they both prioritize
flavors that are straightforward.

581
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,868
And they like tastes
that don't have anything superfluous.

582
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,625
So I stripped everything out.

583
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,131
And I made something even simpler.

584
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:07,261
FIRST PLACE, HOU DEOK-JUK

585
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,975
The next dish I've prepared

586
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,102
is cold kalguksu.

587
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,313
COLD SHRIMP KALGUKSU
CULINARY MONSTER'S SECOND DISH

588
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,940
In this round,
there are no restrictions on ingredients,

589
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,609
and no restrictions on budget.

590
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,819
So I decided to make
some really good shrimp broth.

591
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,946
SHRIMP

592
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,880
I blend the shrimp and water
in equal amounts together.

593
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,971
I blend it until it's nice and thick.

594
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,225
Then, I boil it.

595
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,319
That's it for the broth.

596
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,780
For the garnish…

597
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,793
I grilled some sweet turnips,

598
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,963
lightly blanched some shrimp,

599
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,675
added some tomatoes,

600
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,845
and used chamnamul stems.

601
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,683
Shrimp and tomatoes
make a nice cold pairing

602
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,351
in this clear, cold kalguksu.

603
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,353
I see. There were noodles underneath.

604
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,532
May I say one thing?

605
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,450
-Yes.
-Of course.

606
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,243
It's a cold broth, so if possible…

607
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,787
-It's better to drink it like this.
-Together?

608
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,122
-Like this.
-Okay.

609
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,126
So take in the soup
and ingredients together?

610
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,461
-Yes.
-Okay.

611
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,952
I need to get the highest score.
I need to keep going until I get it.

612
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:43,000
Currently in first place
is Chef Hou Deok-juk with 171 points.

613
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,045
First place will only change hands
if a score surpasses 171 points.

614
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:49,924
Now, please reveal
Culinary Monster's score.

615
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,057
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 90 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 88 points.

616
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,185
Culinary Monster received
a total of 178 points.

617
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,979
The chef has set a new high score.

618
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,439
…received a total of 178 points.

619
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,858
The chef has set a new high score.

620
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,945
Currently in first place
is Culinary Monster.

621
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,321
FIRST PLACE, CULINARY MONSTER

622
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,666
It's not easy to make
a cold broth with seafood.

623
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,586
I thought very highly of that attempt,
and it was executed just as well.

624
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,672
When I ate the tomato,
its texture worked well

625
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:33,509
with the noodles,
the temperature, and the shrimp.

626
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,010
And it tasted great.

627
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,638
Also, you charred the turnips,

628
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,849
and these are very sweet turnips.

629
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,727
But charring it added
not just a sweet note

630
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,812
but also a roasted aroma.

631
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,772
That would've been
an instinctive decision.

632
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:50,025
What you planned for the dish
and how you added each element

633
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,361
all fell into place, in my opinion.

634
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,405
It was very clean and delicious.

635
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,322
Thank you.

636
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,241
-Great job.
-Thank you.

637
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,661
I thought, "I need to get a higher score."

638
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,163
It wasn't what I considered a high score.

639
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,791
I thought it wasn't enough.

640
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,170
It must be shocking

641
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,922
-to see first place change.
-Definitely.

642
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,843
Currently in first place
is Chef Im Seong-keun.

643
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,138
…Venerable Sunjae.

644
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,349
Chef Hou Deok-juk
has set a new high score.

645
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,602
…a new high score.

646
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,688
They'll be looking at the clock
and trying to work out

647
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,107
how many more they should make
or what to make.

648
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,109
Gosh, the suspense.

649
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,869
To this…

650
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,332
What was I going to do?
Right, steam the abalone.

651
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,882
What comes next?

652
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,176
Should I grill first?

653
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,887
No, grilling shouldn't come first.

654
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,517
The more ingredients there are,

655
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,936
the more complicated
and difficult it gets.

656
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,066
Will I be okay if I do this?

657
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,947
Never mind. Whatever.

658
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,452
First place gets you
straight to the finals,

659
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:28,248
so unless I cook this properly,
it's going to be tough.

660
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:33,587
My first dish is called renkon manju.

661
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,964
Renkon means "lotus root" in Japanese.

662
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,217
Back when I was training in Japan,

663
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:42,971
I was amazed that a dish like this
could be made with lotus root,

664
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,265
so I ambitiously chose this dish.

665
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,353
First, I grate the lotus root.

666
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,524
I grate about two-thirds of it.

667
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,109
Okay.

668
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,695
And I chop the other third with a knife.

669
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,617
That keeps the crunchy texture
of the lotus root.

670
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,831
I add flour

671
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,708
and work it in a frying pan over low heat

672
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,544
to make it become nice and sticky.

673
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:24,721
I add steamed crab meat for its filling

674
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,309
and wrap it up into a ball.

675
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,312
It's hot!

676
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,610
I deep-fry it in oil.

677
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:47,494
This makes it crispy on the outside
and chewy on the inside.

678
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,412
On top of that,

679
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,873
I braise conger eel until its tender,

680
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,042
grill it,

681
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,878
and place it on top of that dumpling.

682
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:59,131
Lotus root pairs well with conger eel.

683
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,675
I pour the sauce over

684
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:04,595
and finish by adding grated ginger on top.

685
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,934
Chef Jung Ho-young's
first dish is complete.

686
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,647
You can just cut it and eat it.

687
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:20,694
Renkon manju.

688
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,683
The lotus root still has its crunch.

689
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,521
I think it's quite difficult
to fully bring out

690
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,525
the aroma and flavor
of lotus root in a dish,

691
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,818
but that was done really well here.

692
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:02,819
Thank you.

693
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:07,032
Currently in first place
is Culinary Monster with 178 points.

694
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:11,578
Now, please reveal
Chef Jung Ho-young's score.

695
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,459
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 89 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 85 points.

696
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,796
Chef Jung Ho-young received
a total of 174 points.

697
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,257
The chef has failed to set
a new high score.

698
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,592
You brought out the flavor
and aroma of the lotus root,

699
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,970
and it paired well with the conger eel.

700
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:32,099
But dishes with a thickened sauce
made from broth like this one

701
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:35,978
are things you make often
since you specialize in Japanese cuisine.

702
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:39,982
But now, that feels like a flavor
that always goes into your dish,

703
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,942
-so it feels a bit repetitive.
-I see.

704
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,112
God, this is tough. What should I do?

705
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,074
First place has 178 points.

706
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:53,412
Chef Im Seong-keun's
third dish is complete.

707
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,211
The third dish I've prepared
is called hyojonggaeng.

708
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,214
It was Korea's first ever delivery food

709
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,675
and a hangover soup
that was enjoyed by nobles.

710
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,177
It'll really settle your stomach.

711
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,560
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 87 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 79 points.

712
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,438
Chef Im Seong-keun received
a total of 166 points.

713
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,607
The third dish I've prepared
is called hyojonggaeng.

714
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,777
Chef Im Seong-keun's
fourth dish is complete.

715
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,779
The fourth dish I've prepared

716
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,990
is cold skirt steak and ginseng salad.

717
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,962
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 83 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 70 points.

718
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,882
The chef has failed to set
a new high score.

719
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,635
Personally, I felt the mustard
was too strong.

720
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,429
The seasoning is too strong,
and it had too much garlic.

721
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,014
-Yes, thank you.
-All right.

722
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,265
-See you in a bit.
-Yes.

723
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:03,440
Why is Chef Im's cooking so rough today?

724
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,317
He's capable of doing much better.

725
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,694
-He's rushing things.
-Yes, he's being too…

726
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,575
I wasn't fazed at all.

727
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,371
Up to the fourth dish,
I didn't actually worry about the score.

728
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,040
There are so many different dishes
in Korean cuisine.

729
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,334
I wanted to show a variety of them.

730
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,003
I have something else prepared,

731
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,089
so I can turn this around at the end.

732
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,606
For my fifth dish,
I decided to go with my signature dish,

733
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,567
my special grilled garlic ribs.

734
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,696
My specialty lies
in galbi and meat dishes.

735
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,158
So I thought this dish
would be perfect for my fifth dish

736
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,701
and divided up my time accordingly.

737
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:38,303
And the highlight of this dish
is eating the ribs with Kaesong namul.

738
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:43,225
Kaesong namul is a radish side dish
that was eaten in the Kaesong region.

739
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,393
South Koreans eat radish
usually as raw namul,

740
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,231
but in Kaesong,
they blanch and stir-fry it.

741
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,400
For that sweet flavor, I use
the natural sweetness of dried persimmons.

742
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:57,948
It's tangy, sweet, and tender
but crunchy at the same time.

743
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,747
The most important thing is

744
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,709
making it all work with the garlic.

745
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,171
If you sauté minced garlic
with sesame oil,

746
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,298
it loses its pungency,

747
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,718
and its natural sweetness comes out.

748
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,937
Where is it?

749
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,856
Where's the bell?

750
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:35,235
Chef Im Seong-keun's
fifth dish is complete.

751
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,820
Chef Im Seong-keun,

752
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,739
please take your dish
and proceed to the tasting room.

753
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,792
So, this is my final dish.

754
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,878
The fifth dish I've prepared

755
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,630
is grilled garlic ribs
and Kaesong radish namul.

756
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,798
IM SEONG-KEUN'S FIFTH DISH

757
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,511
Is this your final one?

758
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,429
Yes.

759
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,307
-I'm kind of sad.
-It's really too bad.

760
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,791
It's the dish I'm most confident in,

761
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,920
so I really should get a high score.

762
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,339
It'd be great if I could get 182 points.

763
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:41,426
Currently in first place
is Culinary Monster with 178 points.

764
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,930
Please reveal Chef Im Seong-keun's score.

765
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:51,436
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 91 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 82 points.

766
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,564
Chef Im Seong-keun received
a total of 173 points.

767
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,775
The chef has failed to set
a new high score.

768
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,154
The garlic was great.

769
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:05,533
When you sauté it
to bring out that sweetness,

770
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,786
it tastes really good with the ribs.

771
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,665
In my view, what we're looking for
in this competition

772
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,041
is finesse.

773
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,751
If the dish had that touch of finesse

774
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:18,004
that just hits your palate
and sends chills through you,

775
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,507
I might've been left wondering,
"Wow, what is this?"

776
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,385
But I couldn't really feel that
with this dish.

777
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,178
When I got that score of 173 points…

778
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,557
I'm a little disappointed,

779
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:33,353
but I was able to show a lot off,
so I was very happy.

780
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,730
FIRST PLACE, CULINARY MONSTER

781
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:43,113
These are live abalone cooked in XO sauce.

782
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,824
The highlight of this dish
is using live abalone

783
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:50,495
and adding a slightly spicy kick.

784
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,835
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 88 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 83 points.

785
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,461
With a total of 171 points,

786
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,880
they have failed to set a new high score.

787
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:07,679
I made burdock root japchae
and deodeok salad with pine nut dressing.

788
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,142
VENERABLE SUNJAE'S SECOND DISH

789
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,145
With a total of 173 points,

790
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,397
they have failed to set a new high score.

791
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,774
For my second dish,

792
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,820
I basted blackthroat seaperch
with sea urchin sauce as I grilled it.

793
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,197
They have failed to set a new high score.

794
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,700
Gosh, it's a Paradise for my mouth today.

795
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,411
My mouth is in Paradise,
but my stomach is in Hell.

796
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,246
They have failed to set a new high score.

797
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,041
They have failed to set a new high score.

798
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,085
They have failed to set a new high score.

799
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,297
The dishes are coming in non-stop.

800
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,549
Is this Paradise or Hell?

801
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,301
TASTED 16 DISHES IN TOTAL SO FAR

802
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,971
My dish continued
to remain in first place,

803
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,349
but I wasn't happy with the score.

804
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,686
I was determined to do better than that
as I made my next dish.

805
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,940
I thought I needed
at least 180 points to be safe.

806
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,944
IM SEONG-KEUN
HIGHEST SCORE OF 173

807
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,989
VENERABLE SUNJAE
HIGHEST SCORE OF 173

808
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,700
JUNG HO-YOUNG
HIGHEST SCORE OF 175

809
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,411
HOU DEOK-JUK
HIGHEST SCORE OF 171

810
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:17,248
CULINARY MONSTER
HIGHEST SCORE OF 178

811
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,834
Currently, you have 20 minutes left.

812
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,754
Two of them haven't come in yet.

813
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,882
-Chef Choi Kang-rok and Brewmaster Yun.
-Right…

814
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,176
CHOI KANG-ROK
ZERO DISHES JUDGED

815
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,886
Every time a bell rings, I think…

816
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,474
"Shouldn't I be bringing mine
up there too?"

817
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,725
The mind would waver.

818
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,061
I told myself not to be self-conscious.

819
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,271
I've spent my whole life
being self-conscious.

820
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,232
I'll go at my own pace.

821
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:50,031
I decided to use the 180 minutes
to make one dish.

822
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,910
BREWMASTER YUN
ZERO DISHES JUDGED

823
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,956
I didn't pay much attention.

824
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:01,626
I didn't even look at the scores
since I just need to focus on my own dish.

825
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,545
I'll just do what I always do.

826
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:07,674
I can't do better than what I've done.
I can't be any more special today.

827
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,385
We have Korean cuisine chefs here.

828
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,388
Venerable Sunjae is
a master of temple cuisine.

829
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:17,267
Chef Im's an expert in traditional
noble cuisine and royal court cuisine.

830
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,687
So I chose to do a dish they wouldn't do.
Something only I can offer.

831
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,314
I prepared a full spread of bunsik
as a jumo, or barkeep.

832
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,753
I made tteok, or rice cakes.

833
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,550
I wanted to make tteokbokki,
but when I looked at the pantry,

834
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,885
it didn't have any tteok.

835
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,344
But I did find rice flour.

836
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:57,098
So I used non-glutinous rice flour
and tapioca starch,

837
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,309
and I kneaded them together to make tteok.

838
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:06,941
It took a long time to get
the right texture for the rice cakes.

839
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,154
The only tools I have on me are my hands.

840
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,454
For the tteokbokki I prepared today,

841
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,373
I put a lot of care
and effort into each element.

842
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:26,044
I tried to make full use
of the available time.

843
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,339
For the sauce, I added Korean gochujang

844
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,299
and two kinds of Korean chili powder.

845
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,635
SPICY KOREAN CHILI POWDER
REGULAR KOREAN CHILI POWDER

846
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,387
Then, I added rice syrup.

847
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:40,141
Rice is used throughout the dish
to give it that Korean cuisine influence.

848
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:44,145
I stir-fried some large green onions,
pyogo mushrooms, and striploin.

849
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,363
Then, I added a rich broth
of Japanese scaled sardines,

850
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,241
or dipori, with some anchovies and kelp.

851
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,786
I also added dried chili peppers
to add a touch of spiciness.

852
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,998
I kneaded the tteok mixture quite a bit,
so the tteok was nice and chewy.

853
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:13,633
But rice-based tteok
takes a while to absorb the sauce.

854
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,052
Tteokbokki is usually prepared quickly,

855
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:19,681
but I think I simmered it
for at least 20 minutes.

856
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,852
I kept simmering the sauce down,

857
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,523
adding more sauce and broth as I went

858
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,108
without using artificial seasonings.

859
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,611
It's the same kind
of tteokbokki we always have,

860
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,989
but I wanted to surprise
the judges and show them

861
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:41,536
that tteokbokki can also be made
with as much care and attention.

862
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,210
Then, I made potato jeon.

863
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,008
It's a jeon that's been
pan-fried nice and crispy.

864
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,772
It tastes like really good french fries.

865
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,693
Next, I made mukeunji rolls.

866
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,863
I added some finely chopped pork belly

867
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:17,905
and some chili peppers.

868
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,915
It's a familiar taste,

869
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,835
but I want them to say
it's a touch different since I made it.

870
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,798
COMPLETED IN 166 MINUTES

871
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:39,218
Brewmaster Yun's first dish is complete.

872
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,178
Brewmaster Yun.

873
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,429
Brewmaster Yun,

874
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,640
please take your dish
and proceed to the tasting room.

875
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,932
She staked it all on one dish.

876
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,034
The dish I prepared today is called

877
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,744
Jumo's…

878
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:06,829
bunsik.

879
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,211
JUMO'S BUNSIK
BREWMASTER YUN'S FIRST DISH

880
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,338
TTEOKBOKKI

881
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,173
MUKEUNJI ROLLS

882
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,760
CHEESE AND POTATO JEON

883
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,012
The pantry didn't have any tteok,

884
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:26,015
so I used non-glutinous rice flour
to make it myself.

885
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,214
It's good with the soy sauce dip too,

886
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:01,008
but dipping it in the tteokbokki sauce
gives a different taste.

887
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,073
What kind of cheese is inside?

888
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,617
There was
Jeju mozzarella cheese in the pantry,

889
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,245
so I added a bit of mozzarella
and cheddar cheese.

890
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,497
Cheese is a fermented food as well,

891
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,000
so for the dip accompanying the jeon,

892
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,586
I used clear soy sauce, dark soy sauce,
and aged soy sauce,

893
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,963
and I mixed them all together

894
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,715
without using any artificial seasonings.

895
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:02,111
I see you had a lot of different ideas

896
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,905
and gave them a try.

897
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:11,579
Currently in first place
is Culinary Monster with 178 points.

898
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:16,250
First place will only change hands
if a score surpasses 178 points.

899
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:27,011
Now, please reveal
Chef Brewmaster Yun's score.

900
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,517
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 96 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 84 points.

901
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,602
With a total of 180 points,

902
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,687
the chef has set a new high score.

903
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,773
With a total of 180 points,

904
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,275
the chef has set a new high score.

905
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,527
Currently in first place is

906
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,445
-Brewmaster Yun.
-Thank you!

907
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,783
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 96 points.

908
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,701
-Damn.
-Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 84 points.

909
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,037
With a total of 180 points,

910
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,997
the chef has set a new high score.

911
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,249
Damn it.

912
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,794
With a total of 180 points,

913
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,796
the chef has set a new high score.

914
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,757
Currently in first place
is Brewmaster Yun.

915
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,092
FIRST PLACE, BREWMASTER YUN

916
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,427
This combination was excellent.

917
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,304
-Your plan worked.
-Thank you.

918
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,767
And it's amazing how you thought to make
the tteok yourself. Very impressive.

919
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,520
-You're a gutsy competitor.
-I challenged myself.

920
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,398
To be honest, Brewmaster Yun
challenged herself every round.

921
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:21,858
Thank you.

922
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,359
It was as if I was hypnotized.

923
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,831
You dropped some.

924
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,043
They were pulling me right in.
All three dishes.

925
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,462
If we didn't have other dishes coming in,

926
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,839
I would've eaten everything.

927
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:49,260
With these ordinary, everyday dishes,

928
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:51,512
she created something so impressive,
and I loved that.

929
01:04:58,895 --> 01:04:59,937
I'm ahead by two points?

930
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:00,855
Oh, my god.

931
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,648
I broke the record.

932
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,192
FIRST PLACE, BREWMASTER YUN

933
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,402
Unbelievable.

934
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,071
I was annoyed I lost first place.

935
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,243
I have to keep going
until I get the highest score.

936
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,455
I'm always a bundle of nerves
until I finish.

937
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,874
Currently, you have five minutes left.

938
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,129
You must ring the bell before time is up

939
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:26,756
to have your dish judged.

940
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,800
CURRENT FIRST PLACE
BREWMASTER YUN, 180 POINTS

941
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,220
ONLY TWO DISHES REMAIN

942
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:36,432
ENDLESS COOKING PARADISE
ONE OF THESE THREE WILL BE THE WINNER

943
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,809
I need to keep my spot.

944
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:39,727
It's mine.

945
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,354
I need to get a higher score.

946
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,814
It'd be nice if I can advance.

947
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,734
Then, I'll be able to rest.

948
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,361
I ran around a lot.

949
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,462
Bell peppers…

950
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,885
Stop whining and just get moving.

951
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,097
My legs hurt now.

952
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:22,812
HE KEPT NEEDING ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS

953
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,480
In terms of establishing my plans,

954
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:27,525
as I went back and forth
to get the ingredients,

955
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,860
it came together bit by bit.

956
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:34,073
Rather than making something creative,

957
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:37,868
it was more of a culmination
of my entire cooking journey.

958
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,623
CONGER EEL

959
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,917
BLACKTHROAT SEAPERCH

960
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,586
BUTTERFISH

961
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,840
SKATE LIVER

962
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,758
ABALONE

963
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,469
PYOGO MUSHROOMS

964
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,470
BURDOCK ROOT

965
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,472
ASPARAGUS

966
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,891
There's a generous variety of ingredients.

967
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:02,893
Cooking Paradise.

968
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,980
I'm going to braise them all.

969
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:18,743
Everything in that fridge
is going to be ingredients for my braise.

970
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,166
I wanted to braise everything.

971
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,210
I'm the greedy braise man.

972
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,380
I'll braise skate liver.

973
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,383
I'll take some bits of other fish

974
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,637
and braise them with different seasonings.

975
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,973
I'll braise truffles,

976
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,267
button mushrooms, and pyogo mushrooms.

977
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:47,354
I have 180 minutes anyway,
so let's go all out with the braising.

978
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,149
Braise them all

979
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,234
until it's over.

980
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,820
PYOGO MUSHROOMS, BUTTON MUSHROOMS

981
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,865
SKATE LIVER

982
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,618
I'll braise them until the last minute,

983
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,162
and when it looks like
I'll run out of time, I'll stop.

984
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,164
ABALONE

985
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:09,752
I have to keep checking
each ingredient as it braises.

986
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,510
Every moment presents another hurdle.

987
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,136
I can't stop working.

988
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:22,848
I don't think this is Paradise.

989
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:24,934
It's hard work.

990
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:38,030
I figured taking these braises
I put time into and worked hard to make

991
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,825
and combining them into one dish
would be the best way.

992
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,589
It's sushi.

993
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,675
It's sushi with a part of me in it.

994
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:01,762
I got into the food industry,
because I liked sushi.

995
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,181
Then, I started to learn how to cook,

996
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,560
and the resulting dish
I'm presenting today is…

997
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,147
my life.

998
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,065
My version of sushi.

999
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,194
The rice contains braised burdock root.

1000
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,283
On top of that goes the eggs.

1001
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:31,375
They've been cooked a bit firmer
than scrambled eggs.

1002
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:40,176
It tastes like
a sweet Japanese rolled omelet

1003
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,928
ground down to tiny little pieces.

1004
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,309
On top goes the grilled fish…

1005
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:49,852
GRILLED BUTTERFISH MARINATED IN MISO

1006
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:51,270
…and various braises.

1007
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:55,858
The plating took 20 minutes.

1008
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:57,651
It's that kind of dish.

1009
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,863
It doesn't matter to me
what other people do

1010
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,573
or how high they score.

1011
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:03,574
I have to do well.

1012
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,952
They bring in a quality of 50,
so I only have to do 60?

1013
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,412
That's not how it works.

1014
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:09,997
I always have to do a 100.

1015
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,208
I'm someone
who always strives to do a 100.

1016
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:16,962
I had to make a dish
that was even more refined,

1017
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,714
and I focused on balance.

1018
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:21,091
I thought it'd work well
without standing out,

1019
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:24,887
so I decided to go with a white fish
and used olive flounder.

1020
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:45,032
I poached the olive flounder.

1021
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:51,956
Then, I made a sauce using mushrooms.

1022
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:56,085
I wanted to emphasize an earthy flavor,
so I used a lot of mushrooms.

1023
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:57,044
OYSTER MUSHROOMS

1024
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:00,130
I blended them together to make the sauce.

1025
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:12,768
Next is the caramelized onion compote.

1026
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,812
COMPOTE
A SWEET SAUCE OF FRUIT SIMMERED IN SYRUP

1027
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:19,275
And to enhance the flavor,
I used the olive flounder liver.

1028
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,874
I think everything should
complement each other.

1029
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,545
I tried hard not to go overboard.

1030
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:48,012
Oh, no.

1031
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,973
Time went by faster than I expected.

1032
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,231
I made it look appetizing

1033
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,025
but with plenty of variety.

1034
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,537
Currently, you have one minute left.

1035
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:22,546
Geez.

1036
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,477
Cooking time
for the Endless Cooking Paradise is over.

1037
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:39,772
FIRST PLACE, BREWMASTER YUN

1038
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:45,069
As cooking time has ended,

1039
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,236
the judges' scores

1040
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,783
will be announced in the Main Kitchen
after all tastings have been completed.

1041
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:56,914
Culinary Monster, please take your dish
and proceed to the tasting room.

1042
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:20,437
The dish I've prepared this time
is olive flounder.

1043
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,148
OLIVE FLOUNDER
CULINARY MONSTER'S THIRD DISH

1044
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,567
I poached the olive flounder in milk.

1045
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:29,863
The brown sauce underneath was made
using three kinds of mushrooms.

1046
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:30,823
On top,

1047
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,033
I made a caramelized onion compote.

1048
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,244
On the right is grilled spinach.

1049
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:37,830
I hope you enjoy.

1050
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,835
-You were first place before, but…
-Yes.

1051
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,129
You were surpassed. How did you feel?

1052
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,130
-Right.
-Were you okay?

1053
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:48,590
-Why would you ask that?
-I was a bit disappointed.

1054
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,467
Of course, I thought he'd be disappointed.

1055
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,261
-Yes, I was.
-You're so strange.

1056
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,096
-Why touch a nerve?
-Weren't you curious?

1057
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,014
-No, I wasn't. No way.
-I was.

1058
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:05,816
-That's olive flounder liver.
-I thought so.

1059
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:07,109
You should eat it together.

1060
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,195
Why did you choose olive flounder?

1061
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:56,116
The sauce and the garnishes
all have quite rich flavors,

1062
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,077
so I used a white fish that paired well,
which is olive flounder.

1063
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:03,582
Judges, please enter your score
for Culinary Monster.

1064
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,929
The judging
for Culinary Monster's dish has ended.

1065
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:18,847
Culinary Monster's score

1066
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,558
will be revealed
in the Main Kitchen shortly.

1067
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,436
I hope they give me a good score.

1068
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:38,200
Chef Choi Kang-rok,

1069
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:41,203
please take your dish
and proceed to the tasting room.

1070
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:08,981
It's sushi.

1071
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,566
Mushizushi.

1072
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:12,776
It's steamed sushi.

1073
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:17,447
MUSHIZUSHI (STEAMED SUSHI)
CHOI KANG-ROK'S FIRST DISH

1074
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:21,743
WARM, STEAMED SUSHI
A WELL-KNOWN SPECIALTY OF KYOTO, JAPAN

1075
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,663
ASPARAGUS, BELL PEPPER, LEMON PEEL,
SKATE LIVER, BELL PEPPER, ABALONE

1076
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:28,041
KELP, SHRIMP, CONGER EEL

1077
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,294
BLACKTHROAT SEAPERCH

1078
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:38,176
Please take whatever
you feel like eating first.

1079
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,970
You can scoop some out

1080
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:41,972
and have a taste.

1081
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:43,932
It's crumbled egg over rice.

1082
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,310
We don't mix it up?

1083
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:49,479
Well, it's okay to eat them separately.

1084
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,382
You cooked every ingredient separately.

1085
01:17:58,465 --> 01:17:59,966
They all taste different.

1086
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:01,635
I cooked them separately.

1087
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,019
So… I may be overstepping,

1088
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:14,606
but there's also braised kelp in there,
so if you could taste that too…

1089
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,483
-I already did.
-I see.

1090
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,985
How is that overstepping though?

1091
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,446
-You mean those stacked pieces?
-Yes.

1092
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,781
You did that on purpose, right?

1093
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,616
Yes, I wanted to give it some thickness.

1094
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:28,078
I really wanted to mention the kelp.

1095
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:31,123
KELP BRAISED IN A PRESSURE COOKER

1096
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:36,211
If you press it together
after it cools down,

1097
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:38,714
it tastes really good.

1098
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,595
I thought it'd be good
if they got to taste that kelp.

1099
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:56,523
I get why you suggested we eat that
at the risk of overstepping.

1100
01:18:56,606 --> 01:18:58,567
-Yes.
-"At the risk of overstepping"?

1101
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,278
It was absolutely necessary.

1102
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:03,363
It holds all the flavors together.
Is that right?

1103
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:05,866
It serves that purpose.

1104
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:08,410
You weren't overstepping at all.
It was essential advice.

1105
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:14,082
Judges, please enter your score
for Chef Choi Kang-rok.

1106
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,843
The judging
for Chef Choi Kang-rok's dish has ended.

1107
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:26,636
Chef Choi Kang-rok's score

1108
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,264
will be revealed
in the Main Kitchen shortly.

1109
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:34,186
When they showed hints of recognition
for all of my hard work,

1110
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:35,729
I felt hints of satisfaction.

1111
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:43,361
Now, we will announce the judges' scores
for the remaining two contestants.

1112
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:49,326
Currently, the highest score
is Brewmaster Yun's 180 points.

1113
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:53,121
First place will only change hands
if a score surpasses 180 points.

1114
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:56,708
Maybe another miracle will happen.

1115
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:02,422
Now, it is time to announce
Culinary Monster's score.

1116
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,343
If I'm going to advance,
I wanted to come in first.

1117
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:16,311
Please reveal the judges' scores.

1118
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:30,325
Judge Paik Jong-won gave 92 points.
Judge Anh Sung-jae gave 82 points.

1119
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:33,203
Culinary Monster received
a total of 174 points.

1120
01:20:33,286 --> 01:20:35,372
The chef has failed to set
a new high score.

1121
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,793
CURRENT FIRST PLACE
BREWMASTER YUN, 180 POINTS

1122
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:42,254
My goodness, it's happened again.

1123
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:45,632
There might've been better balance
with a different type of fish.

1124
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:47,217
I thought the other elements

1125
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:50,303
couldn't quite support
the main ingredient well.

1126
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:53,682
I thought, "I should prepare
for the next round."

1127
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:56,893
It doesn't matter
if I go through one round or 100 rounds.

1128
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,937
But I need to go to the finals and win.

1129
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:01,940
Now, the last contestant.

1130
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:05,318
Chef Choi Kang-rok's result

1131
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:08,697
will determine the one contestant
who will book their ticket

1132
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,031
to the finals first.

1133
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:14,578
Currently in first place
is Brewmaster Yun with 180 points.

1134
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:21,376
I just wanted time
to go by a little faster.

1135
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:24,254
The wait is just too nerve-racking.

1136
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:28,133
I kept looking up there
and imagining myself moving up.

1137
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:30,760
I want to get up there.

1138
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:39,603
Now, please reveal
Chef Choi Kang-rok's score.

1139
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,025
PAIK JONG-WON, ANH SUNG-JAE

1140
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:47,652
Chef Choi Kang-rok. With a total of…

01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:54,779
