1
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:11,720
In this Endless Cooking Hell,
the final survivor is…

2
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,766
If he did that intentionally,
he really is a monster.

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,811
They were all there just for the carrots.

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,481
The final survivor is…

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,074
Black Spoon Chef Culinary Monster.
Congratulations.

6
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,495
CULINARY MONSTER SURVIVES

7
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,629
HOU DEOK-JUK ELIMINATED

8
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,803
-They both did an excellent job.
-Yes, you're right.

9
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,972
-But in terms of creativity…
-On a creative level…

10
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,100
-This one is slightly better.
-By just a hair.

11
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,603
The yuxiang carrots were really good.
They were delicious.

12
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,689
But there's a dish called
yuxiang eggplant in Chinese cuisine,

13
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,691
and it was quite similar to that.

14
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,859
It didn't deviate enough.

15
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,611
By just a razor thin margin,

16
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:14,657
that carrot dessert
made more of an impact on us.

17
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,370
Chef Hou has been cooking
since long before I was even born.

18
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,915
I'm truly honored,
and I respect him so much.

19
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,794
I'll make sure to be thoroughly prepared
in order to win.

20
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,878
Thank you.

21
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,133
I was able to cook alongside
so many talented young chefs,

22
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,053
and I made it this far today.

23
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:40,683
At first, there were 100 chefs here,

24
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,353
and many of them were my mentees.

25
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,483
It felt like a festival for chefs,
and it made me very happy.

26
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,238
We were all competing
and battling hard to win,

27
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:58,576
and I got to see many
of my former mentees and junior chefs,

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,037
so it felt very nice in a way.

29
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,626
Making it to the top three

30
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:11,548
is something I'm personally proud of,
and it's been an honor.

31
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,302
You were incredible, Chef.

32
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,804
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

33
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,514
-You did great.
-Well done.

34
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,723
Thank you.

35
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:26,980
I've been cooking for 57 years,
and it looks like I haven't lost my touch.

36
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,149
I still have what it takes.

37
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,317
I'm proud of myself.

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,822
I'm happy, and it feels great
to see a younger chef advance.

39
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:40,910
HOU DEOK-JUK

40
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,539
…begins now.

41
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,751
You've survived.

42
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,129
-Congratulations.
-What?

43
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,338
You've survived.

44
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,842
Thank you.

45
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,094
-Culinary Monster has survived.
-Thank you.

46
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,637
-It was delicious.
-Thank you.

47
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,141
Hidden White Spoon
Chef Choi Kang-rok has survived.

48
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,769
This round is a one-on-one
Black Spoon versus White Spoon Face-off.

49
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,064
White Spoon Chef Son Jong-won.

50
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,817
Black Spoon Chef Rebellious Genius.

51
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,283
The Black and White Spoons' Team Battle,
All or Nothing.

52
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,042
Oh, my gosh!

53
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,589
The Two-Person Team Black
and White Spoon Alliance Battle.

54
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,091
The one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle.

55
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,426
They're turning.

56
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,928
They're turning around!

57
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,430
Chef Hou Deok-juk survives.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,474
Thank you.

59
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,187
Endless Cooking Paradise.

60
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,023
Endless Cooking Hell.

61
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,484
The chef eliminated is Im Seong-keun.

62
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,027
Venerable Sunjae.

63
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,488
Brewmaster Yun.

64
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,198
Jung Ho-young.

65
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,992
Black Spoon Chef Culinary Monster.
Congratulations.

66
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,205
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

67
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,166
Great work.

68
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,585
I'm sorry I'm the one here.

69
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,631
Goodness.

70
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,967
And with this,

71
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,845
the top two chefs to advance
to the final round have been decided.

72
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,514
Choi Kang-rok.

73
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,307
Culinary Monster.

74
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,810
I'm almost there.

75
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,854
To make sure I won't have any regrets,

76
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,481
I'll give it my all.

77
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,401
I wanted to advance, no matter what.
I just had to.

78
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,902
I'm going to win.

79
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,612
Let's do our best.

80
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,302
Korea's top 100 chefs gathered

81
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,346
to determine
the ultimate culinary champion

82
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,764
in the culinary battle

83
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,100
of Culinary Class Wars.

84
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,688
And here today,

85
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,567
the top two chefs
who have advanced to the finals

86
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,194
will engage in one last culinary battle.

87
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,799
Now, it's time to introduce the Top Two
who have made it to the final round.

88
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,180
-Who will it be?
-Who are they?

89
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,307
The first finalist is…

90
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,642
White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok.

91
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,524
CHOI KANG-ROK

92
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,442
I'm getting chills.

93
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,527
Actual goosebumps.

94
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,574
Choi Kang-rok's been up there twice now.

95
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,960
Looking good!

96
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,675
That's really impressive.

97
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,762
I'm Chef Choi Kang-rok.

98
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,767
I always get nervous.

99
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,186
The final round of a competition.

100
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,730
It's the second one I've had in my life.

101
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,941
But do I belong here?

102
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,236
I feel embarrassed.

103
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,988
I may not belong here as a person.

104
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,406
But in terms of cooking,

105
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,327
I will do my best to make a dish
deserving of this stage.

106
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,747
You're almost there.

107
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,082
-Almost there.
-Good luck.

108
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,250
You need to win now.

109
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,507
The second finalist is…

110
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,843
Black Spoon Chef Culinary Monster.

111
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,226
CULINARY MONSTER

112
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,440
Monster!

113
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,661
-We're so proud of you.
-Well done!

114
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,788
It's time to reveal his name.

115
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,917
As Black Spoon Chef Culinary Monster
has made it to the final round,

116
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,921
he will now be called by his real name.

117
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,299
Please reveal your name.

118
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,134
Gosh, this is pretty cool.

119
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,306
Hello, my name is Chef Lee Ha-sung.

120
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,102
CULINARY MONSTER

121
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,188
LEE HA-SUNG

122
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,607
We can call him by his name now.

123
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,652
I'm not someone who's well-known.

124
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,947
I really did all I could do to survive
when I first went abroad.

125
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,868
I believe that struggle has paid off
and enabled me to stand here today.

126
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,038
Good job!

127
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,916
I've never seen him smile so brightly.

128
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,591
Ever since I entered this competition,
I said my goal was to win.

129
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,343
And now, there's just one round left.

130
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,595
Chef Choi, I'll be taking the win.

131
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,556
Right here today,

132
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,476
after fierce culinary class wars,

133
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,436
the final winner

134
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,482
of the prize of 300 million won
will be determined.

135
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,150
Gosh, 300 million won.

136
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,112
That much money doesn't come around often.

137
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,492
We will now reveal the theme
of the final battle

138
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,662
that will determine the winner.

139
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,207
The theme of the final round is…

140
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,671
Just One Dish For Myself.

141
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,632
-Oh, my gosh.
-"For myself."

142
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,884
The two chefs who have reached the finals

143
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:17,139
have always cooked
for others up to this point.

144
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,975
In this last round,

145
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,562
you will create your best dish

146
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,773
for just yourself and no one else.

147
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,945
I find this kind of theme difficult.

148
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,780
"For myself"? It's so difficult.

149
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:37,535
If you're someone who cooks for a living

150
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,538
and you try to make a dish for yourself?

151
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,331
It's not easy.

152
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,458
"A dish for myself."

153
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,876
That's hard.

154
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,254
-I've never cooked for myself before.
-Right?

155
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,798
-I've never even thought about that.
-Exactly.

156
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,758
Surprisingly, people who cook

157
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,386
aren't very good
at cooking for themselves.

158
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:59,140
While I've devoted
all of my skills, effort, and time

159
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,891
into cooking for other people,

160
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,270
I've never once imagined
doing that for myself.

161
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,355
What does that even mean?

162
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,567
I think everyone in this line of work
would feel the same way.

163
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,237
"What kind of care and attention
can I put into myself?"

164
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,197
That's the sort of difficult question

165
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,825
they'll have to ask themselves
in this mission.

166
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,328
I wonder how they'll judge this.

167
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,873
Once each chef has finished
cooking their dish,

168
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,083
they will make their way
to the judges' table

169
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,297
and taste the dish they prepared
along with the judges.

170
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,842
Once the tasting is over,

171
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,803
the judges will decide the final winner.

172
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,639
For the final round,

173
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,684
the winner must be determined

174
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,023
by the judges' unanimous decision.

175
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,110
That's so brutal.

176
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,112
That's intense.

177
00:10:55,196 --> 00:11:00,284
The battle will end when both judges
come to a unanimous decision.

178
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:04,830
However, if the judges
do not reach a unanimous decision,

179
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,917
a rematch will be held.

180
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,254
REMATCHES WILL BE HELD
UNTIL A UNANIMOUS DECISION IS REACHED

181
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,048
It's like Cooking Hell for myself.

182
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,300
-We could be here all night.
-This is crazy.

183
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,927
I wonder what they'll cook.

184
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,596
I'll do my best and win one final time

185
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,057
to prove myself once and for all

186
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,351
to not only the judges

187
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,020
but also to all of the chefs present here.

188
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,858
-You can do it!
-He's full of confidence.

189
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,860
I'm almost there.

190
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,657
I'll break through the illusions
and finally get there.

191
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,783
Thank you.

192
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,833
The final round's

193
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,962
Just One Dish For Myself battle…

194
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,423
begins now.

195
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,883
FINAL ROUND
COOKING BEGINS

196
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,093
-Good luck!
-You can do it!

197
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,471
Let's go all the way!

198
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,894
They must be so nervous.

199
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,735
-He must be nervous.
-He has a lot on his mind.

200
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,114
Culinary Monster doesn't get nervous.

201
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,542
He must be making a broth.

202
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,258
Damn it.

203
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,136
-Ha-sung, the other way.
-The other way?

204
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,637
-The other way.
-It's the other way.

205
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,640
-Why won't it work?
-Oh, no.

206
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,684
What's wrong with this?

207
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,771
-He can't close the pressure cooker.
-Oh, no.

208
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,232
I don't know what happened.
It closed fine during practice.

209
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,276
-That's not it.
-Lift it up.

210
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,236
Yeah, turn it that way.

211
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,154
-That way.
-Close it.

212
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,822
-Click it shut. You did it!
-He got it.

213
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:02,907
There you go!

214
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,533
-Click it shut. You did it!
-He got it.

215
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,576
There you go!

216
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,286
All he did was close a lid.

217
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,622
Why am I this happy
about closing a pressure cooker?

218
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,499
He's basically won.

219
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,461
All he did was move the pressure cooker
and he got applauded.

220
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,881
You should move something too, Kang-rok.

221
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,599
That's so funny.

222
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,519
He got applause
for closing a pressure cooker lid.

223
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,270
-He must be really nervous.
-He's nervous.

224
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,606
-Really nervous.
-Of course, he would be.

225
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,318
-There's so much pressure.
-Exactly.

226
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,947
It's all the same if you lose.
You're left with nothing.

227
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,990
A dish for myself?

228
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,867
-I wonder what they'll make.
-Exactly.

229
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,536
I can't wait to see their dishes.

230
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,457
Essentially, a dish for myself…

231
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,126
just has to be anything
that's made for me.

232
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,962
This is pretty much…

233
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,714
like an MMORPG.

234
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,342
It's like I've been given
an immense freedom.

235
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,012
I think I can have fun
and be as creative as I want.

236
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,225
What's Kang-rok doing?

237
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,604
I think Chef Choi Kang-rok
will probably do a braise.

238
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,190
It's what he's best at.

239
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,109
His nickname is "Mr. Braise."

240
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,694
He'll probably do a braise.

241
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,903
I bet he'll do a braise.

242
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:25,990
"Mr. Braise."

243
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,909
"The Serial Braiser."

244
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,953
I'm the greedy braise man.

245
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,580
HIDDEN WHITE SPOON ELIMINATION ROUND

246
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,789
I'll braise it.

247
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,125
BLACK SPOON VERSUS WHITE SPOON FACE-OFF

248
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,418
And then, I braise them.

249
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,919
I braise some monkfish.

250
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,254
ONE-ON-ONE LIFE-OR-DEATH BATTLE

251
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,839
ENDLESS COOKING PARADISE

252
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,841
I'm going to braise them all.

253
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,135
I'll braise skate liver.

254
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,262
I'll take some bits of other fish
and braise them.

255
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,639
I'll braise truffles.

256
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,765
Braise them all…

257
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,435
until it's over.

258
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,687
The Braise Man…

259
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,689
needs to rest now.

260
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,233
It's a dish for myself,

261
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,861
so I can't do another braise for this too.

262
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,323
Ingredients that I like

263
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,659
and flavors that moved me.

264
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,956
I think it'd be nice to add those elements
here and there to highlight them.

265
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,379
It's a soup with sesame tofu,

266
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,882
but it's just thrown together.

267
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,681
-What did he just add?
-Arrowroot starch.

268
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,475
-What?
-Arrowroot starch.

269
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,060
For the sesame tofu,

270
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,188
I mix sesame paste and starch together.

271
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,193
Then, I stir patiently until it thickens.

272
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,074
-Will he leave that to set?
-That will firm up like gelatin.

273
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,160
If you keep cooking it in the pot,
it becomes jelly-like.

274
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,371
But is something like that
also called tofu?

275
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,706
-Even without soybeans?
-It doesn't matter.

276
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,916
Even without soybeans,

277
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,961
anything that's been set
is called tofu in Japanese cuisine.

278
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,048
He chose a dish
that takes a while to make.

279
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,938
That really put a strain on your arm.

280
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,274
Between that and whipping a meringue,
that's much harder.

281
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,778
-Is it because it's thicker?
-Yeah, that's right.

282
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,822
That requires strength,

283
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,157
and you have to keep putting it
on and off the heat

284
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,034
so it doesn't stick to the pan.

285
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,163
I think it's getting thicker.

286
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,833
No, you need to do it
until it turns clear.

287
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,084
-Completely?
-Yes.

288
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,962
-That's a ton of work.
-Exactly.

289
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,882
It's so simple for a final round dish.

290
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:49,967
-That one?
-Yes.

291
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,302
He's not going for anything fancy.

292
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,848
Chef Choi is once again
not using a lot of equipment this time.

293
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,810
He's using oil and charcoal.

294
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,479
And a pressure cooker and a dough mixer.

295
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,356
-He has a lot of equipment.
-Yeah.

296
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,316
He must have something special ready.

297
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,613
-Chef Lee Ha-sung.
-Hello.

298
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,823
We should use your name now.

299
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,575
What's your dish today?

300
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,618
Today, I'm making sundaeguk.

301
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,120
Sundaeguk?

302
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,955
-He says he's making sundaeguk.
-Sundaeguk.

303
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,582
But sundaeguk is Korean cuisine.

304
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,709
I know how to make everything.

305
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,378
Gosh, that's… Right, that's your style.

306
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,921
That confidence.

307
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,466
I have a feeling
there's a story behind this.

308
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,304
As a child, I'd go to the bathhouse
every Sunday morning with my dad.

309
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,557
After bathing, we'd go eat sundaeguk,
or blood sausage soup.

310
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,393
So sundaeguk is my comfort food.

311
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,438
If I had to pick one dish
to make for myself,

312
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,398
it'd be sundaeguk.

313
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,859
He picked a great dish.

314
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,987
Is he going to make the sundae?

315
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,492
-No way. He can't.
-Then, how can you have sundaeguk?

316
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,622
What's that?

317
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,582
-Isn't that instant rice?
-Yes.

318
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,127
-Rice?
-I think it's rice.

319
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,295
He's adding rice.

320
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,505
INSTANT GLUTINOUS RICE

321
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,009
MINCED PORK

322
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,387
If I make real sundae using intestines,

323
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,057
it won't feel like my own dish.

324
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,354
I decided to present
sundaeguk in my own style.

325
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,355
CARROTS

326
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,122
What is he sautéing?

327
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,082
You don't usually sauté
when making sundae.

328
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,418
I sautéed them in a pan
to remove the moisture.

329
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,004
I take that mixture of sautéed vegetables…

330
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,009
-That's blood, right?
-Yes, it's seonji.

331
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,095
And I add pork blood.

332
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,389
DOUGH MIXER

333
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,266
I mix everything thoroughly in the mixer.

334
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,269
-He's making the sundae filling.
-Yeah, that's the filling.

335
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,063
-He's making it? You're right.
-He's making it.

336
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,315
He chose a difficult dish.

337
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,401
He's making the sundae himself.

338
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,571
My father and I
are from Daegu, Gyeongsang Province.

339
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,199
In Daegu, they dip sundae in ssamjang.

340
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,451
So I added ssamjang to season it.

341
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,289
They eat a lot of Korean mint
and Sichuan pepper in Gyeongsang.

342
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,543
So I added Korean mint
and Sichuan pepper powder to the sundae.

343
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,340
I think it'll have
a lot of very Korean flavors.

344
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,012
I made my own version of sundaeguk.

345
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,981
He just made some sundae.

346
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,232
-Right.
-And with that sundae,

347
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,945
instead of filling the casing with it,
he put it in a tray.

348
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,490
He blended
all the sundae ingredients together,

349
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,951
and then formed it into squares.

350
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,374
-I guess he'll cook them like that.
-I see. That's cool.

351
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,754
I'll wrap them in plastic
and steam them in the oven.

352
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,965
I knew he wouldn't just make
ordinary sundaeguk.

353
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,301
He's making a fine dining-style sundae.

354
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,971
That'll be interesting.
That's the important element.

355
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,980
He's been stirring that
for 20 minutes now.

356
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,024
That's all he's doing.

357
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,530
My goodness.

358
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,659
Chef Choi Kang-rok just keeps on stirring.

359
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,411
I don't think this is a dish for himself.

360
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,497
-His arm must hurt so much.
-Because his arm hurts!

361
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,874
I wish I could stir it for him.

362
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,752
That really strains your arm.
I want to stir it for him.

363
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,589
Will he be okay with time?
He only has 90 minutes.

364
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,136
I was under constant pressure.

365
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,182
What do I do?
What if this eats up all of my time?

366
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,478
If I spend too much time on this step,

367
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,397
the rest will become delayed.

368
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,109
Seriously, he has to
stir that for a while.

369
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,446
He's really putting in a lot of effort.

370
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,994
He's focusing everything
into just one thing.

371
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,871
After stirring for a while,

372
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,748
you eventually feel it.

373
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,667
It's ready.

374
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,337
He's done now.

375
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,381
-He's done.
-There it goes.

376
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,799
He's pouring it in.

377
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,386
It looks like Choi Kang-rok
has finished stirring.

378
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,808
Now, he cools it down.

379
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,235
The timing of both of their steps
are similar right now.

380
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:04,364
He's making tofu here,
and that's basically blood tofu.

381
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,241
I wonder what he'll make next.

382
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,784
-Exactly.
-After this step?

383
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,706
He must be making a broth.

384
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,877
He's taking the time to do it properly.

385
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,880
I think two things are important here.

386
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,758
The sesame tofu and the broth.

387
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,097
There's no recipe.

388
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:34,603
Honestly, it's just a broth
I created from my memories.

389
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,647
-What are those?
-Chicken leg bones?

390
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,316
Is he making chicken stock?

391
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,490
He's added pyogo mushrooms
and chicken bones to katsuobushi broth.

392
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,033
For that savory taste.

393
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,035
-All the savory flavors.
-Just an explosion.

394
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,204
He's brought out lard.

395
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,123
What is he cooking in lard?

396
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,085
I think they're pine mushrooms.

397
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,840
He added large green onions too.

398
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,177
He's putting a lot of effort
into the broth.

399
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,013
He's building so many layers
on top of the base broth.

400
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,933
The taste of that broth
must be extraordinary.

401
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,061
Is this chicken bone broth?

402
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,022
This is my broth.

403
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,901
Your broth.

404
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,946
That'll be packed with savoriness.

405
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,824
That broth over there.

406
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,035
Sundaeguk is all about the pork broth.

407
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,249
That smell of suyuk.

408
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,918
Pork leg bones, other pork bones,

409
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,254
pork large intestine,
pork meat, and pork fat.

410
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,799
I boil them all together
to make the broth.

411
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,469
After making the broth, I strain it

412
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,472
and add a lot of green onions and garlic.

413
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,226
Then, I'm going to reduce it
to intensify the flavor.

414
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,186
It's concentrated.

415
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,272
-It's doubled.
-The flavor is doubled.

416
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,524
There's no way that wouldn't taste good.

417
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,861
I want to taste each of their broths.

418
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:10,699
It feels like this whole space
is filled with aromas and smells.

419
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,536
When you cross over to the other side,
the aroma changes completely.

420
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,913
-It's completely different.
-Yes, totally different.

421
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:21,251
They're doing exactly
what the other isn't doing.

422
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,004
One is dashi,
and the other is pork bone broth.

423
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,964
-One is really clean.
-Right.

424
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,716
The other one's really rich.

425
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,343
I think they'll be delicious.

426
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,515
He must be grilling something.

427
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,604
PORK LARGE INTESTINE

428
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,565
I'm going to make an offal salad.

429
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:47,861
That looks delicious.

430
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,488
Charcoal-grilled pork large intestine?

431
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,033
-That would definitely taste good.
-Of course.

432
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,618
What's that?

433
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,535
SMALL INTESTINE

434
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,786
-Small intestine.
-Yeah.

435
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,290
-God, I bet that'll be delicious.
-Exactly.

436
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,836
I wanted to give it that smoky flavor
from charcoal grilling.

437
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,925
What's he doing now?

438
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,846
Usually, we add
perilla seed powder to sundaeguk.

439
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:19,267
Instead of that, I lightly roasted
whole perilla seeds to enhance the aroma.

440
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,560
WHOLE PERILLA SEEDS

441
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:21,978
GARLIC CHIVES

442
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,980
He's using everything
that goes into sundaeguk.

443
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,899
But he's adding his own techniques.

444
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,442
SALTED SHRIMP

445
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,323
The large intestine will be tender.

446
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,327
And the small intestine will be chewy.

447
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,587
I'm going to make the offal salad
and layer it on the bottom.

448
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,134
Gosh, I bet that's really delicious.

449
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,055
It's interesting to see
a fine dining chef make sundaeguk.

450
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,098
Right?

451
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,726
He's also someone who always has
a surprise or two up his sleeve.

452
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,231
-What's that green vegetable he's using?
-Pumpkin leaves.

453
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,775
Pumpkin leaves? What will he do with them?

454
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,032
-Is that sea urchin?
-Yes.

455
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,584
Wrapping sea urchin inside a pumpkin leaf?

456
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,044
That's interesting.

457
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,132
Would it pair well with them?

458
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,009
Those pumpkin leaves?

459
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,760
Uni and pumpkin leaves…

460
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,014
I'm curious about the uni
and pumpkin leaf pairing.

461
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,436
Aren't those snap peas?

462
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,687
TYPE OF PEAS WITH EDIBLE PODS

463
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,397
Aren't those green onions?

464
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,358
They're pine mushrooms.

465
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,033
I have no idea what he's making.

466
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,537
That combination is…

467
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,372
It's something I've never seen before.

468
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,126
They're all things I like.

469
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,046
I'm prepping ingredients I like

470
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,465
one by one.

471
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,259
What's he making?

472
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,763
-Well, we're still not sure yet.
-Still?

473
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,141
I cook Japanese cuisine,
so I can kind of tell when I see it.

474
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,226
But with this, I have no idea.

475
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,773
It's coming out now!

476
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,444
I'm really curious about that.

477
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,322
How has he interpreted it?

478
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,951
-What's that?
-Sundae.

479
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,244
I see. Finally.

480
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,622
-That's the sundae.
-I see.

481
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,167
He's shaping them now.

482
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,929
It's literally a type of sausage, so…

483
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,181
FLOUR

484
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:06,684
I form them into shapes of sliced sundae
and pan-fry them in perilla oil.

485
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,192
He's lightly searing them in the pan

486
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,735
-to bring out the aroma.
-Right.

487
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,278
And make them a bit crispy.

488
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,073
He really is good.

489
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,952
It'll taste like sundaeguk,
but he's deconstructed the dish.

490
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,706
He keeps adding special things in there,
layering one on top of another.

491
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,500
It's incredible.

492
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,503
You could charge 48,000 won for that.

493
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,089
No, that's worth 300 million won.

494
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,049
You're right. It's 300 million won.

495
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,885
This is a sundaeguk
you won't find anywhere else.

496
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,769
The sesame tofu is ready.

497
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,317
It's in the best possible condition
to use right now.

498
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,997
That tofu turned out really well.

499
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,332
-Yeah, it came out well.
-The texture looks great.

500
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,918
I guess the tofu turned out well.

501
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,223
I'd really like to taste it.

502
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:32,187
-How will he put this dish together?
-Exactly. What on earth is that?

503
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,314
What is it?

504
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,692
What could it be?

505
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,869
Currently, you have ten minutes left.

506
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:51,873
But seriously,

507
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,334
when I'm here,
I'm curious about over there.

508
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,044
When I'm there, I'm curious about here.

509
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,755
It's better to finish quickly.

510
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,300
It's best to finish warm dishes quickly.

511
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,182
He's putting it on the bottom.

512
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,353
I prepared a lot for this,
and I'm also confident.

513
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,233
I think I'm going to win.

514
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,737
Great job!

515
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,239
-Let's go.
-Awesome job.

516
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,198
Let's go.

517
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:27,784
Well done.

518
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:37,085
If there were a place that specialized
in making and selling this dish,

519
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,255
you might find yourself a bit puzzled.

520
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,052
Putting the judging aside,

521
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,305
I made this dish
while only thinking of myself.

522
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,519
I tried my best, so I have no regrets.

523
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,441
Great job.

524
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,486
Well done.

525
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,407
The final round is now over.

526
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,035
You were both amazing!

527
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,250
That young fellow is very impressive.

528
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,587
-If it tastes good, he will probably…
-Exactly.

529
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,634
Will it taste good?

530
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,053
I think this flavor will be more subtle.

531
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,848
-I bet that one has a really bold flavor.
-Exactly.

532
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,559
-In a tasty, straightforward way.
-An intense flavor.

533
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,852
A really intense flavor.

534
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,687
It's hard to tell with Chef Choi's dish.

535
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,524
The two dishes
are completely different in style.

536
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,486
Even the energies they each give off
are completely different.

537
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,740
They're so different.

538
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,950
-They have different vibes.
-Yes, very different.

539
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,872
Chef Lee Ha-sung's dish
will be judged first.

540
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,249
Please head up to the judges' table.

541
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:02,962
Looking good!

542
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,589
Looking great out there!

543
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,174
Let's go!

544
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,384
If I can pass this last hurdle, I win.

545
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,928
So I need to do well.

546
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,893
It's not over yet, but I think I'll win.

547
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,064
Mind if I join you?

548
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,900
Are they tasting it together?
That's so cool.

549
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,109
Great job today.

550
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,780
-They're eating together.
-He must be so nervous.

551
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:35,536
Please serve the one dish
made just for Chef Lee Ha-sung.

552
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,179
It's very fancy.

553
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,644
They're eating Korean sundaeguk,
but they've been given fork and knives.

554
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,813
So, this is completely unexpected.

555
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,652
First, it's an honor to be able
to dine with you at the same table.

556
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,653
Oh, come now.

557
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,489
Seriously, I don't know if I'll ever get
a chance like this again.

558
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,909
The dish I've prepared today is sundaeguk.

559
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,662
SUNDAEGUK

560
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:18,705
On the bottom,

561
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:22,625
there's tender large intestine
and small intestine.

562
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,629
I tossed them
into a kind of an offal salad.

563
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,008
On top is the sundae
I made in my own style.

564
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:34,053
I like Sichuan pepper and Korean mint,
so I added a generous amount.

565
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,431
On top of that is a crumble
made from salted shrimp.

566
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,598
SALTED SHRIMP CRUMBLE

567
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,185
On the side, you have pork rind chicharrón
and garlic chive powder.

568
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,311
CRISPY FRIED PORK SKIN

569
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:46,733
And you have the broth.
Please pour in as much as you like.

570
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,027
So we pour the broth in like this?

571
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,778
Yes, since it's sundaeguk,

572
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,115
-you should eat it as a soup.
-Can we eat without it at first?

573
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,533
-You can.
-Or add the broth first?

574
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,868
You can add it from the start.

575
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,619
There's a lot of elements.

576
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,165
I'm so curious.
I wonder what the story behind it is.

577
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,296
Why did you want
to make this dish for yourself?

578
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,924
There's a bit of a story to this.

579
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:15,011
Through elementary school,

580
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,931
my father would take me
to a bathhouse every Sunday morning.

581
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,142
Back then, I hated it.

582
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,518
Yes, children hate it.

583
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:27,065
He'd always scrub me so hard
with an exfoliating towel.

584
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,608
It'd hurt so much, and I hated it.

585
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,235
But there was
a sundaeguk place downstairs.

586
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,323
So our bathhouse routine would always
consist of scrubbing ourselves clean

587
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,950
and then going to eat sundaeguk.

588
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,744
When you enter the sundaeguk place,

589
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:43,331
you'd smell this pungent aroma
of simmering pork broth.

590
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,168
My father would always buy
sundaeguk for me as a reward.

591
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,714
The two of us would eat
that hot soup together.

592
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,133
I remember doing that every weekend.

593
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,261
It brings back fond memories.

594
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,639
He must remember it vividly.

595
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,391
My dad and I ate sundaeguk
after the bathhouse too.

596
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,018
He's the same as me.

597
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,855
Back in my day, it was banana milk
when we'd go to the bathhouse.

598
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:11,859
But when I was 21 years old,

599
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,072
I started living abroad.

600
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,991
I traveled back and forth
between Europe and the US,

601
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,828
but I didn't have a place to settle down.

602
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,748
Going and adjusting to new cities,

603
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,458
not speaking the language,

604
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,710
and struggling to find restaurant jobs…

605
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,339
That's how I've gotten by in life
up to this point.

606
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,717
In those moments, I'd think of sundaeguk.

607
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,303
So whenever I visit Korea,

608
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,682
sundaeguk is the first dish
that comes to mind.

609
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,184
So…

610
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,521
When you're abroad,
you really miss sundaeguk.

611
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,189
It hits you right here.

612
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,400
Yeah, it's really moving.

613
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,695
-Today's theme is "a dish for myself."
-Yes.

614
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,698
So say a few words to yourself,
whatever they may be.

615
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,909
In your life as a chef,

616
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,912
you're now ending
the first chapter of your career

617
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,582
and starting Chapter Two
as you prepare your own restaurant.

618
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:11,586
I hope you continue growing
and improving as a chef.

619
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,881
He's even making demands of himself.

620
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,341
Instead of praise,
you're telling yourself to work harder?

621
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,010
I'm the type who likes the pressure.

622
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,054
In terms of pure skill,

623
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,682
I think I have a long way to go.

624
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,810
He could've patted himself on the back,

625
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,354
but he always thinks
he needs to do better.

626
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,899
-He's always pushing himself.
-I want to give him a hug.

627
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,275
-Right.
-I wish I could.

628
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,737
-Thank you for your dish.
-Please enjoy.

629
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,988
A dish for Lee Ha-sung.

630
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,406
Please enjoy.

631
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,328
The smell makes me so hungry.

632
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,789
-I'll try it as is first.
-Please eat.

633
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,209
I was really curious
about how the sundae would be done.

634
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,102
It really is sundae.

635
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,208
It's completely different with the broth.

636
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,710
The way I see it,

637
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,630
sundaeguk has that unique flavor
when the sundae bursts open.

638
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,798
Damn it.

639
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,341
-Gosh, I'm hungry.
-No, I mean…

640
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,469
It must be really delicious.

641
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,430
-They're trying it with the soup too.
-They're really savoring it.

642
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,015
He keeps nodding.

643
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,268
That looks like a good sign.

644
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,868
He must be so nervous.

645
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:12,999
No appetite?

646
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,668
No, not really.

647
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,880
-With every spoonful…
-Yes?

648
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,633
I'm reminded that this is sundaeguk,

649
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,137
but there's also
a certain refined touch in here.

650
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,015
And my thoughts keep going
back and forth between those two.

651
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:33,394
You've managed to retain that originality

652
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,938
while expertly showcasing
a subtle balance of flavors.

653
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,064
Thank you.

654
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,860
That reward after the bathhouse.

655
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,904
I can understand that
through the flavors in this dish.

656
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,073
I feel like I just had a bath.

657
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,453
If you did bathe beforehand,
this would taste much better.

658
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,496
No, it's delicious even without a bath.

659
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,793
Judge Paik Jong-won
seems to be really enjoying it.

660
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,962
The feedback's pretty good.

661
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,301
-They're eating all of it.
-They're finishing it.

662
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,181
He's scraping the bowl.

663
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,141
Dishes like that are impressive.

664
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,479
-This will be a landslide for Ha-sung.
-Right?

665
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,732
It must be delicious.
I'd really like a taste.

666
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,150
I think he might win this.

667
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,072
Thank you for the dish.

668
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,907
-Great work.
-Thank you.

669
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,908
Thank you.

670
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,661
Thank you.

671
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,622
Well done.

672
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,040
Great job!

673
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,793
-Excellent job.
-Well done!

674
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,755
He didn't eat much of it.

675
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,173
-What?
-He couldn't eat.

676
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,841
As if he could.

677
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,511
That left quite an impression.

678
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,054
Right?

679
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,725
Gosh, to think he would interpret
sundaeguk like that.

680
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,647
This is really hard to tell.

681
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,776
Their vibes are so different,
so I wonder what will happen.

682
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,653
He's really amazing.

683
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,780
He's advanced every round
since the first one.

684
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,573
If Chef Choi Kang-rok wins,

685
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,034
it means fortune
really does favor the bold.

686
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:16,080
Chef Choi Kang-rok,
please head up to the judges' table.

687
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,501
Let's go!

688
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,839
-Good luck!
-You got this!

689
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,091
-Good luck!
-You can do it!

690
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,468
I feel like I worked really hard,

691
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,929
so I feel a bit emotional too.

692
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,940
-Well done today.
-Thank you.

693
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,483
-Great work, Chef.
-Thank you.

694
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:49,655
Please serve the one dish
made just for Chef Choi Kang-rok.

695
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,760
It's a soup with sesame tofu.

696
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,305
SOUP WITH SESAME TOFU

697
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,516
But I made it the way I wanted.

698
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,771
To be honest, for a dish made for myself,

699
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,940
I didn't want to do anything hard.

700
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,400
However,

701
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:30,529
since I was given 90 minutes,
as a means of self-evaluation,

702
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,490
I decided to make sesame tofu.

703
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,910
I have this really fond memory
from a while back

704
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,371
of eating sesame tofu in a hot soup.

705
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,582
Teaching me to have grit

706
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,545
and to not grow lazy or complacent

707
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,547
was what this sesame tofu did.

708
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,257
-It's a really hard process.
-Really?

709
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,052
He used the term "self-evaluation."

710
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:57,139
And I filled the dish
with ingredients I like.

711
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,517
PINE MUSHROOM, SNAP PEA,
PUMPKIN LEAF, UNI, SESAME TOFU

712
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,563
It may not be to your liking though.

713
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,109
I like udon broth.

714
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:13,197
The things I experienced
from my restaurant are in this broth.

715
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:17,660
I'd grill and add leftover chicken bones
to the broth to make use of them.

716
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,498
I'd also add a bunch of green onions

717
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,832
to cure my hangover.

718
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,380
I also mixed in katsuobushi broth
and made what I felt like making.

719
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,635
Why did you want
to make this dish for yourself?

720
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,556
I'm…

721
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,225
a braise man.

722
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,309
Yes.

723
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,270
So…

724
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,148
I once won a competition before.

725
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,902
Back then, I made a lot of braised dishes.

726
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,488
"The Braise Man."

727
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,532
"Serial Braiser."

728
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,117
"Mr. Braise."

729
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,203
I picked up those nicknames along the way,

730
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,747
so even though I wasn't good at braises,

731
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,958
I pretended I was.

732
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,590
To be honest, I studied a lot too.

733
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,385
I did put in a lot of effort,

734
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,599
but I still spent parts of my life
trying to keep up this appearance.

735
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,937
So I didn't want to make a braised dish
as a dish for myself too.

736
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,777
-It's somewhat sad.
-Yes, I'm tearing up.

737
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,615
I wanted to comfort myself.

738
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,535
I was always so hard on myself.

739
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:48,459
I've never even spent 90 seconds
on a dish meant for myself.

740
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,796
The thought of someone
cooking just for me makes me tear up.

741
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,841
Here in this alternate reality,

742
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,510
I wanted to give it a shot.

743
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,304
And this is what I wanted to make.

744
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,723
That's so inspiring.

745
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,393
Is this the first dish
you've made for yourself?

746
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,313
To be honest,
I've only made instant noodles.

747
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,732
-Really? For yourself?
-Yes.

748
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,150
So then,

749
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,695
Mr. Braise, Serial Killer, and…

750
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,197
Not Serial Killer. Serial Braiser.

751
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,575
-I'm sorry.
-Don't say that!

752
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,618
Serial…

753
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,952
He said "Serial Killer."

754
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,331
He just said "Serial Killer."

755
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,299
Serial… Serial Braiser.

756
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:41,261
To the Choi Kang-rok
with all these nicknames,

757
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,013
-before you eat this…
-Yes?

758
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,598
Is there anything you'd like to say?

759
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,850
Well done, Braise Man.

760
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,771
At least for today,
take a break from braising.

761
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,025
Shouldn't we pour our drinks
before we eat?

762
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,820
The purpose of this soju is…

763
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,030
Rather than for the pairing,

764
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,659
it's for that post-work drink
or a nightcap.

765
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,619
It's to help you sleep.

766
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:09,123
It's a way to wash away
that fatigue in one go.

767
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,582
It's just a drink.

768
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,543
-Exactly.
-Because it's what he wants.

769
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,128
-Soju.
-A soju pairing too.

770
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,796
That's a must.

771
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,298
-The red cap soju.
-You need the red cap soju.

772
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,720
After a hard day in the kitchen,

773
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,806
having some soju feels great.

774
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,016
When it comes to seeking comfort,

775
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,685
-I'd think of soju too.
-Yeah, soju.

776
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:30,602
Cheers.

777
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,565
-That looks refreshing.
-Everyone's clapping.

778
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,649
That's amazing.

779
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,109
What a great idea of serving soju.

780
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,028
That will definitely ease their fatigue.

781
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,032
How should we eat this?

782
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:47,369
The sesame tofu is the main ingredient,
so please start with that.

783
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:50,414
I recommend taking a gentle bite.

784
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,885
-Please eat.
-Okay.

785
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,354
Is the texture of the tofu okay?

786
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,231
Was it made to your liking?

787
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,900
Yes, it was for me.

788
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,735
-Then, it's fine.
-Yes.

789
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,280
It's a dish for Choi Kang-rok,
after all, right?

790
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,198
Yes.

791
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,620
What's this? There's a pouch.

792
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,664
I put some sea urchin inside the leaves.

793
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,042
It's hidden inside.

794
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,340
I had this feeling that sea urchin

795
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,883
and pumpkin leaves

796
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,762
would pair well together.

797
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,433
Pumpkin leaves and uni work well together.

798
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,518
They pair well.

799
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,853
I've never tried this before.

800
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,523
I've never had uni wrapped
in pumpkin leaves before.

801
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,234
It sounds like it goes well
with the pumpkin leaves.

802
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,362
His dish must taste really good too.

803
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,994
-They seem excited.
-Yeah.

804
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,803
It feels like they enjoy this one more.
It just feels like it.

805
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,806
This will be interesting.
This will make him nervous.

806
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,018
Then, in the future,

807
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,063
do you want to be called
Serial Braiser or Serial Broth Maker?

808
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,648
Or maybe Serial Killer?

809
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,780
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

810
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,992
-He's law-abiding.
-He's a law-abiding citizen.

811
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:51,702
So…

812
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,079
some people ask these kinds of things.

813
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,499
"What's special about your dish?"
"What's your signature dish?"

814
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:02,129
To be honest, I don't have
many signature dishes.

815
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,674
I'm not really a special kind of chef.

816
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,718
All the chefs in this world

817
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:13,348
are in their kitchens and out of sight
as they do their jobs day in and day out.

818
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,018
And I'm one of them, but I got lucky,

819
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,479
and I got the chance to become Mr. Braise.

820
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,694
-That's so nice.
-Yes, he's so admirable.

821
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:30,157
Perhaps, a great number of chefs,
as you just mentioned,

822
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,867
are pretending.

823
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:36,705
I think all chefs go through
that phase at some point.

824
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,041
I also keep up a lot of appearances.

825
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,667
So I think this is…

826
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,129
a truly honest dish.

827
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,214
It just really felt like that.

828
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,767
Chef Anh's drinking from the bowl.
It must be really good.

829
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,436
-They're eating the whole thing.
-You're right.

830
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:00,937
He's drinking it.

831
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,273
-They emptied their bowls.
-They did.

832
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,359
They polished them clean.
There's no telling now.

833
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:08,487
-It's neck and neck. Who knows who'll win?
-This will be fun.

834
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,738
Thank you for the dish.

835
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,407
It was very delicious.

836
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,492
Thank you.

837
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,000
That's some high praise.

838
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,672
-I wonder what will happen.
-I can't wait to see the result.

839
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,466
He really is brilliant.
He can work with whatever you give him.

840
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,552
-He's so good.
-Exactly. It's amazing.

841
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,847
Now, it's time to find out
if the judges reach a unanimous decision

842
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:39,434
to determine the final winner.

843
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,313
Choi Kang-rok versus Lee Ha-sung.

844
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,982
Lee Ha-sung versus Choi Kang-rok.

845
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,278
Please select one chef out of the two

846
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,157
to be crowned as the ultimate
culinary champion of Korea.

847
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,618
God, how am I supposed to choose?

848
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,706
They'll have a hard time deciding.

849
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,749
Number one is for Lee Ha-sung.

850
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,085
Number two is for Choi Kang-rok.

851
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,547
Please press your buttons now.

852
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,261
They must be so nervous.

853
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,597
I guess both tasted good.

854
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,766
-It must be really close.
-Yes.

855
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,935
Look how hard it is for them to decide.

856
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,024
Yeah. This is the right choice.

857
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,695
JUDGE ANH SUNG-JAE VOTING COMPLETE

858
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:36,199
Judge Paik, please press the button now.

859
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,326
Just a moment!

860
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,499
They both made soups,
so it's hard to tell.

861
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:50,797
Here goes nothing.

862
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,717
BOTH JUDGES HAVE COMPLETED VOTING

863
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,218
It's done. They've decided.

864
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,263
The voting is complete.

865
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,850
Great job!

866
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,481
The winner will only be determined

867
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:11,026
if the judges' decision is unanimous.

868
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,237
Now, for the results.

869
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:19,576
The two judges have made
a decision that is…

870
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,291
Why is my heart pounding?
Why am I so nervous?

871
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,712
-Oh, my god!
-Hurry up and tell us!

872
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,633
…unanimous.

873
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,676
UNANIMOUS DECISION REACHED

874
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,974
Seriously?

875
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,894
…unanimous.

876
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:48,605
Oh, my god!

877
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,399
Oh, my gosh.

878
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:52,818
It's two to zero.

879
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,736
Who is it?

880
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,112
Who's the winner?

881
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,573
My palms are sweating.

882
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,325
Goodness.

883
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,082
I was thinking, "It must be me."

884
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,127
Rather than think I was going to win,

885
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,547
I wanted to win.

886
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,595
-Lee Ha-sung.
-Oh, my gosh.

887
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,472
Who do you think won?

888
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,307
-Kang-rok won.
-I'm praying it's Chef Choi.

889
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,854
The chef who will receive
the 300 million won prize is…

890
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,732
I know the result, but I'm still sweating.

891
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,362
Congratulations…

892
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,075
White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok!

893
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,079
White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok!

894
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:51,126
WHITE SPOON CHEF CHOI KANG-ROK WINS

895
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,670
Unbelievable!

896
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,840
You did it!

897
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,844
This is crazy.

898
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,555
My goodness, Choi Kang-rok.
This is amazing.

899
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,390
Gosh, this is insane.

900
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,565
I was so unsure. I thought you'd…

901
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,241
Gosh, he entered a second time and won.

902
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,869
If the theme…

903
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,622
of the final round mission

904
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,583
wasn't to create a dish for oneself,

905
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,838
Chef Monster… I mean, Culinary Monster

906
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,926
would have presented
an even more impressive dish.

907
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,010
So,

908
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,387
as I mentioned earlier,

909
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,932
I'm not someone
who makes food that's exceptional.

910
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,767
I'm just…

911
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,895
Like all the unseen chefs
across the country

912
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,274
who quietly and diligently work
in their kitchens,

913
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,444
and like all the people
who simply cook for a living,

914
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,155
I'm just one of them.

915
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:08,662
I'll keep your words close to my heart.

916
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,747
And…

917
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,958
I'll cherish the connections
I've made here,

918
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,962
and I'll continue to devote myself
and my thoughts to food.

919
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,088
Thank you.

920
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,052
Great job.

921
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:30,642
First, to all the chefs present here
and all the chefs who couldn't be here,

922
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,561
you all are truly amazing
and did an exceptional job.

923
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,314
Personally, I had a really fun time.

924
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:40,610
And in the end,
I got to compete with Chef Choi Kang-rok,

925
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,821
which I'm grateful for and proud of.

926
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:46,741
As a chef, I want to be someone
who's really good at cooking.

927
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,369
I want to rise to the level

928
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,789
where I can say to myself
that I'm a pretty good chef.

929
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:58,128
And through this profession
and ability to cook well,

930
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:02,340
I want to make the people
around me happy, including myself.

931
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,758
I want to become someone

932
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,636
who can look after them
without difficulty.

933
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,516
Of course, this is just a game of survival

934
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,687
that was designed to divide us
into Black Spoons and White Spoons.

935
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:20,275
But it immediately made me think
about the meaning of this win.

936
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,611
There are a great number
of cooks out there.

937
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,614
Some are skilled experts.

938
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,535
Others are just starting out.

939
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,246
And there are those
who've worked incredibly hard.

940
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:42,422
They all have dishes
they're good at making.

941
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:47,093
These 11 years of making sausages
have been the happiest times of my life.

942
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,013
I think it's my life's work.

943
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,392
Some people make a living
from those dishes.

944
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:58,021
I started cooking as a way to survive.

945
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:01,066
I wanted to open a great burger joint
and live a happy life.

946
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,028
Instead of my story,

947
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,988
I wanted to share stories

948
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,240
of people who cook

949
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,576
as I ended my journey.

950
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,411
To me, cooking is what I do.

951
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:17,916
It's my work,
and I stake everything on my work.

952
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,835
Because it's my job.
It's something I must do.

953
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,215
There are plenty of good chefs
but not many who keep working hard.

954
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,008
So I'm going to keep at it and do my best.

955
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,471
I realized I'm still a chef.
I still love to cook.

956
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:37,143
I've just wanted to give my best every day
without feeling ashamed.

957
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,898
I'm so glad I've been cooking all my life.

958
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:46,361
If I hadn't been cooking,
I wouldn't be here today.

959
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:49,114
I've been cooking for 57 years now.

960
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:52,867
My goal is to make it to 60 years.

961
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,957
I'm sure everyone is the same.

962
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,375
We all desperately want this,

963
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:05,380
and I don't think anyone's desire
is bigger or smaller than anyone else's.

964
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:10,718
I used the last bit of energy
from my twenties to open my restaurant.

965
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:15,140
I'd do the shopping at dawn,
prep, and do the dishes.

966
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,977
I'd wake up at dawn to study
and look up ingredients.

967
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,728
I've even collapsed once while working.

968
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,231
I think it's a dish
that requires patience.

969
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,026
It was so delicious
that I couldn't give it up.

970
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,736
In that moment when I'm cooking,

971
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,281
I'm just so happy.

972
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:36,119
Okay, let's think of myself as being here
in their place and do my best.

973
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,895
I'll keep my two feet on the ground.

974
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,442
I'm glad I came back and tried again.

975
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:11,279
CHOI KANG-ROK
