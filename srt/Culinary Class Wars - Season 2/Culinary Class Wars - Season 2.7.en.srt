1
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:11,553
Please reveal
the votes of the mystery judges.

2
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,181
The current score is

3
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,977
Team White Spoon with 34
and Team Black Spoon with 34.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,645
THE REMAINING 32 SELECTED THE SAME TEAM

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,689
It's a 32-vote difference.

6
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,482
It's 32 votes…

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,650
It's a 32-vote difference?

8
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,486
Now, we will reveal the results.

9
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,699
The result of the first battle is…

10
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,217
We lost?

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,097
Team Black Spoon, 34 points.

12
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,724
Team White Spoon, 66 points.

13
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,225
Team White Spoon wins.

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,396
Currently, Team White Spoon

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,357
is leading by 32 points.

16
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,692
You're the best.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,820
I almost had a heart attack.

18
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,821
Thank you!

19
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,448
When we had our initial discussion,

20
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,326
I insisted that we had to go
with a mainstream dish.

21
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,287
We need to go with mainstream food.

22
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,663
-Let's go mainstream.
-Exactly.

23
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,165
-Something they've had before.
-Yes.

24
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,875
We decided on a straightforward flavor,

25
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,211
and I think that strategy
worked perfectly.

26
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,546
-You really don't know until you know.
-Right?

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,881
Mainstream tastes are powerful.

28
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,343
As I tasted the dishes,

29
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,638
I thought one side
might win by a landslide.

30
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,473
This dish had strong flavors

31
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,935
and a crowd-pleasing flavor profile,
which worked in their favor.

32
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,563
It was sweet, tangy,
and had a bit of a bold punch.

33
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,148
It's tangy and sweet.

34
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,441
It has strong flavors.

35
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,568
Whereas this feels healthier.

36
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,111
I picked it because I preferred it.

37
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:56,157
It was a unique combination,
and it was very easy on the palate.

38
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,578
I knew what the other judges
were going to vote for,

39
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,248
but I thought I should go with my gut.

40
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,291
Currently, Team White Spoon

41
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,044
is leading by 32 points.

42
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,045
By 32 points?

43
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,465
We lost by that much?

44
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,343
Maybe the flavor we went for
was too subtle.

45
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,719
Wow, the gap is…

46
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,263
This will be hard to close.

47
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,598
I was so angry.

48
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,185
We lost by an absurdly wide margin.

49
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,354
I said I'd do both the second
and third rounds.

50
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:31,317
The second battle will be the five-on-five
Black and White Spoons' Team Battle.

51
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,778
For this battle,

52
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,613
there will not be 100 judges.

53
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,075
What?

54
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,080
What's going on?

55
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,763
In this battle,

56
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:05,018
there will be 50 mystery judges
tasting your dishes.

57
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,190
What is that based on though?

58
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,901
To ensure fairness,

59
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,569
the judges have been reselected

60
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,988
from 25 people who voted
for Team Black Spoon

61
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,117
and 25 people who voted
for Team White Spoon in the first battle.

62
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,329
How very meticulous.

63
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,872
So it's split evenly.

64
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,000
They included Judges Paik and Anh
in the 25 Team Black Spoon votes.

65
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,296
That reduces
how many points we can get too.

66
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,632
For the second battle,
each judge's vote

67
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,134
will now be worth two points.

68
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,344
Right, I see.

69
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,931
Two points per person,
bringing the total to 100 points.

70
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,308
That's a lot of points then.

71
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,310
We have to go with something bold

72
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,687
and turn the tables in the second round.

73
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,065
We have to win.
Otherwise, we're going home.

74
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,983
I don't think
we'll be overtaken that easily.

75
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,194
As long as we don't
suddenly burn something

76
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,529
or fail to complete the dish,
I think we'll be fine.

77
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,075
These are the Team White Spoon chefs
competing in the second battle.

78
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,911
They were such strong team members,

79
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,162
so I had faith in them.

80
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,791
We need to win everything.
That's what everyone kept saying.

81
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,084
We have to win them all.

82
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,922
The White Spoons came out
ready to put an end to things.

83
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,508
The Black Spoons thought
it could get really bad

84
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,343
if they don't make a comeback here.

85
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,929
And they seemed determined
to turn things around.

86
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,682
-Are you going to join?
-In Round 2.

87
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,225
Sure, if you have use for me.

88
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,394
-I'm all fired up right now.
-Okay.

89
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,146
We decided to send out people
with more firepower.

90
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,066
Being tired isn't the issue.
It's about winning.

91
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,902
For the main ingredients of this battle,

92
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,863
Team Black Spoon and Team White Spoon

93
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,241
will each select one ingredient.

94
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,910
We get to choose ourselves.

95
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,120
Okay, we pick first.

96
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,247
-What would be best?
-We pick first.

97
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,249
As winners of the first battle,

98
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,335
Team White Spoon will choose first.

99
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,963
From the Wheel of Land,
Team White Spoon has chosen

100
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,756
chicken.

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,675
We decided on a familiar ingredient

102
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,177
and one with more savory taste.

103
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,263
We'll go with pollock roe.

104
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,266
Team Black Spoon has chosen pollock roe.

105
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,186
Pollock roe is an ingredient
that's naturally savory and rich in taste,

106
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,188
so we can make
more straightforward flavors.

107
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,483
The second battle ingredients
from the Wheel of Fate

108
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,152
are chicken and pollock roe.

109
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,530
They picked two very savory ingredients.

110
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,865
If done well, they'll be tasty.

111
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,075
-Right.
-I wonder how different they'll be.

112
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,994
These ingredients
can turn out very different

113
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,912
depending on the cooking style.

114
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,331
What about for the chicken?

115
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,457
Fricassée for the chicken.

116
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,374
Fricassée?

117
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,586
Fricassée is a French dish
made with chicken.

118
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,381
The chicken is sauteed
and served with a creamy sauce.

119
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,759
In the first dish,
everything contained vinegar.

120
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,720
It was a sweet and tangy dish
with a bit of acidity.

121
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,431
So for the second dish,
we decided to go for something heavy.

122
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,640
Something really rich.

123
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,018
A really creamy fricassée,

124
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,645
with chicken, mushrooms,
and mashed potatoes underneath.

125
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,356
-It'll be very familiar kind of flavor.
-A simple dish.

126
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,609
But we have to add pollock roe.

127
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,487
It has to be savory
while pairing well with the chicken.

128
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,698
-We can add the roe to potatoes.
-Yeah. That's the best.

129
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,283
That will make it incredibly savory.

130
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,952
-The roe makes the mashed potatoes more…
-More delicious?

131
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,829
-It sounds good.
-It brings that savoriness.

132
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,414
Then, who will make the sauce?

133
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,291
-Are you going to?
-I'll make the sauce.

134
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,043
Then, I'll handle the grilling.

135
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,170
-Then, please take the vegetables.
-Okay.

136
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,797
Please take the roe out of the sacs.

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,673
You just want the roe taken out?

138
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,384
Chicken fricassée
with pollock roe mashed potatoes.

139
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,552
We've won already.

140
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,304
-Right? Doesn't it sound delicious?
-Yes.

141
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,976
I think they'll do something like this.

142
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,313
A fricassée with chicken and pollock roe.

143
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,398
-Chef Sam Kim.
-He's Italian cuisine.

144
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,525
-Jong-won.
-Yeah.

145
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,734
Chef Park Hyo-nam.

146
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,361
They're all Western cuisine.

147
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,197
Chicken fricassée is a classic dish.

148
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,741
It's also easier to prepare for 50 people.

149
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,786
I thought we really needed
to catch up to them in the second round,

150
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,788
so I felt we should take
a different approach.

151
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,207
We should make kkanpunggi

152
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,627
and make a béchamel
with pollock roe and cheese

153
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,295
-that we'll spread on the bottom.
-Good.

154
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,381
-It'll have spice and cheese.
-Okay.

155
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,465
-Sounds good.
-Good. Okay.

156
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,467
Team White Spoon's chicken fricassée

157
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,096
is a dish that can easily become
a bit too heavy and greasy.

158
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,474
So, we decided on kkanpunggi,
or spicy garlic fried chicken.

159
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,017
-Lay the cheese sauce down.
-Okay.

160
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,437
-Add the chicken and shredded green onion.
-Yes. Right.

161
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,523
Kkanpunggi has a bold flavor
with a spicy kick.

162
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,902
I think it needs a gentle flavor
to balance it out.

163
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,405
People like the intense flavor
of tteokbokki,

164
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,074
but they also enjoy eating it with cheese.

165
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,952
This will be a combination
quite similar to that.

166
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,912
I'll be upstairs praying
that it tastes good.

167
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,038
So we can win.

168
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,375
Let's talk about our stations,
so our workflow doesn't get messy.

169
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,295
Rebellious Genius and I
will work over there.

170
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,755
You two need to prep the chicken,

171
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,800
so please do it by the sink,
and Chef Ok will work here.

172
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,011
He was watching us running around earlier.

173
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,263
He wasn't pleased at all.

174
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,558
I was quite frustrated
with their work process in Round 1

175
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,602
when I was watching from above.

176
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,189
There's enough space
on the other side to work.

177
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,859
We have cutting boards.
Why are they sharing one?

178
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,946
They're not splitting up the tasks.

179
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,157
I think I need to do this here.

180
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,868
For the second round with five people,

181
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,330
I said I'd take the lead.

182
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,332
If you have ideas,
don't talk among yourselves.

183
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,917
-Right.
-If you tell me,

184
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,960
I'll think it through and share it

185
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,712
or turn it down.

186
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,464
Just trust me and follow my lead.

187
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,591
Please don't be offended
if I turn you down.

188
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,428
-Any questions?
-No.

189
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,721
-No.
-Very nice.

190
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,099
I didn't take the lead
out of a sense of duty to save our team.

191
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,728
I was thinking, "They're so frustrating.
I should do it myself."

192
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,480
Now,

193
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,858
The Black and White Spoons'
Team Battle, All or Nothing.

194
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,819
The second culinary battle begins now.

195
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,780
FIVE-ON-FIVE FACE-OFF
TIME LIMIT IS 120 MINUTES

196
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,031
-Good luck!
-You can do it!

197
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,783
-Go, Black Spoons!
-Good luck!

198
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,536
-Good luck!
-You can do it!

199
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,829
-I'll set everything up.
-Who do I get vegetables with?

200
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,039
-Come with me.
-Okay.

201
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,999
-Prep the chicken.
-Yes, Chef.

202
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,543
Let's go get the vegetables.

203
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,127
I'll finish setting things up.

204
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,714
Before we began,

205
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:13,094
we made sure to designate stations
and workflows for everyone.

206
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,805
One, two, and three.

207
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,687
In order to lead your team effectively,

208
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,274
you need to assign the right jobs
to the right people.

209
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,193
As soon as we start,
please fill these with oil first.

210
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,861
Just to be safe, fill up everything.

211
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,994
We decided the management of our process

212
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,829
should be left to Culinary Monster.

213
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,915
I'll get the ingredients from the pantry.

214
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,875
-You get the butter and…
-I'll set up.

215
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,211
-Cheese.
-Two types of cheese from the fridge.

216
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,882
He assigned all the tasks by time.

217
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,845
His orders are so well-organized.

218
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,389
-You two prep the chicken.
-I can fry the chicken.

219
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,685
-Prep the vegetables for the kkanpunggi.
-Okay.

220
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,817
When I start stir-frying the vegetables,

221
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,193
you scrape out the pollock roe.

222
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,033
It's like we're going along for the ride.

223
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,951
On the Monster Bus.

224
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,537
We're getting a premium ride.

225
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,539
And he's our driver.

226
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,795
From here, I see
he is really good at organizing.

227
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,922
We must've looked so ridiculous earlier.

228
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,258
Earlier, we were a lot
like them over there.

229
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,302
Where are the gloves?

230
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,014
-Under there.
-The gloves are there.

231
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,641
-They're here.
-I need to use these.

232
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,267
Boil some water first.

233
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,563
Where's the stove lighter?

234
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,773
-Where is it?
-What?

235
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,774
That thing.

236
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,192
-The peeler?
-Do I peel with that?

237
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,276
-Yes.
-The peeler is…

238
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,238
The potato peeler.

239
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,450
-It's not there?
-No.

240
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,161
They're all over the place right now.

241
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,707
I've only competed alone until now,
so this was my first team battle.

242
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,377
It was so different.

243
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,254
Even though we had decided
on what we should be doing,

244
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,007
once the battle started,
we were all over the place.

245
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,884
Hold on! Here.

246
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,511
I brought them. Here's the lighter.

247
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,389
He lit the stove.

248
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,099
The peeler's right here, Venerable.

249
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,350
Here.

250
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,267
I've put it on.

251
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,521
-You don't need a peeler?
-No, I'm fine.

252
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,327
Chef, I brought the butter
for the mashed potatoes.

253
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,829
-Okay.
-I'll let it temper.

254
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,457
Chef Son is working
like a commis chef.

255
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,458
He's working hard.

256
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,670
Chef, I brought most of the seasonings.

257
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,339
-And the balsamic vinegar?
-Yes, all of them.

258
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,216
-Here's the salt too.
-We can use those then.

259
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,510
The more I run around,

260
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,053
the more help I can be to the team.

261
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,972
They won the first match
by such a big margin,

262
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,266
so I'd feel bad
if we lost the second match.

263
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,184
All I could think about
was moving quickly

264
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,311
to do absolutely everything I can.

265
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,398
-I'll help with the chicken now.
-Okay.

266
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,275
-Please debone this.
-Okay.

267
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,198
This…

268
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,825
This takes a lot of work.

269
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,702
This is a lot more work than I thought.

270
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,996
-This is the hard bit.
-Yeah, it's a lot of work.

271
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,874
This is really slippery. Damn.

272
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,294
This wasn't the easy task.

273
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,384
Prepping the chicken

274
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,595
took a lot longer than we thought.

275
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,138
We expected around 20 minutes.

276
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,515
Chef Hee-eun, how long has it been?

277
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,350
-It's been 20 minutes.
-99 minutes left!

278
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,935
We should've been done by now.

279
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,062
We aimed to prep the chicken
in 20 minutes.

280
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,941
I even thought,
"Maybe we shouldn't have picked chicken."

281
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,361
It's taking a while to debone the chicken.

282
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,624
Gosh, look at our Witch with a Wok!

283
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,542
-Look at that.
-She's amazing.

284
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,585
See that knife?

285
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,089
Even her knife is very witch-like.

286
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,228
Chicken is an ingredient I always use.

287
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,107
Wow, you're so fast.

288
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,317
-What?
-You're so fast.

289
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,401
Really?

290
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,487
I came determined to duel it out today,

291
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,907
so I sharpened my knife
to a fine edge beforehand.

292
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,827
Gosh, Chef Witch with a Wok

293
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,996
is really fast.

294
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,999
Deboning is actually a delicate job,

295
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,127
but she just cuts through
with her cleaver.

296
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,130
-Everything okay?
-All good.

297
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,883
We have plenty of time. We're all done.

298
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,887
I'm going to brine it now.

299
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,692
-Why are you sighing?
-You can't sigh.

300
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,610
-No sighing allowed.
-No sighing.

301
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,529
-No sighing.
-My back hurts.

302
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,322
No sighing, Team White Spoon.

303
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,117
We're almost done. Just a little more.

304
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,370
Is someone doing the vegetables?
The mirepoix?

305
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,595
-Hello, Venerable.
-Hello.

306
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,806
-The ingredients are…
-Yes?

307
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,767
-They're seafood and chicken, so how…
-Right.

308
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,937
With cooking, not everyone
has to be a vegetarian.

309
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,814
-True.
-Yes, so in that case,

310
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,733
-I do what I can for them.
-Right.

311
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,819
Just as you try to balance people
who do and don't get along,

312
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,864
I believe you should do
the same with food.

313
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,074
When you're on a team,

314
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,119
it's important to work in harmony.

315
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,206
"I'm a practitioner, so I only do
vegetarian food." It's not that.

316
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,000
I can just cook what I'm able to cook.

317
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,294
If you think about an orchestra,

318
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,339
I just need to play my piece
and do my part well.

319
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,966
I'm not the conductor
who handles everything.

320
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,801
What should I do next?

321
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,803
The button mushrooms are done.
And this parsley.

322
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,264
-I think we'll need one more celery.
-Celery?

323
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,223
-Is that so?
-Yes.

324
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,105
-Do we need more chicken?
-No, this seems enough.

325
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,774
Could you check this? I'll sear them.

326
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,035
-Please toss the onions too.
-Yes, Chef.

327
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,041
Wow, look how quick Chef Son is.

328
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,172
We'll sear the chicken in the pan first.

329
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,383
The color's okay, right?

330
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,051
The color? Yes.

331
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,306
We added garlic, rosemary, and thyme.
The chicken's going in.

332
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,769
-Wow, that looks delicious.
-That looks good!

333
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,857
We'll give it a sear
and then cook it in the oven.

334
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,778
The key point of this dish
is making a rich sauce.

335
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,658
We use chicken
to give the broth some real flavor.

336
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,537
We sauté the celery
and onion in olive oil.

337
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,498
Then, we add that rich chicken broth
and let it cook.

338
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,593
Light it up!

339
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,725
Our team leader is Chef Park Hyo-nam,
and he's a master of French cuisine.

340
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,059
It felt reassuring to have him.

341
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,022
He's a master of Western cuisine,

342
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,859
so I knew this chicken dish
would be perfect.

343
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,822
It smells like Western cuisine now.

344
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,742
It's bound to be good.
The god of Western cuisine made it.

345
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,372
I just hope the sauce is good.

346
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,041
-The kkanpunggi sauce.
-I know.

347
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,045
Using spicy chili peppers
with soy sauce tastes the best.

348
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,213
Is it going well?

349
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,010
I said I'd make the kkanpunggi sauce.

350
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:37,097
-What will you make for the sauce?
-Kkanpunggi sauce is soy sauce-based.

351
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,807
-Want to add balsamic vinegar?
-Balsamic?

352
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,434
-Yes, it'll taste good.
-I don't mind.

353
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,812
I suggested that we use balsamic vinegar.

354
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,732
It'll have a savory and sweet flavor.

355
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,901
Spicy and sweet.

356
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,569
Yeah, that's the best flavor.

357
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,739
Is there anything else I can help with?

358
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,865
Chef Ok.

359
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,075
Three each, so six in total.

360
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,493
-They need to be diced.
-Okay.

361
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,287
-Did you shred the green onions?
-No. They need to be shredded.

362
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,757
-Prep has to be done in 20 minutes.
-Yes, Chef.

363
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,802
Witch with a Wok,
could you check the sweetness?

364
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,595
15, 25.

365
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,225
Have a taste.
I added cooking syrup as well.

366
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,685
-Add more?
-It's too salty.

367
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,020
-Too salty?
-It's really salty.

368
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,230
-It's too salty.
-Too salty?

369
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,231
It's really salty.

370
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,482
-It's salty?
-Yeah.

371
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,860
It'll be really salty if we let it reduce.

372
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,738
Make it sweet and not salty.

373
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,741
-Okay.
-I think it's really salty.

374
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,409
-Okay, sorry.
-For my taste.

375
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,286
Make it mild enough
to just eat it like this.

376
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,832
That way, we can reduce it in the pan
and toss the chicken in it.

377
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,670
It strangely came out salty,
and I was struggling to figure out

378
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,922
the fix to that problem at the time.

379
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,218
I was frustrated.

380
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,430
He said he'd handle the sauce
and the vegetable prep,

381
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,183
but he hadn't even prepped
the vegetables yet.

382
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,895
Chef Ok, I think the sauce
is taking too long.

383
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:07,980
No, I'm almost done.

384
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,482
-We said we'd prep the vegetables.
-Yes, I'm almost done.

385
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:15,445
But I was able to tone down the saltiness
and draw out more sweetness

386
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,865
to fix the flavor.

387
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,120
I chopped the green onions,
bell peppers, and garlic.

388
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,454
-What should I do?
-Come here.

389
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,956
-Pour this for me.
-Do what?

390
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,791
-Water.
-Water? How much?

391
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,376
-Just pour it.
-I'll pour all of it.

392
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,377
-Say when.
-Okay.

393
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,963
How's it going?
We should make one and taste it.

394
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,507
-We just need to make the batter.
-Pour it all in.

395
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,301
It's been an hour now.

396
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,344
We need to start frying.

397
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,013
-We have two minutes left.
-Almost done.

398
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,182
Please tell me an actual time instead.

399
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,683
-For this?
-Three minutes.

400
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,601
Three minutes?

401
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,895
When I ask how long something will take,

402
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,230
saying "almost done"

403
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,357
doesn't answer my question.

404
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,443
-We need to start.
-Yes, we're ready to fry.

405
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,198
We're five minutes behind.

406
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,452
As the one leading the team,
I had to keep track of the time.

407
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,537
It's been 15 minutes.

408
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,456
Prep has to be done in 20 minutes.

409
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,876
The team leader needs to be
more proactive and keep following up

410
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,669
to check if things are going well.

411
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,087
Sorry, Chef.

412
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,380
Let's redo the peanuts.

413
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,465
Redo them? How?

414
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,842
-These are too burnt.
-Okay, so less cooked than this?

415
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,302
-They must be evenly cooked.
-Okay.

416
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,014
-I think they're good now.
-Like this?

417
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,724
-Stop here or keep going?
-Stop.

418
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,728
I need to set a good example first
and demonstrate how it's done.

419
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,606
We're done.
Please tell me what's left to do.

420
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,608
Make me some starch paste.

421
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,485
-Paste? What kind?
-Yes, using this.

422
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,741
That's how I've always worked,
so I tried hard to do it that way.

423
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,284
STARCH PASTE
BÉCHAMEL SAUCE

424
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,455
-I'll finish off the béchamel.
-Okay.

425
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,332
Rebellious Genius.

426
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,126
-If we add the roe, we're done.
-Got it.

427
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,212
-Could you add it and season it?
-Season it? Okay.

428
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:00,300
POLLOCK ROE ADDED TO BÉCHAMEL SAUCE
TO FINISH POLLOCK ROE CREAM SAUCE

429
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,219
They're making a pollock roe béchamel.

430
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,972
-It's a pollock roe béchamel.
-So that's what it was.

431
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,058
I hope our pollock roe mashed potatoes
come out well.

432
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,022
We need to do this and then transfer
the mashed potatoes to a big bowl.

433
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,775
We need to press them through.

434
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,154
-Could I have a look, Venerable?
-Sure.

435
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,161
We need to push them through.
Is it working? Yes, like this.

436
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,248
-It'll take a while though.
-But this is how it's done.

437
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,749
-Really?
-Even in French cuisine,

438
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,043
it's important
to put in the effort and do this.

439
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,129
Are the potatoes coming out?
Is it working well?

440
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,964
-Not really.
-Not really?

441
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,801
We need to do this first.

442
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,553
Put these through, Venerable.

443
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,264
I'll do this first for you.

444
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,017
-Break them down?
-If we break them down, it'll be easier.

445
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,395
Gosh, the mashed potatoes
must be so hot to handle.

446
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,647
It's so hot.

447
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,191
Geez, it's mashed potato hell.

448
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,279
Who knew the potatoes
would be this much trouble?

449
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,196
Right?

450
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,406
It's so hot.

451
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,658
-How about we switch?
-Sorry?

452
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,951
We'll take turns doing it.

453
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,494
-We have to save our strength.
-Okay.

454
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,412
Right?

455
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,289
The potatoes will take a while.

456
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,541
Yeah, this will take longer than expected.

457
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,959
Could you pass me that?

458
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,419
-Please give me that.
-What?

459
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,503
Please give me that.

460
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,049
Like this.

461
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,051
Push them through this.

462
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,136
Like this.

463
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,223
It's hot, so do it like this
with the rack.

464
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,224
There we go.

465
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,518
Bravo!

466
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,437
-They're going through well.
-You're the best!

467
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,607
I think pushing them through
like this should do it.

468
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,025
It's working.

469
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,861
-Yes, they'll quickly pass through.
-They're all passing through.

470
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,905
I think this should be enough.

471
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,948
Have a look.

472
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,035
The chicken's done, right?

473
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,119
-It's all done.
-All done?

474
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,206
-But we do need to cook it in here.
-Yeah, so let's do that now.

475
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,838
After taking the chicken out of the oven,
they're cooking it in the sauce.

476
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,298
Yes.

477
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,424
Thirteen.

478
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,384
Fourteen.

479
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,357
If the pollock roe gets too hot,

480
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,109
it might taste a bit fishy.

481
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,780
-This really wears out your arm.
-Shall I do it?

482
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,281
No, it's fine. I'll do it.

483
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,576
-If your arm hurts…
-Even though my arm hurt,

484
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,037
I mixed it at a low temperature
for a long time.

485
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,790
I'm a little worried right now,

486
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:40,210
because the mashed potatoes
and the chicken are both cream-based.

487
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,964
-I'm making the tasting sample.
-Okay.

488
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,801
-It's Chinese versus Western cuisine.
-Right.

489
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,386
I hope ours is a little spicy.

490
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,513
The way you make kkanpunggi is

491
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:57,602
you toss the fried chicken in the sauce
and let it really soak in.

492
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:02,858
On the bottom, there is a béchamel sauce
made with pollock roe and Parmesan cheese.

493
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,276
That's about three spoonfuls.

494
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,569
Okay, three spoonfuls.

495
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,660
-Have a taste.
-Should I make this and…

496
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,537
-Pause for a moment and have a taste.
-Okay.

497
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,164
Let's taste this together.

498
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,665
This is a team battle,

499
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,750
and everyone specializes
in different cuisines,

500
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,170
but we had to create one single dish.

501
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,592
Could someone taste all of it at once?

502
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,510
-All of it.
-Taste it with the sauce.

503
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,137
Yes, with the sauce and green onions.

504
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,018
Is it too mild?

505
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,273
I think we should add more sauce
and also add more pollock roe.

506
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,775
-Season the sauce more?
-The sauce could use more acidity.

507
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,902
-Yes.
-More acidity?

508
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,529
The heat kicks in at the end.

509
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,490
-Let's recheck the sauce.
-The roe sauce is only creamy.

510
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,909
The roe doesn't stand out.

511
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,829
It wasn't quite there.

512
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,915
By my standards,

513
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,875
the flavor wasn't that bold.

514
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,503
Since you make this all the time,
please do it your way.

515
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,423
Rebellious Genius, please add more roe.

516
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,592
Just make your best kkanpunggi.

517
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,219
-The cream's pretty strong.
-Okay.

518
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,936
We need to start plating in 15 minutes.

519
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:21,937
-Okay.
-Okay.

520
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,612
Our dish has a refined flavor,
but it contains cream and butter,

521
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,573
so if they find it greasy,
they won't like it.

522
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,285
-There's a lot of cream.
-Yes.

523
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,664
-The potatoes and top layer are creamy.
-The potatoes, cream, cheese. Too heavy.

524
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,707
Right, it's too heavy.
It'll be too greasy.

525
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,377
Fricassées can taste a little greasy.

526
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,129
So I thought the dish
needed a clear highlight.

527
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,716
Right now, the mashed potatoes
are in the middle with the pollock roe,

528
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,468
and the cream sauce goes on top.

529
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,721
We're missing
that special flavor in the dish.

530
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,808
-I think adding some acidity will help.
-Yes, acidity.

531
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,936
If we reduce something
like balsamic vinegar

532
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,813
and drizzle it over the mashed potatoes,

533
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,482
-when they take a spoonful…
-It'll add a sweet note.

534
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,150
Yes, and it'll be tangy too.

535
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,069
And we can take a lemon wedge

536
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,445
and char it.

537
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,738
Either char or grill it.

538
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,909
That freshly squeezed citrus aroma
is really nice.

539
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,954
You get a hint of charred lemon juice,

540
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,039
which is quite a unique flavor.

541
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,461
The Venerable torched it with such care.

542
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,255
I've never done this before.

543
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,800
The lemon will add that special flavor.

544
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,135
Let's make a sample dish.

545
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,345
We'll put this here like so.

546
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,597
When layering the dish

547
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,435
with the mashed potatoes,
the cream sauce, and the chicken,

548
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:47,314
the balsamic vinegar and lemon
will add that special something.

549
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,481
CHARRED LEMON JUICE

550
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,026
It's braised in the sauce
and has acidity and sweetness.

551
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,611
Shouldn't we place it on top
to be squeezed?

552
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,864
-It needs a bit more acidity.
-It's good.

553
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,159
-It's good. The texture's good.
-Did you add balsamic vinegar?

554
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,076
-Yeah.
-You did?

555
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,870
The texture's great.

556
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,914
-I think the potatoes are good like this.
-Yeah, the texture's good.

557
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,334
Chef Park said the texture's good.

558
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,170
Okay. Let's start plating.

559
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,506
-Did you add more balsamic vinegar?
-Yes, I did.

560
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,966
-And vinegar?
-No.

561
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,096
I wanted the flavor

562
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,100
to really hit the palate of those tasting.

563
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,144
Should we add some chili oil to the sauce?

564
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,896
-It lacks heat.
-Yes, a little more…

565
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,481
Let's add chili oil and try it again.

566
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,193
-Do we have chili oil?
-Yeah. The chili oil. Where was it?

567
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,694
-The Lao Gan Ma.
-Yeah.

568
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,071
-That bottle.
-This one?

569
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,989
-Strain it and just give me the oil.
-Okay.

570
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,241
It needs to be spicy.

571
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,327
There we go.

572
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,872
Witch with a Wok, the chili oil.

573
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,499
-Is this enough? Where?
-Chili oil?

574
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,209
-Put it there.
-I'll put it here.

575
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,181
Let's taste this again.

576
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,474
Let's go.

577
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,651
It's okay.

578
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,949
Is it good?

579
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,410
-Is it okay?
-We got it.

580
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,078
-Let's go with this.
-It's good.

581
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,538
-That's good.
-It's perfect.

582
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,540
When I tried it, it was great.

583
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,668
We were all happy with it.
All five of us. It was so good.

584
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,054
-We need to keep frying the chicken.
-Okay.

585
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,934
-Ten minutes until plating.
-Okay.

586
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,105
-It's good we set up two frying stations.
-Yeah, we did it just in case.

587
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,733
-Forty minutes left. We'll start plating.
-Okay.

588
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,151
A spoonful of potatoes for each.

589
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,365
-I'll plate them.
-Okay.

590
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,783
-Please pour it.
-Okay.

591
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,287
-And then, like this?
-Okay.

592
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,622
-This needs to be a little pink.
-Okay.

593
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,249
It needs to have the pollock roe.

594
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,042
-Mix it so it evenly distributes.
-Okay.

595
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,839
We really need to fry them now.

596
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,507
-We have to go.
-Here's the second fry.

597
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,469
I'm doing the second fry now.

598
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,141
Just take one big spoonful like this.

599
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,351
-Be careful not to spill.
-One big spoonful. Okay.

600
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,853
From the left? Or doesn't matter?

601
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,854
-Doesn't matter.
-Okay.

602
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,063
We've started plating.

603
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,072
Mine are slowly going to come out now.

604
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,662
Here.

605
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,753
Unlike with the squid,
the smell of the cooking is…

606
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,339
It gets your mouth watering.

607
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,175
That kkanpunggi makes this a toss-up now.

608
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:06,095
With that smoky flavor,
it'll be hard to beat kkanpunggi.

609
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,599
I think it'll be a repeat
of the first round

610
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,226
but reversed.

611
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,685
-Reversed?
-Yeah.

612
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,770
But over there,

613
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,731
I think the White Spoons
went for mainstream too.

614
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,234
Potatoes and chicken.

615
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,948
They're adding more cheese on top.

616
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,951
-Like this.
-Yes, stand it up like this at the edge.

617
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,203
-All in the same direction?
-Yes.

618
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,789
So they can grab and squeeze it.

619
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,709
-Can we add a tiny bit of roe on top?
-Pollock roe?

620
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,253
-I think it needs more impact.
-Okay.

621
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,046
This should make it perfectly balanced.

622
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,131
We added a bit of pollock roe
right at the end.

623
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:46,302
Because ultimately,
it all comes down to the details.

624
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,137
I wanted to really make it taste great.

625
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,056
How many have we done?

626
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,268
There's still a bit to go.

627
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:01,025
-We need to move the dishes we've wiped.
-Move the dishes?

628
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,738
-They're placing the plates now.
-Good luck!

629
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,490
You can do it!

630
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,996
Let's pick up the pace a little.

631
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,545
-These are all done, right?
-Yes.

632
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,588
You can take these.

633
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,884
The lemon is at the top.

634
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,554
-The two have completely opposite flavors.
-Yes.

635
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,473
I think the dishes reflect
the personality of that team.

636
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,058
Well done.

637
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,438
-Great job!
-Well done!

638
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,273
Great job!

639
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,900
-Good job.
-Thank you. You too.

640
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,653
-Great job.
-The last one.

641
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,447
Let's go! Good job!

642
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,743
That looks good.

643
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,037
The second battle is over.

644
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:59,208
5-ON-5 FACE-OFF
END OF COOKING

645
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,085
-Great job.
-Good job, everyone!

646
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,587
You worked so hard.

647
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,422
-Great job.
-Good job.

648
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,382
-Great job.
-It's all over.

649
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,927
-Great job.
-You too, Chef.

650
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,935
They went all out.

651
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,021
-But ours is bolder in flavor.
-Exactly.

652
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,731
Gosh, it was really…

653
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,524
It felt like they had come out

654
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,361
with a perfect plan
after going through the first battle.

655
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,113
Like, "We're all about the flavor."
Something bold.

656
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,409
The White Spoons' dish looked fuller.

657
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,370
There was some depth to the dish.

658
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,289
This time, we had a real chance.

659
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,918
Yes, thank you.

660
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,472
The dish we prepared for this battle

661
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,850
is a dish that tastes delicious
in a straightforward way.

662
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,728
TEAM BLACK SPOON
KKANPUNGGI WITH ROE SAUCE

663
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,273
We added pollock roe
to a smooth cream base

664
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,025
to make a savory sauce.

665
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,778
On top of that is kkanpunggi.

666
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,155
I personally think

667
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,741
the most delicious cuisine
is Chinese cuisine,

668
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,035
so I believed we could win.

669
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,830
The dish we prepared is called

670
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,124
"Cock-a-Doodle-Doo Embracing Pollock Roe."

671
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,418
TEAM WHITE SPOON
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO EMBRACING POLLOCK ROE

672
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,254
We based it on the very classic dish,
chicken fricassée.

673
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,925
We mixed the pollock roe and potato purée
so they can blend together.

674
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,636
There's a lemon wedge
charred on one side.

675
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,890
If you add just a drop of juice from that,
the dish will taste even better.

676
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,873
I'm so nervous.

677
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,835
Let's win this time.

678
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,420
Please.

679
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,903
I think ours will taste better.

680
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,071
It'll be savory.

681
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,115
Should we have made it spicier?

682
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,647
Please.

683
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,899
They both used pollock roe as a sauce.

684
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,984
POLLOCK ROE MASHED POTATOES
POLLOCK ROE CREAM SAUCE

685
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,319
Neither used a lot of it.

686
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,363
-The pollock roe…
-It's very mild.

687
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,864
Yes, they made it very mild.

688
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,033
The kkanpunggi sauce
isn't too strong either.

689
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,119
If it were,

690
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,538
we wouldn't taste the pollock roe at all.

691
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,915
This is a tough one.

692
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:29,710
Team Black Spoon changed their strategy
and went for a straightforward taste.

693
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,381
-Team White Spoon also did really well.
-I'm licking my knife right now.

694
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,799
Well…

695
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,676
-You must be enjoying it.
-Yeah.

696
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,288
The tasting is complete.

697
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,956
No, I'm not done.

698
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,666
Now,

699
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,002
-it's time to begin voting…
-No, wait.

700
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,337
-for the second battle.
-Wait.

701
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,279
The voting is complete.

702
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,697
END OF VOTING

703
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,285
First, we will reveal the results
of the two judges' votes.

704
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,579
Please reveal the vote…

705
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,623
of Judge Anh Sung-jae.

706
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:55,546
JUDGE ANH SUNG-JAE VOTED
FOR TEAM WHITE SPOON

707
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,803
Please reveal the vote
of Judge Paik Jong-won.

708
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,722
-Please.
-Please.

709
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,519
JUDGE PAIK JONG-WON VOTED
FOR TEAM BLACK SPOON

710
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,940
This is nerve-racking.

711
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,860
I've had a lot of kkanpunggi in my time,
but this is the best I've ever had.

712
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,113
I didn't know adding pollock roe
could make it taste so refined.

713
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,990
I honestly want to eat it again.

714
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,785
Before starting,

715
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:29,830
Team Black Spoon said they'd compete
with direct, straightforward flavors.

716
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,000
But it didn't come across
as that straightforward for me.

717
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:37,922
This dish maintains a sense of delicacy
while trying to be direct,

718
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,508
so it wasn't as pleasurable to me.

719
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,511
In contrast, "Cock-a-Doodle-Doo
Embracing Pollock Roe"

720
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,263
seems to possess two qualities.

721
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,808
It has that classic feel
but also a touch of wit.

722
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,892
The charred lemon…

723
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,272
When I squeezed in
a few drops of it while eating,

724
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,524
just as Chef Son Jong-won said earlier,

725
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,818
it was the exact highlight of the dish.

726
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:03,114
And that really tiny bit
of pollock roe on top

727
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,324
may seem like it'd make
a minor difference,

728
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,786
but even that helped to make
the overall dish really shine.

729
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,788
I felt we did everything we could.

730
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,083
We worked hard
to create the our intended dish.

731
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,042
So we can't lose.

732
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,005
The White Spoons did well too.
Theirs was put together well.

733
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,089
Then, it's fifty-fifty.

734
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,967
I was thinking we needed to
at least win 60 to 40.

735
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,886
The results of the first battle were…

736
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,555
Team White Spoon with 66 points

737
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,473
and Team Black Spoon with 34 points.

738
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:33,102
Currently, Team White Spoon
is ahead by 32 points.

739
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,565
Now, it is time to announce

740
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,650
the voting results.

741
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,029
Please reveal the final results.

742
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,497
Let's just win.

743
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,625
I was confident
our flavors would measure up.

744
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,673
I had faith in our dish,
and I believe it suited their tastes more.

745
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:08,512
TEAM WHITE SPOON, 48
TEAM BLACK SPOON, 48

746
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,727
TEAM WHITE SPOON WINS

747
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,030
Gosh, I'm going to lose my mind.

748
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,366
I think I might cry.

749
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,827
Team Black Spoon, 48 points.

750
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,788
Team White Spoon, 52 points.

751
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,581
Team White Spoon wins.

752
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,751
36-POINT DIFFERENCE AFTER SECOND BATTLE

753
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,252
You're so awesome.

754
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,546
-Nice job.
-They were awesome.

755
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,178
I suppose our dish didn't taste as good.

756
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,306
It won't be easy, but…

757
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,392
we have to survive somehow.

758
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,935
I'll just try really hard.

759
00:39:56,018 --> 00:40:01,482
I'll do everything I can,
using all the strength I have.

760
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,526
BLACK AND WHITE SPOONS' TEAM BATTLE
ALL OR NOTHING

761
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,902
WHITE SPOONS WIN FIRST 2 BATTLES

762
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,529
TOTAL, 118 TO 82
36-POINT DIFFERENCE

763
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,289
They're all closed.

764
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,750
Why are they gone?
It's making me nervous.

765
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,047
The third Black and White Spoons'
Team Battle, All or Nothing.

766
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,882
The survival of one team

767
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,176
and elimination of the other
is on the line.

768
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,719
The third battle will be

769
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,139
between the best three chefs
from each team.

770
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,353
In this final battle,
the number of judges will be…

771
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,524
only ten.

772
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,693
…only ten.

773
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,154
Ten points per judge? Okay.

774
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:52,408
Each judge's vote
will now be worth ten points.

775
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,326
-That's a lot of points.
-Ten points.

776
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,662
Gosh, this is really bad.

777
00:40:56,745 --> 00:41:00,583
According to the votes of the ten judges,
including Judges Paik and Ahn,

778
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,918
the total scores will be added up

779
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,880
to decide the fate of the two teams.

780
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,340
-What does that mean?
-It's 70 to 30.

781
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,385
If we earn 70 points, we win.
If we get only 60, we lose.

782
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,137
If they get 70 points, we lose.

783
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,015
We have a chance to make a comeback.

784
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,852
There's even a chance
we could win 100 to zero.

785
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,312
We just need 40 points to win.

786
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:25,774
Out of the ten judges, let's aim for half.
So it'll be 50 points for each.

787
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,986
Now, we will reveal the other judges.

788
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,447
-I'm curious. I can't wait to see.
-I'm curious too.

789
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,074
As this is a battle
between each team's best three chefs,

790
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,411
we've assembled
a special panel of judges.

791
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,954
A special panel?

792
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,789
-A special panel?
-Special?

793
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,292
-Special?
-Introducing…

794
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,213
the special judges for this battle.

795
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,739
Gosh, it's our predecessors!

796
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,919
3-ON-3 BATTLE OF THE BEST
THE SPECIAL PANEL'S EIGHT JUDGES

797
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,587
Gosh, it's our predecessors!

798
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,215
Our predecessors from Season 1!

799
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,851
Your judges of the special panel

800
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:47,439
are the eight chefs
who helped the show shine last season.

801
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,275
Hello, everyone.

802
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,987
It's very challenging,
but don't think about giving up.

803
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,198
You must fight hard until the end.

804
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,617
I hope everyone does well.
I'll be cheering you on.

805
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:03,038
It brings back memories
to be here again after a year.

806
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,624
The chef I truly respect and I

807
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,335
can face the same direction
instead of each other

808
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,837
as we shoot this show together,

809
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,380
so I am truly honored.

810
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,757
Hello, I'm Chinese cuisine chef
Jung Ji-sun.

811
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,259
I'm Cooking Maniac.

812
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,885
I'm Auntie Omakase #1, Kim Mi-ryeong.

813
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,429
I'm Jang Ho-joon from Tongyeong.

814
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,765
Hello, I'm Chinese cuisine chef
Lu Chinglai.

815
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:27,187
My seniors are all here,
and it's certainly a valuable experience.

816
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,024
I wish all of you the best of luck.
You can do it!

817
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,150
We do it!

818
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,863
In this battle,
as we have a special panel of judges,

819
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,158
the decision of each and every judge

820
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:43,329
will have a major impact on the results.

821
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,749
They're all chefs.
They know about cooking.

822
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,126
They've been on the receiving end
of this before,

823
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,795
so I expect they'll give
very sharp criticism.

824
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:56,050
They'll have a keener palate
than ordinary people.

825
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,137
So, this won't be easy.
We should really brace ourselves.

826
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,390
Please select your three best chefs

827
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,477
who will bear the team's fate
on their shoulders.

828
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,230
It is time to announce

829
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,108
the three best chefs from each team.

830
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,737
From Team White Spoon, Son Jong-won.

831
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,159
I told myself not to get complacent.

832
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,827
I want to win big.

833
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,497
Jung Ho-young.

834
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,707
Sam Kim.

835
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,464
Their team seemed pretty tough too.

836
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,591
Our lineup is more original.

837
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,678
From Team Black Spoon, Culinary Monster.

838
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,014
-You got this!
-Our best chef.

839
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,517
Well, I insisted that I had to do it.

840
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,811
We have to win no matter what.

841
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,896
Barbecue Lab Director.

842
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,898
Knife Omakase.

843
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,446
I wasn't really…

844
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,782
I mean, of course,
their best stepped forward.

845
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,494
But rather than worry about their dish,
I was focused on ours.

846
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:09,164
I wasn't bothered at all.
I'm the one who has to do well anyways.

847
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,918
In this three-on-three Battle of the Best,

848
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,171
Judges Paik and Anh have selected

849
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,382
a hidden ingredient.

850
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,842
-What?
-Things have changed.

851
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,928
…a hidden ingredient.

852
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,097
-What?
-Not those?

853
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,433
The discussion for our dish
was for nothing.

854
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,018
We talked it over a hundred times though.

855
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,687
Man, they can't do this.

856
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,690
I got really angry.

857
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,025
We saw the remaining ingredients,

858
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,778
so we thought of
tens of thousands of recipes.

859
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,781
We kept thinking
about all the possibilities.

860
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:48,120
But then, the hidden ingredient came up,
and I got really angry.

861
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,539
I don't know why you keep things hidden.

862
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,374
I was hidden too.

863
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,294
Why do they keep hiding stuff?

864
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,672
Once the hidden ingredient is revealed,

865
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:03,760
each team must pick one ingredient
from the Wheel of Fate that will pair well

866
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,721
with the hidden ingredient.

867
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,808
Combining the hidden ingredient
with their selected ingredient,

868
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:14,104
each team must create their best dish
for this final battle.

869
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,105
What will it be?

870
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:17,691
What is it?

871
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:21,987
We will first reveal

872
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,616
the hidden ingredient
selected by the judges.

873
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,951
-It must be in there.
-It's shiny.

874
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,244
What's under the shiny cover?

875
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:48,263
We will first reveal
the hidden ingredient.

876
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,309
It's tofu.

877
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,603
-Tofu?
-What? Tofu?

878
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,522
-It's tofu.
-Tofu!

879
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,773
-What is it?
-Tofu.

880
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,358
-What is it?
-It's tofu.

881
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,693
-Tofu.
-Tofu.

882
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,279
-That long-term storytelling is wicked!
-Tofu!

883
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,499
-Goodness.
-That's funny.

884
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,667
THE HIDDEN INGREDIENT, TOFU

885
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,794
If you go take any exam,

886
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,004
you never get a question
from the previous exam.

887
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,508
Tofu? In a mission this important?

888
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,426
You didn't expect to see
tofu again, did you?

889
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,136
-No.
-I was so shocked.

890
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,348
You can't let your guard down.
Please make us a delicious dish.

891
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,645
Last season,
after eating 27 dishes of tofu…

892
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,774
I've also been steering clear of tofu.

893
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,860
That's why today,

894
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:47,072
I'm expecting great things
from our best chefs.

895
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,909
Seeing this tofu
makes me want to cook again.

896
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,922
However, the eight special judges

897
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:08,719
will not be observing your cooking process
to ensure fair judging.

898
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,931
They will not know which team
made which dish.

899
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:17,352
Only taste will decide the outcome.

900
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,396
-That's fair.
-It is.

901
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,066
Please lower the blinds
for the special judges.

902
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:26,612
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

903
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,156
-You can do it!
-Hang in there!

904
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,365
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

905
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,914
The eight special judges,
please make your way out.

906
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,335
-Gosh.
-Good luck with observing.

907
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,420
All the best.

908
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:58,268
Now, each team will discuss
amongst yourselves

909
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:02,898
and choose one main ingredient
that pairs well with tofu

910
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,108
from the Wheel of Fate.

911
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:09,488
Out of the eight remaining ingredients,
you can select any ingredient,

912
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,698
whether it's from the land or the sea.

913
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,369
However, as Team White Spoon
won the second battle,

914
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,746
they have the right to pick first.

915
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:21,625
The cooking time for this three-on-three
Battle of the Best is 60 minutes.

916
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,127
It'll depend
on which ingredient they pick.

917
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,962
It will completely change the game.

918
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,716
We can go with our original plan.

919
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,593
Let's do as we planned.

920
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:36,306
There's a dish with a bunch of lime
laid out over somyeon noodles.

921
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,893
It's a dish with a very tangy, sour broth.

922
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,562
We decided to fit
whatever we got into this dish.

923
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,814
Since we were losing,

924
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,149
I told my team members
in the third battle…

925
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,779
If he can demonstrate
that level of determination,

926
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,448
I thought we should put our trust in him.

927
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,534
We ended up getting tofu.
Okay, then…

928
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:57,994
Tofu?

929
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,500
The hidden ingredient
selected by the two judges…

930
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,210
-We'll blend the tofu with tsuyu.
-Yeah.

931
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,045
-Like kong-guksu.
-That's a nice idea.

932
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,381
Don't make the soybean soup too thick.
Keep it clean.

933
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,801
We'll blend the tofu
and make it like a refreshing kong-guksu.

934
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,429
Making the cold soup with tofu
sounds really good.

935
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,388
I agree.

936
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,474
We might overlap again
with the other team though.

937
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,810
-Then, we'll win with flavor.
-Ours can just be tastier.

938
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,978
-Right.
-It can't be helped.

939
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,148
-This is pretty hard.
-It is.

940
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,944
Tofu.

941
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:36,408
"Why did it have to be tofu?"
That's what I thought.

942
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,368
Tofu isn't an easy ingredient.

943
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,163
It's already a perfect ingredient,
so to do something to it…

944
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,331
What can make tofu shine?

945
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,752
The important thing is that you three
cook something you're confident in.

946
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,130
Suddenly, the pressure really hit me.

947
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,799
Depending on whether we win or lose,

948
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,719
we all survive or we all get eliminated.

949
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,891
To make sure
all the White Spoon chefs advance,

950
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:06,062
we need to make a truly outstanding dish.

951
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,106
We can only win

952
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,943
by letting the ingredient shine
while adding a depth of flavor.

953
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:16,239
Team White Spoon has chosen rockfish.

954
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:19,951
Rockfish?

955
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,790
Up until the end, we couldn't decide
between that and veal bone-in sirloin.

956
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,043
But in the end, we went with rockfish.

957
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,295
But veal tastes completely different.

958
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,755
The meat is tough and dry.

959
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,632
-Because there's no fat?
-There's none.

960
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:34,800
Because it's a young calf.

961
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,552
Tofu and rockfish taste good together,
don't they?

962
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,513
Tofu and rockfish.

963
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,847
-Tofu and rockfish.
-What?

964
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,140
How will you cook those two?

965
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:43,850
What I had in mind was

966
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,979
mixing the tofu
with some thinly sliced vegetables.

967
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,608
It's a bit like a fish cake.
We grill the rockfish and put it on top.

968
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:56,112
We make a Japanese dashi broth
for a thick sauce to pour over it.

969
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,240
There's a Japanese dish
called kenchin-mushi.

970
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:03,703
It's made by finely straining tofu,
mixing in ingredients, and steaming it.

971
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,289
With the rockfish on top
and the tofu underneath,

972
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,583
you can enjoy
the delicious rockfish, the soft tofu,

973
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:12,087
and the rich flavor of the sauce.

974
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:16,758
Ultimately, tofu is an ingredient
that's good at absorbing flavors.

975
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,677
So I think seafood
will pair better with it.

976
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,303
We need to pick the second ingredient.

977
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,098
-I think the sirloin will be good.
-Sirloin?

978
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:27,352
I think sirloin wouldn't be a bad idea.
We can serve it cold and thinly sliced.

979
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,854
But we only have an hour.

980
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:32,023
Can we cook, chill,
and slice it to serve cold?

981
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,818
I think we could slice it
at the 50 to 55-minute mark.

982
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,488
-That's too tight.
-I think 20 minutes would be enough.

983
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:42,158
Is it too risky?
Because I'm confident I can do it in time.

984
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,618
If you're confident, do it.

985
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,412
-Yeah, I can do it.
-Let's do sirloin.

986
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,039
Team Black Spoon

987
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,876
has chosen veal bone-in sirloin.

988
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,675
Why? Why did they choose bone-in sirloin?

989
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,468
It's not easy to cook in a short time.

990
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,055
To be honest, when it comes to meat,
he's probably the best

991
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,348
among all the contestants.

992
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,768
Doing what he does best

993
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,729
will help the team.

994
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:14,524
The garnish will be thin strips
of fried tofu and the veal,

995
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,860
and they'll eat that with the lime slices.

996
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,862
It's a cold noodle dish,

997
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:22,991
so it's like eating naengmyeon
with slices of meat.

998
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,618
COLD TOFU SOBA
WITH SLICED VEAL SIRLOIN

999
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,287
Lime is often paired with seafood,

1000
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:30,373
so it'll give a whole new taste
when eaten with meat.

1001
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,958
They're all food connoisseurs.

1002
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,711
I'm going to win over their taste buds.

1003
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,546
The votes are worth more,
so we can win.

1004
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,590
-Let's make a comeback.
-Just have fun.

1005
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,508
Yeah, have fun. Enjoy it.

1006
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,260
-Hands up on three.
-One, two, three.

1007
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,428
Let's go!

1008
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,930
Go, White Spoons!

1009
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,097
Let's do this!

1010
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,601
I hope we advance.

1011
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,480
But our fate lies with…
Is that why they did this?

1012
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,565
-The Wheel of Fate?
-The Wheel of Fate.

1013
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,317
We're all riding this together.

1014
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,945
And now,

1015
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,448
the Black and White Spoons'
Team Battle, All or Nothing.

1016
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,450
The three-on-three Battle of the Best.

1017
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,869
The third culinary battle begins now.

1018
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,122
Let's go!

1019
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,627
-A comeback win!
-Let's go!

1020
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,212
Not a chance!

1021
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,966
We just have to avoid losing
70 to 30 in score.

1022
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,175
We have the advantage,

1023
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:25,387
but I never thought,
"We can take it easy and still win."

1024
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,846
Because you never know with this.

1025
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,975
I was confident we could win,
but we had to win by a lot.

1026
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,559
And that's another matter altogether.

1027
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,645
Gosh, this is really fresh.

1028
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,314
They're huge.

1029
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,111
It seems Sam Kim
is prepping the rockfish.

1030
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,906
You're right. That's actually good.

1031
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,492
A Western cuisine chef
should handle the filleting.

1032
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,249
This is a recipe
only Chef Jung Ho-young knows.

1033
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,168
I thought I should help him
in every way I could.

1034
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,378
I'll prep the fish.

1035
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,339
You should focus on other parts
as the main chef.

1036
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,260
I think you should focus
on the main sauce.

1037
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,512
-These need to be julienned.
-I'll do that.

1038
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,055
Blanch the tofu and mix them.

1039
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:13,101
I was determined to support him
in any way I could to make this a success.

1040
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,770
Chef Jung, please tell me
if you need to boil water.

1041
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,772
I need boiling water to blanch the tofu.

1042
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,734
Here's one for grilling too.

1043
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,338
From my experience,
the start was really important.

1044
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,176
So in the third battle,
I was really focused

1045
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:50,513
on getting off to a steady start
and dealing with the rest as we went.

1046
00:55:56,728 --> 00:56:00,648
I had faith that Barbecue Lab Director
would take care of the veal,

1047
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:05,153
so I thought the sirloin
was the best choice.

1048
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,541
Veal isn't like beef,
which is marbled with fat.

1049
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:22,962
It doesn't have that rich, fatty flavor
that beef has.

1050
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:31,179
It's actually more like pork loin.
It's just a lump of lean meat.

1051
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:35,517
It'll be different from the cuts
Barbecue Lab Director is used to.

1052
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,518
-Exactly.
-Yes.

1053
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,104
-There's no marbling.
-Right.

1054
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,314
There's not much meaty aroma either.

1055
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,399
-Yes, you're right.
-Yes, so…

1056
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,984
I'm curious to see what he will do.

1057
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,244
Cooking the meat all the way through

1058
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,748
will probably make it really dry
and not very tasty.

1059
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:03,002
So I seared it quickly over the gas flame.

1060
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:09,968
Then, I planned to cook it quickly
in a pressure cooker.

1061
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,098
I want to slice it
when it's medium to medium-rare.

1062
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:23,273
I was confident I could cook the meat
as we discussed within that time,

1063
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,316
so I wasn't worried about time at all.

1064
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,946
We planned to fry the tofu
at a low temperature for a long time

1065
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:34,117
to use as a garnish on top of the dish.

1066
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,327
I tasked Culinary Monster with it.

1067
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,540
-Tell me what to do next.
-The next thing?

1068
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,417
One second, please.

1069
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,544
Should I press the tofu?

1070
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,672
I blanched it,
so you can just squeeze it.

1071
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:54,512
SQUEEZE WATER OUT OF THE TOFU
THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE COLD SOUP

1072
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,645
-I'll squeeze three cubes.
-Okay.

1073
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:07,025
-Tell me what to do next.
-Okay. Can you strain this?

1074
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,867
Anything else?

1075
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,160
Anything else…

1076
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,287
Not really at the moment.

1077
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,830
How's the tofu?

1078
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,249
It's being fried.

1079
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,585
Give us instructions.
We have nothing to do.

1080
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,295
-You have nothing to do?
-Order away.

1081
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,255
Should we squeeze some limes?

1082
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,423
The lime juice.

1083
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,760
-That's for one person. What about me?
-I'll use this. Should I squeeze them?

1084
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,345
Yes. Do that and…

1085
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,639
The tofu and…

1086
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,723
What about me?

1087
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,184
One second.

1088
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,020
Those two are just
really different in styles.

1089
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:48,358
Right from the start,
I think I was a little worried.

1090
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,944
But you have to do everything.
The broth and the noodles.

1091
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,403
We have to do it together.

1092
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,364
-I'll do the scoring.
-No, no.

1093
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,491
We need to clearly divide the work.

1094
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,409
-We only have 60 minutes.
-Of course, we will.

1095
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,828
"If you need help, I'll back you up."
We can't do that.

1096
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,997
With only 60 minutes,
we have to stick to our jobs.

1097
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:04,999
I can back you up.

1098
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,380
-I'll do it.
-No, let's decide now.

1099
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:14,092
Their cooking styles
are completely different too.

1100
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:19,806
Knife Omakase wanted to divide up
the needed tasks as things happened,

1101
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:24,352
whereas Culinary Monster
wanted to decide everything first.

1102
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:28,398
Since their styles are so different,
I wondered if this would work.

1103
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,983
Should I cut the green onions?

1104
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,651
-Rather than green onions…
-The garnish?

1105
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,237
Let's slice some gim to place on top.

1106
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,863
-Like kizami nori?
-Like kizami nori.

1107
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,116
Do it If you have time.

1108
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,914
The key point is

1109
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:48,418
that the tofu is a lot softer
than the tofu people are used to.

1110
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,921
We blanch the tofu in boiling water,

1111
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,716
remove as much moisture as possible,

1112
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,968
add a bit of starch,

1113
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,307
and add some thinly sliced vegetables.

1114
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,021
-Here.
-Okay. Put that in.

1115
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,823
Since the tofu is cooked
with eggs and vegetables,

1116
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,367
it has a soft and delicate texture.

1117
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,788
The tofu is wrapped in plastic wrap
and shaped into a ball.

1118
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,755
-Like this?
-Yes.

1119
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,349
Chef Jung, the fish is ready.

1120
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,392
What should I do next?

1121
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,562
Next, please prepare those for searing.

1122
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,230
They're working well together.

1123
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:55,568
They're all perfectly executing
what they're good at.

1124
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,320
-Right.
-That's so reassuring to see.

1125
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,697
The tofu's all fried.

1126
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,866
Is it crispy?

1127
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:04,077
All we need is the texture.

1128
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,536
-Is it crispy?
-Yes.

1129
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,790
It's nice. It'll be crispier
when it cools down.

1130
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:10,541
The tofu and the gim are done.

1131
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,961
We're almost done.
We just need to focus on the timing.

1132
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,756
-Tell me if you need me to do anything.
-Okay.

1133
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,809
THE PRESSURE COOKER WITH VEAL INSIDE

1134
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,477
It's been five minutes. Turn it off.

1135
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,978
Isn't it too short? A bit more…

1136
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,439
-No, just five minutes.
-I think it'll be fine.

1137
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,483
-It's better if it's pink.
-Okay.

1138
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,950
How long until the veal is ready?

1139
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,035
The veal? When there's 15 minutes left.

1140
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,079
It's going in cold water now to chill.

1141
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,332
To cut the veal within an hour,
I need to cook it

1142
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,752
and also make sure to cool it down.

1143
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:59,257
I was aiming for medium to medium-rare.
At least medium-rare.

1144
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,485
It's really rare inside.

1145
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,239
I was really thrown off
when I took out the veal. It was…

1146
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,032
bright red.

1147
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:26,951
Did it not cook?

1148
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,953
Which part is undercooked?

1149
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,246
-The inner part.
-Right.

1150
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:33,249
-Because it was attached.
-Is it the part near the bone?

1151
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,543
Should I pan sear the surface a bit more?

1152
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,130
-It's way too rare.
-This part was attached here.

1153
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:43,009
Obviously, he's the best
when it comes to barbecue in Korea.

1154
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,928
I expected him to cook the meat perfectly.

1155
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,349
I don't think this will work. This…

1156
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,935
I'll cook it again in the pressure cooker.
What do you think?

1157
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,854
I'll cook it here. It's still hot.

1158
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,983
It's not cooked at all.

1159
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,699
The veal's the most pressing thing.

1160
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,284
It's the most urgent issue.

1161
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,911
I'll try to get it done in time.

1162
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,752
We need to fry the green onions now.

1163
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,965
FRIED GREEN ONIONS FOR THE GARNISH

1164
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,427
We need to heat some oil
and fry the green onions.

1165
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,013
It's much cleaner
if you coat it in flour before frying.

1166
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,352
The large green onions!

1167
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,312
-Use a strainer first.
-Okay.

1168
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,445
The color is too strong.
Don't fry them now!

1169
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,531
Okay, we still have time.

1170
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:51,244
Ultimately, everyone watching from above
is connected too.

1171
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:56,499
I figured I should just think of myself
as playing in the game too.

1172
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,670
If I don't shout out now,
I'll regret it later.

1173
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,297
I think the temperature of the oil
is too hot right now.

1174
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,383
-So just turn it down.
-Okay.

1175
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,343
Are you going to make
the starch slurry later?

1176
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,303
-I'll get it ready now.
-Okay.

1177
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:12,265
There's smoked paprika over there too!

1178
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,641
Shout it out now

1179
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,726
when you still have the chance.

1180
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,228
I'll start cooking the fish.

1181
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,151
Just cook it with salt and pepper,

1182
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,820
like you do in Western cuisine.

1183
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:38,958
The fish firmed up
because the flesh was really fresh.

1184
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:52,179
With rockfish,

1185
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:55,182
you can't let it dry out,
so how you grill it is important.

1186
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,814
The skin should be crispy,

1187
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,609
while the flesh is tender and juicy.

1188
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:10,323
Chef Son Jong-won cooked it perfectly
in the style of Western cuisine.

1189
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,497
I think it's almost ready.

1190
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,057
How's the veal?

1191
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,393
I think it'll be ready in time.
I'll just cook it here for a bit.

1192
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,104
-It should be fully cooked.
-Then, chill for two minutes. What?

1193
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,231
-Have it fully cooked.
-Okay. I'll cook it more.

1194
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,359
It's still too rare.

1195
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,485
Much too rare.

1196
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:53,240
Please check.
We need to cook it a bit faster.

1197
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,660
-He is cooking it.
-What?

1198
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:59,288
-He's cooking it right now.
-I think it'd cook quicker in the broth.

1199
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,917
I think it'll be fine.

1200
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,961
If I keep turning it
for another three minutes,

1201
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,712
I should be able to make time.

1202
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,674
-Is the lime all sliced?
-Almost.

1203
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,885
-You need to tell me what to do.
-What?

1204
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:16,764
We have to cut the veal.
We're waiting on the veal.

1205
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:20,142
How can we cut it? It's not even cooked.
It needs to be chilled.

1206
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,937
I've always worked in fine dining,

1207
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:26,023
so I believe the process is important,
but this was so disorganized.

1208
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,943
I'm the team leader,
so he kept demanding things from me.

1209
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:31,278
"What should I do?
Give me something to do."

1210
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,989
He can find something to do,

1211
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,616
or if there's nothing to do,
he can just sit or go home.

1212
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,952
I wanted to tell him,
"You go find something to do!"

1213
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:40,287
But that would only lead to arguing.

1214
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,540
So I just…
It was tough just holding it in.

1215
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:45,960
How can we cut it? It's not even cooked.
It needs to be chilled.

1216
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,170
Could you taste this?

1217
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,800
My eyes were fixed on the sirloin.

1218
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:55,302
Anyway, I was confident.

1219
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,595
With this piece of meat,

1220
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:59,932
I believed that I could make it work.

1221
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,394
I kept turning it
on the gas stove as I grilled it.

1222
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,073
I needed it at the right temperature,

1223
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:21,787
and I worked to cook and chill it
within the given time.

1224
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,461
-When it's ready, let's cut it together.
-Okay.

1225
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:44,852
ONCE IT FINALLY CHILLS IN THE ICE,
IT'S READY

1226
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:58,783
And then,

1227
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:00,534
the broth.

1228
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,871
I make a delicious broth with katsuobushi

1229
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,873
and blend it with tofu

1230
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:09,585
to make a nice soup
with the nutty aroma of tofu.

1231
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,088
I've never blended tofu
in soy sauce before.

1232
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,172
I wonder what it's like.

1233
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:18,677
He's mixing the blended tofu into tsuyu
to make the broth for the noodles.

1234
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:23,182
MIXING TSUYU BROTH WITH BLENDED TOFU BROTH
UNTIL THEY GET THE RIGHT RATIO

1235
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:26,977
Then, I add lime juice
for that lime aroma.

1236
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,856
That gives us a nutty and tangy broth.

1237
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,658
The broth is done.

1238
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,160
The garnish is done too.

1239
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,787
-We just need the veal now.
-Okay.

1240
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,083
How is it?

1241
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,169
-Still too rare?
-I should be able to slice it.

1242
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,921
It won't be getting any more heat anyway.

1243
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:55,673
-Right. Okay.
-Let's try slicing it.

1244
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,932
Please.

1245
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:12,773
How is it?

1246
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,741
Cooking the meat all the way through

1247
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:27,496
will probably make it really dry
and not very tasty.

1248
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,291
So it'll be served cold and sliced,
but I want it medium.

1249
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:33,127
I want to slice it
when it's medium to medium-rare.

1250
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:36,881
It's too…

1251
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,924
No, it'll be perfect here.

1252
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,218
It looks okay.
The outside will always be cooked.

1253
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,636
The problem is the inside.

1254
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,929
-It needs to be thinner.
-Okay.

1255
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,514
We need 20 pieces.

1256
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:47,975
Very good.

1257
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,020
It looks okay.

1258
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,612
The shape is a little…

1259
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:00,905
-Shall I slice it?
-Sure.

1260
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:02,156
With a sharp knife.

1261
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,921
The veal looks okay.

1262
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:19,298
Great job.

1263
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:25,471
Yes, it's really nice.

1264
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,599
-The veal's good.
-Sorry about earlier.

1265
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:31,477
-I should've played it a bit safer.
-No, no.

1266
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,192
You can cook veal this perfectly?

1267
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,069
In just an hour?

1268
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,072
That's ten sets.

1269
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,083
Man, this is hot.

1270
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,543
We have ten fillets done now.

1271
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:59,129
I'm making two more.

1272
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:04,760
-I'll open these. I'm good at it.
-Kind of like this.

1273
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:07,805
-If we place it on top like this…
-Right.

1274
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:10,641
-I think this looks okay too.
-It's good.

1275
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:12,101
-It looks good.
-Like this?

1276
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,562
Let's try tasting a finished one.

1277
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:18,107
The sauce is ready. Let's drizzle it on.

1278
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,821
I'm not sure
if we should add ginger or not.

1279
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,489
-I'll have a taste first.
-Okay.

1280
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,539
-It definitely needs ginger.
-It's sweet.

1281
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,457
It's a little too sweet right now.

1282
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:37,126
Too sweet?

1283
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,253
-It's a bit sweet.
-It's a bit sweet.

1284
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:45,175
After making the katsuobushi broth,
it's reduced to a sweet, thick sauce.

1285
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:50,347
But it came out sweeter than expected,
so we had to figure out what to do.

1286
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,808
-What should we do? Add soy sauce?
-Add acidity.

1287
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,476
-Okay? Acidity.
-Acidity?

1288
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,603
How about using lime zest for that?

1289
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,688
Exactly.

1290
01:11:57,771 --> 01:12:00,149
And where's the ginger?

1291
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,067
-We should try it with the ginger.
-Here.

1292
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,527
That already has ginger.

1293
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:04,737
It needs more.

1294
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:09,616
The lime's good, right?

1295
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,328
If we grate some ginger and lime,

1296
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,704
-it should be perfect.
-Okay.

1297
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:15,414
Then, I'll grate both with a Microplane.

1298
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,458
Taste that one with the lime added in.

1299
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:19,793
It's much better.

1300
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,171
With the lime is good.

1301
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,672
Ginger and lime.

1302
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,632
-I'll clean out this plate.
-Okay.

1303
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:29,595
To balance the flavors,
I thought we needed some acidity.

1304
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:30,929
It's about making improvements.

1305
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:34,683
I'll start plating.

1306
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,810
-Broth first?
-Yes, broth first.

1307
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:41,690
-This much? One ladle?
-Yes, perfect.

1308
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:48,906
On top,

1309
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:50,866
fried tofu.

1310
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:52,993
The fried tofu looks good.

1311
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,537
-It was a good idea.
-It's super crispy.

1312
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,749
If you do the tofu, I'll start plating.

1313
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:07,716
Check the rockfish for bones again!

1314
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,051
-Rockfish bones.
-Near the head.

1315
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,552
Do it like this.

1316
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,598
-The fish is cooked perfectly.
-Thank you.

1317
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:17,267
-This is enough, right?
-Yes.

1318
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:19,978
Add the green onions.

1319
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:25,109
-All done, right?
-Yes.

1320
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:29,863
They finished quickly.

1321
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:39,623
-Well done.
-Great job.

1322
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,251
-Great job. Sorry, I panicked.
-Well done!

1323
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:43,752
-Great job!
-Great job!

1324
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,003
You did it.

1325
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:46,922
You did a great job.

1326
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:49,174
They need to serve the dishes now.

1327
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:52,136
Should we add
just two drops of lime juice at the end?

1328
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:54,638
Yes, I think a bit of lime would be good.

1329
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:57,266
-I'll take them after you add the juice.
-Okay.

1330
01:13:58,058 --> 01:13:59,309
Okay.

1331
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,310
Great job.

1332
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:11,655
3-ON-3 BATTLE OF THE BEST
END OF COOKING

1333
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:13,073
-Well, we're done.
-We did it.

1334
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,242
-Well done!
-They did great.

1335
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,704
-You were amazing.
-Gosh, that was…

1336
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,581
Their team…

1337
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,624
I think they blended the tofu.

1338
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,209
They blended the tofu.

1339
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,044
But will the meat and tofu

1340
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,547
-pair well like that?
-I think it'll be a bit off.

1341
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,425
I think they were a bit careless,
but who knows?

1342
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,969
To be honest, I was a bit puzzled.

1343
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:37,389
Why is it so simple?

1344
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:41,560
Because a cold dish is
always easier to put together.

1345
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:45,189
They could've done more,
so why did they only do that much?

1346
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,524
We'll probably win again.

1347
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:49,818
I saw their dish.

1348
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,821
It was pretty well put together.

1349
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,616
That made me a bit nervous.

1350
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:58,702
Now, the eight special judges,

1351
01:14:58,785 --> 01:15:00,829
please re-enter.

1352
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:14,718
I'm nervous.

1353
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:17,179
Of course, you are.

1354
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:20,182
The result hinges on us.

1355
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:25,521
Now, please open the blinds.

1356
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,248
As mentioned before,

1357
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,583
the eight special judges

1358
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:50,796
will taste the dishes without knowing
which team has made them.

1359
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:54,466
Gosh, they covered everything up. Damn.

1360
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:58,887
They covered things, so we can't see
or guess what they've done.

1361
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:11,358
Damn.

1362
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:13,318
I can't believe
how complete these dishes are.

1363
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:16,947
They're different.

1364
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:20,492
The two are polar opposites.
Their styles are completely different.

1365
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:28,875
I smell a citrus aroma.

1366
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,462
This one has a nutty aroma.

1367
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:34,965
Is this rockfish?

1368
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,052
Rockfish is a tough one.

1369
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,390
It's a grilled rockfish
that's crispy yet tender

1370
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:47,394
with soft steamed tofu underneath.

1371
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:51,231
When they take a big spoonful
of the sweet sauce

1372
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:53,025
and eat it with the rockfish and tofu,

1373
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:58,280
this will bring us luck
and lead us to victory,

1374
01:16:58,363 --> 01:16:59,948
so we named it
"Lucky Bonbon Rockfish."

1375
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:16,632
The sauce is nice and salty.

1376
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,071
It's nice with the fried green onions.

1377
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,864
-The green onion is the key here.
-Yeah.

1378
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:43,742
It connects everything together.

1379
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:46,244
-It ties everything together.
-It pulls everything in.

1380
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,330
FRIED LARGE GREEN ONIONS

1381
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:55,379
When I saw the White Spoon chefs' dish,
I could imagine the flavor.

1382
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:56,838
A sweet sauce,

1383
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,549
warm temperature,
and the softness of tofu.

1384
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:01,718
They seemed to have done well.

1385
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,137
What's underneath? Noodles?

1386
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,764
-Noodles, right?
-Noodles.

1387
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,518
Is it kong-guksu?

1388
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:14,690
It's kind of like the naengmyeon we eat
at the end of a meal in Korea.

1389
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,109
We blended the hidden ingredient, tofu,

1390
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:20,612
made a nutty and tangy broth,

1391
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,490
and lastly, added thinly sliced veal,

1392
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,576
so they can all be enjoyed together.

1393
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,704
TEAM BLACK SPOON
THE FINALE NOODLES

1394
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,124
Doesn't this bring back memories?

1395
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:33,500
FRIED TOFU

1396
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,213
It's really crispy.

1397
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:49,141
The noodles taste different
from what I expected.

1398
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,350
-That one?
-Yeah.

1399
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,162
Is it good?

1400
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:12,372
This is really good.

1401
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,002
Tofu itself is quite bland.

1402
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:20,464
But they elevated it
with a tangy, refreshing flavor.

1403
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:22,883
-That idea.
-Yes, it's so good.

1404
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,177
When they were tasting the dishes,

1405
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,929
you could kind of see
which ones they're eating.

1406
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,185
But they were really enjoying
Team Black Spoon's dish.

1407
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,735
All I could see were noodles.

1408
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:44,196
But from the way
they were eating those noodles…

1409
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,740
ALL EATING NOODLES

1410
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:49,826
It made me wonder how it tasted
for them to enjoy it so much.

1411
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:53,497
I watched Cooking Maniac,

1412
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,917
and he kept eating the noodles.

1413
01:19:57,584 --> 01:20:00,003
So I thought maybe our dish
was really delicious.

1414
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:03,131
But then, he went and ate
Team White Spoon's dish again.

1415
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,382
This is too difficult.

1416
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:14,810
So I figured he was just hungry.

1417
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,062
This is for sure

1418
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:20,315
a battle of the best.

1419
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:22,818
These two are completely different
in character,

1420
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:25,737
but they both have their own strengths.

1421
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,989
-That's so true.
-I really can't decide.

1422
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:31,326
This one has its own charm,
and so does this one.

1423
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:46,424
But it's clear they're both delicious.

1424
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,430
It's time to begin voting
for the third battle.

1425
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:56,935
If you preferred the dish on the left,
press button number 1.

1426
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,563
Please.

1427
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:04,234
If you preferred the dish on the right,
press button number 2.

1428
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,488
Please vote now.

1429
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:20,417
Please let Chef Choi Kang-rok
avenge his loss!

1430
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,918
Please let him advance.

1431
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:24,296
I don't mind losing the next round
if I win this one.

1432
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:25,714
-Gosh.
-Seriously.

1433
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:31,386
The ten judges have all cast their votes.

1434
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:35,348
Thank you for making
such delicious dishes.

1435
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:38,518
To start, the first dish

1436
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:43,273
had a classic, steady feel to the flavor,
as if it came from experience.

1437
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:46,318
The second dish on the right

1438
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:49,988
felt quite daring
with a unique approach behind it.

1439
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,824
But I focused more
on how the ingredients came together,

1440
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,702
and that's where I gave extra points
in making my decision.

1441
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:59,205
First, the noodles.

1442
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:02,584
I really enjoyed
how it all came together in one bite.

1443
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,253
And this broth… I want to keep eating it.

1444
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:07,881
But this sea creature…

1445
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:09,925
"Sea creature."

1446
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:14,179
It has that nice crunch,

1447
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,307
and it's so tender and delicious.

1448
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:22,938
The first dish has
that familiar sweetness.

1449
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,023
But it also has a savory, rich taste,

1450
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:28,443
-making it very elegant in flavor.
-Yeah, the flavor itself.

1451
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:32,572
As for The Finale Noodles,

1452
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:36,493
I assumed you had used tofu
to imitate kong-guksu

1453
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:39,704
and expected a pretty familiar taste.

1454
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,581
But it was really unfamiliar.

1455
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,500
It felt foreign,

1456
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:47,170
but it also left me salivating
and wanting more.

1457
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:50,006
It was quite a unique discovery.

1458
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:53,843
Everyone gave positive feedback,

1459
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:58,390
but I'd like to point out the negatives.

1460
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:01,768
The first dish used rockfish,

1461
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:05,105
but the seasoning
on the ankake sauce was too strong.

1462
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:09,901
So the sweetness
was too overpowering for me,

1463
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:13,822
and I couldn't really taste

1464
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:16,741
the flavor of the rockfish much.

1465
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,326
As for the second dish,

1466
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:23,456
it should've paired well with the tofu,

1467
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:27,335
but I couldn't really taste the veal.

1468
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,379
If you had added a little more
in some other way,

1469
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:33,758
you might've gotten more use
out of this ingredient.

1470
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,761
I just wanted to point these out
before moving on.

1471
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,179
Thank you for the dishes.

1472
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,806
I was so nervous.

1473
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:43,351
I just wanted the moment to pass quickly.

1474
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,979
I was just…

1475
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:47,605
I couldn't even look.

1476
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,277
This will make or break them right here.

1477
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,404
It's so harsh to eliminate
all of them in one go.

1478
01:23:54,487 --> 01:23:55,989
-Well done, Chef.
-Great job.

1479
01:23:56,072 --> 01:23:57,198
Good work.

1480
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:01,870
Well done. Good job.

1481
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,080
Well done.

1482
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:07,042
-I wonder who will win.
-You did great.

1483
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:12,589
The third Black and White Spoons'
Team Battle, All or Nothing.

1484
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:15,675
In the first battle…

1485
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,970
Team Black Spoon earned 34 points.

1486
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,639
Team White Spoon earned 66 points.

1487
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,641
In the second battle…

1488
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,769
FIVE-ON-FIVE FACE-OFF

1489
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:27,896
Team Black Spoon earned 48 points.

1490
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,648
Team White Spoon earned 52 points.

1491
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,028
Currently, the total scores are…

1492
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,614
Team Black Spoon, 82 points.

1493
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:40,033
Team White Spoon, 118 points.

1494
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:44,579
Team White Spoon is leading by 36 points.

1495
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:49,250
So the White Spoons won everything.

1496
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,628
The White Spoons have been dominant.

1497
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:55,965
In this round,
the currently trailing Team Black Spoon

1498
01:24:56,049 --> 01:25:00,470
must score over 37 points
to win from behind.

1499
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:06,726
When we calculated the points,

1500
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,603
seven judges had to pick us

1501
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:10,730
out of ten.

1502
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:16,069
We won the first two battles,

1503
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:19,989
but if we lose by a big margin
in the third battle,

1504
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,200
they could take the round from us.

1505
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:23,993
Before the results are announced,

1506
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:26,663
we will reveal to the special judges

1507
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:30,125
which team made which dish.

1508
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,918
I'm dying to know.

1509
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:35,880
The first dish on the left
was made by Team White Spoon.

1510
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:39,717
The second dish on the right
was made by Team Black Spoon.

1511
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:50,436
Now, we will reveal the voting results.

1512
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:53,606
First,

1513
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:57,068
please reveal the vote of Jang Ho-joon.

1514
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,321
Wasn't this an anonymous vote?

1515
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:01,239
Nope.

1516
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:04,826
This is the most nerve-racking moment
of this entire day.

1517
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,288
Please reveal the vote of Jang Ho-joon.

1518
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,629
Jang Ho-joon has chosen Team Black Spoon.

1519
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:22,510
Really?

1520
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:23,553
And so, currently,

1521
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:25,263
Team White Spoon, 118 points.

1522
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:27,682
Team Black Spoon, 92 points.

1523
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:32,061
Next, please reveal the vote
of Jung Ji-sun.

1524
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,408
It was Team Black Spoon?

1525
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:51,539
No way.

1526
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,334
And so, currently,

1527
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:56,044
Team Black Spoon, 102 points.

1528
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:58,588
Team White Spoon, 118 points.

1529
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:02,175
We're 16 points behind.
We just need two more votes.

1530
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,470
Please reveal the vote of Lu Chinglai.

1531
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:10,183

Just two more.

1553
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:35,727
Seriously?

01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,813

Now, Team Black Spoon has taken the lead.

1558
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:54,162
We're in the lead now!

1559
01:28:54,245 --> 01:28:55,204
We're winning.

1560
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:57,957
As soon as we overtook them,
I was so shocked.

1561
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:01,044
I was like,
"What? Are we going to win? We won!"

1562
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:04,547
Since the points were going up by ten,
we closed the gap quickly.

1563
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,549
We might actually have a chance to win.

1564
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:08,843
We're in big trouble.

1565
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:10,762
This is really bad.

1566
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,431
I was having fun watching,

1567
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:16,768
and then, I suddenly realized
we could lose.

1568
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:20,688
I felt like it was all my fault.

1569
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:24,317
Rather than being scattered,
all the votes came from one side.

1570
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,361
So when I thought about the other side,

1571
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:28,613
I got a bit scared.

1572
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:31,574

If we get one more vote, we win.

1587
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:39,559
-Both votes need to be for us.
-Then, we win?

1588
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:42,145
Yes, but if even one
isn't for us, we lose.

1589
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,149
Please reveal the vote
of Cooking Maniac.

1590
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:48,151
White Spoon.

1591
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:52,947
-Please reveal the vote.
-Make it 158.

1592
01:30:59,453 --> 01:31:00,621
We have a chance!

1593
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,874
Auntie!

1594
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,751
I can't believe it's down to one.

1595
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:13,676
What?

1596
01:31:13,759 --> 01:31:15,011
It was Black Spoon?

1597
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:17,430
We have a chance!

1598
01:31:17,513 --> 01:31:19,140
Auntie!

1599
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:20,766
We don't know yet.

1600
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,185
-Is this for real?
-Auntie!

1601
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:23,644
Please.

1602
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:27,565
Hey, we might actually pull it off.
Hold on, what's happening?

1603
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:29,734
She's on our side. It's us.

1604
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:33,613
I felt an adrenaline rush
and a surge of dopamine.

1605
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:35,406
I thought, "Are we actually going to win?"

1606
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:38,743
Is this really possible?

1607
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:42,872
I've never been this nervous
in any cooking competition before.

1608
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:44,207
And so, currently,

1609
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:46,125
Team Black Spoon, 142 points.

1610
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:48,836

1611
01:31:49,462 --> 01:31:50,796
She's going to decide it.

1612
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,507
-How did it turn out like this?
-Why am I last?

1613
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:54,508
Auntie Omakase #1!

1614
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,802

I don't think I can look.

1623
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:20,284
Please.

1624
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,578
I go to Auntie Omakase #1's
restaurant a lot.

1625
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:25,039
Please vote for us.

1626
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:26,707
Are we going home?

1627
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,918
Or are we going to stay here?

1628
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:31,754
Auntie, please! Just once!

1629
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,675
Please!

1630
01:32:35,758 --> 01:32:38,344
-Gosh, don't cry!
-Auntie!

1631
01:32:38,427 --> 01:32:41,222
Our fate was in her hands.

1632
01:32:41,305 --> 01:32:43,891
I was hoping she had voted for us.

1633
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:45,893
Please.
