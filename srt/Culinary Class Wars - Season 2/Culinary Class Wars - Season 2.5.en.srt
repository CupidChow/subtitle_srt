1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,549
The battle of Pohang monkfish.

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,092
The result is…

3
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,553
one to one.

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,847
PAIK JONG-WON, SEOUL MOTHER
ANH SUNG-JAE, JUNG HO-YOUNG

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,558
The problem is there's nothing
to fault with either of them.

6
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,476
What should we do?

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,104
Let's taste them again.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,025
Shall we vote again?

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:28,862
Okay.

10
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,281
The revote is complete.

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,908
I voted based on this tasting.

12
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,618
-Me too.
-Based on what we just tasted.

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,828
-Again.
-I forgot the past.

14
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,996
The revote result is…

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,956
The revote result is…

16
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,000
The revote result is…

17
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,210
one to one.

18
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,257
The revote result is…

19
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,634
one to one.

20
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,346
It's one to one again?

21
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,265
Again?

22
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,851
-What in the…
-What is this?

23
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,020
The result is…

24
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,021
FIRST VOTE RESULTS

25
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,022
…one to one.

26
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,565
PAIK, SEOUL MOTHER
ANH, JUNG HO-YOUNG

27
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,733
The revote result is…

28
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,777
one to one.

29
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,694
REVOTE RESULTS

30
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:13,740
PAIK JONG-WON, JUNG HO-YOUNG
ANH SUNG-JAE, SEOUL MOTHER

31
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,575
What's wrong with you?

32
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,659
What did I do?

33
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,747
People might think we're ridiculous
for going back and forth.

34
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,665
But try tasting them. It's really hard.

35
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,833
The revote result is…

36
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,960
one to one.

37
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,337
Again?

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,671
…one to one.

39
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,964
Again?

40
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,716
-Basically, no one…
-They didn't agree?

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,092
They couldn't agree.

42
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,719
The revote was also one to one?

43
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,514
-It seems they couldn't agree.
-I guess they couldn't agree.

44
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,102
I thought, "The time has come." But then…

45
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,312
It was one to one.

46
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,315
I heard it's the first time
this has ever happened.

47
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,277
Now, it's just down to a hair's breadth.

48
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,493
Then…

49
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,414
-Damn.
-This was the hardest one ever.

50
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,541
Seriously.

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,334
Really?

52
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,169
Oh, my goodness.

53
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,005
Oh, my god!

54
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,635
Oh, my gosh.

55
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,310
Contestants, please reenter.

56
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,773
Gosh.

57
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,277
-Hello.
-Oh, my gosh.

58
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,736
Hello.

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,322
If only you two hadn't faced each other.

60
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,074
Honestly.

61
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,368
These dishes would stand out anywhere.

62
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:44,247
But we had to choose only one,
so we made a tough decision.

63
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,082
Because it can't end in a tie.

64
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,256
For the Pohang monkfish battle,
the survivor is…

65
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,675
I'm sure Ho-young will win.

66
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,176
Let's go, Seoul Mother.

67
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,262
The survivor is…

68
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,812
Black Spoon Chef Seoul Mother.

69
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,564
-Really?
-Congratulations.

70
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,320
Black Spoon Chef Seoul Mother.

71
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,866
Unbelievable!

72
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,035
Black Spoon Chef Seoul Mother.

73
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:23,870
Gosh, Ho-young.

74
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,334
What a surprise.

75
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,836
After much difficulty,

76
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,255
we ultimately based our decision

77
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,550
on tasting the fish one last time,
and when we did…

78
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,761
-I tasted just the monkfish.
-Right.

79
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,597
Based on just the monkfish,
this was more tender and delicious.

80
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,640
But this was…

81
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,227
The "main ingredient" of this match

82
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,811
was monkfish.

83
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,813
It was a really subtle difference,

84
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,441
but the flesh inside the chawanmushi

85
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,652
felt a little dry.

86
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,820
If we have to decide on one dish,

87
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,864
we agreed to go
with the well-cooked monkfish.

88
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,658
It was a really subtle difference.

89
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,119
-It was really delicious.
-Yes, very delicious.

90
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,205
The spicy flavor

91
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,792
must have made
a good first impression on them.

92
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,793
That's what I thought.

93
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,338
It worked out for me
because I just picked the right item.

94
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,966
In everything else, he was outstanding.

95
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,510
I believe the dish I cooked today

96
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:25,098
was 100% to my satisfaction.

97
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,140
However…

98
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,893
Since my opponent defeated me,

99
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,813
it means her dish surpassed 100%.

100
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,524
I will return to my main profession

101
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,901
and keep working hard
in my restaurant's kitchen.

102
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,237
I'll put mine under Raymon Kim's.

103
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,117
I guess we're heading out together.

104
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,702
JUNG HO-YOUNG

105
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,870
I really do need this.

106
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,163
I want to show him

107
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,623
that his dad is a cook.

108
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,959
French Papa has survived.

109
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:57,338
FRENCH PAPA
CHEF-OWNER OF BISTROT DE YOUNTVILLE

110
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,133
I was really happy.
I didn't know I'd be this thrilled.

111
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,428
Now that I've passed the first step,

112
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,055
I want to keep going.

113
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,183
And if nothing else,
I have confidence in my cooking.

114
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,603
When I have confidence
in a dish I've made,

115
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,231
I believe I might have a chance.

116
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,817
It's a match for the ages.

117
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,611
This'll be fun. A French cuisine showdown.

118
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,947
I couldn't really look him in the eyes.

119
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,658
He's basically a living legend.

120
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,077
He's a legend among legends.

121
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,372
All of us chefs should be kneeling
and bowing before him.

122
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,668
-He brought Western cuisine to Korea.
-Exactly.

123
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,004
-French cuisine's…
-The very first generation.

124
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,633
PARK HYO-NAM
THE TENTH KOREAN MASTER HAND

125
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,635
He is Korea's…

126
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,848
very first chef to introduce
non-Korean cuisine.

127
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,017
When I first started cooking,

128
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,061
he was my role model.

129
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,855
He's one of the first-generation chefs
who represent Korea.

130
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,816
I'm Park Hyo-nam, a Korean Master Hand.

131
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,318
THE TENTH KOREAN MASTER HAND

132
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,571
I've been cooking for 47 years.

133
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,867
I was the first Korean
and non-foreign chef to work

134
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,246
as the executive chef
of a luxury hotel in Korea.

135
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,875
I'm the only chef in Korea
who has received a medal

136
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,752
from the French government.

137
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,714
As a Master Hand of Korea
who truly loves cooking,

138
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,925
I came here to offer my support

139
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,636
and to help however I can.

140
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,679
Good luck.

141
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,102
I did have French Papa in mind
as my opponent.

142
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:37,730
He's made bouillabaisse over there.

143
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,859
As a chef who also cooks French cuisine,

144
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,986
I wanted to go up against him,

145
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,489
so I was glad we were matched up.

146
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,657
FRENCH PAPA VS PARK HYO-NAM

147
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,617
A boy who's never tasted French food

148
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,577
goes on to cook French dishes,

149
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,414
captivating countless gourmets
with those dishes.

150
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,710
And in the end, he even receives
a medal from France.

151
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,380
That story had a big influence on me.

152
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,591
I was grateful I could cook with him.

153
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,719
Please begin cooking now.

154
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,767
Good luck!

155
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,895
-Good luck!
-You can do it!

156
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,491
-They're using similar ingredients.
-Yes, they're similar.

157
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,704
He's making bouillon right away.

158
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,415
SHORT BROTH
MAINLY USED FOR POACHING SEAFOOD

159
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,333
Gosh, he's doing it the classic way.

160
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,087
I think his approach will be similar.

161
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,590
What's their main ingredient?

162
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,844
SOKCHO WHELK

163
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,137
It's really interesting.

164
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,765
Korea consumes
90% of the world's whelk.

165
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,311
Figuring out how to cook
those whelks perfectly

166
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,271
is probably the most important thing.

167
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,773
They have a nice chewy texture,

168
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,443
but I personally want them to be tender.

169
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,653
So, I'll simmer them for about 50 minutes.

170
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,615
I simmer them in broth.

171
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,035
When they're chilled
and tossed in seasoning,

172
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,454
that chewy texture of whelk is pleasant.

173
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,374
But I'll be making a warm dish,
so I'm simmering them.

174
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,920
The whelks will become really tender.

175
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,009
They are neck and neck right now.

176
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,552
Whose will be more tender?

177
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,014
The whelks are sliding out well.

178
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,399
Whelks are also referred to
as "sea snails."

179
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,237
So whelks are a type of snail.

180
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,282
The French have snails in their cuisine.

181
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,202
SIGNATURE FRENCH SNAIL DISH, ESCARGOT

182
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,955
SNAILS BAKED IN THEIR SHELLS
WITH GARLIC, BUTTER, PARSLEY, ETC

183
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,708
In that case, I thought
I should approach this in a similar style.

184
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,545
It's called "Korean escargot de Sokcho."

185
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:10,049
I simmered the whelks for a long time
for that tender texture.

186
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,093
I separate the innards from the whelks.

187
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,053
BUTTER, HERBS

188
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,138
Then, I mix the innards
with herbs and butter.

189
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,725
I turn that into innards and herb butter.

190
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,563
Then, I fill the shells with that butter,

191
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,607
add in the whelk meat,
and add more herb butter.

192
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,032
This might seem quite unusual to Koreans

193
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,660
to use whelk in the same way as snails.

194
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,372
I sprinkle breadcrumbs over the top
and bake them in the oven.

195
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,624
A timeless classic.

196
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,209
Escargot.

197
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,588
A velouté sauce is a sauce
made by reducing clam stock in cream.

198
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,759
I'm going to make a sauce
that can bring out the flavor of whelk.

199
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,014
Ultimately, French cuisine
comes down to the sauces.

200
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,561
Is that gim?

201
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,229
Yeah, he's using dried seaweed.

202
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,773
I wonder what he'll do with that.

203
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,529
Seasoned gim from Korea.

204
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:18,159
I'll be using that to make the sauce.

205
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,998
Inspired by the blue seas of Sokcho,

206
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:29,170
I prepared a seasoned gim sauce
using whelks.

207
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,549
The main ingredient is whelk,

208
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,427
and the main ingredient
should never be upstaged.

209
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:41,724
I'm going to present
the timeless essence of the blue sea.

210
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,060
-He's using sesame oil too.
-Sesame oil?

211
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,145
You're right.

212
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,150
And on top of that,
I wanted to use Korean sesame oil

213
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,818
to make a French dish.

214
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,073
I believe you can easily use
Korean ingredients

215
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,533
to create flavors just as good as,

216
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,994
if not better than,
authentic French cuisine.

217
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,706
That's where I went all in on.

218
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,252
Even after all these years,
I'm amazed how Chef Park Hyo-nam

219
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,090
can still manage to present something new.

220
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,928
And you can't leave out potatoes
when it comes to Gangwon Province.

221
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,722
I'm going to make potato risotto.

222
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,558
But I'm going to make it
with potatoes instead of rice.

223
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,273
-Look at him peel.
-His peeling technique.

224
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,194
Look at Chef Park peel the potato.

225
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,947
His legendary peeling technique.

226
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,742
How does the knife move like that?

227
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,702
It must be muscle memory.

228
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,747
Europeans are amazed when they see that.

229
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,962
I really admire
how he's still able to do that.

230
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,259
His movements are so clean and precise.

231
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,760
His experience really shows.

232
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,055
Seeing this in person makes me feel…

233
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,225
When we were young,
we all wanted to do French cuisine.

234
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,645
I watched Chef Park's videos a lot.

235
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,399
He is a living legend.

236
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,154
-Despite his injured finger…
-Yes, that's right.

237
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,698
He earned and held an executive title.

238
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,284
My hand?

239
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,414
As a child, I grew up in the countryside.

240
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,332
We had to chop up feed for the cows.

241
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,710
I didn't know how to do it,
so I just went like this

242
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,754
and hurt my hand on the very first slice.

243
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,133
Because of this hand,

244
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,635
I learned to be positive.

245
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,556
I don't consider it
a disability in any way.

246
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,267
It doesn't hold me back at all
when I cook.

247
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,688
I developed my own way of holding a knife.

248
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,817
If I had to hold a pan,
I could just figure out

249
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,152
my own way of holding it.

250
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,533
Imagine if my entire hand
had been cut off.

251
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,702
Would I have been able to cook
like I wanted to?

252
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,496
I think losing only my finger

253
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,123
was an incredibly fortunate thing.

254
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,084
So because of this hand,

255
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,129
I learned to be much more positive.

256
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,926
Whenever I cooked,

257
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,429
I always did it with joy.

258
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,895
I'm making potato risotto,

259
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:37,191
so I add potatoes
to the blue crab bisque sauce I made.

260
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,193
Then, I cook it slowly

261
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,738
to a slightly undercooked texture.

262
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,368
-Gosh, he's so calm.
-He's so relaxed.

263
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,452
That's amazing.

264
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,085
Seeing him so composed

265
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,962
put even more pressure on me.

266
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,673
It's huge. That pressure of time.

267
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,717
I think he's making a vol-au-vent.

268
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,471
The only donut shapes you have
in French cuisine are vol-au-vents.

269
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,268
A HOLLOW PUFF PASTRY
STUFFED WITH VARIOUS FILLINGS

270
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,019
But he only has 25 minutes left.

271
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,145
Hurry.

272
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:21,569
As for something to accompany the dish,
people often eat it with bread in France.

273
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,365
Hurry. Let's go.

274
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,909
I'm not sure if he has enough time.

275
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,079
It went into the oven now, right?

276
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,124
That will probably be done in 12 minutes,

277
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,960
but he still has to plate it,
so it's going to be tight.

278
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,464
-Is he waiting?
-Yeah.

279
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,342
-He's at complete ease.
-So relaxed.

280
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,262
There's so much to do.

281
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,938
Chef Park Hyo-nam is plating.

282
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,704
Five minutes.

283
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,955
Three minutes.

284
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,373
Ten minutes.

285
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,547
Chef Park is done.

286
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,803
Great job, Chef!

287
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,930
Great job, sir!

288
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,141
Look at that composure.

289
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,853
Oh, no. It's still not done.

290
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,188
-Oh, no.
-This is bad.

291
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,274
He'll be dying inside if they don't rise.

292
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,944
-Please cook.
-Hurry up and cook.

293
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,028
Oh, my god.

294
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,075
Four minutes.

295
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,451
Yes, thank you.

296
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,082
They're coming out.

297
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,960
They're done.

298
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,920
The pastries rose.

299
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,005
They must be done. They're done.

300
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,723
I have 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

301
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,113
-I don't think he'll have enough time.
-Shouldn't he be plating it?

302
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,614
It's okay. 1 minute and 30 seconds.

303
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,199
-Let's go.
-You can do it.

304
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,118
-Stay relaxed.
-You can do it.

305
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,536
I wanted it cooked a little more.

306
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,870
You have one minute!

307
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,707
I want to convey the warmth in my cooking.

308
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,459
Run!

309
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,920
Quickly!

310
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,965
-Slowly!
-Do it calmly!

311
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,096
That's hot.

312
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,264
I have 17 seconds.

313
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,976
Gosh, he's almost out of time.

314
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,188
Great job!

315
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,362
Oh, my gosh.

316
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,034
-That was close.
-He made us so nervous.

317
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,790
From what I saw,
he worked hard and did really well.

318
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,001
So I want the Black Spoon chef to succeed.

319
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,003
Shall we go?

320
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,463
Yes, Chef.

321
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,216
I want him to surpass me
and become a great chef.

322
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,509
Good luck!

323
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,471
With my support,
I want him to really soar.

324
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,982
This is the battle of Sokcho whelk.

325
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,528
Now, please taste the first dish.

326
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,990
WHELK AND POTATO RISOTTO
WITH SEASONED SEAWEED SAUCE

327
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,325
It's a flavor with depth.

328
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,494
I put everything into the flavor

329
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,497
and captured the seas
of Sokcho in this dish.

330
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:12,091
I got the impression that it was
a mix of Korean and French cuisine.

331
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,469
To be honest, I could kind of feel it.

332
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,100
I felt the incredible mastery
he developed through years of experience.

333
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,385
It was cooked with potatoes.

334
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,386
Potatoes and…

335
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,763
Gim?

336
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,767
I didn't know
you could do this with whelks.

337
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,104
The texture is interesting
with the whelks and potatoes.

338
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,316
The potatoes weren't overcooked,
so they still have a bite.

339
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,777
They come together nicely as you chew.

340
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,364
It really lingers.

341
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,536
Next, please taste the second dish.

342
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,626
I think balance is
the most important thing.

343
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,463
The whelks with the herb butter sauce.

344
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,218
The vol-au-vent drizzled
with the cream sauce.

345
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:43,432
When they're combined in one bite,
it gives you a balanced burst of flavors.

346
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,058
That's what I want.

347
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,562
KOREAN ESCARGOT DE SOKCHO

348
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,906
He made escargot with whelks.

349
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,743
And not only that,
he also made vol-au-vent.

350
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,412
He did a great job.

351
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,622
A really good job.

352
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,726
This tastes familiar.

353
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,282
They're both Western cuisine, but they're…

354
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,367
different.

355
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,161
The first dish used gim in the sauce,

356
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,122
so even though it's Western cuisine,
the flavor is unique.

357
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:53,168
The second one feels like
a very familiar French dish.

358
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,461
-Yes, you're right.
-Yes.

359
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,465
If I threw a fastball with a classic dish,

360
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,301
Chef Park seems to have thrown
a curveball.

361
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,721
The voting is complete.

362
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,933
The result is…

363
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,353
two to zero.

364
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,439
…two to zero.

365
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,861
-It's two to zero.
-Two to zero.

366
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,780
Gosh.

367
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,491
It was Chef Park Hyo-nam.

368
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,452
As far as I know,

369
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,330
whelks aren't really eaten
in French cuisine.

370
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,794
With both dishes, I was surprised
whelks could be prepared like this.

371
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,795
In one dish,

372
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,715
it combined the texture
of whelks with potatoes,

373
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,384
which weren't cooked all the way through.

374
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,594
So they were a little crunchy,

375
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,764
and it contrasted with the whelk,
which made it interesting as I ate.

376
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,599
And this one used

377
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:53,937
whelks instead of snails
in a French escargot dish.

378
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,940
And as I ate, I thought,
"Why didn't I ever think of that?"

379
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,109
And I realized that was your intent.

380
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,570
They were delicious,
and I was so pleasantly shocked.

381
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,076
It's time to announce the results
of the Sokcho whelk battle.

382
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,835
The survivor
of this one-on-one face-off is…

383
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,634
White Spoon Chef Park Hyo-nam.

384
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,969
Congratulations.

385
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,721
PARK HYO-NAM SURVIVES

386
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,184
White Spoon Chef Park Hyo-nam.

387
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,606
-Incredible.
-I guess that's why he's a legend.

388
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,234
The gim sauce and originality

389
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,320
were what I gave more weight to.

390
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,571
The texture was great.

391
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,992
The balance came together
perfectly on the palate.

392
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,787
When I had a bite of the escargot,

393
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,248
it was very fresh and well-balanced.

394
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,251
But I had to spit something out.

395
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,713
There was some grit in it.

396
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,131
Could I get a napkin?

397
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,307
Personally, I do prefer this style,

398
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,936
and I thought it was
a well-executed dish as I was chewing.

399
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,354
But unfortunately…

400
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,106
-Thank you.
-That's what happened.

401
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,107
Great job.

402
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,031
-Gosh, what a shame.
-You were great.

403
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,950
It was a valuable experience for me.

404
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,409
I feel terrible.

405
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,954
I was hoping he would win,

406
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,539
but he didn't,

407
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,165
so I was choked up.

408
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:42,212
In any case, I really want
to root for Chef French Papa.

409
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,588
I really do.

410
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,423
I did my best,

411
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,552
and I was grateful for this experience.

412
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,554
FRENCH PAPA ELIMINATED

413
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,100
But…

414
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,185
it made me think of my kid.

415
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,688
"Wouldn't he be disappointed?"

416
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,439
That thought crossed my mind.

417
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,859
I knew he'd be fine,
but I still felt that way.

418
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,362
I was just really…

419
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,823
I felt sorry.

420
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,659
That was how I felt.

421
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,618
I want to be

422
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,455
a dad my son can be proud of.

423
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,959
And if I get the chance someday,

424
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,463
I want to run a small cafe
with young people

425
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,799
who have developmental disabilities.

426
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,636
A beautiful cafe that serves breakfast.

427
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,014
I hope that day comes soon

428
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,016
so I can cook with my son.

429
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:42,355
FRENCH PAPA

430
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,733
If the only vegetable in the world

431
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,359
were large green onions…

432
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,907
JINDO LARGE GREEN ONION

433
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,576
The highlight of this dish
is the large green onion.

434
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,455
It cannot be made without it.

435
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,125
It's Choi Kang-rok.

436
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,004
-Holy cow, it's like seeing a celebrity.
-Right?

437
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,048
I'm a fan of Chef Choi Kang-rok.

438
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,299
I even have his book.

439
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,760
-Will he be braising?
-I was wondering the same.

440
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,679
"Will he be braising or not?"
That's the question.

441
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,849
Chef Choi Kang-rok's cooking
always makes you curious.

442
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,517
He stokes your curiosity.

443
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,353
Yes, I'm always curious about him.

444
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,855
Isn't Chef Choi made for this competition?

445
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,982
He was even in the first round.

446
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,944
Knowing that I've competed since the start

447
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,487
is giving me resolve, determination,

448
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,031
and tenacity.

449
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,159
It's like I'm getting these buffs.

450
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,702
I want to survive this round.

451
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,373
Let's not forget
that losing means elimination.

452
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,672
Our main ingredient
was large green onions.

453
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,883
I'll take this stalk of large green onion

454
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,718
and break it down.

455
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,901
And I'll use everything I can from it.

456
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,199
I took it to the extreme.

457
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,201
"What if the world only had
large green onions?"

458
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,162
Aren't they all so calm and composed?

459
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,415
All the Black Spoons.

460
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,667
Especially that second guy.

461
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,128
I think he's a formidable one.

462
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,422
He's working so calmly and well.

463
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,259
What was his name again?

464
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,428
-Iron Arms.
-Right, Iron Arms.

465
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,972
He's the one who makes soba.

466
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,891
IRON ARMS
CHEF-OWNER OF SOBAJUU

467
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,189
-It's soba.
-He's making soba here?

468
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,276
I think you're an amazing cook.

469
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,528
Iron Arms, you've survived.

470
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,571
Thank you.

471
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,786
I don't know how Choi Kang-rok will do,

472
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,663
but if Iron Arms wins,
I think he'll go far.

473
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,915
I'm a big fan of Chef Choi Kang-rok,

474
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,083
so I picked him.

475
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:11,046
We both have backgrounds
in Japanese cuisine,

476
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,882
so in a side-by-side comparison,

477
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,509
my skills may come across as more subtle.

478
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,141
That guy's like a real expert.

479
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,185
Just who on earth is he?

480
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,479
-He cooks so elegantly.
-Look at him.

481
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,197
He's young but seems very skilled.

482
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,241
No one knows him.
There's no information on him.

483
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,785
Yeah, even Ho-young didn't know.

484
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,371
-Chef Kim Geon doesn't know either.
-Right.

485
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,792
He's a hidden young talent.

486
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,712
I don't know if I'm weird,

487
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,799
but I didn't feel nervous
or uneasy at all.

488
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,593
I'm confident, so I'm not really worried.

489
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,889
Bringing out the natural flavor
and amplifying that sweetness

490
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,809
are things I know how to do well.

491
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,818
He's cooking the large green onions
straight on the charcoal.

492
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,570
I think large green onions

493
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,282
taste best when you just grill them.

494
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,746
The spiciness mellows
into sweetness as they cook

495
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,164
and gives you that impact.

496
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,875
The most important thing is

497
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,002
cooking the large green onions right.

498
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,424
It's about how well you use
the charcoal to cook them.

499
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:42,011
They can't become too soft,
and they have to retain a bit of texture

500
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,264
with that green onion flavor still there.

501
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,225
The important thing is
cooking them just right.

502
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,688
I think that will be the deciding factor
between winning and losing.

503
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,942
Right now, Iron Arms's cooking

504
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,528
looks a lot simpler
than Chef Choi Kang-rok's.

505
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,989
-I think that's a first.
-Right.

506
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,366
He's really busy today.

507
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,118
He brought so many cooking tools.

508
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,203
Yeah, I think he came determined.

509
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,000
I tend to commit myself to the challenge.

510
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,335
To execute what's in my head,

511
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,379
I thought I would need that many tools.

512
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,594
I stir-fry the large green onions.

513
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,890
Then, I make broth with them.

514
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,899
I boil the large green onions…

515
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,820
and make another broth.

516
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,117
Almost like squeezing out
juices from meat,

517
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,829
you get that green onion essence
when you press the large green onions.

518
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,373
I like broth made from large green onions.

519
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,127
My plan was to make
large quantities of broth.

520
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,462
BOILED LARGE GREEN ONION BROTH

521
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,221
I'll mix these two broths together.

522
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,097
BEATEN EGGS, BROTH 1, BROTH 2

523
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,276
It's steamed eggs
made with large green onion broth.

524
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,029
They call it chawanmushi
in Japanese cuisine.

525
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,534
A great way to showcase
this large green onion broth

526
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,868
is this steamed egg dish.

527
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,080
And to accompany this,

528
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,666
since this world only has
large green onions…

529
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,751
I mean, in this universe I've made.

530
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,921
Gosh, that's hot.

531
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,221
I grill them…

532
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,518
And then, I braise them.

533
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,943
I julienne the stalks

534
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,737
and deep-fry the strips
to use as garnishes.

535
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,282
The large green onion

536
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,118
is like the overlord.

537
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,206
Chef Choi Kang-rok's dish
looks really complex.

538
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,124
It does.

539
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,544
I think he's putting
a lot of effort into it.

540
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,963
Usually, he goes for simplicity.

541
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,052
Iron Arms is only grilling green onions
and heating charcoal.

542
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,935
I tried my best

543
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,813
to cook them to the level I wanted.

544
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,166
I char the outer layer over charcoal,

545
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,252
remove that outer layer,

546
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:05,048
and then use
the perfectly cooked inner stalk.

547
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,270
Large green onions cooked
over charcoal are delicious.

548
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,315
It's not easy to keep things simple,

549
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,025
but he's doing a good job of it.

550
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,945
I think when you're really confident,
you keep it simple.

551
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,488
-Exactly.
-But it's hard to do that.

552
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,906
Especially in a place like this.

553
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,950
Your opponent might not keep it simple.

554
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,674
SEA URCHIN ROE

555
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,845
I think I used
every cooking method I could

556
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,056
with the large green onion.

557
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,558
I did everything you can with them.

558
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,894
Like a jack-of-all-trades,

559
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,522
you'll get its raw aroma,

560
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,190
the taste when it's cooked,

561
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,986
and the aroma and flavor you get
when it's slightly charred.

562
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,363
The secret identity
of the large green onion.

563
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,156
That's what I'm going to lay bare.

564
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,955
I focused on bringing out
the large green onion's natural flavor.

565
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,625
I used Japanese white miso

566
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,586
and made a warm, thick sauce

567
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,339
to help the large green onion stand out.

568
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,846
Finely diced beef jerky,
fresh green onions,

569
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,932
and freshly grated wasabi
will be placed on top

570
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,142
to finish the dish.

571
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,854
I didn't make any mistakes

572
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,064
or find anything difficult.

573
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,774
I might have a chance.

574
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,818
The battle of Jindo large green onion.

575
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,737
Please enter.

576
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,206
It took me back.

577
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,625
You redid the interior.

578
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,045
It's a wooden style now.

579
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,300
It's my second time,
but I'm even more nervous.

580
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,178
When you go into that room,

581
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,848
there's a heavy, stifling atmosphere.

582
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,225
You're not allowed to talk.

583
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,522
It makes you want to cheat a little.

584
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,524
Like whisper in their ears, "It's me."

585
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,863
Now, please taste the first dish.

586
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,782
LARGE GREEN ONION SOUP CHAWANMUSHI

587
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,260
I wanted them to taste
the dish I had designed

588
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,139
in a series of steps.

589
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,682
They're blindfolded,

590
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,185
so just scooping it all at once

591
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,563
and giving it to them
seemed like such a waste.

592
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,774
It's one dish,

593
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,070
but they'll get a range
of different impressions.

594
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,201
When I saw there were three spoons,

595
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,829
I realized it was no ordinary dish.

596
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,956
This is the first bite.

597
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,379
In the first bite, they'll get
a taste of the dish in its entirety.

598
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,757
LARGE GREEN ONION AND SEA URCHIN ROE

599
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,682
LARGE GREEN ONION,
SEA URCHIN ROE, AND STEAMED EGG

600
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,851
DEEP-FRIED GREEN ONION

601
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:09,625
This dish is almost like a soup.

602
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:15,173
The second bite will have the broth
with that rich flavor of large green onion

603
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,467
and the steamed eggs infused
with the aroma of large green onion.

604
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,437
For the third bite,

605
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,941
I give the rest of the dish a good stir.

606
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,697
When sea urchin roe is heated,

607
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,283
I thought it was similar
to large green onion.

608
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,912
It becomes sweeter as it's cooked.

609
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,247
That is the final bite.

610
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:58,049
The sweetness of green onions
was used to make steamed eggs.

611
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,429
How did they do this
with green onions and eggs?

612
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,644
It feels like all the dishes you can make
with large green onion were put into one.

613
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,898
Next, please taste the second dish.

614
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,152
GRILLED LARGE GREEN ONION
WITH WHITE MISO SAUCE

615
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,410
This also has a touch of Japanese cuisine.

616
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,288
But to me, the two are so different.

617
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,957
Very different,
even with the same ingredient.

618
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,250
-Exactly.
-Yes.

619
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,127
In terms of the flavors you can bring out,

620
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,421
they went in completely
different directions.

621
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,674
Bringing out
the ingredient's essence to the fullest,

622
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,719
or capturing every dish possible
with the ingredient in one creation.

623
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,557
The result is…

624
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,184
two to zero.

625
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,771
…two to zero.

626
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,484
It's Choi Kang-rok.

627
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,155
If Iron Arms wins,
that would be incredible.

628
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,785
Sea urchin roe is usually the star
of the show, but because of Chef Choi,

629
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,413
it played a supporting role today.

630
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,207
Large green onions
and sea urchin roe are different things,

631
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:59,211
but I think they take on
similar qualities when heated.

632
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,255
It's similar to large green onion

633
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,215
in terms of having
that pleasant sweetness.

634
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,261
It was only used to intensify
the flavor of the large green onion.

635
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,765
The sea urchin roe wasn't overpowering.

636
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,974
I really enjoyed it.

637
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,602
-Iron Arms.
-Yes?

638
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,103
This is really brave of you.

639
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,900
Your large green onion dish…

640
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:25,237
requires the confidence
that you truly know the ingredient well.

641
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,907
You really pulled out

642
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,076
the best qualities of large green onion.

643
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,244
You really drew them out.

644
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,579
I'm amazed.

645
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:39,001
Now, it's time to announce the results
of the Jindo large green onion battle.

646
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,047
The survivor
of this one-on-one face-off is…

647
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,553
White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok.

648
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,430
Congratulations.

649
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,018
White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok.

650
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,188
What a shame.

651
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,276
-Chef Choi set a very high bar.
-Yes.

652
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,778
-Very high.
-Yeah.

653
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,781
I picked the chawanmushi
because everything you can do

654
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,450
with large green onion
was put into one single dish.

655
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,703
Grilling, steaming,
and frying were all in here.

656
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,206
He made steamed eggs,

657
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,291
but that was just a disguise.

658
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,794
Each ingredient he put in

659
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:26,090
were elements to maximize
the flavor of the green onion.

660
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,675
It was very calculated.

661
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,512
All three bites had
different tastes of green onion.

662
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,642
"It's green onion.
This is also green onion."

663
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,977
"Wait, this one is too?"

664
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,770
He's kind of playing with us.

665
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,939
He's toying with our palates.

666
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,566
But it's so delicious.

667
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,152
So you're being toyed with
but in an enjoyable way.

668
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,864
Even when I think back on it now,
it makes me a little excited.

669
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,075
The dish he had prepared

670
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,996
was able to present
so many different things.

671
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,999
I may have been too narrow in my thinking.

672
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,250
IRON ARMS ELIMINATED

673
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,585
But I also feel some relief.

674
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,586
IRON ARMS

675
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,753
I'm happy.

676
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,174
In this world of competitions,

677
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,760
winning once doesn't mean you can relax.

678
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,182
You can only relish the victory
but for a brief moment.

679
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,609
I was so nervous.

680
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,987
But I gave it my all

681
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,574
and prepared something only I could make.

682
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:38,037
BREWMASTER YUN
OWNER OF HAEBANGCHON YUNJUDANG

683
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,539
Last round, I served soju.

684
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,042
I prepared something
I was really good at making.

685
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,045
Brewmaster Yun,

686
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,713
you've survived.

687
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,964
-Congratulations.
-What?

688
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,010
No way!

689
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,678
Since I've made it this far,

690
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,223
I have a much stronger desire to survive,

691
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,308
so I think I might make it.

692
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,397
It felt like the movement of cranes.

693
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,732
She was so elegant.

694
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,655
Rather than watching from above,

695
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:16,075
I felt so much better cooking down below.

696
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,786
She's so relaxed.

697
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,288
You can tell she's a pro.

698
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,916
So she's an executive chef at a hotel?

699
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,502
With a background in Korean cuisine?

700
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,295
-Yeah, that's right.
-Really?

701
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,714
It's hard to become executive chef
from Korean cuisine.

702
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,717
Exactly. I can sense
how incredibly skilled she is.

703
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:41,267
I was the first female chef to become
the executive chef of a hotel.

704
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,771
A KOREAN CUISINE CHEF OF 39 YEARS
WHO FOCUSES ON TRADITIONAL KOREAN CUISINE

705
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:51,652
I came here to share
what traditional Korean food is all about.

706
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,322
I believe I've dedicated myself
to a single path.

707
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,657
She's a master.

708
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,325
So I'm really nervous.

709
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,495
I think we'll cook something
in completely different styles.

710
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,539
Your main ingredient is…

711
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,999
Gongju chestnut.

712
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,592
I'm curious to see
what they'll make with chestnuts.

713
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,843
That's a difficult one.

714
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,636
It's not really a main ingredient.

715
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,307
It's often used
as a supplementary ingredient.

716
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,686
Even with your eyes closed,
you'd know it was a chestnut dish.

717
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,231
I'm making chestnut porridge.

718
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,484
I use glutinous rice

719
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,571
to make white porridge,
which forms the base.

720
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,744
Since the Goryeo period,

721
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,247
they say people ate a lot
of white porridge as an appetizer.

722
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,541
I thought it would be really good

723
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,337
to use that and combine it with chestnuts.

724
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,341
I steam the chestnuts thoroughly

725
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,176
and puree them.

726
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,019
Then, I'll mix that with white porridge.

727
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,774
It'll be a delicate harmony
of glutinous rice porridge and chestnuts.

728
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,069
Hotel-style chestnut porridge

729
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,570
is bound to be impeccable.

730
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,874
Brewmaster Yun is making dough.

731
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,086
What is she making with chestnuts?

732
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:37,883
I've prepared a dish
they wouldn't have tasted anywhere else.

733
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,053
I'm going to make tteok,
or rice cakes, with chestnuts.

734
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,889
It's chestnut rice cake soup.

735
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:47,059
The Italian cuisine chefs
all make fresh pasta.

736
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,019
Well, I'm going to make
fresh rice cake soup.

737
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,690
In Chungcheong Province,
they use hot water dough

738
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,026
made from non-glutinous rice flour
to make rice cakes on the spot.

739
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,780
Rice cakes can take on flavors
from just about anything.

740
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,659
I'll crush the chestnuts
with a mortar and pestle.

741
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,458
Then, I'll make rice cakes
filled with the cooked chestnuts.

742
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:24,763
I'm going to cut them
into bite-sized coin shapes.

743
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,308
And then,

744
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,061
so they can really taste the chestnuts,

745
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,105
I'm going to mince boiled beef shank,

746
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:37,359
and the amount of chestnuts added
will be twice as much as the meat.

747
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,571
I'm going to make meatballs
that have a lot more chestnuts in it.

748
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,739
Normally, you add tofu in meatballs,

749
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,367
but I'm using chestnuts instead.

750
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,661
The layers will keep building up.

751
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,746
It'll be chestnut
after chestnut after chestnut.

752
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,752
I make traditional Korean food.

753
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,631
Rather than use fancy techniques,

754
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,509
I focus on things like
the depth of flavor,

755
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,723
so I prepared something refined
and not too overbearing.

756
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,189
TRADITIONAL CHESTNUT CONFECTION

757
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,525
She's finished.

758
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,154
She's done already?

759
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,114
She didn't even take an hour.

760
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,206
That's why she's a master.

761
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,127
But I have a certain kind of tenacity.

762
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,339
To truly bring out the chestnut flavor,

763
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,341
I didn't add any other ingredients.

764
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,222
I tried adding radish and green onion
to make a clean-tasting broth,

765
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,848
but they all clashed too much.

766
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,600
They took away from the chestnut.

767
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,316
Chestnut, rice, Korean beef shank.

768
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,609
That's all that went in.

769
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,904
I hope my intent
comes through in the dish.

770
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,288
I'll show you

771
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,958
something unique that only I can make.

772
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:21,922
Now, please taste the first dish.

773
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,926
This is chestnut porridge,
where each spoonful bursts

774
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,679
with the nutty richness
and flavor of chestnut.

775
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,514
CHESTNUT PORRIDGE

776
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:46,780
It's porridge.

777
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,658
It's chestnut porridge.

778
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,827
It's subtle.

779
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,456
It may seem rustic,

780
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,667
but it's full of warmth.

781
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,586
Yes.

782
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:05,716
Next, please taste the second dish.

783
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,804
CHESTNUT RICE CAKE SOUP

784
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,477
My hand was shaking so much.

785
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,606
It was driving me crazy.

786
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,025
So I had to use both hands.

787
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,799
They're rice cakes.

788
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,053
Why do they have no bite?

789
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,348
I think they were made soft on purpose.

790
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,974
Are these fresh rice cakes?

791
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,312
Is that why? Fresh rice cakes…

792
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,274
They made rice cake soup with chestnuts.

793
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,401
Gosh.

794
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,278
The meat pairs well
with the chestnut though.

795
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,821
-They do.
-Yeah.

796
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,701
The voting is complete.

797
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,828
The result is…

798
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,748
two to zero.

799
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,254
-It's fresh rice cake soup, right?
-Yes, it's Chungcheong style.

800
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,964
-Are you from there?
-No, I'm from Seoul.

801
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,258
-But you've made this before?
-No, I haven't.

802
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,553
I was surprised.
Chestnuts have a delicate aroma,

803
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,347
so they can easily be overpowered by meat.

804
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,641
-This was very daring…
-Yes, I know.

805
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,309
-You knew and still did it?
-Yes.

806
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,477
Gosh, that's gutsy.

807
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,021
When I first tasted
this chestnut porridge,

808
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,565
I could tell it was made
in the traditional way.

809
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,193
There was nothing fancy.
Just the chestnut.

810
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,320
-Chef Lee, this was textbook.
-Pure chestnut.

811
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,614
It was done so properly.

812
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:57,869
When I tasted it, I knew it was made
by someone with years of experience.

813
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:02,457
Now, it's time to announce the results
of the Gongju chestnut battle.

814
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,460
The survivor
of this one-on-one face-off is…

815
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,926
Black Spoon Chef Brewmaster Yun.

816
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,720
-Oh, my gosh.
-Congratulations.

817
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:15,762
BREWMASTER YUN SURVIVES

818
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,431
-Thank you, Chef.
-Of course.

819
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,682
Thank you.

820
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,350
-Thank you.
-Great job.

821
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,894
Thank you. Oh, my gosh.

822
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,523
Black Spoon Chef Brewmaster Yun.

823
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,317
That's amazing!

824
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,736
Gosh, this is a bit…

825
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,863
surprising.

826
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,698
LEE KEUM-HEE ELIMINATED

827
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,867
Just as I've been doing to this day,

828
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,788
I'll continue to cook
our traditional Korean cuisine.

829
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,915
Brewmaster Yun.

830
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,917
-She's got skills.
-It's remarkable.

831
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,336
After tasting the first dish,

832
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,213
I thought it would win.

833
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,675
It was very Korean
while staying true to the basics.

834
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,218
I thought it was really delicious.

835
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,887
Then, I tasted the second dish,

836
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,347
and I was really surprised.

837
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,809
It had that sweet
and delicate nuttiness of chestnuts

838
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,977
with the chewy rice cakes.

839
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,272
I thought, "How did they make
such a well-balanced broth?"

840
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,607
To be completely honest,

841
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,109
it was shocking.

842
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,862
How did she even think
of doing this with chestnuts?

843
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:16,448
I just went all in.

844
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,825
The two judges fully understood that.

845
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,620
That really moved me as a chef.

846
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,458
Did it turn out okay?

847
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,170
I made something too complex.

848
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,589
Mine is simple, but I got careless.

849
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,507
You did?

850
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,592
I left out one garnish.

851
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,552
I love you, Chef.

852
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,680
That was random.

853
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,265
All of a sudden?

854
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,393
Chef Kim Hee-eun was

855
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,230
my cooking teacher
when I was in middle school.

856
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:51,441
That's when I started admiring her.

857
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,612
She's been mentoring me
for almost a decade now.

858
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:00,242
She's one of the people
I'm most thankful for in my life.

859
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:05,038
Chef Kim is someone who's so strong.

860
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,249
I really think she's amazing.

861
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,001
When you look at the food at Soul,

862
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,503
she truly is outstanding.

863
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,508
I'm Chef Kim Hee-eun, and I run Soul,
a Michelin one-star restaurant,

864
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,344
and Egg & Flour,
a Bib Gourmand restaurant.

865
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,055
I didn't know she'd be here.

866
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,599
I rooted for her with all my heart.

867
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,269
I wish she'd explain her dish more.

868
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,896
She might advance and say,

869
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,982
"I want to go up against my teacher."

870
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,775
Losing to your student is a good thing.

871
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,068
All right, already.

872
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,070
You've survived.

873
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,032
Well done!

874
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,576
I was so happy for her.

875
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,953
I thought, "This is so great."

876
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,206
But next thing I know,
she's standing right in front of me.

877
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,374
"What are you doing here?"

878
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,959
What was their main ingredient again?

879
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,043
Pork shank.

880
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,753
-Pork shank?
-Yes.

881
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,173
I don't think pork shank will be easy.

882
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,259
They're using pork shank?

883
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:03,179
Compared to other cuts,

884
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,223
it has very little fat or marbling.

885
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,477
It's not even used
for suyuk, or boiled pork.

886
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:13,189
"How can I make these tough cuts tender?"

887
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,900
That was my biggest worry.

888
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:18,153
So I use a pressure cooker.

889
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,989
I cook it tender in a pressure cooker.

890
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,035
They're both using pressure cookers.

891
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,747
But she's really good.

892
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:29,831
That…

893
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,125
Little Tiger? Young Tiger?

894
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,086
What is Little Tiger doing?

895
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,379
What? Where did she go?

896
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,764
Ice?

897
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,809
I'm going to make jangjorim,
a soy-braised dish, with pork shank.

898
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:56,149
I'll cook it tender in a pressure cooker.

899
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,696
I'll make a less salty jangjorim.

900
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:11,039
She's going to vacuum-seal it
and let the meat absorb the sauce.

901
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,586
I think that is ice.
Is she going to put it under the meat?

902
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,006
I'm going to cool it
before I assemble the dish.

903
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,099
It's some kind of cold
and seasoned boiled pork.

904
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,060
It's so good.
She'll have to slice it thin.

905
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,147
To add more flavor to the meat,

906
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,567
I'll use shrimp, asparagus,

907
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,154
and the spring vegetable,
angelica-tree shoots

908
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,410
to make something called Joseon japchae.

909
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,786
Pine mushrooms,

910
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:51,830
kkwari peppers,

911
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,874
and green garlic

912
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,252
are used raw without being cooked

913
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:00,588
to add a touch of the freshness of spring.

914
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,009
The main ingredient is pork shank,

915
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,054
so I hope it goes well
with the spring vegetables.

916
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,975
PORK SHANK JANGJORIM AND JOSEON JAPCHAE

917
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,769
I did try making a cold dish too.

918
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,480
But no matter how I thought about it,
to improve the texture,

919
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,733
I felt a warm dish was the way to go.

920
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,277
I think it's a pork shank braise.

921
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,154
She's braising it in a soy sauce mixture.

922
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,531
I prepared a warm braised dish.

923
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,702
I cook it slowly
for a long time until it's tender.

924
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,663
Then, I take the meat out

925
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,374
and add a bit of smoke using thyme.

926
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,335
That's a big key of this dish.

927
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,547
I cook it thoroughly

928
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,593
and shred it into thin strips
like jangjorim

929
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,762
so it can be mixed and eaten with rice.

930
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,978
I thought it'd be nice to keep
that pleasant chewy texture going,

931
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,105
so I'm using potato ongsimi…

932
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,400
POTATO ONGSIMI

933
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,027
…and soaked sea cucumber.

934
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,780
SOAKED SEA CUCUMBER

935
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,990
It's a dish prepared in a Korean style

936
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,118
with a bold punch of flavor.

937
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,537
It's a braise

938
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,956
with a punch of everything.

939
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,752
BRAISED BLACK PORK SHANK

940
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,797
The battle of Sancheong black pork shank.

941
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,217
Please taste the first dish.

942
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,685
I'm sure she did well.

943
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,729
She's my student, after all.

944
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,461
The pork shank is very tender

945
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,380
but also slightly chewy.

946
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,758
It was cooled down

947
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,136
and served with vegetables,

948
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,012
so it's fragrant.

949
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,812
It lingers.

950
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,106
-The aroma is still present.
-Yeah.

951
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:26,734
Next,

952
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,737
please taste the second dish.

953
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,366
First is the texture of the pork shank.

954
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:37,245
I want them to taste
just how perfectly I've cooked it.

955
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:41,124
I mix the well-cooked rice with the sauce…

956
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,463
and top it with the pickled rhubarb,
apple, and gim I made.

957
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,465
It'll taste familiar,

958
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,717
but there'll be
something special about it.

959
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,733
This is well-made.

960
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,236
So,

961
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,281
the first dish felt like
I ate something healthy.

962
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,366
This one feels like a hearty meal.

963
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,661
It's a dish you eat with rice
as a proper meal.

964
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,874
The voting is complete.

965
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,002
The result is…

966
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,424
one to one.

967
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,851
Contestants, please exit for a moment.

968
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:49,400
PAIK JONG-WON, KIM HEE-EUN
ANH SUNG-JAE, LITTLE TIGER

969
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,444
The taste of this one

970
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,280
felt really special to me.

971
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,991
It was special and seemed like
an attempt at something new.

972
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,827
I think people would be divided on this.

973
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,704
-They would be.
-Right?

974
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,874
There's a touch
of bitterness there as you eat it.

975
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,293
They wouldn't be divided on this.

976
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,546
This is just a tasty meal.

977
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,298
I think eating this after tasting that
made it feel more familiar.

978
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,800
But I just felt

979
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,135
that they tried
something difficult and new.

980
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,971
Yes, that's true.

981
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,265
But there's such a big difference.

982
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,642
Not in terms of quality of execution.

983
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,727
What they're aiming for
are completely different.

984
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,021
They were completely different.

985
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,315
When I ate the first dish,

986
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,067
I picked up that spring vegetable aroma.

987
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,194
I thought it was really well-balanced.

988
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:37,198
The second dish was just plain delicious.

989
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:41,703
They were so different I thought,
"They're really from the same pork shank?"

990
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,914
END OF JUDGES' DISCUSSION

991
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,962
Well, you both made great dishes.

992
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:56,175
In the battle of Sancheong black pork,

993
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,053
the survivor is…

994
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,480
White Spoon Chef Kim Hee-eun.

995
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,775
KIM HEE-EUN SURVIVES

996
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,824
-So, if we ate this again…
-Yeah?

997
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,826
You asked me which one I would eat.

998
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,454
The healthy one or the tasty one?

999
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,331
Well, it has to be the tasty one.

1000
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:29,334
So I thought,
"I'd probably order this one."

1001
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,836
If you had to eat a dish again?

1002
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:32,754
Yes.

1003
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,839
It was a great attempt,

1004
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,633
but maybe since you like greens,

1005
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,760
the flavor was too strong.

1006
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,763
This dish wasn't lacking in any way.

1007
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:45,850
The fact that we have a young chef
who likes spring greens

1008
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,310
is a real delight.

1009
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:51,481
They praised me
and told me what I hoped to hear,

1010
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,858
so I have no regrets.

1011
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,155
The way she sees things is really unique.

1012
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,158
I'm rooting for her with all my heart.

1013
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,620
I'll go next to Venerable Sunjae.

1014
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,000
I'm disappointed, but I have no regrets.

1015
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,960
LITTLE TIGER

1016
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,215
Man, that meljeot looks rich.

1017
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,217
That looks salty.

1018
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:32,313
JEJU MELJEOT

1019
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,982
I think Sam will do
a good job with meljeot.

1020
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,776
He's used anchovies a lot before.

1021
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,487
I think he'll cook something good
in a style similar to his.

1022
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,865
I'm Chef Sam Kim. I cook Italian cuisine.

1023
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,202
I watched him cook during the first round.

1024
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,081
-It's a variation of lasagna.
-Yes.

1025
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,669
I felt that he had
a completely different style from me,

1026
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,964
so if I just consider his strengths,
it does make me afraid.

1027
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:01,342
I think my strengths
are my wit and energy.

1028
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,386
I wanted to present something creative.

1029
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,098
I'm making potato jeon.

1030
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,726
It's going to be very crispy.

1031
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,564
It's damn crispy. Very good.

1032
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,526
When eating with your eyes closed,

1033
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,945
could anything beat
the crispiness of this potato jeon?

1034
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,948
I'm going to make two types.

1035
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:26,534
One will be in charge of crispiness.

1036
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,204
The other will be in charge
of the potato flavor.

1037
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,207
Then, I'll combine them like a taco.

1038
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,792
I'll lay down two potato jeon

1039
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:40,131
and then spread a bagna càuda
made with meljeot sauce.

1040
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,593
Next, I'll place grilled shrimp on top

1041
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:44,886
and with a piece of anchovy.

1042
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,930
I really focused on texture.

1043
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,267
What is Sam Kim making?

1044
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,813
It's pasta.

1045
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,940
-That white bag.
-Right, the bag back there.

1046
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,442
I'm going to make pasta.

1047
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,486
There's a pasta called paccheri.

1048
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:05,865
I used a hollow pasta
so the flavors can really spread out.

1049
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,867
I take out the pasta when it's cooked.

1050
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:12,330
And then, there are pencil squids,
which is a type of small squid.

1051
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:16,125
I make stock
from pencil squids and mitre squids.

1052
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:20,630
I add the pasta to that
and cook it slowly.

1053
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:21,923
What I really focused on

1054
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:26,302
was finding ways to make
the meljeot flavor linger in the mouth.

1055
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,970
So I put it in the breadcrumbs

1056
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,266
and in the young summer radish.

1057
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,522
The meljeot is present
from start to finish.

1058
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,237
In my entire life, I've never spent
this long thinking about one dish.

1059
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,404
YOUNG SUMMER RADISH

1060
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,866
Of all the pasta dishes
that have been made in the world today,

1061
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:52,912
I can confidently say
that my pasta dish is probably the best.

1062
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:57,458
Now, please taste the first dish.

1063
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,713
They need to eat the whole thing,

1064
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,632
even if it's not in one go.

1065
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,593
All of it.

1066
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:12,181
I've been told you should eat everything,
even if you have to take several bites.

1067
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,600
Okay. How many bites
do you think it will take?

1068
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,812
-I think around one and a half.
-Okay.

1069
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,480
-It's pretty tall.
-Okay.

1070
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,148
Please open wide.

1071
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,779
It's in front of you.

1072
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,701
That's all of it.

1073
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,414
I'll press it down a bit for you.

1074
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,457
Take one bite first.

1075
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,502
How can I…

1076
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,338
-There's still some left.
-How can I eat this?

1077
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,930
The remaining bit is a bit long.

1078
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,684
Okay.

1079
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,895
Shall I push it in?

1080
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:08,863
With the first bite,

1081
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,743
they'll notice the crispiness.

1082
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,205
Then, they'll pick up
the flavor of the potato.

1083
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,042
Next, they'll think,
"Oh, it's potato jeon."

1084
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,337
Gosh, it's a very savory potato jeon.

1085
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:31,844
The back of my throat is bleeding.

1086
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,139
It's really crispy.

1087
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,978
I can't tell where the meljeot is.

1088
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:42,939
It's not really coming through.

1089
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,150
Right, the main ingredient was meljeot.

1090
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,693
It is there, but…

1091
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,823
The roof of my mouth is all scratched up.

1092
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,660
I'm not joking.
I think my throat has been torn up.

1093
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,328
Goodness.

1094
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,332
Next, please taste the second dish.

1095
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,334
PENCIL SQUID AND MELJEOT PASTA

1096
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,836
I cooked the pasta al dente,

1097
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,340
because the more you chew,
the more savory it gets.

1098
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,675
It's quite big.

1099
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:20,893
The pasta dough has
a really unique texture.

1100
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:24,981
The meljeot hits you at first

1101
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:26,857
in a delicate way.

1102
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,193
It develops into a savory taste.

1103
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:31,696
The meljeot is nice and savory.

1104
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:35,032
The voting is complete.

1105
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,077
The result is two to zero.

1106
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:44,083
The battle of Jeju meljeot.
The survivor is…

1107
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,883
White Spoon Chef Sam Kim.

1108
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,176
Congratulations.

1109
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,554
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

1110
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,809
Chef Sam Kim's pasta was…

1111
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:02,727
You're well-known,

1112
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,729
and this is my first time
tasting your cooking.

1113
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,023
This dish is very charming.

1114
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,358
The pasta itself is really charming.

1115
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,611
It's like when you don't know
what you're eating, but it tastes great.

1116
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,530
Sometimes,
even if you don't know what it is,

1117
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:17,450
you just think everything
goes well together while eating it.

1118
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,285
-You did great.
-Thank you.

1119
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:25,916
I'm a trendsetter.

1120
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:30,129
I'll keep setting new trends

1121
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,923
and try hard to do well,
so please keep rooting for me.

1122
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:33,966
I appreciate it.

1123
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:38,095
The battle of Jeungpyeong pork skin.

1124
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:41,682
JENNIE WALLDÉN VS WITCH WITH A WOK

1125
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:58,157
These are cumin-spiced pork skin ribs.

1126
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,285
I finely dice pork skin

1127
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,412
and attach it to the bones.

1128
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,957
After chilling them, I fry them.

1129
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,169
The smokiness, sweet and salty taste,

1130
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,713
and texture of the pork skin
are all perfect.

1131
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,882
Black Spoon Chef Witch with a Wok.

1132
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,300
WITCH WITH A WOK SURVIVES

1133
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:18,552
No one does Chinese cuisine like this.

1134
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,388
This is the battle of Danyang garlic.

1135
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,934
KIM GEON VS KNIFE OMAKASE

1136
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,312
I'm Kim Geon from Goryori Ken,
a Michelin-star restaurant.

1137
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:32,608
It's mackerel and garlic fried rice
arancini with garlic purée.

1138
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,819
I prepared "Black and White Garlic Ramen."

1139
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,489
I thinly sliced squid
to make it like noodles.

1140
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:41,784
That special something
has to be the burnt garlic.

1141
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,995
I prepared a dish
where the garlic is subtly hiding.

1142
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:47,540
Black Spoon Chef Knife Omakase.

1143
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,625
KNIFE OMAKASE SURVIVES

1144
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,044
A subtle garlic aroma
came through sweetly.

01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,631
This is the battle of Wando gopchang gim.

1146
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,843
SHIM SUNG-CHUL VS ANNYEONG BONJOUR

1147
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,220
I'm a chef with 25 years of experience.

1148
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,264
I'm Shim Sung-chul,
and I'm a chef in New York.

1149
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,767
I run Kochi and Mari,

1150
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,270
which are both
Michelin one-star restaurants.

1151
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:13,149
I made Wando gopchang gim seafood porridge
to show the essence of this dried seaweed.

1152
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:16,819
FRIED CHI-GIM

1153

ANNYEONG BONJOUR SURVIVES

You really nailed the texture.

1156
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:33,544
This is the battle of Gunsan tongue sole.

1157
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:37,840
CHUN SANG-HYUN VS BANCHAN WIZARD

1158
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,426
I served as the president's chef
at the Blue House.

1159
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,428
I'm Blue House chef, Chun Sang-hyun.

1160
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,221
Starting from President Kim Dae-jung,

1161
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:47,057
I've served five presidents
over a span of 20 years and 4 months.

1162
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,769
This is soy-braised
semi-dried tongue sole.

1163
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,938
This is called
tongue sole dubuseon neureumi.

1164
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,982
It's a recipe
from a historical Korean cookbook.

1165
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:56,734
I prepared a warm dish.

1166

1167
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:00,738

Rainbow "yangjang-fit."

1175
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,302
I'm going to dress it
in yangjangpi ingredients.

1176
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,888
It's spring greens
and rump steak carpaccio.

1177
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,475
CHOI YU-GANG SURVIVES

1178
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,392
Thank you.

1179
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,519
Culinary Class Wars Season 2

1180
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:35,397
has the best White Spoon lineup to date.

1181
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,944
I will show you exactly why

1182
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,862
I deserve to be one of them.

1183
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,950
BLACK SPOON SURVIVORS
OF ONE-ON-ONE FACE-OFF

1184
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:49,328
WHITE SPOON SURVIVORS
OF ONE-ON-ONE FACE-OFF

1185
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:03,968
It's definitely different.

1186
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:06,220
It's huge!

1187
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,182
They've completely covered it up.

1188
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,267
I know.

1189
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:13,143
It's a huge curtain.

1190
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,270
What's it for?

1191
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,897
They put three of these together.

1192
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,858
The cooking stations…
I see. There are three.

1193
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,990
This looks very familiar.

1194
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,910
Actually, that was
my final battleground in Season 1.

1195
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,663
And I've been mulling it over
for about a year now.

1196
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:34,039
That scene.

1197
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,917
My defeat in this very spot.

1198
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,211
Do I add on another traumatic memory?

1199
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,463
Or do I get to ease some of it here?

1200
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,341
Survivors of the one-on-one face-off.

1201
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,509
Nine Black Spoons

1202
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,304
and ten White Spoons.

1203
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:51,974
Joining you in this round

1204
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,810
are additional survivors.

1205
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,314
Who are they?

1206
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,606
-Who could it be?
-Where?

1207
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:01,317
-It has to be a Black Spoon.
-Who is it?

1208
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,569
There are nine Black Spoons, and we have…

1209
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,279
-It must be them, right?
-I think so.

1210
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:07,072
The number of additional survivors

1211
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,993
-is two.
-Two?

1212
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:13,996
Two survivors?

1213
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,623
FAN MASTER

1214
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,709
RAYMON KIM, VENERABLE SUNJAE, LEE JUN

1215
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:24,048
We each have to pick someone
we didn't want to eliminate.

1216
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,883
Is this a "super pass" again?

1217
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:26,800
JUDGES' SUPER PASS

1218
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,386
EACH JUDGE CAN SAVE
ONE ELIMINATED CONTESTANT FROM ROUND 2

1219
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,848
There are a few.

1220
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,726
Their dish was so amazing.

1221
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,144
I found it delicious too.

1222
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:39,813
I want to taste their cooking again.

1223
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,440
The additional survivor,

1224
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,943
-please enter.
-Where are they coming from?

1225
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,528
Maybe from above?

1226
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,530
-Are they coming up from below?
-From below?

1227
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:56,121
Oh, come on! Seriously?

1228
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,336
The first additional survivor is

1229
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:04,296
-White Spoon Chef Jung Ho-young.
-I survived!

1230
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,297
JUNG HO-YOUNG SURVIVES

1231
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,341
Chef Jung Ho-young!

1232
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:09,009
-Yes, the monkfish liver.
-Chef Jung.

1233
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,761
-He used the monkfish liver.
-I agree.

1234
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,638
I really enjoyed his dish. Back then…

1235
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,432
The result is one to one.

1236
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:16,892
The revote result is…

1237
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:18,394
one to one.

1238
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,020
We voted once and then twice.

1239
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,064
And it was tied the second time too.

1240
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,440
It was such a close call.

1241
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:26,443
They did tie twice.

1242
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,699
-Come on! You had to hide it like that?
-Sorry.

1243
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:33,784
This is hilarious.

1244
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,870
I think the judges wanted

1245
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,872
another taste of my cooking.

1246
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,583
There are so many of them.

1247
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,877
Will it be a Black Spoon next?

1248
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,045
One Black Spoon?

1249
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,214
The second additional survivor…

1250
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:49,299
-From over there?
-Please make your entrance.

1251
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:50,884
-Come on out.
-Who is it?

1252
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,302
-Who is it?
-Where?

1253
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,887
From there?

1254
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:55,973
-No.
-Over there.

1255
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:56,932
Are they here?

1256
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:58,934
Where?

1257
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,778
There they are.

1258
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,739
The second additional survivor is

1259
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,533
White Spoon Chef Venerable Sunjae.

1260
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:15,784
VENERABLE SUNJAE SURVIVES

1261
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,328
Congratulations!

1262
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,206
-Congratulations.
-We missed you!

1263
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,791
Yes, thank you.

1264
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,753
Venerable Sunjae's pine nut noodles

1265
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,755
had such a depth of flavor.

1266
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:29,882
When I tasted the noodles,

1267
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,759
I thought,
"This is it. This can't be beaten."

1268
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,597
In the blind taste testing,
that was the hardest one to decide.

1269
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,517
If they both had been matched up
with someone else, they both could've won.

1270
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,646
I was given another opportunity,

1271
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,107
and I was really grateful.

1272
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,193
Gosh, I feel so much better now.

1273
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:51,153
-You feel better?
-So much better.

1274
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:54,698
The two contestants
who lost by the narrowest margins

1275
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:58,327
were chosen regardless of class
as the additional survivors.

1276
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:01,288
12 WHITE SPOON CHEFS

1277
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:04,791
VERSUS 9 BLACK SPOON CHEFS

1278
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:07,211
Now, in this very place,

1279
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:10,839
another culinary class battle
will take place.

1280
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,385
It is time to announce…

1281
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,470
We have to win.

1282
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,806
…the mission of this battle.

1283
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,642
I'm getting all fired up.

1284
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:22,726
Your mission is…

1285
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:25,729
What is that?

1286
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,774
-What on earth?
-What's that?

1287
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:32,236
What is that?

1288
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:38,195
