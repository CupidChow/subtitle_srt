1
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,093
There was one last vote
remaining at the end.

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,721
This is crazy.

3
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,056
TEAM WHITE SPOON, 148
TEAM BLACK SPOON, 142

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,891
-Oh, my gosh.
-I'm so nervous.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,852
-Oh, my goodness.
-This is insane.

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,270
I can't look.

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,483
What on earth is this?

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,235
This is so intense.

9
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,653
Gosh, I can't look.

10
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,364
If we lose here, it's all over.

11
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,283
Everyone on our team will be eliminated.

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,534
We have to win.

13
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,119
We just have to win, no matter what.

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,039
The final battle to decide the fate

15
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,623
of the two culinary classes.

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,543
Please reveal the vote…

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,005
of Auntie Omakase #1!

18
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,858
Gosh, this is too much!

19
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,412
Auntie Omakase #1 has chosen
Team White Spoon.

20
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,623
TEAM BLACK SPOON, 142
TEAM WHITE SPOON, 158

21
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,421
Auntie Omakase #1 has chosen
Team White Spoon.

22
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,548
How could the competition be so…

23
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,135
Team White Spoon wins by 16 points,

24
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,054
and all members have survived.

25
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,268
Everyone survived.

26
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,062
It almost brought me to tears.

27
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,939
It was overwhelming.

28
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,774
It felt better
than getting a Michelin star.

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,069
If we had lost,
I wouldn't be able to face my teammates.

30
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,863
They had worked so hard
to win the previous two rounds.

31
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,117
Thank you!

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,870
Goodness, what on earth…

33
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,664
Gosh.

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,925
Auntie Omakase #1 has chosen
Team White Spoon.

35
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,098
We tried so hard…

36
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,562
Team Black Spoon has lost this round,

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,857
and all members have been eliminated.

38
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,543
This can't be. This must be a dream.

39
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,753
I couldn't believe it.

40
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,172
Damn it.

41
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,507
Hey, why are you crying?

42
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,800
-Why are you crying?
-I'm fine.

43
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,845
-What's wrong?
-It was nice.

44
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,346
-No, come on.
-It was a great time.

45
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,348
We did make a comeback. It's okay.

46
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,517
-No, don't cry.
-No, I'm good. They're happy tears.

47
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,810
Gosh.

48
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,103
-You did well.
-You were great.

49
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,771
-I'm sorry.
-No, don't be.

50
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,942
I felt really bad
about letting my teammates down.

51
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,528
If it weren't for me,

52
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,991
we could've gone in a direction
where the noodles stood out more.

53
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:23,244
I couldn't believe
they eliminated all of us.

54
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,580
I guess it'll just be
"The White Spoons Show" now.

55
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,332
There aren't any Black Spoons left.

56
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,128
Compared to the Black Spoons,
the White Spoons were

57
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,339
on another level.

58
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,383
It's a shame, but this is the end.

59
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,469
TEAM BLACK SPOON, TEAM WHITE SPOON

60
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:43,389
TEAM WHITE SPOON

61
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,195
My goodness.

62
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,117
-It's a new setup now.
-What's this?

63
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,329
What's this?
Are we starting all over again?

64
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,581
God, I'm sick of these cooking stations.

65
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,668
-Why are there so many?
-What will it be today?

66
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,753
-Solo matches.
-Solo matches?

67
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,380
-Solo matches?
-Hold on. Seriously?

68
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,923
One, two, three, four, five, six.

69
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,383
-It is solo matches.
-Seven, eight.

70
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,550
Winners of the third round,

71
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,136
the Black and White Spoons' Team Battle,
All or Nothing,

72
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,765
and with all members surviving,
Team White Spoon.

73
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,852
Welcome back to the Main Kitchen.

74
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,147
We survived.

75
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,986
We will now reveal
the theme of the fourth round.

76
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,239
The theme is…

77
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,701
-What could it be?
-This is the most important thing.

78
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,119
The theme of the round.

79
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,787
The theme is…

80
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,832
The Black and White Spoon Alliance Battle.

81
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,419
The Black and White Spoon…

82
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,796
The Black and White Spoon Alliance Battle.

83
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,382
What?

84
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,833
The nine Black Spoon contestants.

85
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,006
This is your last chance at survival.

86
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,385
This is the Last Box Battle.

87
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,472
I want to survive and come back.

88
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,891
I have to win at all costs.

89
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,935
I'll make it back, no matter what.

90
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,772
The boxes placed in front of you

91
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,107
each contain one main ingredient.

92
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,485
It's the ingredient you personally brought

93
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,945
as the one you're most confident with.

94
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,324
Starting now,

95
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,494
you must bring out the flavor
of your one main ingredient

96
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,788
and present your best dish.

97
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,625
However, the number
of additional ingredients you may use

98
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,586
is limited to just ten.

99
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,466
Including seasonings,
such as salt and sugar,

100
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,886
you may only use
up to ten additional ingredients.

101
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,308
In the consolation round,
the Last Box Battle,

102
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,062
you must showcase your main ingredient

103
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,856
with only a minimal amount
of supporting ingredients.

104
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,321
Using only ten supporting ingredients
is no easy task.

105
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,699
There's at least five ingredients
in seasonings alone.

106
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,244
And then, there's oil, which is essential.

107
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:55,164
It's about showcasing the main ingredient
with just a few supporting ones.

108
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,207
That takes real skill.

109
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,837
You could say today's theme
is a duel between the Black Spoons.

110
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,964
Now,

111
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,133
we will reveal the main ingredients

112
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,885
inside the Last Boxes.

113
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,806
Barbecue Lab Director's
main ingredient is…

114
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,852
triploid oysters.

115
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,774
I've always wanted to show

116
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,236
that I'm not someone
who only barbecues meat.

117
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,156
I'm someone who can cook. I'm a chef.

118
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,450
Annyeong Bonjour's main ingredient is

119
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,869
beef tenderloin.

120
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,788
Seoul Mother's main ingredient is

121
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,415
brown croaker.

122
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,458
Brown croaker?

123
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,751
Knife Omakase's main ingredient is

124
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,044
daggertooth pike conger.

125
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,715
Culinary Monster's main ingredient is…

126
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,554
asparagus.

127
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,726
I figured that everyone

128
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,937
would bring all kinds of delicacies
as their main ingredient.

129
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,773
So I wanted to do
a vegetable dish instead.

130
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,942
Witch with a Wok's main ingredient is

131
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,403
eggs.

132
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,242
It's the perfect food.

133
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,079
It's an ingredient
that's always accessible.

134
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,665
Dweji-Gomtang in NY's main ingredient is

135
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,125
blue chanterelle mushrooms.

136
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,086
Brewmaster Yun's main ingredient is

137
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,880
dried pollock.

138
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,175
Rebellious Genius's main ingredient…

139
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,941
will not be revealed
at the contestant's request.

140
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
What?

141
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,991
If they taste without seeing

142
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,037
and can still guess right away
what the main ingredient is,

143
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,832
I think that's when the ingredient
has truly been brought out.

144
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,171
And so,

145
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:11,509
the Last Boxes to prove yourselves
have all been revealed.

146
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,637
Before we begin the Last Box Battle,

147
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,723
we will reveal
the number of survivors for this round.

148
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,562
The number of survivors
for the Last Box Battle is…

149
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,736
only two.

150
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,541
Two?

151
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,920
That was harsh. It was really harsh.

152
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,131
I thought maybe three or four

153
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,716
would get to survive.

154
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,014
That's so stingy.

155
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,393
There are 12 White Spoon chefs left,

156
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,270
so if only two of us advance,

157
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,232
it'll feel like only a tiny hint
of Black Spoon would exist.

158
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,113
And with this,

159
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,491
the Last Box Battle

160
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,621
begins now.

161
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,878
LAST BOX BATTLE RULES

162
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,672
1. ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS
ARE LIMITED TO 10 OR FEWER

163
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,966
2. ONLY MINIMAL NUMBER
OF COOKING EQUIPMENT IS ALLOWED

164
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,933
There were nine Black Spoons

165
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,019
who all wanted to survive,

166
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,649
and it was a bit cruel to make us
face each other as we cooked.

167
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,529
So we're choosing two from here?

168
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,241
This time, it's one main ingredient
and ten additional ones.

169
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,952
-But with only ten…
-It'll be what they're most confident in.

170
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,578
-That won't be easy.
-Of course not.

171
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:49,125
If you start to count salt and pepper too,
there's no end to it.

172
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,419
I can't wait.

173
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,212
The dishes they'll make
while on the brink…

174
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,397
COOKING COMPLETED IN JUST 21 MINUTES

175
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,816
-Did you really ring the bell?
-Yes.

176
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,859
-Really?
-Yes.

177
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,528
It hasn't even been 20 minutes.

178
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,613
-You're done?
-Yes.

179
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,323
-Really? Are you sure?
-Yes, really.

180
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,601
BEEF TENDERLOIN

181
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,147
CAPERS

182
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,816
ONIONS

183
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,651
SALT AND PEPPER

184
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:34,563
BEEF TARTARE

185
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,148
Gosh, this is really…

186
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,235
-Thank you for the dish.
-Yes, please enjoy.

187
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,111
What are these on top?

188
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,738
Those are croutons on top.

189
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,365
-I see. Croutons.
-Yes, so…

190
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,034
Okay.

191
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,578
-You made them look like truffles.
-Yes, a little.

192
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,872
So that's why you used squid ink bread.

193
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,833
You only had ten ingredients,
so you made the most of them.

194
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,379
Ten really is too little.

195
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,023
Your main ingredient

196
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,942
-is beef tenderloin.
-Yes.

197
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,111
The tenderloin is one thing,

198
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,738
but by adding things like truffles,

199
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,908
I think you brought out
the flavor quite well.

200
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,328
A classic example of French cuisine.

201
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,414
That's what you presented.

202
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,584
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

203
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,586
LAST BOX BATTLE RULES

SURVIVORS ARE ANNOUNCED
AFTER ALL TASTINGS ARE COMPLETE

205
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,550
TRUFFLE SCENT
NEEDS ACIDITY

206
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,303
DELICIOUS
FALLS A BIT SHORT DUE TO INGREDIENT LIMIT

207
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,530
I've cooked meat four times,

208
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,826
but I did want to try cooking seafood too.

209
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,079
I can also cook vegetables and fish.

210
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,665
I'm confident when it comes to flavor.

211
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,711
I need to add some aroma to my food.

212
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:24,048
But how would I do that and with what?

213
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,634
There were limits on the use
of cooking equipment as well.

214
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,430
To do the smoking,
there were these stainless-steel pans

215
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,891
called hotel pans.

216
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,935
I set down two half-size pans.

217
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,400
In each one, I put a handful
of hickory wood chips and lit fires.

218
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,655
I placed the oysters in the middle.

219
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,039
Then, I covered that
with a full-size pan like a lid.

220
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,876
I opened up small vents on both sides

221
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,837
so air could flow through

222
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,340
and the smoke could disperse.

223
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,313
I tried to give them a subtle aroma.

224
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,565
There's no oven in this challenge.

225
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,192
No oven and no microwave.

226
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,444
So I used my brain.

227
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,488
We had gas stoves.

228
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,451
I used the hotel pan again
and covered the flame.

229
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,706
I basically made an oven.

230
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,003
So I finished the oysters there
to bring out their color.

231
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,800
And they got that nice, golden hue.

232
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,722
Then, I finished by placing on top
the additional ingredients I prepared.

233
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,809
They're oysters
that are smoked well, very moist,

234
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,686
and full of texture.

235
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,479
That's what I want them to taste.

236
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,107
THE TASTE OF THE OCEAN
WITH FLAME-BROILED MEMORIES

237
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,654
-Barbecue.
-The color is very nice.

238
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,408
I thought you'd cook meat one last time,

239
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,618
but you smoked oysters?

240
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,580
I had to do this
so I wouldn't have any regrets.

241
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,998
If I have to go home,

242
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,708
I'd want to do so without regrets.

243
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,670
They have that soft, moist texture
of steamed oysters

244
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,090
but with a smoky aroma.

245
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,300
-Could I pick one up?
-Yes.

246
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,509
I see. It's completely fine.

247
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,803
-Please take this one.
-What's the sauce?

248
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,931
To really infuse that smoky aroma,

249
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,475
I topped them with garlic butter

250
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,560
and started smoking them
at room temperature.

251
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:45,355
Next, I added shallots
and Cheongyang chili peppers on top.

252
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,316
I thought adding
some starch would be nice,

253
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,401
so I fried thinly sliced
Russet potatoes strings.

254
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,199
It's almost a shame to eat.

255
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,493
You should drink the juices as well.

256
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,703
You'll pick up the lingering smoky aroma.

257
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,673
I couldn't help but smile.

258
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,595
It was a dish
I felt proud of and confident in.

259
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,724
Smoking isn't an easy thing to do.

260
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,978
If you overdo it even a little,
it's overwhelming on the palate.

261
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,820
When you smoked these triploid oysters,

262
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,072
you went about it in an analog way

263
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,740
-due to difficult circumstances.
-Yes.

264
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,700
But there's nothing
to fault with the cooking.

265
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,619
It's very juicy,

266
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,538
but the texture is
also very soft and creamy.

267
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,748
On top of that, you smoked it.

268
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,959
The doneness of the oysters

269
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,669
matched perfectly with his explanation.

270
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,587
It was definitely cooked,

271
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,006
but it still had
that creaminess of raw oysters.

272
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,591
It was really delicious.

273
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,761
You really are amazing
at controlling that intensity.

274
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,763
-It comes through really subtly.
-Right.

275
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,640
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

276
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,562
I was very satisfied. I was so happy.

277
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,150
VERY DELICIOUS
HE'S DEFINITELY A MASTER OF SMOKING

278
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,696
A main ingredient that comes to mind?

279
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,076
It's the supporting ingredient
that we most commonly use.

280
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,163
Let's show them the true value of eggs.

281
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,125
These are secret steamed golden eggs.

282
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,045
First, I add salt, water,

283
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,674
rice wine, and Shaoxing wine
to the eggs and mix them well.

284
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,096
Then, I place a bamboo steamer
on top of a wok.

285
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,811
And I steam the eggs in it.

286
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,107
As the name suggests,
there are secret things

287
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,360
hiding inside this steamed egg dish.

288
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,033
Once the eggs have been steamed,

289
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,495
I carefully place

290
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,957
whole eggs on top

291
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,877
and cook it again.

292
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,215
I'm basically adding whole eggs on top

293
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,799
and steaming it once more.

294
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,602
I sprinkle scallions
and Cheongyang chili peppers over it.

295
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,396
I forgot to mention the scallion oil.

296
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,566
I use scallions to make scallion oil.

297
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,574
Then, I drizzle the scallion oil
over the raw scallions.

298
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,785
The heat from the oil

299
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,079
intensifies that scallion aroma.

300
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,543
I pour over my special soy sauce mix

301
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,673
and then finish with peperoncino flakes.

302
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,302
You scoop and expect just plain eggs,

303
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,723
but you find silky steamed eggs
secretly hiding underneath.

304
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,518
SECRET STEAMED GOLDEN EGGS

305
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,520
These are secret steamed golden eggs.

306
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,689
-Secret steamed golden eggs?
-Yes, secret.

307
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,648
-Why?
-They're wary.

308
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,066
What's so secret about it?

309
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,610
Hiding underneath, very secretively,

310
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,488
there are steamed eggs as soft as pudding.

311
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,407
-Then, it's two layers of steamed eggs?
-Yes.

312
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,703
There's more egg underneath.

313
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,204
Yes, it's in there secretly.

314
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,623
You chose a very common ingredient,

315
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,917
the egg.

316
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,419
What was your intent?

317
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,338
My intent is that today is
the consolation round,

318
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,382
and I must be reborn and survive,

319
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,800
so I picked eggs.

320
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,273
You were right. If you had used
only the whole eggs on top,

321
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,358
it could've tasted a bit dry.

322
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,944
But it's soft underneath
and surprises you.

323
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,655
It's even like
really silky extra soft tofu.

324
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,282
A lot of egg went into this,

325
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,617
so it feels like the main ingredient

326
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,953
was brought together in one spot

327
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,913
to really make an impact.

328
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,124
It was delicious. Thank you.

329
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,250
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

330
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:22,257
VERY DELICIOUS
VERY GOOD IDEA, A FAMILIAR TASTE

331
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,801
The contestant I'm most wary of

332
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,636
is Culinary Monster.

333
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,180
Culinary Monster is at the top.

334
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,098
Of course, Culinary Monster.

335
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,266
He's a monster.

336
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,934
And I'm a witch.

337
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,561
He cooks really well.

338
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,854
He's the biggest threat.

339
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,564
No, I'm not threatened by anyone.

340
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,316
I'm definitely going to advance.

341
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,234
I have to come in first, no matter what.

342
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,036
Asparagus? How will he approach it?

343
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,746
He's using that ingredient?

344
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,249
Other contestants brought meat, fish,

345
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,667
or some kind of protein.

346
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,587
I don't think there's anything
distinctive about asparagus,

347
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,755
so wouldn't it get lost?

348
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,049
Asparagus.

349
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,217
-Right?
-That's right.

350
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:13,642
Will just asparagus be enough?

351
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,813
It may be a vegetable dish,

352
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,148
but I went into it thinking
I'll make it tastier

353
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,234
than the meat or seafood dishes.

354
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,823
I give the asparagus
a good sear in the pan first.

355
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,158
I need to build layers of flavor,

356
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,619
so I add shio koji to brown butter

357
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,870
to bring out some aroma.

358
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,083
To add depth to the flavor,
I use brown veal stock.

359
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,377
STOCK MADE WITH VEAL BONES,
VEGETABLES, AND SPICES

360
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,628
After reducing it down…

361
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,634
I finish by glazing the asparagus with it.

362
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,890
There's not much of a recipe.

363
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,102
The only thing I made
was the lemon nuruk purée.

364
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,482
I used as much
of the lemon peel as I could.

365
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,113
I add nuruk rice made with koji mold.

366
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:12,242
And I seasoned it with shio koji.

367
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,707
BLANCHED LEMONS

368
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,752
BLANCHED LEMONS, SHIO KOJI,
NURUK RICE, LEMON PEEL

369
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,048
I blended all the ingredients together

370
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,968
and made a purée.

371
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,434
LEMON NURUK PURÉE

372
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,146
Lastly, all I did was
add garnishes and plate it.

373
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,816
PANCETTA

374
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,320
GRILLED ASPARAGUS WITH LEMON NURUK PURÉE

375
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,490
Gosh, I thought
your main ingredient was too simple,

376
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,242
but your supporting ingredients weren't.

377
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,037
You chose asparagus, but this is just…

378
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,248
Of course, the asparagus
should be the highlight,

379
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,833
but for more layered flavors

380
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,710
and to give it more depth,

381
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,795
I prepared these supporting ingredients.

382
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,840
Is there a reason why you chose asparagus?

383
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,052
I thought I needed to make
an impact in a single bite.

384
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,846
And it sort of fills up
your mouth in that bite.

385
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,973
Asparagus has that juiciness.

386
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,477
It makes you feel like
you're really chowing down.

387
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,020
That's why I chose asparagus.

388
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,606
I think we can take one each.

389
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,732
-Right?
-Yes.

390
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,138
I've never tasted
a blend of flavors like that before.

391
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,475
I took a bite…

392
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,526
and the flavor of the asparagus

393
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,610
just came alive.

394
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,990
I thought it was really delicious.

395
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,283
But more importantly,

396
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,910
although various ingredients
and techniques were used,

397
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,080
I wondered why the asparagus
stood out so much?

398
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,249
The choice of ingredients was key in this.

399
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,669
Brown veal is essentially beef stock.

400
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,130
-Yes, that's right.
-And pancetta is pork.

401
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,135
The nuruk rice and shio koji add
that touch of fermented flavor.

402
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,387
-In that short time.
-Yes, all of those things.

403
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,347
When they come together like this,

404
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,057
they really make the asparagus shine.

405
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,475
You chose your ingredients well.

406
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,601
Thank you.

407
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,480
If only sugar was used,
it'd be sweet and nothing more.

408
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,650
But when you use shio koji and nuruk rice,

409
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,903
you get both sweet and savory flavors,
making it really complex.

410
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,280
That one thing made it all work.

411
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,282
I became shocked as I tasted it.

412
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:02,162
The supporting ingredients
didn't try to forcibly stand out at all,

413
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,164
and I shouted "Wow!"
to myself as I ate it.

414
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,208
But I didn't want to give it away,
so I just wrote it down. "Wow!"

415
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,920
WOW! I WANT TO EAT MORE AGAIN
INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS

416
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,425
SCORE 9.0

417
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,470
I think it's too early for me to go.

418
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,144
To be honest,
I hate it when food doesn't taste good.

419
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,564
It's a dish
I've been cooking for a decade.

420
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,899
BROWN CROAKER

421
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,108
I chose brown croaker.

422
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,532
I cut it into thick pieces
with the skin on.

423
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:46,831
Its texture is a lot firmer
than other fish, but it's still tender.

424
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,959
It would've been too boring
to just serve it raw.

425
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,047
I decided to cook it like a steak.

426
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,678
I used a bulgogi marinade

427
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,472
and cooked it all the way through.

428
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,350
Next,

429
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,770
there's a type of green onion
called calçots

430
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,939
that grow in Hamyang
at only this time of the year.

431
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,528
I peeled off the outer charred layers.

432
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,865
When you grill it, it becomes very sweet.

433
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,620
I cooked and served
the brown croaker in big pieces

434
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,039
so you can tell it's the star of the dish.

435
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,333
BROWN CROAKER BULGOGI STEAK

436
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,961
-Thank you for the dish.
-Of course.

437
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:33,962
Thank you.

438
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,228
-So you ate this with rice?
-Yes.

439
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,646
-Since childhood?
-Yes.

440
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,984
It would've been nice if there were rice.

441
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,236
Even without rice,

442
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,904
-it would go well with alcohol.
-Right.

443
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,450
It's the peak season
for Hamyang green onions.

444
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,785
-Yes, from the end of April.
-Right.

445
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,788
I think it worked well
with this ingredient.

446
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,249
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

447
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,463
DWEJI-GOMTANG IN NY

448
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,257
Blue chanterelle mushrooms
are a very precious variety.

449
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,509
They're the main ingredient of my dish,

450
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,094
blue chanterelle gomtang.

451
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,139
I sell gomtang made with pork
in New York right now,

452
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,349
but a lot of people ask
for a vegan option.

453
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,267
New Yorkers.

454
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,643
So why not do a vegan dish?

455
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,938
To balance out that wild and robust flavor
of blue chanterelle mushrooms,

456
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,399
I added cauliflower mushrooms
and pyogo mushrooms.

457
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,695
By bringing out the subtle sweetness
from the vegetables,

458
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,364
I offset some of that bitterness.

459
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,743
It's a gomtang
with a deep, natural flavor.

460
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,789
BLUE CHANTERELLE GOMTANG

461
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,548
All the ingredients you mentioned
pop out one after another

462
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,425
and highlight the flavor
of your ingredient.

463
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,761
-I think vegans would love this.
-Yes.

464
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,266
KNIFE OMAKASE

465
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,560
It's a dish that reflects my title.

466
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,605
I prepared
daggertooth pike conger shabu-shabu.

467
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,194
Daggertooth pike congers
have a lot of fine bones,

468
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,197
so depending on how it is prepped,

469
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,866
its quality and flavor can really change.

470
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,828
Out of all the chefs here,

471
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,248
there's no one who can prep
a daggertooth pike conger better than me.

472
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,294
DAGGERTOOTH PIKE CONGER SHABU-SHABU

473
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,462
It looks too good to eat.

474
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,130
It's like a blooming flower.

475
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,632
DAGGERTOOTH PIKE CONGER

476
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,093
EGGPLANT, UMEBOSHI, ONIONS, YUZU,
KOMBU, SALT, COOKING OIL

477
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,141
It's been nicely scored,

478
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,185
and the broth has seeped into the cuts.

479
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,271
You really made the ingredient shine.

480
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,148
Only the right ingredients have been used,

481
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,400
so the dish is very clean.

482
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,610
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

483
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,285
I thought Rebellious Genius
really nailed the buildup,

484
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,495
especially by not revealing
his main ingredient.

485
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:17,250
I thought about how I could make
my main ingredient really stand out.

486
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,503
If they taste without seeing
and can still know what it is,

487
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,091
wouldn't that clearly prove
the ingredient has really stood out?

488
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,684
-I'll prepare it for you.
-Should we look away?

489
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,977
-If possible.
-Really?

490
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,145
-We can't look?
-Yes.

491
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,441
I'm so curious.

492
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,486
Okay, it's ready to taste now.

493
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,009
What is this, 20 Questions? Seafood!

494
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,345
-Yes, it's seafood.
-Seafood, right?

495
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,304
Yes.

496
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,640
It's sometimes consumed as a drink.

497
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,309
-That's right.
-Right? I know what it is.

498
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,769
As I kept chewing,

499
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,229
the flavor of it came through
more and more,

500
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,148
and then I realized what it was.

501
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,818
To be honest, I knew they'd get it
as soon as they tasted it.

502
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,280
The dish I prepared is

503
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,532
deep-fried sea pineapple.

504
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,620
Since sea pineapples have
such a strong taste of the ocean,

505
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,374
I thought they'd fit well
with the theme of the consolation round,

506
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,541
so I picked them.

507
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,212
Using perilla leaves and dried seaweed,

508
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,922
I wrapped the sea pineapples in them.

509
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,218
Then, I dipped them in batter
and deep-fried them.

510
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,848
Using sour cream, doenjang, and garlic,

511
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,976
I made a doenjang and vinegar sauce,

512
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,144
like chojang,
or a gochujang and vinegar sauce.

513
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:05,108
I cut the deep-fried sea pineapples
in half and put them on the sauce.

514
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,322
I chiffonade some Swiss chard

515
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,074
and place that over the sea pineapples

516
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:17,120
to hide the main ingredient
and make sure they can't see it.

517
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,789
DEEP-FRIED SEA PINEAPPLE

518
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,625
Initially, the savory batter
and perilla aroma were strong.

519
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,336
But as you keep chewing,
the distinct flavor of sea pineapple

520
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,921
starts to come through.

521
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,049
Deep-frying it gives it a unique charm.

522
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,927
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

523
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,012
Thank you.

524
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,119
All the dishes looked delicious.

525
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,581
And their ingredients
all seemed really good.

526
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,294
Annyeong Bonjour's main ingredient is

527
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,422
beef tenderloin.

528
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,217
…blue chanterelle mushrooms.

529
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,304
…brown croaker.

530
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,639
God, this ingredient in front of me…

531
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,645
This dried pollock.

532
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,773
I almost felt bad for it.

533
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,608
Is it too ordinary?

534
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,401
Yeah.

535
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,987
But for the last time,

536
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,033
I wanted to show respect
to the main ingredient I had picked today.

537
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:40,036
As a barkeeper, I decided
to serve them a hangover cure today,

538
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,913
so I prepared dried pollock hangover soup.

539
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,540
What I thought was really important was

540
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,418
extracting flavor
from the whole dried pollock.

541
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,714
Normally, people use
shredded dried pollock,

542
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,217
but the taste from using it whole
is completely different.

543
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,720
I prepped the whole dried pollock…

544
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,478
And I grilled it nice and golden brown,

545
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,689
which really concentrates the flavor.

546
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,401
I heard this was how they made it
back in the old days.

547
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:17,240
It may be forgotten now,
but we used to always cook it this way.

548
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,494
Then, I needed to make the broth,

549
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,248
so I sautéed some potatoes.

550
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,002
I added the head and bones
of the grilled pollock.

551
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,258
I also added some kelp.

552
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,095
And by adding rice water,

553
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,889
I can get rid of that fishy taste
from the pollock.

554
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,651
And once the broth was ready…

555
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,579
I took the dried pollock
seasoned with soy sauce

556
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,583
and simmered it
with just a bit of the broth.

557
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,795
This soup is sometimes made with tofu

558
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,422
or soybean sprouts.

559
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,215
Everyone probably cooks it differently.

560
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,759
But all of that felt unnecessary.

561
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,221
At some point,
I realized the dried pollock

562
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,015
was perfectly fine on its own,

563
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,726
so I left the rest out.

564
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:34,150
Dried pollock is left to freeze
and thaw repeatedly in the winter,

565
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,944
so it's an ingredient
that's been naturally dried.

566
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,655
It reminded me of life.

567
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,824
It can't be good all the time.

568
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,326
We have bad days too.

569
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,788
I'm sure everyone has
their own version of hangover soup,

570
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,041
but my hangover soup

571
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,044
has simmered dried pollock
with rich flavor.

572
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,712
It's dried pollock hangover soup.

573
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,883
-I knew it'd be a dried pollock soup.
-Right.

574
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,092
You were really pounding it.

575
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,348
Didn't you worry it might be too plain?

576
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,850
I thought this was the best dish

577
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,852
to truly present dried pollock

578
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,562
-in my own style.
-As a barkeeper.

579
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,439
-You sell alcohol…
-With the bones too.

580
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,774
-And you cure hangovers.
-Right.

581
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,817
I thought, "What can I offer
as a hangover cure?"

582
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,111
And I wanted to serve
the whole fish in the soup.

583
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,073
We need to eat this before it cools.

584
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,494
Gosh, the broth…

585
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,537
It's nice and thick.

586
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,749
-You must have been pressed for time.
-Yes.

587
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,708
But still,

588
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,002
-it came out nice and rich.
-Yes.

589
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,227
He picked up the entire bowl
and ate from it.

590
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,564
To really highlight the dried pollock,
she used rice water

591
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,775
and just a touch
of supporting ingredients.

592
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,194
She did an excellent job of it.

593
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,030
The flavor is focused
on the dried pollock,

594
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,449
but it's still very clean
and the ingredient stands out.

595
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,202
It wasn't about trying
to make things appear plentiful

596
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,204
or anything like that.

597
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,914
In very a pure way,

598
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,333
the flavor of dried pollock was hearty,

599
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,335
sweet, and savory.

600
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,045
Everything was about the dried pollock.

601
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,047
Gosh, I'm totally cured now.

602
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,092
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

603
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,468
The flavor came through

604
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,137
because I had faith in my ingredient.

605
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,727
The tasting is complete.

606
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,105
While the judges discuss,

607
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,649
contestants, please exit for a moment.

608
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,652
Do you have a clear winner in mind?

609
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,863
I wrote it down here.

610
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,075
-Right.
-None of the ingredients used

611
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,243
was unnecessary.

612
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,494
-That's right.
-None of them.

613
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,538
But they weren't used excessively either.

614
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,790
They definitely used
their main ingredient the best.

615
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,042
You and I thought the same.

616
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,419
Okay, we've picked the one in first place.

617
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,545
And in the end…

618
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,472
That dish brought out
the ingredient better.

619
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,015
Can't we pick three?

620
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:15,019
I made the best dish
according to my standards.

621
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,103
I was certain

622
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,647
I'd make it.

623
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,648
Now,

624
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,860
we will announce the two survivors

625
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,279
who have made it through

626
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,198
the consolation round.

627
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,086
I had a bad feeling.

628
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,629
I haven't felt that way in a while.

629
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,257
In this consolation round,

630
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,054
the first survivor is…

631
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,731
Congratulations,

632
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,735
Culinary Monster.

633
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,280
Culinary Monster.

634
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,536
CULINARY MONSTER SURVIVES

635
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,917
More than anything,
your dish fit the theme perfectly.

636
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:25,256
All the flavors of the asparagus
gradually started to come out,

637
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,425
and I found myself
chomping away without realizing.

638
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,843
He really is a culinary monster.

639
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:33,013
Even if this dish
was served in a restaurant,

640
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,850
it wouldn't feel out of place at all.

641
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,727
It was the most well-executed
and best tasting dish.

642
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,104
There was no question about it.

643
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,649
Since I was able to advance,

644
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,276
and though winning was always my goal,

645
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,403
I want it even more now.

646
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,073
We will now announce

647
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,660
the second and final survivor.

648
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,003
Who will advance with him?

649
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,716
I really hope I'm the second survivor.

650
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,927
The final survivor is…

651
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,900
Congratulations,

652
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,777
Brewmaster Yun.

653
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,654
Brewmaster Yun.

654
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,035
BREWMASTER YUN SURVIVES

655
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,917
Brewmaster Yun's dried pollock dish

656
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,252
had warmth in it.

657
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,421
In some ways,
you did the best job of bringing out

658
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,381
the natural flavor of the ingredient.

659
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,675
The dried pollock tasted

660
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,303
as if I was being pounded by the mallet

661
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,804
and hit by the pollock.

662
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,599
That's how rich the flavor was.

663
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,102
Actually, Mr. Paik assumed
I was done eating and took it away, but…

664
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,399
Rather than adding garnishes
and all sorts of things,

665
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,944
-you used rice water and potatoes…
-Yes, for a clean taste.

666
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,737
-And to make it…
-You're done, right?

667
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,864
Please, go ahead. So…

668
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,492
It'd be pathetic to say, "No, give it!"

669
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,910
So I just said, "Sure, go ahead."

670
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,161
But that was a shame.

671
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,960
I'm so grateful and happy,

672
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,004
but I also felt bad for my teammates.

673
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,510
As someone who cooks Korean cuisine,

674
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,262
and as someone who brews alcohol,

675
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:41,308
I felt the weight on my two shoulders
in that moment.

676
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,815
There will be

677
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,858
no additional survivors.

678
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:01,495
You all did a tremendous job
of making it this far.

679
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:06,041
Just being here today
is definitely something to be proud of.

680
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,459
And I truly respect you all.

681
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,420
Great job, everyone.

682
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,089
Congratulations.

683
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,886
Of course, I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't disappointed.

684
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:19,847
But still,

685
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,474
I tried my best and have no regrets.

686
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,644
I was eliminated
because the others did better.

687
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,230
The dishes I wanted to create

688
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,984
included ones
that couldn't be served to customers.

689
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,487
But I got to cook what I wanted here.

690
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,282
I think it's a way to push myself.

691
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,452
"How many people out are there
who can cook better than me?"

692
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,038
That's the kind of arrogance
I need to reflect on.

693
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,582
I realized I need to work harder.

694
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,293
This is only the beginning.

695
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,295
The fourth round is

696
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,173
the Black and White Spoon Alliance Battle.

697
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,720
In this fourth round competition,

698
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,681
you will not be the only contestants.

699
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,851
-What?
-It means there are more people.

700
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,978
Black Spoon survivors,

701
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,730
please enter.

702
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,357
-Are they coming in from there?
-Where?

703
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,900
I think it's from over there.

704
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,276
There?

705
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,986
-There!
-What?

706
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,031
Culinary Monster.

707
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,658
It's Culinary Monster!

708
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,701
The first additional survivor is

709
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,827
Culinary Monster.

710
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,788
I know that feeling.

711
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,915
I came back from the dead once.

712
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,583
Yeah, we needed some Black Spoons

713
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,377
to balance things out.

714
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,170
That's what the show's all about.

715
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,755
The second additional survivor is

716
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,882
Brewmaster Yun.

717
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,260
Gosh, congratulations!

718
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,638
Congratulations!

719
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,848
Welcome back!

720
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,893
They were sent to hell
and came back alive.

721
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,479
They must have hidden skills.
They're tough opponents.

722
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,232
With this, there are 12 White Spoon chefs

723
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,067
and two Black Spoon chefs.

724
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,277
A total of 14 contestants

725
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,113
will take part in the fourth round

726
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,073
and engage in a culinary battle.

727
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,368
This fourth round

728
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,581
is the Battle for the Top 7.

729
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,041
Seriously?

730
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,292
Half will be wiped out.

731
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,504
-Half of us will be going home.
-That's 50%.

732
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,964
Exactly.

733
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,632
The real game starts from now.

734
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:22,010
In the third round,
they basically got rid of a whole team.

735
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,097
Then, after letting two
of those nine survive,

736
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,765
they're eliminating half of us again.

737
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,475
Isn't this…

738
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,519
too cruel?

739
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,149
The Battle for the Top 7's theme is…

740
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,574
Two-Person Team Black
and White Spoon Alliance Battle.

741
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,243
-Two-person?
-Two-person!

742
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,619
So it is groups of two.

743
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,121
So it's two stations for each team.

744
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,747
Right here.

745
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,291
So we have to get into pairs.

746
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,251
In front of you now

747
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:59,089
are seven sets of cooking stations
that allow two people to cook together.

748
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,425
In this round,

749
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,386
the two chefs in each pair
must form an alliance

750
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,181
to create their best dish.

751
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,809
Please create a well-executed dish

752
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,729
that can only be made with two people.

753
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,023
So the pairs aren't fighting each other.

754
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,026
It's a new type of challenge.

755
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,987
So I thought, "Who do I need to pair with

756
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,405
for the easiest way to advance?"

757
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,699
And with this,

758
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,828
we will proceed
with the selection of the pairs.

759
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:35,250
First, the two Black Spoon chefs
who survived the consolation round

760
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,879
will be given priority
in choosing their teammates.

761
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,550
Congratulations.

762
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,718
We're waiting to be picked.

763
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,261
I have no complaints.

764
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,597
They worked hard to make it back here.

765
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,142
The Black Spoon chef who survived first
in the consolation round,

766
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,602
Culinary Monster,

767
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,355
will be given the first pick.

768
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,107
Does anyone want to team up with me?

769
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,068
No one?

770
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,195
Me.

771
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,947
It'd be nice to team up.

772
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,990
Momentum is a really important thing.

773
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,076
I thought I should take in
some of that energy.

774
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,579
So the other ten chefs
will reject me if I pick them?

775
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,747
Here!

776
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,332
Well, you have to pick us first.

777
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,291
Then…

778
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,421
Mr. Good Vibes.

779
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,798
I'll go with Chef Son Jong-won.

780
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,050
-A strong pair.
-I had my hand up.

781
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,552
You didn't see.

782
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,680
I think Chef Son Jong-won
also believed that teaming up with me

783
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:33,308
would yield better results
than pairing with other people.

784
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,687
To be honest, I did want to
team up with Culinary Monster.

785
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,232
We've both been working
in fine dining for a long time,

786
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,150
so we understand each other.

787
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,319
Which station?

788
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,613
I want to try the White Spoon's side.

789
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,074
-That has the most space.
-Here? Let's take this one.

790
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,160
I'll go straight to the person.

791
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,455
Chef.

792
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,542
-Right away?
-The Korean cuisines chefs meet.

793
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,668
IM SEONG-KEUN

794
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,003
If you would join me…

795
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,797
-I'm for it.
-I'd be grateful.

796
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,090
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

797
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,383
Thank you.

798
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,512
Chef Im is basically
an expert in Korean cuisine,

799
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,680
and I always thought

800
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,391
he was great at bringing out
the natural flavor of ingredients.

801
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,853
I do Korean cuisine,
and so does Brewmaster Yun.

802
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:22,357
I thought we'd be able to create something
we both would be on board with.

803
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,360
-What about the rest of us?
-Right?

804
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,988
Now, the remaining White Spoon chefs

805
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,366
are free to team up in pairs

806
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,286
with another White Spoon chef
of their choice.

807
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,747
-Do we express our interest?
-We can freely pick?

808
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,332
Do we say who we're interested in?

809
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,542
Having made it this far,

810
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,336
you start to get a read on people.

811
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,630
I bet looks were exchanged here and there

812
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,257
with secret intentions
passed back and forth.

813
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,342
Like this.

814
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,219
…of their choice.

815
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,929
-We can freely pick?
-Yeah, that's right.

816
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:57,017
-What are you doing? Take your arm out!
-We're done.

817
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,518
Hee-eun, team up with me.

818
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,978
Like this?

819
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,813
All I need is Sam Kim.

820
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,232
Goodness.

821
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,318
-Would it be okay?
-Of course.

822
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,820
-Are you Western and Japanese cuisine?
-Sorry?

823
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,781
Japanese and Western work well together.

824
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,115
Yes, we're Chinese and Western.

825
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,408
They're not bad.

826
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:14,826
Okay.

827
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,703
Let's team up.

828
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,080
-Let's pair up.
-Okay.

829
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:23,001
TWO-PERSON TEAMS
FOR BLACK AND WHITE SPOON ALLIANCE BATTLE

830
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,837
Then, we have to decide
on the dish right now.

831
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,589
We're allowed to develop it.

832
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,300
-We can't change…
-But the overall idea can't change.

833
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,677
-What a headache.
-Yes, it is.

834
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,470
To do this now…

835
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,430
Put simply, I think it's this.

836
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,599
This is a dish
only the two of us can create.

837
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,684
-Right.
-Yes.

838
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,102
These two people came together,

839
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,395
but why did they have to meet?

840
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,022
I think it's about that synergy
when we become a team.

841
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,982
So I thought about it.

842
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:49,361
Your cooking is rooted in tradition,
and although I also do Korean cuisine,

843
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,613
I do modern Korean food.

844
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,448
We both have backgrounds
in Korean cuisine,

845
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,659
so you could say
our cooking styles aligned.

846
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,453
With the traditional food I've made,

847
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,748
she reimagines it
through the lens of her own generation.

848
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,127
If we can blend in these aspects,

849
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,295
I think it will make a beautiful story.

850
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,465
So then I thought,
"What should we be focusing on?"

851
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,927
I think we should figure out
our enemies first.

852
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,763
They do Chinese and French cuisines.

853
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,683
They're purely Chinese cuisine.

854
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,435
-Right.
-With Chef Chun Sang-hyun.

855
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,020
-This is good. Japanese and Italian.
-Right.

856
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,647
Honestly, they go well together.

857
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,399
-Can I say you do Italian cuisine?
-Yes.

858
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,359
-Italian and Japanese.
-Right.

859
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,945
It's Italian cuisine but with local food.

860
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,363
-We grow a lot of produce.
-Right.

861
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,281
So…

862
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,618
They'll definitely have some kind
of showy aspect to their dish.

863
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,078
Their flavors will be bold.

864
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,040
To be honest, the good thing about this is
we have similar backgrounds.

865
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,251
So I think incorporating that
would be really good.

866
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:52,215
I don't think there are many teams
whose styles match as well as ours.

867
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,010
When explaining techniques or methods,

868
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:58,096
I thought we could really be in sync.

869
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,224
For example, when you do this…

870
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,809
-Let's say there's a custard.
-Okay.

871
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,020
We have the glaze,
and if we make it look nice…

872
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,980
So this is just an idea.

873
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:09,566
If we have a classic poached egg,

874
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,860
we cover it with a cresson purée

875
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,237
and stick on the caviar roe on one by one.

876
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,491
-Classic and… Yes.
-With hardcore plating in one category.

877
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,743
When the others see our dish,
they'll think,

878
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,912
"These jerks really went this far?"

879
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,955
They said "a special dish,"

880
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,500
but I don't think it has to be

881
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,918
-a premium ingredient.
-I agree.

882
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,712
-What do you like?
-I like…

883
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,464
I like meat.

884
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,507
-Meat?
-Yes.

885
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,718
To be honest,
the best thing I can make are meat dishes.

886
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,261
-Right.
-That's how I'd put it.

887
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,723
With us, it's barkeeper,
liquor, and Korean cuisine.

888
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,518
Those are some essential keywords.

889
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,561
-Because you're a barkeeper.
-Right.

890
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:51,691
I think this will go perfectly
with traditional galbi.

891
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,401
Brewmaster Yun!

892
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,945
Im Seong-keun, let's do it!

893
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,405
Hey, White Spoons!

894
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,449
We're off to shop for groceries!

895
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,078
EACH TEAM MUST PROCURE
THEIR INGREDIENTS BY THEMSELVES

896
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:06,498
(THEY MUST ALL SHOP
AT THE DESIGNATED PLACE)

897
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,461
BUYING OF INGREDIENTS IS COMPLETE

898
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,587
Finally.

899
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,430
The most important thing is

900
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,391
they each have their own styles.

901
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,810
So it's about how key flavors
and their different styles

902
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,646
come together to create synergy.

903
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,065
Of course, if the dish tastes bad,

904
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,067
it's all useless.

905
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,779
The Two-Person Team Black
and White Spoon Alliance Battle

906
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,322
to decide the Top 7.

907
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,199
Each pair,

908
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,076
in order of completion,

909
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,579
will present their dishes
before the judges.

910
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,040
After tasting a dish,

911
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,292
the judges will discuss,

912
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,670
and if the dish is deemed
to have been well-executed,

913
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,132
that pair will be sent
to the Survival Candidate Zone.

914
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,593
If the dish is deemed to be lacking,

915
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,429
the pair will be sent
to the Elimination Candidate Zone.

916
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,932
Once all seven dishes have been tasted,

917
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,810
the first-place team
from the Survival Candidate Zone

918
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,731
and the last-place team
from the Elimination Candidate Zone

919
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,065
will be selected.

920
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,943
The first-place team
will advance to the Top 7.

921
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,279
The last-place team

922
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,114
will be eliminated.

923
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,118
The process for deciding
the remaining spots in the Top 7

924
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,786
will be revealed at a later time.

925
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,706
We have to come in first place.

926
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,626
I need to hurry and grab a seat up there.

927
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,210
Basically,

928
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,463
winning is everything.

929
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,257
And with this,

930
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,510
the Two-Person Team Black
and White Spoon Alliance Battle

931
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,764
begins now!

932
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,308
-Let's go!
-Okay, let's do it!

933
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,101
-We can do this.
-Let's do it!

934
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,729
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

935
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,189
Let's go!

936
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,525
-Okay, let's do it.
-Yes.

937
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,028
-We'll take it easy.
-Right. We'll just do what we always do.

938
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,532
It requires a lot of effort.
We have to use the full two hours.

939
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,036
It's a very technical dish.

940
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,539
If there's even the slightest error,
this dish will fail.

941
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:15,335
Both of our experiences combined

942
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:19,089
will support us
in creating an amazing dish.

943
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,801
Gosh, this is so heavy.

944
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,639
Our dish is where
Japanese cuisine and Italian cuisine meet.

945
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:33,853
We're planning to season brown croaker
with doenjang and grill it.

946
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,691
Chef Sam Kim will make the sauce.

947
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,277
It'll feel like
Italian cuisine made in Japan.

948
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,613
Venerable Sunjae and I formed a pair.

949
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,700
We wanted to present
the essence of Korean cuisine,

950
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,576
so we'll make a bansang,
or spread of dishes.

951
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,912
This is an honor for us.

952
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,125
These are dishes you can't eat
in any restaurant anywhere.

953
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,209
That's right.

954
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,003
Unless they do special collaborations.

955
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,546
It's their first time making these.

956
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,716
Yes, and it's unlikely
we'll ever get to taste these again.

957
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,800
This is true.

958
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,052
They have their own distinct styles,

959
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,471
so I wonder how they'll work together.

960
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,695
He's chopping something with an ax.

961
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,574
Chef Im Seong-keun.

962
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,908
-He has ribs.
-Yes.

963
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,077
He's hacking them with an ax.

964
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,792
The challenge is about two people
coming together as one,

965
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,588
so something Brewmaster Yun is good at

966
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,048
and what I'm good at

967
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,383
will come together as one
and create a synergy.

968
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,677
That's the kind of dish we decided on.

969
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:51,222
We didn't even take ten minutes to decide.

970
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,934
-What do you like?
-I like…

971
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,644
I like meat.

972
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,687
-Meat?
-Yes.

973
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,315
Do you know something called bakpogalbi?

974
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,108
Bakpogalbi.

975
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,027
-I've had it before.
-Yes.

976
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,113
They say the king of galbi is bakpogalbi.

977
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,532
In the past, they'd leave
the bone in the pork belly

978
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,159
and marinate it to make galbi.

979
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,077
BAKPOGALBI

980
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,288
A STYLE OF GALBI MADE BY SLICING
PORK BELLY WITH RIB BONE STILL ATTACHED

981
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,124
SLICED THIN WITH THE RIB BONE INTACT

982
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,381
You're basically making pork galbi

983
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,926
using the rib bones
attached to the pork belly.

984
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,221
-I remember the texture.
-Yes, it's nice and chewy.

985
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:34,015
-An even mix of fat and meat, right?
-Yes, that's right.

986
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,809
That texture and savory flavor

987
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,103
are much better than regular galbi,

988
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,355
so we decided to go with bakpogalbi.

989
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,690
And we'll need something
to accompany that.

990
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,651
What can we add? My role…

991
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,111
-I need to play a part.
-Radish.

992
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,237
-Radish. Yeah.
-Radish.

993
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,863
That's the most important element.

994
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,908
When you eat meat,
you need to have radish salad.

995
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,409
-It's an absolute must.
-I love it.

996
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,079
I'm good at slicing radish.
I can season it well too.

997
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,288
-It's a must.
-Right.

998
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,457
Radish helps you digest the meat,

999
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:04,254
and its refreshing and clean taste
balances out the sweet and salty flavors.

1000
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,923
It might seem really simple,
but it's a great combination.

1001
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,633
The perfect match.

1002
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:13,054
After slicing the meat
to a thickness of 7mm, I score both sides.

1003
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,558
You need to score it so the marinade
is absorbed quickly and evenly.

1004
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:22,230
The texture of pork changes
depending on the direction of your cuts.

1005
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,692
It requires proper cooking techniques,

1006
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,486
and I could tell
he really was a master at this.

1007
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,240
MEAT PREPPED IN JUST 10 MINUTES

1008
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,160
All right.

1009
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,203
How far have you gotten?

1010
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,997
I'm mincing the garlic, Chef.

1011
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,499
-And the large green onions?
-They need to be minced.

1012
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,379
I was mincing the garlic super finely,

1013
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,632
so you wouldn't bite into
even a single piece.

1014
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,356
-Here.
-Thank you.

1015
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,408
He was moving like lightning.

1016
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,911
He was just flying around.

1017
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:25,502
If I mess this up,
I'd be a huge inconvenience.

1018
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,422
So I worked hard like I was in overdrive.

1019
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,967
I caught my breath and looked around,

1020
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:37,514
and everyone was cooking so gracefully.

1021
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,683
We were the only ones
moving around chaotically.

1022
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,648
But we had to.

1023
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,733
Because we had a goal in mind.

1024
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,986
-We'll finish as quickly as possible.
-Okay.

1025
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,821
Then, we'll have a taste.

1026
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,032
We just need the texture.
The seasoning will be fine.

1027
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,243
I said we should finish it
as quickly as possible.

1028
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,953
It's a hot dish,

1029
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,163
so it has to be eaten quickly.

1030
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:05,208
I wanted to ring the bell
with around 55 minutes left.

1031
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,001
THEIR GOAL IS TO FINISH IN 65 MINUTES

1032
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:09,087
In that short amount of time,

1033
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,006
the marinade must be absorbed well
and evenly into the pork.

1034
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,758
That was the key point.

1035
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,970
We coated the pork with honey

1036
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,557
so the sugars would work as a tenderizer.

1037
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,060
Once the honey softens up the pork…

1038
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,650
The pork goes into the marinade,

1039
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,486
and we grill it once.

1040
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,030
In that short amount of time,

1041
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,283
the marinade needs to be absorbed evenly,

1042
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:42,078
and the charcoal aroma needs to be
infused deeply into the pork.

1043
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:44,038
But what's the best way to do that?

1044
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,666
Now, please cover this

1045
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,459
-and take it to the freezer.
-Okay.

1046
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,795
-Set the timer for five minutes.
-Three? Five minutes.

1047
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,799
I found the answer in grilling.

1048
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,843
In historical recipes,

1049
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,721
there's something called seolyamyeok.

1050
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,056
It was a meat dish enjoyed by nobles.

1051
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,309
It's a method where you grill
meat over a brazier,

1052
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,270
cool it in the snow,

1053
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,564
and then grill it once more.

1054
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,358
If you cook it about 30 to 50%

1055
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,403
and then put it in the fridge or freezer,

1056
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,947
the leftover heat in the meat,

1057
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,366
in the same way we steam rice,

1058
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,702
allows the meat to soften
and absorb the marinade.

1059
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,996
And it enhances that charcoal aroma.

1060
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,549
This was chilled perfectly.

1061
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:43,890
It chills after about five minutes,
so we take it out,

1062
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,642
put it back on the fire,

1063
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,894
and then baste it as we grill it.

1064
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,145
That's the key point.

1065
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,858
I've cooked meat dishes
for almost 40 years,

1066
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,278
so I believe I'm better
at cooking galbi than anyone else.

1067
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,200
Brewmaster,
it's going back in one more time.

1068
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,706
When you repeat
that process two to three times,

1069
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,838
even in that short period, it tastes like
it's been aged a day or two.

1070
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:23,763
I said I'd season
the radish salad in the meantime,

1071
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,390
so I added peak-season salted shrimp

1072
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,058
as a special ingredient.

1073
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:35,108
PEAK-SEASON SALTED SHRIMP

1074
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:39,237
I crumbled in the salted shrimp
with my hands to season the radish.

1075
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,992
To make sure
it complements the galbi nicely,

1076
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,538
I made the dish slightly spicy
with finely ground chili powder.

1077
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:52,792
I tried to season it so the taste
would be clean and smooth on the palate.

1078
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:56,504
Next, the ssamjang on the side

1079
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,673
is another important element.

1080
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:01,384
A bad one could even ruin
meat that's been perfectly-cooked.

1081
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,595
I mixed two kinds of doenjang together.

1082
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,014
Every doenjang differs
in saltiness and sweetness.

1083
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,309
I also added a bit of gochujang

1084
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,604
and used honey to add some sweetness.

1085
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,235
Chef, I added a bit of honey.

1086
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,988
Is it okay? Should I make it sweeter?

1087
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,072
-No, don't.
-It's okay?

1088
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,198
-It's perfect.
-It is?

1089
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:27,702
We kept tasting
and adjusting the flavor together.

1090
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,124
Is it okay?

1091
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,460
It's so delicious.

1092
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,420
-Have a taste of this.
-Okay.

1093
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:38,880
It should be cooked.

1094
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,591
Okay, how is it?

1095
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,342
-It's so delicious.
-What?

1096
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,719
It's really good.

1097
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:45,970
-Really good.
-All done?

1098
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:49,307
Let's plate it up.
Let's go and serve it quickly.

1099
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,560
In a way,

1100
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,979
it's a dish everyone knows,

1101
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,272
and it's a humble one.

1102
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,234
But we'll present the best flavor

1103
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,446
and be the ultimate dream team

1104
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,323
to succeed in this round.

1105
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,705
"We have to serve it while it's hot."

1106
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,208
That was our goal,

1107
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,461
so we really pushed ourselves at the end.

1108
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,802
-Ring the bell?
-Yes, ring it.

1109
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,386
Okay, one, two, three.

1110
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,100
What?

1111
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,186
With 52 minutes left to go?

1112
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,104
They're already done?

1113
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,606
What? They're already finished?

1114
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,400
Already?

1115
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,152
-That was quick.
-Very quick.

1116
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,947
It's better to get it over with quickly.

1117
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,747
The team of Im Seong-keun
and Brewmaster Yun.

1118
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,250
Please make your way to the judges' table.

1119
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,376
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1120
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,382
You finished that quickly?
You're faster than us.

1121
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:06,884
Gosh, that's amazing.

1122
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,263
It went just as planned.

1123
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,973
Things went smoothly and quickly.

1124
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,644
From our perspective,
we were happy with the outcome.

1125
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,677
Our team…

1126
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,721
made bakpogalbi and radish salad.

1127
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,514
BAKPOGALBI AND RADISH SALAD WRAPS

1128
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:56,976
Bakpogalbi is galbi made
from pork belly left on the bone,

1129
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,229
so it boasts a nice, chewy texture
and a savory flavor.

1130
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,773
Then, pairing perfectly with the meat,

1131
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,942
we have radish salad,
a popular Korean side dish.

1132
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:06,903
Since it's a common side dish,

1133
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:09,614
you may think it's nothing special.

1134
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:13,492
But radish contains diastase,
which is great for digestion,

1135
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,328
so it's to help them digest.

1136
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,622
It's all about being considerate.

1137
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:21,292
It's a side dish that has always
accompanied meat dishes in Korean cuisine.

1138
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,919
We recommend

1139
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,630
tasting a piece of galbi first.

1140
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,924
Then, have it with some radish.

1141
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,718
And third, try it in a lettuce wrap.

1142
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,971
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

1143
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,181
-Thank you.
-Of course.

1144
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:38,684
First,

1145
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:40,728
take a piece.

1146
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,010
Sometimes, you can tell

1147
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:17,014
when a single dish
has been made by multiple people together.

1148
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:20,101
We tried very hard
to make sure that didn't happen.

1149
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,401
How do we drink this?

1150
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:15,990
I've already made
the hondonju in these glasses.

1151
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,742
I've prepared a hidden item.

1152
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,577
It's a drink called hondonju.

1153
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,245
It's a bomb shot from the Joseon era.

1154
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:23,581
It's a mix of makgeolli
and distilled liquor.

1155
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:27,084
I used a traditional distilled liquor
with over 40% alcohol,

1156
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,504
which raises the alcohol content
of the makgeolli,

1157
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,715
and it's delicious when paired with meat.

1158
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:34,842
To this,

1159
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,553
I'll add bokbunja,
a Korean black raspberry spirit.

1160
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:41,182
This is a light digestif
you can enjoy called hondonju.

1161
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,729
Why are you shaking so much?

1162
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:48,606
-Is that a bokbunja?
-Yes, it is.

1163
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:50,941
It's like how you have
an olive in a martini.

1164
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,526
You really are a barkeeper.

1165
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:04,330
-Just a taste.
-You even prepared bokbunja.

1166
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,299
You marinated this well
in such a short time.

1167
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:16,509
Thank you.

1168
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,427
Altering the temperature helped too,

1169
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,680
but you did a good job with the pork.

1170
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,015
-You scored it well.
-Yes.

1171
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,101
You made really fine cuts in the meat.

1172
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,144
-It's a well-executed…
-Thank you.

1173
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,729
…pork galbi dish.

1174
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,774
Did you make the ssamjang, Brewmaster?

1175
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,859
Yes, the ssamjang and the seasonings.

1176
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,569
The radish salad was all her work.

1177
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,321
-As you made this…
-Yes?

1178
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:39,198
Did you taste each other's cooking?

1179
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,491
-Yes, continuously.
-Yes.

1180
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:42,159
The ssamjang may clash with the meat.

1181
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,120
That's right.
We worked on separate things,

1182
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,746
so I asked him to check.

1183
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,541
And when I made the radish salad,
I tried it with the galbi.

1184
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,792
-Right.
-And…

1185
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,836
Yes, we adjusted the flavors.

1186
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,421
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1187
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:55,881
Please wait there for a moment.

1188
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,799
Okay.

1189
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:03,305
Now, the judges will discuss

1190
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:06,142
and decide whether the team
of Im Seong-keun and Brewmaster Yun

1191
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,145
will be sent
to the Survival Candidate Zone

1192
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,772
or the Elimination Candidate Zone.

1193
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,482
Let's hold hands.

1194
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:29,248
Don't be nervous.

1195
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:30,958
I was shaking.

1196
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,169
Gosh.

1197
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,260
I thought the pork galbi

1198
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:43,804
was just pretty standard at first

1199
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,306
even though it tasted good.

1200
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,144
Radish salad wraps?

1201
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,104
Bakpogalbi?

1202
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:57,735
Those are just things
you can find at your local eatery.

1203
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:01,572
So I wondered about how they made this.

1204
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:04,116
How did they infuse
their unique styles into the dish?

1205
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,951
I will announce the result.

1206
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:08,120
Im Seong-keun

1207
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,539
and Brewmaster Yun,

1208
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:11,665
You two are…

1209
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,751
