1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,593
When you said
you were making braised eel,

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,305
I wondered if the dish would be
what I was thinking of

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,809
or if it would be something
carrying your own distinct style.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,145
The braised dishes

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,813
that you make

6
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,566
have a very clear style.

7
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,453
You've survived.

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,329
You've survived.

9
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,665
PAIK JONG-WON - SURVIVED
ANH SUNG-JAE - SURVIVED

10
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,125
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

11
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,794
Hidden White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok
has survived.

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,591
…has survived.

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,511
Congratulations!

14
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,971
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations!

15
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,016
This is good news for the Black Spoons.

16
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,517
I thought it could've been heavy.

17
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,020
If the fat is rendered out incorrectly

18
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,647
and the dish was left
to simmer and reduce,

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,608
it can become greasy,
but it had a clean taste.

20
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,068
It was a very tasty braised dish.

21
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:12,322
I've never tasted such clean and delicate
braised freshwater eel before.

22
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,407
The vegetables also tasted
clean on the palate

23
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,659
with each one retaining
its own unique flavor.

24
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,705
It was clear this was a braise
made by a chef.

25
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:25,126
A lot of thought and care
was put into this dish.

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,338
I think I understand
why he came back to this show.

27
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,257
He has plenty to show us,
and I'm looking forward to it.

28
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,258
You can smile now.

29
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,760
-Right.
-You can smile.

30
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,097
See? Braising was the right call.

31
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,267
CHOI KANG-ROK

32
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,814
I can cook what I want to cook,

33
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,484
so it helped me steel my resolve again.

34
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,613
When you advance once,
it makes you want to keep advancing.

35
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,284
-Why is Chef Choi going that way?
-Right?

36
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,829
I bet he feels bashful,
so he went over there.

37
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,830
I think so too.

38
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,131
It's the same as last time.

39
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,384
I'll give it my all
as if today's my last day.

40
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,055
With the survival
of Hidden White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok,

41
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,267
one additional Black Spoon survivor
has been added.

42
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,728
As a result, the number
of possible Black Spoon survivors…

43
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,981
is 19.

44
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,401
That means it'll be 19 versus 19.

45
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,946
The current remaining number
of Black Spoon survivor spots…

46
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,197
is ten.

47
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,579
Is that Japanese cuisine?

48
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,665
-Who?
-He has a whole stand of knives.

49
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,543
He has an entire collection on display.

50
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,715
I came to take down the White Spoons
with my knife skills.

51
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,674
KNIFE OMAKASE

52
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,719
It'll be tough
with just knife work alone.

53
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,315
They say Japanese cuisine
is all about the knife work.

54
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,109
True to my title,

55
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,987
I prepared a mini omakase
highlighted by knife work.

56
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,780
They call rice rolled in seaweed maki.

57
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,868
Usually, a maki is rolled
with dried seaweed.

58
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,995
But instead of seaweed…

59
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,876
I'm going to slice a radish thinly.

60
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,170
Knife Omakase's doing katsuramuki.

61
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,257
KATSURAMUKI
PEELING VEGETABLES INTO A LONG, THIN SHEET

62
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,342
He's good at that.

63
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,053
I slice it thinner than dried seaweed…

64
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,851
I place cucumbers
inside the thinly cut sheet of radish,

65
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,938
and the cucumbers
will gently come apart in your mouth.

66
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,106
CUCUMBER AND PLUM MAKI

67
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,192
Next is somyeon.

68
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,653
They're beautifully coiled thin noodles.

69
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,862
But when you taste it…

70
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,823
It's actually thinly sliced Chinese yam.

71
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,118
It has to be cut extremely thin.

72
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,498
It looks just like somyeon on the outside,

73
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,792
but when you eat it, it's crunchy.

74
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,169
CHINESE YAM SOMYEON

75
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,755
The key to today's dish is my knife work.

76
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,675
The key is tenderness.

77
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,261
He's doing Japanese cuisine too.

78
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,388
-You're right.
-This is bad.

79
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,432
He had a fan behind his back.

80
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,018
That's what I call style.

81
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,648
He's the best
at freshwater eel rice bowls in Korea.

82
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,735
-What's his title? Fan Master?
-No way.

83
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,861
FAN MASTER

84
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,572
I'm Fan Master.

85
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,699
FAN MASTER
TOKYO BABSANG

86
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,327
Look at the fan.

87
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,037
He moves as if he has no bones.

88
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,875
The way he waves the fan
is like he's dancing.

89
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,128
"Why doesn't he…

90
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,839
use his fan this way?"

91
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:03,261
People might think,
"Why does he wave the fan like this?"

92
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,014
Heat varies according to the position
of the charcoal,

93
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,600
so in order to maintain
an even temperature,

94
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,853
I fan it gently from above

95
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,106
and from the side as well.

96
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,401
What is that?

97
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,904
He's steaming them to make them tender.

98
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,365
-He has a steamer for that.
-He has to tenderize them.

99
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,533
Then, he grills them.

100
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:30,246
Eel tastes better
when the fat's been cooked off.

101
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,957
That method is the right way
if you want tenderness.

102
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:39,088
I learned this cooking method in Japan
at a restaurant specializing in eel

103
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,965
called Jubako in Akasaka.

104
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,886
Passed down through eight generations,
it's been around for 250 years.

105
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,055
I just barged right in.

106
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,473
I got down on my knees

107
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,558
and said I came from Korea to learn.

108
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:54,312
And I'm applying
that method I learned right now.

109
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,026
Eel rice bowls require patience.

110
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,696
You need to be patient
in front of the fire.

111
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,075
"How long should it marinate for?"

112
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,036
"When should it be taken out?"

113
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,042
That precise timing
is what can make this dish shine.

114
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,630
I believe if you don't have
a ton of patience,

115
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,257
it's a dish
that cannot rise to perfection.

116
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,721
When eaten with rice,

117
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,390
the textures blend together perfectly.

118
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,143
I'm sure they'll be nodding
after taking a bite.

119
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,562
TOKYO-STYLE EEL RICE BOWL

120
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,274
-How should I eat it?
-Break off a piece with your chopsticks.

121
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,152
-Without any rice?
-I'll serve the rice a bit later.

122
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,664
Yes.

123
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,708
It was steamed until tender,
so it'll break apart easily.

124
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,168
He steamed it, so…

125
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,129
It's tender enough to cut with chopsticks.

126
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,440
There's no way that could taste bad.

127
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,783
Your eel-grilling technique is clearly…

128
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,618
outstanding.

129
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,916
I can hardly pick up that muddy taste
eels usually have.

130
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,877
However,

131
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,546
I think…

132
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,509
it's hard to make a call,
so I'm deferring my decision for now.

133
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,720
Okay.

134
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,763
Thank you.

135
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,765
FAN MASTER DEFERRED

136
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,978
This result

137
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,438
wasn't part of my plan.

138
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,565
He must've been deferred.

139
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,733
It seems so.

140
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:08,029
He nailed the classic flavor
of grilled eel.

141
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,282
And the sauce was great too.
It's a sauce called tare.

142
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,576
But personally, with grilled eel,

143
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,538
I believe it should melt in your mouth
as soon as you take a bite.

144
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,958
There was a subtle difference.

145
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,462
So I called Chef Anh,
who's well-versed in Japanese cuisine.

146
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,682
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

147
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,730
He just left. I thought,
"What? Why didn't he say anything?"

148
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,150
I wondered if this was
the end of the road for me.

149
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,569
IF THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SURVIVORS
BY THE END OF TASTING

150
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,613
SURVIVORS WILL BE CHOSEN
FROM DEFERRED CHEFS

151
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,282
That's the first deferred Japanese dish.

152
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,413
I think he's almost done.

153
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,583
They may look the same on the outside,

154
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,378
but the textures and flavors change

155
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,381
according to the type of knife work I use,

156
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,133
and that's what I wanted
to show the judges.

157
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,346
I'm sure I'll pass
the first round just fine.

158
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,100
FOUR-COURSE KNIFE OMAKASE

159
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,851
This is really…

160
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,689
elegant and very Japanese in style.

161
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,482
Isn't this upside down?

162
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,234
-Yes, you're right.
-Am I? Okay.

163
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,610
You're exactly right.

164
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,946
-I worked with Japanese cuisine too.
-Here you go.

165
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,490
Okay, so how should I eat this?

166
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,993
First, have a taste
of the grilled blackthroat seaperch.

167
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,870
Then, you can taste the palate cleanser.

168
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,038
CUCUMBER AND PLUM MAKI

169
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,500
With some rice.

170
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,211
And angelica-tree shoots.

171
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,724
-Ume, kyuri, shiso.
-That's right.

172
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,808
A daikon maki.

173
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,617
I saw his expression.

174
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,828
I could see he was
really enjoying the dishes.

175
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,293
Lastly, please try the somyeon
with just the cherry blossom.

176
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,979
I think you're really skilled
with a knife.

177
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:47,897
Thank you.

178
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,608
The effort you put in is very apparent

179
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,151
in your knife work.

180
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,069
Thank you.

181
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,072
But why did you tell me
to eat that dish first?

182
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,910
Within the meal I prepared,
this one was the main course.

183
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,079
This was the final course.

184
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,915
And it was seasoned a bit more heavily.

185
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,670
When a chef tells you
to eat something first,

186
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,964
I think that's an important detail,
because they're giving you direction.

187
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,758
-Yes.
-So in that regard,

188
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,053
as the one tasting this,

189
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,515
there was an element
that made me think, "What? Really?"

190
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,516
Right.

191
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,351
On that note, Knife Omakase.

192
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,268
Yes.

193
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,313
-I'm deferring my decision.
-Okay.

194
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,981
-Good job.
-All right.

195
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:36,946
KNIFE OMAKASE DEFERRED

196
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,117
Just the day before,

197
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,619
I changed the order of the dishes.

198
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,538
It had it as my final one as well.

199
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,623
But it was my best dish

200
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,459
and I wanted to start
with an eye-opening course,

201
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,002
so I made it the first one.

202
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,464
He pinpointed that exact change,
so I was really surprised.

203
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,925
Everything else was fine.

204
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,553
He made just a minor lapse in judgment.

205
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,848
-Okay. Should I start with this?
-Yes.

206
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,851
-Blackthroat seaperch.
-That's right.

207
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,310
-It's an oily fish.
-Yes.

208
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,855
You're starting with something oily?

209
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,525
That's kind of what Chef Anh
criticized as well.

210
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,901
-He said the same thing?
-Yes.

211
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,236
I'm sorry I rubbed the salt in.

212
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,291
It should've gone this way.

213
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,462
-Right?
-My last-minute change was a bit…

214
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,796
-This way was right.
-Yes.

215
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,882
He's deferred.

216
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,760
-If it's borderline…
-All the Japanese dishes were deferred.

217
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,596
IF THERE ARE
NOT ENOUGH SURVIVORS BY THE END

218
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,431
SURVIVORS WILL BE CHOSEN
FROM DEFERRED CHEFS

219
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,269
Where was that sound from?

220
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,440
-Wow, hand-pulled!
-Hand-pulled noodles.

221
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,108
-We have to go see this.
-Of course.

222
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,985
HAND-PULLED NOODLE KING

223
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,821
CEO OF ULTIMATE MASTER KIM HYE-KYU'S
ACCLAIMED JJAMPPONG

224
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,032
Hand-pulled noodles
in a competition will be tough.

225
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,034
He's stepping on it?

226
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,202
Is he kneading the dough?

227
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,703
-It's foot-kneaded.
-Foot-kneading?

228
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,123
TWO-STAR RAMYEON
CHEF-OWNER OF KANSEI

229
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,583
There's a lot of noodles.

230
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,959
He's pressing out naengmyeon.

231
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,669
Korea, China, and Japan are all here.

232
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,923
Someone's making fresh pasta too.

233
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,508
That looks like Southeast Asian food.

234
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,968
It's a battle of noodles.

235
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,733
LAOS-HOLIC
CHEF-OWNER OF LAO PIAK

236
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,277
These noodles are almost the same
as khao piak noodles.

237
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,697
But there was a touch more starch in them.

238
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,574
-You're eliminated.
-Okay. Thank you.

239
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,284
It lacks a distinct identity.

240
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,452
-You're eliminated.
-Okay.

241
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,411
You are eliminated.

242
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,412
You're eliminated.

243
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,289
They have to compete with just noodles.

244
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,209
It's so difficult to be creative
with just one thing.

245
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:59,004
Just look at Chef Kim Do-yun.
Their standards are pretty clear.

246
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,681
The noodles are the key.

247
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,600
The noodles have to taste good
for everything else to taste good.

248
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,107
They're soba noodles.

249
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,236
You have to take your time to make them.

250
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,322
If the small lumps
become large too quickly,

251
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,241
it's hard to make the perfect noodles.

252
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,786
I add water to the flour as I go
and knead by hand.

253
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,589
I think he's making
buckwheat noodles by hand.

254
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,923
-Is that buckwheat?
-Yes.

255
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,425
He was milling it earlier.

256
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,969
What's his title?

257
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,929
His title is…

258
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,055
IRON ARMS

259
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,557
-Iron Arms.
-I see.

260
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,976
-Because he's good at this.
-He kneads dough by hand.

261
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,019
Iron Arms.

262
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:02,109
I chose the title "Iron Arms"
with a contradictory meaning in mind.

263
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:08,490
I have a rare, incurable disease
that causes muscle loss in my right hand.

264
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,660
I may have this illness,
but I can still be as firm as iron.

265
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:19,126
I slowly started to notice the symptoms
when I was a junior in high school.

266
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,838
My hand shakes. That's basically a given.

267
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,883
I don't have the muscles
to support my hand,

268
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,636
so my hand shakes when I move my fingers.

269
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,139
It's from my elbow to my hand.

270
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,600
If this spreads throughout the body,
that's ALS.

271
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,935
I came here to show

272
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,938
that despite the condition,
you can still succeed if you keep trying.

273
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,111
-He's making the buckwheat noodles.
-It's soba.

274
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,988
With soba,

275
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,700
it's unlike udon, which needs to rest,
and can be made right away.

276
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,952
That makes it taste better.

277
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,704
When it's fresh, it tastes different
from when time has passed.

278
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,668
How you roll out the dough
is really important.

279
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,962
The thickness has to be even,

280
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,090
and you need to be quick
so the moisture doesn't evaporate.

281
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,105
Gosh, he's good.

282
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,565
He's good. He's no joke.

283
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,068
I'd better not compete with him
in noodle dishes.

284
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,236
He's a dark horse.

285
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,198
He seems serious about noodles.

286
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,910
Noodles are what define me,

287
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,161
so I make them every day.

288
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,832
I mill flour the day of, make the noodles,
and cut them every day.

289
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,473
I don't have the muscles
to support my fingers,

290
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,684
so I don't have full control over my hand.

291
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:02,813
I just…

292
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,857
This is a little embarrassing to say,

293
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,152
but I kept practicing through tears

294
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,653
until I could finally do it.

295
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,991
Talking about this
makes me a little emotional.

296
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,000
I can still move my shoulder,

297
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,544
so using the momentum in my shoulder,

298
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,672
my hand just holds the knife
and keeps it in place.

299
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,967
I just kept practicing
until I was able to do it.

300
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,262
I put in much more effort
than other people,

301
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,017
just so I could do what they did,
like everyone else.

302
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,780
I just really wanted to cook.

303
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,199
I loved cooking, so I kept going.

304
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,796
I milled the buckwheat coarsely
to make the noodles have

305
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,674
a rough texture and rich aroma
that is enjoyable.

306
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,011
It's one type of noodle
that can be enjoyed three different ways.

307
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,763
BUCKWHEAT NOODLES AND CHICKEN BROTH TSUYU

308
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,681
In front, you have fresh wasabi.

309
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,558
There's Maldon salt in the small dish.

310
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,644
In the cup, I prepared white sesame oil

311
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,146
-seasoned with salted kelp.
-Okay.

312
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,607
This one is tsuyu made with chicken broth.

313
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,567
-You dip the noodles in it.
-I see.

314
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,072
First…

315
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,260
-Next, I take this.
-Please mix them with the oil.

316
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,730
-Just lightly in the tsuyu?
-Yes, maybe just half of it.

317
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,793
Where did you learn to cook?

318
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,798
I never learned how to make soba.
I taught myself.

319
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,427
Well, in my view,

320
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,054
you have a clear idea of the kind
of soba you want to make.

321
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,515
They're somewhat coarse and rough noodles.

322
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,602
Personally,

323
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,230
I think you're an amazing cook.

324
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,066
-Thank you.
-Because of the seasoning and balance,

325
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,110
whenever I dip them in something
and taste them,

326
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,613
it makes me look forward to the next one.

327
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,114
I want to try the next one,

328
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,575
and I get excited about how it'll taste.

329
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,243
And when I tried the tsuyu,

330
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,456
it felt complete,
as if I did a full circle.

331
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,833
Iron Arms, you've survived.

332
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,711
-Thank you.
-Congratulations. It was delicious.

333
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,047
Iron Arms has survived.

334
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,512
IRON ARMS SURVIVES

335
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,058
I feel proud of myself.

336
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:30,520
For all this time,
I do feel I've worked really hard.

337
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,605
IRON ARMS

338
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,814
So I was really happy.

339
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,359
He's not done yet, right?
The Yongnidan-gil guy?

340
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,569
-No, not yet.
-Who's the Yongnidan-gil guy?

341
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,155
Over there.

342
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,533
-Where?
-There. The pink apron.

343
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,455
TRENDSETTER
CHEF-OWNER OF SAM SAM SAM

344
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,457
What is he laying out?

345
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,129
What is that?

346
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,841
-What's he making?
-What?

347
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,885
-What is he making?
-I don't know.

348
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,472
It's the dish I'm most confident in,
so I chose it.

349
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,350
Statistically speaking, in Korea,

350
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,520
I think our restaurant has sold
more of this than any other place.

351
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,314
The restaurant with the longest line
in Yongnidan-gil.

352
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,650
His nickname is "The Son of Sinyongsan."

353
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,527
So I thought, "How about I make this?"

354
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,117
The dish I'll be making today

355
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,536
is lasagna.

356
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,914
-Who makes lasagna like this?
-Right, it's usually in layers.

357
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,082
-But today…
-Béchamel sauce?

358
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,085
-Yes, béchamel and ragù.
-Ragù. But why do it like this?

359
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:39,131
Lasagna is technically a type of pasta,
but it's similar to a pie.

360
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,258
So you put together various ingredients

361
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,968
and layer it like a pie.

362
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,263
But I came up with
a bit of a different and new idea.

363
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,433
I rolled it up to make a lasagna roll.

364
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,771
The noodle's texture
comes out crispier this way.

365
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,189
I thought this would be better.

366
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,442
-You thought outside the box.
-Right.

367
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,901
-It's better.
-It's not bad.

368
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,945
-Right.
-That's very clever.

369
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,491
This is interesting.
Lasagna made into a roll.

370
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,702
It's a variation of lasagna.

371
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,829
It's lasagna but shaped into a roll.

372
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,374
You get that crisp texture
Korean people like.

373
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,545
The judges said
the judging criterion was taste.

374
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,964
It's delicious. It really is.

375
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,635
SHRIMP LASAGNA ROLLS

376
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,972
There's the ragù sauce…

377
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,224
-And tomato sauce…
-And the béchamel too.

378
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,268
-I have everything, right?
-Yes, that's right.

379
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,947
It must be good. He raised his eyebrows.

380
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,628
It's unique.

381
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,340
Reimagining lasagna like this

382
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,258
makes it seem like a different dish

383
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,427
but also like a lasagna at the same time.

384
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,097
I'm torn.

385
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,059
Trendsetter, for now,

386
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,561
-I'm deferring my decision.
-Okay, thank you.

387
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,564
TRENDSETTER DEFERRED

388
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,734
The things we felt needed improvement
were nicely addressed,

389
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,694
but the taste itself…

390
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,124
The tastiest part of a lasagna

391
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,710
-are the slightly browned edges.
-Yes, that's right.

392
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:45,507
You considered things like that
and made this into a roll.

393
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,218
I get what you were going for.

394
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,302
Thank you.

395
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,974
-Great job.
-Thank you.

396
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,227
It's up to fate now.

397
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,065
LOBSTER WITH KIMCHI BISQUE

398
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,490
ANNYEONG BONJOUR
CHEF-OWNER OF CHEZ NOUS PRIVATE KITCHEN

399
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,701
KIMCHI

400
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,578
I'm from France.

401
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,330
I was adopted when I was six years old.

402
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,293
KIMCHI BISQUE SAUCE

403
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,974
-You've survived.
-Thank you.

404
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,726
-Merci beaucoup.
-Congratulations.

405
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,439
That lobster looks really fresh.

406
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,567
They'll be fooled into thinking
it's a real lobster shell.

407
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,445
I'll make a tuile
shaped like a lobster shell.

408
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,571
She drew a lobster.

409
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,989
TUILE
A THIN, CRISP FRENCH WAFER

410
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,074
She's basically making art.

411
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,828
Then, I fry it by pouring hot oil over it.

412
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,789
LOBSTER MEAT SALAD

413
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,083
I top it with the shell-shaped cover,

414
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,003
so you'll know right away
that it's a lobster dish.

415
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,340
This is a fun idea!

416
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,883
I felt everything you intended.

417
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:10,842
You've survived.

418
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,844
PERFECT MATCH SURVIVES

419
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,429
Survived.

420
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:15,889
BOSS IN THE KITCHEN

421
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,059
-Boss in the Kitchen!
-Boss in the Kitchen!

422
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,143
He wore white on purpose.

423
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,145
He's basically saying,
"Why am I a Black Spoon?"

424
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,148
The White Spoon chefs know
what I'm capable of.

425
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,734
I prepared spring vegetable
and shrimp porridge.

426
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,946
I didn't use
any flavor enhancers or additives.

427
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,992
The chef's intent to omit flavor enhancers
and the finish on the palate…

428
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,661
Boss in the Kitchen, you've survived.

429
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,372
BOSS IN THE KITCHEN SURVIVED

430
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,040
Survived.

431
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,708
There are six spots left.

432
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,835
SASHIMI SWORDSMAN
EXECUTIVE CHEF OF MIGAKI

433
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,297
It's really in the shape of a crane.
It's just beautifully presented sashimi.

434
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,298
You're eliminated.

435
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,552
-So I just pick it up and eat it?
-Yes, you can try any piece.

436
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,721
CHICKEN FEET TYCOON
CEO OF SAMMI BUNSIK

437
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,431
They've all been cut.

438
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,111
Chicken Feet Tycoon,

439
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,530
it doesn't really have
a unique flavor that wins me over.

440
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,864
-You're eliminated.
-Thank you.

441
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,908
It's called a pocket katsu.

442
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,368
-Mangwon Market Hero.
-Yes?

443
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,078
Deferred. I need to think about it.

444
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,664
It's a cartoccio inspired by flounder
and mugwort soup.

445
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,624
The mugwort is very tough.

446
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,876
That single bite I take
is your only opportunity.

447
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,794
You're eliminated.

448
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,546
-I'm going to defer.
-You're eliminated.

449
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,588
You're eliminated.

450
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,799
Who on earth will pass then?

451
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,468
They're all ingredients
you can easily find at home.

452
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,138
If you add a bit of a kick and some love,

453
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,432
you can make Korean cuisine
that's even more special.

454
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,893
I prepared a set of familiar
yet fresh Korean dishes.

455
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,687
GRILLED DRIED POLLOCK WITH GLUTINOUS RICE

456
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,652
The side dishes you create
are truly special.

457
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,237
-You've survived.
-Thank you.

458
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,530
-Wow.
-He made it?

459
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:59,451
The Black Spoon Elimination Round
is now complete.

460
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,913
With the survival
of one Hidden White Spoon chef,

461
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,498
the number of remaining seats…

462
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,250
is five.

463
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,210
5 SURVIVOR SEATS REMAIN

464
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,381
Now, it's time to announce
the additional survivors.

465
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,803
The first survivor is…

466
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,683
Knife Omakase.

467
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,935
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

468
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,106
To be honest, I knew I'd make it.

469
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,235
The second survivor is…

470
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,904
Rebellious Genius.

471
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,947
Congratulations.

472
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,494
I'd like to try and defeat Chef Lee Jun.

473
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,329
I hope you won't see me

474
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,039
as too rebellious.

475
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,207
Fan Master.

476
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,666
Thank you.

477
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,627
FAN MASTER SURVIVES

478
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,045
I'll give it my all.

479
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,505
Trendsetter.

480
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,257
TRENDSETTER SURVIVES

481
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,509
Thank you.

482
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,594
This is crazy.

483
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:05,433
Lastly, the additional
Black Spoon survivor is…

484
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,060
Three Star Killer.

485
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,356
THREE STAR KILLER SURVIVES

486
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,440
Yeah!

487
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,985
The 19 finalists have been selected

488
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,530
from the Black Spoon Elimination Round.

489
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,032
-Congratulations, everyone!
-Congratulations!

490
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,410
-Great job, everyone!
-Good job!

491
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,120
I thought, "This is doable."

492
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,663
I'm just going to go for it.

493
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:32,669
THE 19 SURVIVORS
OF THE BLACK SPOON ELIMINATION ROUND

494
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,671
If I lose, I'm out.

495
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,802
They don't have a chance against me.
I'll show them how it's done.

496
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:46,808
THE 19 WHITE SPOONS

497
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,722
The Black Spoon chefs
changed into their black uniforms.

498
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,476
It was a little scary.

499
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,854
I was a bit confused.

500
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,232
There was nothing in that empty room.

501
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,693
I thought we'd see refrigerators.

502
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,322
I wondered where the fridges were.
They were nowhere to be found.

503
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,243
The survivor of the first round,

504
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,621
Hidden White Spoon Chef Choi Kang-rok,

505
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,832
and the 19 survivors

506
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,084
of the Black Spoon Elimination Round,

507
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,921
you have proven your skills

508
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,258
and earned the right to participate
in the second round.

509
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,011
And now,

510
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:09,641
it's time to reveal the second round
of Culinary Class Wars.

511
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,602
This round…

512
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,024
is a one-on-one
Black Spoon versus White Spoon Face-off.

513
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,902
The moment has arrived.

514
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,987
It's my turn now.

515
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,199
Who will I face?

516
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,201
What ingredient will I get?

517
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,538
It took me right back.
The one-on-one battle.

518
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,209
And now, we will reveal

519
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:40,630
the theme of the Black Spoon
versus White Spoon Face-off.

520
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,383
The theme is…

521
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,096
right in front of your eyes.

522
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,391
Where?

523
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,935
What is it?

524
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,145
Is it going to come down?

525
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,358
-What's going on?
-What?

526
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,609
What is it?

527
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,444
What's that?

528
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,199
-What's going on?
-What's that?

529
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,287
-What's going on?
-What's that?

530
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,058
Oh, my gosh!

531
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,031
This is intense.

532
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,785
That's crazy.

533
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,876
-This is very meaningful.
-That's so cool.

534
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,252
My goodness.

535
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,378
The fridges were upgraded

536
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,923
-to stylish display cases.
-They weren't fridges this time.

537
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,925
This battle

538
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,219
is a one-on-one Black Spoon
versus White Spoon Face-off

539
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,014
using Korea's signature ingredients.

540
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,474
This is great. I love it.

541
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,477
In front of you,

542
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,771
there are 20

543
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,900
of the finest ingredients
from across the country.

544
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,153
When two chefs of a matchup

545
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,530
choose a region,

546
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,952
the signature ingredient
of that region will be revealed.

547
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:38,331
Using the main ingredient
from your chosen region,

548
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:44,796
you must create your best dish
to surpass your opponent.

549
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,757
It looks like this round
is all about the ingredients.

550
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,384
I thought it would be fun.

551
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,971
When you look at a region, you can
kind of guess what the ingredient will be.

552
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,807
I realized I could reflect
the local culture as well.

553
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,308
I got excited the moment I saw it.

554
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,644
Now, it is time

555
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:03,022
to begin selecting the matchups

556
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,150
for the one-on-one Black Spoon
versus White Spoon Face-off.

557
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,444
FACE-OFF OPPONENT MATCHUPS

558
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,197
White Spoon Chef Son Jong-won,

559
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,324
please step forward.

560
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:15,868
You can do it!

561
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:22,250
Chef Son Jong-won
is an incredibly renowned chef.

562
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:27,922
Currently, he has a Michelin star
in both Korean and Western cuisine.

563
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,216
He's the only one with that distinction.

564
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,845
I know he's exceptionally skilled
at making casual food too.

565
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,057
If any Black Spoon wishes to challenge
White Spoon Chef Son Jong-won,

566
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,976
please step forward.

567
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,246
Impressive!

568
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,665
Why did so many come out? Do I seem weak?

569
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,627
He's a tough opponent,
and that's why I want to face him.

570
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,672
The foundation of my cooking
is in fine dining too.

571
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,675
So I might be able to beat him.

572
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,177
THREE STAR KILLER

573
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,055
I wanted to take down
a Michelin-starred chef.

574
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,141
KNIFE OMAKASE

575
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,519
I'm a huge fan of Chef Son Jong-won.

576
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,979
LONER IN A HOLE-IN-THE-WALL

577
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,106
White Spoon Chef Son Jong-won,

578
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,443
please choose the Black Spoon chef
you wish to compete against.

579
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,447
IF MULTIPLE BLACK SPOONS STEP FORWARD,
THE WHITE SPOON CHOOSES

580
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,240
He must've decided right away.

581
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,410
Three Star Killer.

582
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,375
I've also worked at three restaurants
with three Michelin stars.

583
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:50,713
The three-star restaurants where I worked
didn't turn me into a three-star chef.

584
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,508
I had to earn my own stars.

585
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,219
That's pretty cool!

586
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,013
Do you think you can stop me?

587
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,640
I will try.

588
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,852
White Spoon Chef Son Jong-won

589
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,313
and Black Spoon Chef Three Star Killer,

590
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,483
you've been matched for the Black Spoon
versus White Spoon Face-off.

591
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,363
SON JONG-WON VS THREE STAR KILLER

592
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,741
THE BLACK SPOON CHEFS
WHO WERE NOT CHOSEN

593
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,035
CAN ENTER AGAIN
TO JOIN ANOTHER MATCHUP

594
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,038
Now, with your face-off opponent,

595
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,290
please select a region.

596
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,460
THE TWO MATCHED OPPONENTS
WILL PICK A REGION OF THEIR CHOICE

597
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,628
That's nice.

598
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,716
Jindo Island, Jeju Island,
Changwon, Yeosu.

599
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,887
The coastal regions
will probably have a lot of seafood.

600
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,265
I had my guesses,

601
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,684
but would they prove our guesses correct

602
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:50,398
or would they bring out ingredients
we've never used before?

603
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,359
Even if we choose a region,
we don't know what we'll end up with.

604
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,451
Gosh, how do you choose?

605
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,372
What a conundrum.

606
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,666
Where should we go?

607
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,544
Somewhere close might be better.

608
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,089
-Where will they go?
-Mungyeong?

609
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,508
Maybe around here?

610
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,012
-Wonju?
-Wonju?

611
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,638
-Wonju?
-What's in Wonju?

612
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,473
-Wonju?
-Wonju?

613
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,019
Something made me think Wonju
would be more interesting.

614
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,229
He wanted to pick Wonju.

615
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,399
So I thought, "Well, why not?"

616
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,027
Where is it? Wonju?
What do they have in Wonju?

617
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,322
Vegetables? What could it be?

618
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,490
I'm curious.

619
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,458
That's so cool.

620
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,129
Here it comes.

621
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:59,050
The main ingredient from Wonju
will now be revealed.

622
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,968
REVEALING WONJU'S INGREDIENT

623
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,595
Your main ingredient is…

624
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,681
-What is it?
-What is it?

625
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,974
Is it meat? What is it?

626
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,145
Wonju beef tongue.

627
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:16,692
Beef tongue!

628
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,279
That's amazing. It's beef tongue.

629
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,572
Beef tongue.

630
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,949
Beef tongue.

631
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,705
I've never used it before.

632
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,249
What do I do?

633
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,543
Beef tongue.

634
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,754
They're both in fine dining,
so this should be fun.

635
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,714
It's a tough one to use.

636
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:43,552
White Spoon Chef Venerable Sunjae,
please step forward.

637
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,055
VENERABLE SUNJAE
KOREA'S FIRST MASTER OF TEMPLE CUISINE

638
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,348
I'd rather not face her.

639
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,353
White Spoon Chef Hou Deok-juk,
please step forward.

640
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,731
HOU DEOK-JUK
EXECUTIVE CHEF OF HAOBIN

641
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,901
Chef Lee Jun, please step forward.

642
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,196
LEE JUN
CHEF-OWNER OF SOIGNÉ

643
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,323
I doubt anyone will go out.

644
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,952
If any Black Spoon wishes to challenge,
please step forward.

645
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,132
This is incredible.

646
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,509
I'll give you a taste of hell.

647
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,219
I'll send you home quickly.

648
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,013
If you lose, you're out.

649
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,807
Gosh, this is so scary.

650
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,394
Now, please select a region.

651
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,813
Your main ingredient is…

652
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,398
Your main ingredient is…

653
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,317
Paju cheonggukjang.

654
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,235
Cheonggukjang!

655
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,070
Pohang monkfish.

656
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,030
Monkfish!

657
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,615
Your main ingredient is…

658
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,950
What is it?

659
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,703
Changwon ***.

660
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,958
That's crazy.

661
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,752
-Oh, my god.
-That's tough.

662
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,211
I think it will be fun.

663
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,714
All matchups have been set

664
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,508
for the one-on-one
Black Spoon versus White Spoon Face-off.

665
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,264
Black Spoon versus White Spoon.

666
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,725
White Spoon versus Black Spoon.

667
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,353
Welcome to the kitchen

668
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,563
where your first culinary class battle
will begin.

669
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,067
This round

670
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,445
is a one-on-one Black Spoon
versus White Spoon Face-off.

671
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,865
In this Black Spoon
versus White Spoon Face-off,

672
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,368
the number of survivors on each side

673
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,330
will have an effect on the next round.

674
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,003
In this one-on-one Black Spoon
versus White Spoon Face-off,

675
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:45,591
the judges will do
a blind taste test of your dishes.

676
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,553
The judges will be blindfolded

677
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,015
and judge your dishes
purely based on the taste.

678
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,193
We can be judged solely on taste
to decide the best dish.

679
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,738
I figured they would have analyzed
Season 1 before coming here,

680
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,241
so I should prepare myself accordingly.

681
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,450
More critically.

682
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,619
More meticulously.

683
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,539
ONE-ON-ONE BLACK SPOON
VERSUS WHITE SPOON FACE-OFF

684
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:29,093
With 57 years under my belt,
I have that experience and composure.

685
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,095
I don't ever get nervous.

686
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,473
We'll show you what Black Spoons can do.

687
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,393
We're not Black Spoons for nothing.
We came back from the dead.

688
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,938
And with this,

689
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:45,317
the one-on-one Black Spoon
versus White Spoon Face-off begins now.

690
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,988
-Let's send them packing!
-Let's go!

691
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,239
Let's go!

692
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,116
Go, Black Spoons!

693
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,830
Chef Son Jong-won
looks completely at ease.

694
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,249
-I wonder what Chef Son will make.
-Yes.

695
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,878
He has a Michelin star
at two separate restaurants.

696
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:04,920
Eatanic Garden.

697
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,464
And L'Amant.

698
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,091
He's famous for being
a multi-starred chef.

699
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,139
I started a restaurant
called L'Amant Secret.

700
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,058
It has one Michelin star,

701
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,352
and we've maintained it
for five years now.

702
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,483
Eatanic Garden has also maintained
one star for three years now.

703
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,320
I'm the first and only chef
in Korea to have

704
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,905
two restaurants with Michelin-stars.

705
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,074
And recently, he made it
onto "Asia's 50 Best Restaurants"

706
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,494
and immediately entered the list at 25.

707
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,372
Every year, they pick
the 50 best restaurants in Asia.

708
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:44,919
The Highest New Entry Award
is given to the restaurant

709
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,879
that makes the highest debut on the list.

710
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,172
Eatanic Garden won that award.

711
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,092
I think Chef Son will go all out.

712
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,553
He uses a lot of different techniques.

713
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,972
I want to see Chef Son's cooking up close.

714
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,684
I think a candidate to win it all
is Chef Son Jong-won.

715
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,979
Hello, I'm Chef Son Jong-won.

716
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,357
I think it'll be a lot of pressure.

717
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,234
-He's up against Chef Son.
-Yeah, definitely.

718
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,154
I really think he's going to draw
the most attention.

719
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,699
Who is he? His opponent.

720
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:17,868
Three Star Killer.

721
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,412
-He's talented too.
-I think he'll do well.

722
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,542
He's really good
at traditional French cuisine.

723
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,629
He's also followed an elite career path.

724
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,841
He might beat a three-star chef.

725
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,760
His knife work is…

726
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,429
-He's good.
-He's skilled.

727
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,848
His risotto made me think

728
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,725
chefs who have worked at the best places

729
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,644
really do know their stuff.

730
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,105
He's only worked in fine dining.

731
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,943
Since I'm here to compete,
I wanted to face a strong opponent.

732
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,614
I'm the type who matches strength
with strength and softness with softness.

733
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,283
I want this to be a good fight.

734
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,620
At the end of the day,
it's about survival. I can't lose.

735
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:06,667
THREE STAR KILLER - SON JONG-WON

736
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,335
What does the Black Spoon chef have?

737
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:09,753
What?

738
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,174
-Beef tongue.
-Right, beef tongue.

739
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,259
It's big.

740
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,178
I think out of all the ingredients,
beef tongue is the hardest.

741
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,639
He might not be very familiar with it.

742
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,311
I mean, there's also ribeye.

743
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,856
Out of all the cuts to choose from,
why beef tongue?

744
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,858
It's not really a common ingredient.

745
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,236
People don't just go,
"I'm craving beef tongue."

746
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,405
It's not an ingredient you see every day.

747
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,074
It's not one we eat commonly either.

748
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,785
I was completely stumped.

749
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,873
I had to prep the ingredient,
so I went ahead with it.

750
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,133
But when I cut it up,

751
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,512
the marbling was gorgeous.

752
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,266
I thought it might taste great
even just as a steak.

753
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:09,438
It's just one piece of beef tongue
cooked perfectly over charcoal.

754
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,236
I thought that was the best option.

755
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,656
With beef tongue,

756
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,992
just peeling off the skin, slicing it,
and grilling it is delicious too.

757
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,370
-That's the best way to eat it.
-Yes, like yakiniku.

758
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,207
I've grilled meat
over charcoal quite a lot.

759
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,418
I've probably grilled
tens of thousands of portions.

760
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:36,465
You need to grill the meat evenly
without overcooking any one part.

761
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,138
It tastes best when the fat
has rendered down a bit.

762
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,810
That's between medium and medium well.

763
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,980
Cooking to that level of doneness
renders the fat

764
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,442
to bring out the flavor
and give it the right texture.

765
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,196
Three Star Killer is really focused.

766
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,239
That's pretty cool.

767
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,782
-That tray is so cute.
-Yeah.

768
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,744
He must be making steak.

769
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,455
What's Chef Son doing?
He has charcoal too.

770
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,625
Charcoal versus charcoal.

771
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,585
They're both quite similar.

772
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,260
I figured we might both use charcoal.

773
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,929
Because of that smoky flavor,

774
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:27,599
I believe grilling over charcoal
has a clear advantage.

775
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,645
Where is his beef tongue?

776
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,314
-I don't see it.
-Me neither.

777
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,444
I can't really see it.

778
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,247
I wasn't looking and was like this,

779
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,332
but I could hear
the pressure cooker working.

780
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,173
"He lit charcoal."

781
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,466
"But why the pressure cooker?"

782
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,012
When I first saw the beef tongue,

783
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,097
I had it figured out
within two to three minutes.

784
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,392
I thought I'd cook it
in a pressure cooker.

785
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,979
Then, I'd grill it over charcoal.
That plan was in my head from the start.

786
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,273
I think Jong-won will do a braise.

787
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,776
So, I'll be using a lot of meat.

788
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,698
I cook some Korean beef.

789
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,122
I add onion, carrot, and celery to that.

790
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,795
Then, I let it cook
until they become tender.

791
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,800
That forms a broth,
which becomes the base.

792
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,429
As for the beef tongue…

793
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,476
He's tying it with string.

794
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,229
He's using fire

795
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,439
and tying it with string.

796
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,567
It feels like he's going classic French.

797
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,153
I don't think
he'll do anything predictable.

798
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,534
I add beef tongue to the stock

799
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,119
and then cook it
in the pressure cooker for 40 minutes.

800
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,998
Is he adding beef tongue
to the sauce then?

801
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,875
He's reducing it in there.

802
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,378
-In the pressure cooker?
-Yeah.

803
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,546
BRAISE

804
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,881
SLOW-COOKING MEAT OR VEGETABLES
IN LIQUID AT LOW HEAT

805
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,300
It's a sauce full of flavor.

806
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,598
After I take out the beef tongue…

807
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,769
The beef tongue's out. It looks delicious.

808
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,187
Chef Son.

809
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,606
-That looks delicious.
-It looks really tender.

810
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,485
I'm going to grill it over charcoal.

811
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,281
The surface will pick up a smoky flavor,

812
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,658
and the Maillard reaction
will give it some texture.

813
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,704
It'll be tender on the inside
from braising in the pressure cooker.

814
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,372
And after grilling it over charcoal,

815
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,000
the outside will have a pleasant crust.

816
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,170
I think they both prepared
something lavish,

817
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,965
but Three Star Killer
only grilled it over charcoal.

818
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,217
Maybe he wants to take him head-on.

819
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,094
He's grilling over charcoal

820
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,138
and cooking a tasty sauce.

821
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,889
Did you see what the sauce was?

822
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,518
The highlight of today's dish
is the sauce.

823
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,564
Honestly, the real key is the sauce.

824
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,775
Beef tongue is a cut that's very fatty.

825
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,320
It's hard to eat more than three pieces.
It's so rich.

826
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,698
To counter that fatty taste,

827
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,909
I thought about the sauce
that would work best.

828
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,710
SICHUAN PEPPER

829
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:56,600
I prepared a Sichuan pepper sauce
with Chinese-inspired flavors.

830
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,020
Intuitively, the best-tasting thing is…

831
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,064
-It's Chinese cuisine.
-Yeah, I really think so.

832
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,983
I'm going to make a sauce.

833
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,739
Is Jong-won using truffles?

834
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,783
He's chopping up truffles?

835
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,701
I thought about that too.

836
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,495
-About what?
-The double knives.

837
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,413
-Double knives?
-Yeah.

838
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,334
He's using his best move.

839
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:27,756
Black truffles pair really well
with rich, fatty dishes.

840
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,843
I'll strain that stock
I braised the beef tongue in…

841
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,056
Then, I'll add the minced truffle to it.

842
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,850
He chopped it all up earlier.

843
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,814
I'll reduce it using the classic method.

844
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,901
I put a lot of care and effort into it.

845
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,197
Lastly, I'll take the beef tongue

846
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,283
and baste it continuously
with the reduced stock…

847
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,663
so the flavor builds as it cooks.

848
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,334
Chef Son Jong-won has a lot going on.

849
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,461
Yeah, he has a lot of steps.

850
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,345
It's simple versus complicated.

851
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,598
-Totally.
-Simple versus complicated.

852
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,353
That looks really good.

853
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,485
Since mine is a Sichuan pepper sauce,

854
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,739
I thought of having it tasted first

855
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,075
would be more beneficial,

856
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,538
so I finished a bit earlier than Chef Son.

857
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,624
-He's done.
-Nice!

858
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,418
Well done!

859
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,171
Oh, my gosh!

860
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,631
Don't lose your focus.

861
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,425
Go, Son Jong-won!

862
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,099
Thirteen.

863
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,518
Quickly.

864
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,437
Ten seconds!

865
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,230
Ten seconds!

866
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:14,321
Seven, six, five, four,

867
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,907
three, two…

868
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,043
Great job!

869
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,929
Did he do that on purpose?

870
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,807
Great job, chef.

871
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,603
Did it turn out well?

872
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,688
I think it turned out as I intended.

873
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,148
Very elegant.

874
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,486
Did it go okay?

875
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,571
-Did it go okay?
-Yes.

876
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,366
I can't take it. Please lend me a fan.

877
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,784
I'm too hot.

878
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,163
-Nervous?
-I'm the one getting nervous.

879
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:07,916
This is just…

880
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,919
-It's a rare chance to feel such nerves.
-Exactly.

881
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,212
Since we're split into teams,

882
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,172
I can't help but root
for the White Spoons.

883
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,508
The battle of Wonju Korean beef tongue.

884
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,260
Please proceed to the table.

885
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,185
Go, Black Spoon!

886
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,229
Good luck, Three Star Killer!

887
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,147
They must be nervous.

888
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:33,984
Look at Chef Son's expression.

889
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,027
I've never seen him like that.

890
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,574
-They just go in like that?
-Yes.

891
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,536
-How did you feel back then?
-Very nervous.

892
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,621
-So you wheel that inside?
-Yes.

893
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,623
They'll be so nervous.

894
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,814
Just as I'd seen on screen,

895
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,858
they were blindfolded
with their arms folded.

896
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,819
I was so nervous
and didn't know how to act.

897
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,906
It felt so strange.

898
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,911
Since they're blindfolded,

899
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,081
it could tip the scales in my favor.

900
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,169
This one-on-one Black Spoon
versus White Spoon Face-off

901
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,463
is the battle of Wonju Korean beef tongue.

902
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:41,468
Now, please taste the first dish.

903
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,603
Since the highlight is the sauce,

904
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:54,356
the balance of the sauce
is the most important factor.

905
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,902
Taste has a beginning, middle,
and end too.

906
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,323
First, you get the flavor of the sauce.
Then, the crispy texture.

907
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,324
FRIED GINGER

908
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,327
Lastly, the flavor of the meat.
That's how it goes.

909
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,621
WONJU KOREAN BEEF TONGUE STEAK
WITH SICHUAN PEPPER SAUCE

910
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,624
The way the sauce goes along
with the main ingredient

911
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,001
is the key to this dish.

912
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,338
I could tell right away
that it was cooked perfectly.

913
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,424
So, I was a bit nervous.

914
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,719
It has a sharp aroma.

915
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:26,930
-This much?
-Yes.

916
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,866
It's an interesting sauce.

917
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,576
It's unique.

918
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,954
It has a bold flavor.

919
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,708
It's somewhat…

920
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:58,169
inspired by Chinese cuisine.

921
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,507
But as you chew, it's really…

922
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,468
It has all the ingredients
of a Sichuan sauce,

923
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,179
but some of them
seem to have been used differently.

924
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:09,806
But…

925
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,766
it's been cooked well.

926
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,436
The rich, fatty flavor is…

927
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,063
subdued by the sauce.

928
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,361
Next, please taste the second dish.

929
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,282
I prepared Wonju Korean beef tongue

930
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:30,994
with Dubaek potatoes and black truffles.

931
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,913
To present the simplicity
of the beef tongue elegantly,

932
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:38,126
I paired it with black truffles
and delicious Dubaek potatoes from Wonju.

933
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:41,337
I kept tasting it myself to figure out
what would be the best spoonful.

934
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,258
I even brought the spoon, fork,
and knife to serve with.

935
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:48,303
I wanted to recreate
the exact way I had eaten it.

936
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:57,896
The plating itself resembled Chef Son.

937
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,190
Like a young nobleman.

938
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:06,780
But I thought his dish
might taste a bit heavy,

939
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,407
because he braised a fatty ingredient
and did a lot with it.

940
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,511
I just want them to smile.

941
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,972
Eating something good makes you smile.
That's what I really want to see.

942
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,904
A classic sauce.

943
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,365
The beef tongue's…

944
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,450
texture is very…

945
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:00,750
It disappeared.

946
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,256
The two cooking methods
were completely different.

947
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,425
The cooking styles and the cuisines
are both different.

948
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,763
The voting will now begin.

949
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,433
Please select the dish

950
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:21,104
that is more delicious
and better utilized the main ingredient.

951
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,689
THREE STAR KILLER - SON JONG-WON

952
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,824
The voting is complete.

953
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:34,951
The result is…

954
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,372
two to zero.

955
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,630
Gosh, hello. Thank you for the dishes.

956
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,179
They were completely different.

957
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,390
One is tender,
and the other has texture.

958
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,435
Very different styles.

959
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,273
I was really torn.

960
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,067
Chef Son Jong-won's beef tongue

961
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,819
was cooked tender.

962
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,906
And Three Star Killer's beef tongue

963
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,825
was cooked to around medium.

964
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,995
It was beautifully cooked
and the doneness was almost perfect.

965
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,163
They were both delicious.

966
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:25,502
But how well the sauce, the balance,
the flavors, and everything

967
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,713
came alive in my mouth
is what made the difference.

968
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:35,428
Now, it's time to announce the results
of the Wonju Korean beef tongue battle.

969
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,473
The survivor
of this one-on-one face-off is…

970
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,438
White Spoon Chef Son Jong-won.

971
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:50,151
SON JONG-WON SURVIVES

972
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,697
-Black Spoon.
-White Spoon Chef Son Jong-won.

973
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,492
-Oh, my goodness. So harsh.
-Oh, no.

974
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,285
Two to zero.

975
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,578
-Of course.
-Yes.

976
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,830
That's Chef Son Jong-won for you.

977
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,833
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

978
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,296
Three Star Killer's doneness of the meat.

979
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,215
It was so good it made me think,

980
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,467
"I won't find
better cooked beef tongue elsewhere."

981
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,929
But Chef Son Jong-won's beef tongue
was a little more…

982
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,306
impactful in my opinion.

983
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,225
His dish was just too strong.

984
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,856
He was a tough opponent,

985
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,776
and I couldn't argue with the result.

986
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,236
You did great.

987
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,364
But I was still pleased.

988
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,825
Chef Anh Sung-jae said he wouldn't find

989
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,536
better cooked beef tongue
elsewhere in Korea.

990
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,165
The fact that I received such praise…

991
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,502
made me really happy.

992
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,379
THREE STAR KILLER

993
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:58,011
I wonder how she feels.
Do you think it's the same as us?

994
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:02,765
-She's spent decades training.
-She's trained her mind.

995
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,268
Venerable Sunjae.

996
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,104
VENERABLE SUNJAE
KOREA'S FIRST MASTER OF TEMPLE CUISINE

997
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,232
I'm dying to know what she'll make.

998
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:15,695
-She's the first master of temple food.
-Yes, that's right.

999
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,405
-But…
-Temple cuisine.

1000
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,240
Not temple food.

1001
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,956
Since I became a monk in 1980,

1002
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,584
I've eaten and cooked temple cuisine.

1003
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,587
I was designated
the First Master of Temple Cuisine

1004
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:37,175
and also served as the chairperson
of the Korean Food Promotion Institute.

1005
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:42,180
Cooking is part of the training for us.
It's also an act of compassion.

1006
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:48,603
I am a monk but I also teach cooking,
as I consider it part of my training.

1007
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,606
We've welcomed many famous chefs too.

1008
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,441
Chef Oh Se-deuk visited.

1009
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,861
Chef Son Jong-won visited too.
I've met many chefs.

1010
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:59,906
Buddhism sees food as medicine.

1011
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,825
I make food that becomes medicine,

1012
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:07,830
so temple cuisine follows nature's ways
to produce natural flavors

1013
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,625
and flavors that capture
the vitality of nature.

1014
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:15,588
I want to share the knowledge of food
that I've built over my 70 years.

1015
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,049
I prayed on my way here.

1016
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:22,679
For anyone who wishes to join me
in sharing Korean food,

1017
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,597
I welcome you all.

1018
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,435
I'm sure Venerable Sunjae will make

1019
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,355
delicious and beautiful dishes
that would be unmatched.

1020
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,900
So who would want to go up against her?

1021
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:41,572
When I thought about who could possibly
compete against Venerable Sunjae,

1022
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,659
he was the only person I could think of.

1023
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,332
-Dweji-Gomtang in NY!
-Gosh, he uses meat.

1024
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,042
DWEJI-GOMTANG IN NY

1025
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:57,004
Hello, I'm someone who cooks pork.

1026
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,841
He makes dweji-gomtang now,

1027
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:02,844
but that's not the extent
of his cooking spectrum.

1028
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:07,181
He knows a lot about Korean cuisine.
It's not a shock to see him come forward.

1029
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:10,852
I thought I would be greatly enlightened.

1030
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,229
She's a huge mountain in my eyes.

1031
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:14,897
I'm ready to learn from you.

1032
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,692
Yes, then…

1033
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,320
Let's have a battle
between us short-haired folks.

1034
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:24,782
She's good.

1035
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,078
So it's a match between gomtang
and temple cuisine?

1036
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,372
It's a contest between someone
who usually cooks meat

1037
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,791
and someone who never cooks meat.

1038
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,294
Will this match be possible?

1039
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:38,796
I think this will probably be
the biggest match.

1040
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,884
What if the ingredient
turns out to be meat?

1041
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,428
It looks like she can choose.

1042
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,722
She can't use certain ingredients,

1043
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:51,309
so it looks like they're letting her
choose a region without meat.

1044
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,397
She needs to go inland.

1045
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:00,860
Gapyeong.

1046
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:05,740
The main ingredient from Gapyeong
will now be revealed.

1047
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,743
Your main ingredient is…

1048
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:12,038
Gapyeong pine nuts.

1049
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,415
This will be worth watching.

1050
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,001
-I can't wait.
-It's going to be good.

1051
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,214
Pine nuts are great.

1052
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,257
Pine nuts from Gapyeong

1053
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,384
have this flavor and aroma

1054
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,762
that can hold its own
anywhere in the world.

1055
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,473
I wonder how the chefs will interpret it.

1056
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,267
I'm a little afraid,

1057
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:36,562
because pine nuts are used a lot
in temple cuisine.

1058
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,814
It was a welcome sight.

1059
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,234
The battle of Gapyeong pine nuts.

1060
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,486
Please begin cooking.

1061
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,155
Good luck!

1062
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,116
Good luck, Venerable Sunjae!

1063
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,159
One, two, three.

1064
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,328
Go, Dweji-Gomtang in NY!

1065
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:55,581
-Good luck, Venerable Sunjae!
-How dare they not root for the Venerable?

1066
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,336
It's a very important ingredient
for monks.

1067
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,339
It's high in protein and fat.

1068
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,259
It's also nutty and sweet.

1069
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,095
Rather than use a new recipe,

1070
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:12,473
this dish carries the wisdom
of monks built up over the years.

1071
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,809
A dish monks often eat.

1072
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:16,936
It's pine nut and vegetable noodles.

1073
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:21,566
I use pine nuts to make
the soup for the noodles.

1074
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,067
She's chopping them.

1075
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,278
She's chopping all of those with a knife?

1076
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,572
-That's a lot to chop.
-Exactly.

1077
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:32,076
The longer pine nuts stay in the blender,
the more their aroma disappears.

1078
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,537
So I chop them with a knife first

1079
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,832
to reduce their time spent in the blender
as much as possible.

1080
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:41,168
-The Venerable is incredible.
-"I am one with the pine nut."

1081
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:43,713
"I am the pine nut."

1082
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,883
The pine nut is the star of the show.

1083
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,177
We have to bring out its natural flavor
and aroma as much as possible

1084
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,180
while making sure
its natural fats and proteins

1085
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,182
can be absorbed easily by the body.

1086
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,441
She's only seasoning with salt.

1087
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,822
Seriously, that only has
pine nuts and water.

1088
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:10,740
-Yeah.
-Right?

1089
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,158
It's not like she used any dairy.

1090
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:16,495
Temple cuisine isn't just vegetarian food.

1091
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:20,082
It's a little different.
It's food that helps your practice.

1092
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,626
We don't use green onions or garlic.

1093
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:26,088
Anything with additives or seasonings
is also not allowed when we cook.

1094
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,136
I think the Venerable is making dough.

1095
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,681
It's green.

1096
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,975
To make it even more nutritious,

1097
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:41,854
I'm going to blend in seasonal vegetables
to make the noodle dough.

1098
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:46,025
Korean zucchini in particular
prevents flour from clumping,

1099
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,027
so it's essential when making noodles.

1100
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:49,987
It helps ease the stomach.

1101
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,286
Is she pressing out the noodles?

1102
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,374
She's using a pasta maker
to press them out.

1103
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,586
It's my first time seeing
Venerable make noodles.

1104
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,970
"It's made without green onion,
garlic, fish, or even meat,

1105
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,388
so how could it taste like this?"

1106
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,515
But it does.

1107
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,517
It has a delicate flavor.

1108
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,520
It's about making the most
of the ingredients.

1109
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,690
True beauty lies in emptiness.

1110
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,486
I can't believe it's a match
between the Venerable

1111
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:31,946
-and Dweji-Gomtang in NY.
-I know.

1112
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,408
It can't be any more contradictory.

1113
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,245
But if you look at his ingredients,

1114
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,038
-they're all…
-Carrot, radish…

1115
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,832
-Temple cuisine ingredients.
-Yes.

1116
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,835
-I think he's making it vegan.
-He's making a vegan dish.

1117
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,670
Even if pine nuts are the main ingredient,

1118
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,422
-he can still use meat.
-Exactly.

1119
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:53,801
It's a competition,
so it needs to be fair.

1120
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,056
Shouldn't I be doing this
on equal terms as the Venerable?

1121
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,477
Instead of making the food
I've made until now,

1122
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,689
I decided to approach it
as a practitioner like the Venerable.

1123
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,232
I wanted to create a dish

1124
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,318
in the style of temple cuisine
without the five pungent vegetables.

1125
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:15,865
I'll only be using vegetables,
so I julienned burdock root,

1126
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,367
radish,

1127
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,077
pyogo mushrooms,

1128
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,245
bamboo shoots,

1129
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,456
and carrots.

1130
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:26,375
I julienne the vegetables along the grain.

1131
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,502
My dish is called "Vegetable Japchae."

1132
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:31,297
And the subtitle would be
"The Texture of Vegetables."

1133
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,467
In a cast iron frying pan,

1134
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,178
I drizzle some perilla oil
and stir-fry over very low heat.

1135
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:42,058
I cook the vegetables gently over low heat

1136
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,226
to preserve their natural grain
and texture.

1137
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,145
You need to feel that on the palate.

1138
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,899
Then, I use a very mildly prepared
doenjang broth

1139
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:52,401
to season the vegetables
instead of using salt.

1140
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,862
Each vegetable has
its own natural savoriness,

1141
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:58,032
and with the flavor of doenjang,
that savoriness will come alive.

1142
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:01,535
But the key thing is pine nuts
are the main ingredient.

1143
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,246
They have to encompass everything.

1144
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,415
I thought I definitely had to
make a sauce with them.

1145
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:07,875
Made with Chinese toon shoots

1146
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,878
and pyogo mushrooms, the broth goes in.

1147
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:12,338
And I purée them with a blender.

1148
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,384
The pine nuts pull
everything together as you eat this.

1149
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,388
I can confidently say
I'm just as committed as the Venerable is

1150
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,432
to bringing out
the natural flavors of food.

1151
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,148
Is the Venerable making
potato dumpling balls?

1152
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:36,445
-Venerable Sunjae works really fast.
-Yes, she really does.

1153
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:38,864
Yeah, her hands are a blur.

1154
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,367
-You can't see them.
-She's really fast.

1155
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,284
Yeah.

1156
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,328
She's light on her feet.

1157
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,872
-Her movements are precise.
-Yes.

1158
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,626
I guess all she does is just cook?

1159
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,673
The potato dumpling balls, or ongsimi,
are for eating with the soup.

1160
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,174
If you just gulp down the soup,

1161
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,593
the pine nuts are too rich
to digest properly.

1162
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,345
The ongsimi makes you chew and eat slow.

1163
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:04,056
I'm thinking about how this dish

1164
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:08,060
will make the person eating it
happy and healthy in both mind and body.

1165
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,820
-Great work!
-Venerable Sunjae!

1166
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:19,655
She ended with 15 minutes left.

1167
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:24,368
I caught my eyes wandering over.
Then, I quickly focused on my own dish.

1168
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,250
I put a lot of care
into every part of my dish

1169
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,879
and tried my best with what I was given.

1170
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:42,219
He was working very hard,
so I wanted to root for him.

1171
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:46,348
I even thought,
"I hope he wins this match."

1172
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,318
DWEJI-GOMTANG IN NY

1173
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:03,699
-I think Venerable Sunjae will advance.
-Me too.

1174
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,868
Those noodles looked extraordinary.

1175
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,329
You can't go wrong with pine nut noodles.

1176
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,832
If Dweji-Gomtang in NY wins,
that would be a real upset.

1177
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,168
The battle of Gapyeong pine nuts.

1178
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,921
Please proceed
to the blind taste testing table.

1179
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:18,756
Let's go.

1180
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,930
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

1181
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:33,562
The battle of Gapyeong pine nuts.
Please enter.

1182
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,241
They were both blindfolded.

1183
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:49,662
It must be so exhausting to go through
all those people with blindfolds on.

1184
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:54,416
It must take a toll on their eyes.
Those were my initial thoughts.

1185
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,711
Now, please taste the first dish.

1186
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,591
It's called Seungso Pine Nut
and Vegetable Noodles.

1187
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,595
Seungso means the smile of monks.

1188
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,847
This provides all the nutrients
that monks lack.

1189
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,392
Not just the pine nuts
but flour is rich in protein too.

1190
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:12,351
It has glutamine.

1191
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,312
Noodles always bring a smile,
so I gave it this name.

1192
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,858
Just as it brings a smile to monks' faces,

1193
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:24,446
I hope this is a dish
that can make the judges smile too.

1194
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:31,495
I wondered how delicious
those pine nut noodles would be.

1195
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,039
I really wanted to have a taste too.

1196
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,435
They're noodles.

1197
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,730
But not just any noodles.

1198
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:01,275
I added sliced Korean melon
with the rind on

1199
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:03,027
and had them take a second bite.

1200
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,535
You can taste the sweet flavor

1201
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:13,162
of the melon rind.

1202
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,094
They could've made the pine nuts…

1203
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,598
stand out much stronger in their flavor.

1204
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,808
-They held back.
-They exercised restraint.

1205
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,102
But the aroma is still so fragrant.

1206
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:41,565
The fruit in the second bite
tasted like Korean melon.

1207
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:44,151
It wasn't overly sweet

1208
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:46,862
but had something
of a watermelon rind-like aroma,

1209
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:48,405
which paired really well.

1210
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:52,451
Pine nuts on their own are very oily
and can taste a bit heavy,

1211
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,036
but this is really refreshing.

1212
01:12:58,248 --> 01:13:01,001
I tasted the first dish
of pine nut noodles,

1213
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,044
and it was amazing.

1214
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:03,796
It was so delicious.

1215
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:07,508
I didn't know pine nut aroma
could be so beautiful.

1216
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,220
This wasn't made by any ordinary person.

1217
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,763
That's what I thought.

1218
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:17,226
I was thinking, "If this one's lacking,
I'm ready to push the button right away,"

1219
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:18,519
as I tasted the second dish.

1220
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:25,943
Next, please taste the second dish.

1221
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:29,655
VEGETABLE JAPCHAE

1222
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:33,325
The pine nut sauce coats
all the julienned ingredients,

1223
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,328
so every bite comes with the flavor
of pine nut and the ingredient.

1224
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:44,294
You drizzle the pine nut sauce
and toss it all together.

1225
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,966
I suppose it's almost like a salad.

1226
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,693
It's a mix of different aromas.

1227
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,196
It's complex.

1228
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,951
This person also exercised restraint…

1229
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,245
in the flavor.

1230
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,457
They did a great job of bringing out
the aroma of the ingredients.

1231
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:06,001
Wait, I don't think there's any meat.

1232
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:07,836
But the texture…

1233
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:13,842
You can kind of taste
the time put in this. It's kind of…

1234
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:18,055
Oh, no. This is bad.
It's going to be so hard to choose.

1235
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:20,015
Technique aside,

1236
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:22,476
I could taste the care
that was put into the vegetables.

1237
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,230
The pine nut aroma
came through subtly too.

1238
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,607
But it wasn't like a fresh aroma.

1239
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:32,986
It was deep, almost as if it reaches
straight into your soul.

1240
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,447
This person was also something else.

1241
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,910
They didn't season this too much either.

1242
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,162
-It's mild.
-Yes, it's mild but…

1243
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:44,915
They made the qualities
of each ingredient shine.

1244
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:48,460
But the pine nut isn't overbearing.
It gently supports the flavors.

1245
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,796
They made good use
of the strengths of pine nuts.

1246
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:54,091
Both contestants used a light hand.

1247
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:56,426
The pine nut noodles screamed,
"I'm pine nuts."

1248
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,595
But it was quite sophisticated.

1249
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:03,225
This one feels like the pine nut
is complementing each ingredient.

1250
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:09,398
Such a big difference with just pine nuts…

1251
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:13,193
But there's so much skill
and depth in both dishes.

1252
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,279
This is a tough one.

1253
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:18,574
-It's really tough.
-This one's so hard.

1254
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:27,332
This is the hardest decision yet for me.

1255
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,961
Please select the dish

1256
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:34,923
that is more delicious
and better utilized the main ingredient.

1257
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:37,634
The first dish versus the second.

1258
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:40,012
Please make your choice now.

1259
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:41,722
Gosh, this is…

1260
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,474
It's too hard.

1261
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,268
The difference in flavor.

1262
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,187
The difference in time.

1263
01:16:50,897 --> 01:16:54,401
Is it the pine nut broth with noodles
that's full of different flavors…

1264
01:16:57,195 --> 01:17:01,533
or is it the pine nut sauce
that complements various vegetables?

1265
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,623
The voting is complete.

1266
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:12,169
The survivor
of this one-on-one face-off is…

1267
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:18,462
