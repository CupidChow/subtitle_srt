1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,507
They're turning.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,050
They're turning around!

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,428
They're turning!

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,595
The stations are turning!

5
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:17,976
What on earth?

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,769
I did not see this coming.

7
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,022
Unbelievable.

8
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,233
The second battle of the fourth round is…

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,361
the one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle.

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,158
Your opponent in this one-on-one battle…

11
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,246
is your former teammate.

12
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,583
This is crazy.

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,712
This really is something else.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,968
This is so annoying.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,723
Not even an hour ago,
we were talking about advancing together.

16
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,809
CULINARY MONSTER VS SON JONG-WON

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,978
We're suddenly opponents now.

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,396
Like this?

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,523
SAM KIM VS JUNG HO-YOUNG

20
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,983
I just got chills.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,903
KIM HEE-EUN VS VENERABLE SUNJAE

22
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,364
I realized, "Right, it's Venerable Sunjae.
She's a tough opponent."

23
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,117
-How absurd.
-We all chose who we each thought

24
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,410
was the strongest contestant.

25
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,205
He was one of the people
I wanted to avoid.

26
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,915
So we meet again.

27
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,542
HOU DEOK-JUK VS CHUN SANG-HYUN

28
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,002
This is so dramatic.

29
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,799
Also, in this one-on-one
Life-or-Death Battle

30
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,971
you must only use the ingredients
that were used in the previous battle.

31
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,187
Just incredible.

32
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,522
Unbelievable.

33
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,316
This is so cruel.

34
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,194
They're bringing them back to us.

35
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,946
What on earth?

36
00:01:54,531 --> 00:02:00,161
THE SAME INGREDIENTS
AS THE ONES FROM THE TWO-PERSON BATTLE

37
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,204
So that's why…

38
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,290
No wonder why they told us
to buy double. It was so odd.

39
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,584
Right. It was strange
when we were buying ingredients.

40
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,878
-Why ask us to buy double?
-There was no need for it.

41
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,338
It was for this.

42
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,011
In other words,
you must share the same ingredients

43
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,597
from the previous mission
between the two of you.

44
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,850
Oh, my god.

45
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,436
You may decide
on how to divide the ingredients,

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,108
and with them, you must make a dish
to defeat your opponent.

47
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,196
That means we'll have
entirely new dishes then.

48
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,199
That's right. We'll see new dishes.

49
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,284
What should I make?

50
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:45,790
Only the winners of the one-on-one matches
will advance to the Top 7.

51
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,667
The losers will be eliminated.

52
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,253
Furthermore, for this match,

53
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,796
there will be

54
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,840
no additional survivors.

55
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,929
This is driving me crazy.

56
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,222
My goodness.

57
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,183
When we were on the same team,

58
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,936
I was happy we were
mentor and student again.

59
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,646
But the ending was…

60
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,732
ONE-ON-ONE LIFE-OR-DEATH BATTLE

61
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,442
…just so cruel.

62
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,034
We did say before we started,

63
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,829
"No hard feelings, no matter who wins."

64
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,499
I made it back from the dead
and got this far.

65
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,046
We're good buddies.

66
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,008
-But now, we part ways.
-Right.

67
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,596
I think it's time I aimed a little higher.

68
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,350
I'll give an even bigger hug
when it's over.

69
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,768
Yes, all right.

70
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,900
Even if we partake
in friendly competition,

71
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,819
I hope we don't consider
each other as enemies.

72
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,614
I don't know if I'm trying
to be positive because I'm a monk,

73
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,282
but that's just how I feel.

74
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,286
It's a rather sad situation.

75
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,166
I'm sure all the chefs do want to win.

76
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,169
We just don't tell each other that.

77
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,964
We're all aiming to reach the top.

78
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:21,469
That's just how things are
in the world of competition.

79
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,806
-Gosh. It's an honor, Master Hou.
-Let's do our best.

80
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,558
-I'm just grateful to even be here.
-All right.

81
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,477
-There's no pressure.
-Yes, all right.

82
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,108
I said instead of getting nervous,
we should just have fun.

83
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,945
He's someone I really admire and like.

84
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,072
I've known him for a long time.

85
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,491
However,

86
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,743
there's no room for that in a competition.

87
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,495
I have to win.

88
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,915
Culinary Monster…

89
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,208
is very talented.

90
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,710
Of course, he'll do well.

91
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,670
But I just need to do better.

92
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,463
I'm confident.

93
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,385
Now, the one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle

94
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,054
begins now!

95
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,604
Split them fifty-fifty?

96
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,858
-How many?
-Let's do a crab and a half each.

97
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,318
A crab and a half? Okay.

98
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,904
-We have to split them properly.
-Yes.

99
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,449
-I used one blue crab.
-Okay.

100
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,409
You can take all those.

101
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,829
For the first battle, they were in teams.

102
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,291
They probably took those ingredients

103
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,293
and had lengthy discussions over them.

104
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,212
So they might read
what each other will do.

105
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,964
-They shared ideas too.
-Exactly.

106
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,219
The challenge was to use
the ingredients we had bought together,

107
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,346
so our ingredients will be very similar.

108
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,768
It felt too limited
to do anything new with them.

109
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,145
You can take the abalone.

110
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,482
We bought one carrot
and one Korean zucchini,

111
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,525
but we had to share them.

112
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,112
This really isn't easy. What do I do?

113
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,286
Geez, there's too much in here.

114
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,581
-Why did we buy so much?
-What?

115
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,084
-Geez.
-You're complaining there's too much?

116
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,253
It's a relief to have too much.

117
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,842
We had around ten dishes in mind

118
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,594
and bought our ingredients accordingly.

119
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,641
So we had bought a lot of stuff.

120
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,684
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

121
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,531
I'm prepping so much brown croaker today.

122
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,201
First, I prep the brown croaker.

123
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,747
I start by prepping the brown croaker.

124
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,794
BOTH CHOOSE BROWN CROAKER
AS THEIR MAIN INGREDIENT

125
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,923
The first battle had to be a collaboration
between Italian and Japanese cuisine.

126
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,634
But for the second battle,
I'm doing purely Japanese cuisine.

127
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,220
So you've dropped Italian cuisine, right?

128
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,972
Yes. We never really got along.

129
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,102
It's the most classic style
of Japanese cooking.

130
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,941
I chose to go with a braise.

131
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,405
I'm actually quite good at braises.

132
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,658
After combining cooking wine,
rice wine, and sugar,

133
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,452
I put the fish in and start cooking.

134
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,625
As the sweet flavor seeps in,
the fish becomes tender.

135
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,129
Next, I add brewed soy sauce

136
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,548
and braise it until it's glossy.

137
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,472
That's when I add the burdock root.

138
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,893
In the meantime, I take some tofu.

139
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,397
I sear the surface with a kitchen torch.

140
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,942
That makes it firm on the outside
but soft on the inside.

141
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,613
That's the kind of braise it'll be.

142
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,245
But it might be boring to make
just braised brown croaker.

143
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,831
This swim bladder is really good.

144
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,792
As with the team battle,

145
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,879
I didn't want to pass on using
the brown croaker's swim bladder.

146
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,840
Are you using the swim bladder?

147
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,050
The swim bladder? No.

148
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,969
-Pass me the swim bladder.
-It's right here.

149
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,765
The swim bladder punctures easily.

150
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,517
It does? It's right there at the end.

151
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,727
-What is this?
-What?

152
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,148
-It's not much. I cut the head.
-It's cut!

153
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,983
-You sure you didn't cut it on purpose?
-No!

154
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,319
Come on.

155
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,570
You knew I'd use it.

156
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,364
No, no. Seriously, it's not that.

157
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,491
I was in a hurry, so I cut the head off.

158
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,540
What a waste of an ingredient.

159
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,086
I'm going to steam the swim bladder again.

160
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,548
In the first battle,
we tried to stuff it whole,

161
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,509
but the filling wouldn't go in,
and it burst.

162
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,805
This time, I boldly cut it up.

163
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,852
I also stuffed them with more filling.

164
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,230
-What are you making?
-Me?

165
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,775
I'm thinking of taking the dish we made

166
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,610
and reinventing it in my own style.

167
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,238
-So Italian-style instead of Japanese?
-Yes.

168
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,864
And you're using the same broth?

169
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,784
Yes, I'm making another one
to mix together.

170
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,078
THE PROSCIUTTO SAUCE
USED IN THE TEAM BATTLE

171
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,289
Because you can reuse
what you made before?

172
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,415
-That's right.
-Okay.

173
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,666
In the team battle,

174
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,877
we glazed the fish with miso
and grilled it over charcoal.

175
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,504
I'm going to confidently show

176
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:53,384
that the dish can be transformed
by cooking it in a different way.

177
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,139
With olive oil on low heat,

178
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,517
I add the brown croaker.

179
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,103
It's going to cook slowly
at a low temperature.

180
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,230
POACHING

181
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,441
COOKING FOOD GENTLY
IN LIQUID BELOW ITS BOILING POINT

182
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,860
The flesh becomes really tender.

183
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,405
I thought about what sauce to use.

184
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,657
BASIL

185
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,869
Then, I thought of basil pesto.

186
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,040
So I mix basil pesto and heavy cream.

187
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,045
I add Parmesan cheese
to make a creamy sauce.

188
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,925
Chef Sam Kim is really good
at cooking Italian food.

189
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,887
I think his flavors
will contrast with mine.

190
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,431
So I'm worried.

191
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,436
Gosh, you're making something tasty.

192
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,313
It looks tasty.

193
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,319
It looked like he made
some kind of cream sauce.

194
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,571
It looked really tasty.

195
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,283
The highlight of this dish is
its series of gentle textures and flavors.

196
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,412
The fish is really tender,
and the sauce is nice and smooth.

197
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,458
But it can't all be gentle,
so I add tomato

198
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,170
and some grilled spinach.

199
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,925
I put the poached fish on top.

200
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,180
Lastly, I add the prosciutto broth,
which will complement everything.

201
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,143
When eaten all together,
I think the balance will be really good.

202
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,487
I've made braised dishes countless times.

203
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,702
I kept checking the taste
until the very end

204
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,455
and really gave it my all.

205
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,707
Very nice.

206
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,047
As for the steamed swim bladder,

207
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,511
I place it on the plate
where the soy sauce won't seep in.

208
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,848
Burdock root, large green onions,

209
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,934
and ginger were added as accompaniments.

210
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,688
I added a chiffonade
of some shiso as a garnish.

211
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,443
It's a soy-braised dish,
which is usually popular.

212
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,278
This is soy-braised brown croaker.

213
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,628
THE CHEF WHO FINISHES FIRST
WILL BE JUDGED FIRST

214
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,380
Hello.

215
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,715
Please explain your dish.

216
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,050
I used the same brown croaker
from the last battle.

217
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,429
Earlier, we glazed it with miso
and grilled it over charcoal.

218
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,015
But this time, I poached it in oil.

219
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,684
For the sauce,
I used basil pesto for the aroma.

220
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,145
I also wanted to create a creamy texture.

221
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,147
Next, this sauce around it

222
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,152
is a variation of the sauce
I used earlier.

223
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,820
It is similar to your earlier dish.

224
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,575
It's similar, but I added elements
that I originally wanted to do.

225
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,243
BROWN CROAKER, TOMATO, PROSCIUTTO SAUCE

226
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,039
When tasting it, eat the tomato

227
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,333
and the grilled spinach that's inside.

228
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,836
If you eat them together,
it will be much more enjoyable.

229
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,271
This creamy basil pesto
makes it really delicious.

230
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,527
Even though it's similar
to the dish from before,

231
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,781
your unique style comes through,

232
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:47,326
-so it feels completely different.
-It's completely different.

233
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:51,288
I think it was a good decision
to poach the fish in oil.

234
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:55,459
It makes it nice and creamy,
and the texture comes together.

235
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,674
Thank you for your dish.

236
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,095
I became confident.

237
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,348
"I think I might actually win this."
That kind of confidence.

238
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,397
For my dish,

239
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,609
I prepared a Japanese-style
brown croaker braise with burdock root.

240
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,280
I don't think I did
the steamed swim bladder justice earlier,

241
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,198
so I stuffed it fuller and steamed it.

242
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,325
Then, I topped it with shiso leaves.

243
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,120
You should take the tofu,
large green onion, and ginger

244
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,413
and taste it all together.

245
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,500
Start with the swim bladder
and soak it in the sauce.

246
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,877
-Swim bladder first?
-Please try.

247
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,004
-Like this?
-Yes, like that.

248
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,188
I'll cut it for you.

249
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,569
-And the ginger can go with anything?
-Yes, please taste it together.

250
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:22,087
Each ingredient's flavor comes through,
and they all match well with the sauce.

251
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,640
It's hard to read
Chef Anh Sung-jae's expression.

252
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:37,853
It would be nice if he could understand
what I was aiming for.

253
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,775
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

254
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,408
Now, it is time for the two judges

255
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,536
to decide on a survivor.

256
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,377
This is really tough.

257
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,005
Please write down your decisions
without discussing them.

258
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,010
THE JUDGES SUBMIT THEIR DECISIONS
TO THE PRODUCTION TEAM

259
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,262
BEFORE THE RESULTS ARE ANNOUNCED

260
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,350
I chose…

261
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,691
Chef Jung Ho-young.

262
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,110
PAIK JONG-WON
JUNG HO-YOUNG

263
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,823
To be honest, I don't think it's easy
to make a sweet braised dish.

264
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,993
The supporting ingredients and the fish

265
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,286
came together beautifully,

266
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,665
yet each ingredient shined on their own.

267
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,501
In particular, when I tasted
just the swim bladder

268
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,627
with the braised sauce,

269
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,255
I thought I didn't even need
to taste anything else.

270
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,798
I was already convinced.

271
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,555
Braises have a straightforward flavor,

272
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,724
so mine might seem weaker in comparison.

273
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,353
I chose…

274
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,152
Chef Sam Kim.

275
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,070
Chef Sam Kim.

276
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,281
ANH SUNG-JAE
SAM KIM

277
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,702
The way the brown croaker was used
along with the other ingredients

278
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,413
felt so much more natural to me.

279
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:24,168
I thought the cooking methods you adapted
based on the qualities of the ingredients

280
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,628
worked really well.

281
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,300
TIED AT 1-1

282
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,510
We'll need to discuss again.
Where should we go?

283
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,763
Oh, god.

284
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,434
ONE-ON-ONE LIFE-OR-DEATH MATCH RULE

285
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,312
IN THE EVENT OF A TIE,
THE JUDGES WILL CONFER AND DECIDE

286
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:48,067
It's not easy to maintain that texture
without having it become dry.

287
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,193
-No, it's not.
-So I…

288
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,653
In terms of that single spoonful…

289
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,572
My palate found it satisfying…

290
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,117
They were discussing for a while.

291
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,455
I wondered which side they would pick.

292
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,792
Now,

293
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,045
judges, please announce the result.

294
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,966
For this one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle,

295
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,470
the winner is…

296
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,933
Chef Jung Ho-young.

297
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,143
Chef Jung Ho-young. Congratulations.

298
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,230
JUNG HO-YOUNG ADVANCES TO THE TOP 7

299
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,731
Thank you.

300
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,067
Congratulations.

301
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,157
It's a battle between experts
of the highest level.

302
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:43,580
If the fish falls apart,
shouldn't we see that as a problem?

303
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,877
If it's even slightly overdone,
the fish can fall apart.

304
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,547
The brown croaker was cooked
to be very soft and tender.

305
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,966
Some people might see that
as being overcooked.

306
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,803
Chef Jung Ho-young's dish
didn't have that issue.

307
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,680
He executed it so cleanly.

308
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,641
I decided that going
with Chef Jung Ho-young this time

309
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,101
was the right choice.

310
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,478
Eliminated chef, Sam Kim,

311
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,981
please take your nameplate
and leave the kitchen.

312
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,820
Goodness.

313
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,530
-Well done.
-Congratulations.

314
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,950
Gosh. I'll do my best in the next round.

315
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,535
You have to win.

316
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,038
We promised there would be
no hard feelings.

317
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,332
I want to thank him
for that amazing battle.

318
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,294
To be honest,
I feel so relieved right now.

319
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,378
SAM KIM ELIMINATED

320
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,671
I have no regrets.

321
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,716
There were so many thrilling moments
I'll look back on fondly.

322
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,511
We said Venerable Sunjae
and Chef Kim Hee-eun

323
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,138
had very different styles.

324
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,224
But they can just do
their own thing this time.

325
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,226
Being different in styles
will benefit them.

326
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,103
They can bring out what makes them unique.

327
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:53,066
If they focus on their own styles
and showcase everything they've got,

328
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,236
that could work to their advantage.

329
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,863
We're just cooking our own dishes.

330
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,908
Instead of worrying over
if we'll be eliminated or not,

331
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,494
we should just try our best
in this moment.

332
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,039
I want her to do well.

333
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,875
But if she does well
because I go easy on her,

334
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,293
that would hurt her pride.

335
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,922
I don't want to hurt her pride
by going easy on her.

336
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,091
For me,

337
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,718
if I have a knife,

338
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,511
soy sauce,

339
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,933
and some doenjang, I can make anything.

340
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,312
There were a lot of ingredients,

341
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,899
so I thought about
how I could use all of them.

342
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,443
There was also rice left over.

343
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,945
LEFTOVER RICE AFTER MAKING GIMBAP

344
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,740
I decided to use that rice,
so what I came up with was

345
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,744
soy sauce bibimbap and doenjang bibimbap.

346
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,413
For the bibimbap,

347
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,291
I take carrots and burdock root,
which grow underground,

348
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,585
spinach and cabbage,
which grow above ground,

349
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,130
and mushrooms picked from trees
and mix them all together.

350
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:01,134
I take everything from the earth
and bring them together as one.

351
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,929
Next, I made the seasoning sauce.

352
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,556
Usually, when you make
the seasoning sauce with chili peppers,

353
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,268
you add chili peppers
and sesame oil to soy sauce.

354
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,479
But I changed the order
and used a slightly different method.

355
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,648
I chopped green chili peppers,

356
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,775
stir-fried them in sesame oil,

357
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,443
and then added some soy sauce.

358
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,613
It had a very clean flavor.

359
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,741
I just kept it simple and straightforward.

360
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,369
Should I do it or not?

361
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,206
With mascarpone…

362
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,918
Should I do it? Should I not?

363
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,382
The first battle

364
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,301
was where I felt the most regret.

365
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,511
It felt like Venerable Sunjae's
doenjang soup

366
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,973
was at odds with this gimbap.

367
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,018
This gimbap is delicious
with complex flavors.

368
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,519
I gave it a lot of thought.

369
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,481
I'm going to do everything I can
and give it my best shot.

370
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,400
I think of it as competing with myself.

371
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,444
Let's try this again.

372
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,368
MASCARPONE CHEESE

373
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,037
GIM POWDER

374
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,913
I wanted to focus

375
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,541
on abalone and gim again,
so I gave it another try.

376
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,086
I steamed the abalone
to make it very tender,

377
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,130
and to give it extra impact,

378
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,466
I lightly smoked it with herbs.

379
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,009
To that slightly smoked abalone,

380
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,763
I added a mix of gopchang gim
and mascarpone to create my dish.

381
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,267
We didn't use abalone innards earlier,

382
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,351
but I used the innards

383
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,938
to make a savory abalone innards sauce.

384
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,278
I wanted to try another abalone dish

385
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,032
to leave them impressed by how it tastes.

386
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,953
For the doenjang sauce,

387
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,872
after adding pyogo mushrooms,
Korean zucchini,

388
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:54,998
and green chili peppers,

389
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,500
I tossed them in doenjang.

390
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,879
I made a bit of kelp broth
and cooked that mix in it

391
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,339
to make the sauce.

392
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,971
I just prepared a dish I usually make.

393
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,812
I just try my best with the given time.

394
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,106
I'm going to cook the way I always do

395
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,732
but also be really focused to do well.

396
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,952
I really used that time
without any regrets.

397
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,503
This is beautiful.

398
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,966
SOY SAUCE BIBIMBAP AND DOENJANG BIBIMBAP

399
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,928
When we think of bibimbap,
we only think of gochujang sauce,

400
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:53,849
but we also have soy sauce bibimbap
and doenjang bibimbap.

401
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,978
-I thought I should mix it for you.
-All right.

402
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,938
-Please do.
-Okay.

403
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,567
I'll take just a bit and mix it
with the soy sauce for you.

404
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,530
-Do you eat it like this at times?
-Yes.

405
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,532
When there's a big gathering,

406
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,118
we serve this to symbolize
people coming together.

407
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,290
It's salty,
but you can digest it really well.

408
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,044
SOY SAUCE BIBIMBAP

409
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,922
You can each try a spoonful.

410
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,925
Use a spoon and have a taste.

411
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,673
The taste is clean, isn't it?

412
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,515
It's not the flavor I expected.

413
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,061
It's an unexpected flavor.
But the soy sauce has a special aroma.

414
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,980
And you stir-fried it,
so the peppers are cooked through.

415
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,525
If you use raw green chili peppers,
the flavors don't blend.

416
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,486
It leaves a raw taste.

417
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,999
The judges were having a full meal
instead of just tasting the dish.

418
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:49,589
THEY ALSO TASTE THE DOENJANG BIBIMBAP

419
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,526
It must've been really delicious.
They're probably not hungry anymore.

420
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,405
They're appealing in different ways.

421
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,699
-Thank you for your dish.
-Thank you.

422
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,375
Hello.

423
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,459
Hello.

424
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,087
This is beautiful.

425
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,549
HERB-SMOKED ABALONE WITH GIM MASCARPONE

426
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,759
I made another attempt at creating a dish

427
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,053
with gopchang gim and abalone
as the main ingredients.

428
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:41,891
Please taste a piece of abalone
with the gim mascarpone first.

429
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,728
Then, try it
with the abalone innards sauce.

430
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,189
-First, with the mascarpone.
-Yes, the mascarpone and the abalone.

431
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,607
Just those two together.

432
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,650
-Like this?
-Yes.

433
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,111
-This…
-Yes.

434
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,363
-Yes, with that.
-Gopchang gim and mascarpone.

435
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,534
I personally think gim
pairs very well with dairy.

436
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,161
So…

437
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,256
Mascarpone pairs very well with gim.

438
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,383
The sauce is good.

439
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,511
Please taste the abalone innards sauce.

440
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,763
-This one?
-Yes.

441
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,238
Why did you use
gopchang gim in particular?

442
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,741
Gopchang gim has a coarse texture,

443
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,827
but I think it's much sweeter
and more savory than other types of gim.

444
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,996
So I roasted it
and ground it into a powder.

445
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,166
Then, I mixed it with mascarpone,
a bit of sugar, and salt.

446
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,627
Gosh, it's delicious.

447
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,629
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

448
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,887
Judges, please announce the result.

449
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,889
I chose…

450
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,061
Venerable Sunjae.

451
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:09,979
Venerable Sunjae.

452
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,023
ANH SUNG-JAE
VENERABLE SUNJAE

453
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,525
Honestly,

454
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,780
whether it's temple cuisine or not
is of little importance to me.

455
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,242
I just felt there was mastery
and refinement in the dish.

456
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,744
And I thought
Venerable Sunjae's personal touch

457
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,872
came through very well in the dish,
so that's why I made this choice.

458
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,790
Thank you.

459
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,793
I chose…

460
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,799
Venerable Sunjae.

461
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,134
PAIK JONG-WON
VENERABLE SUNJAE

462
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,802
Congratulations, Venerable Sunjae.

463
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,886
You won.

464
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:48,268
For a dish that seems so simple,
it gave so much happiness.

465
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,521
Even though she had limited ingredients,

466
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,816
I was amazed at what she could do
with temple cuisine.

467
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,693
From that humbleness,

468
00:28:56,776 --> 00:29:00,238
you get something that really hits you
in the core of your being.

469
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,324
You realize why people speak
so highly of Venerable Sunjae.

470
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,243
The one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle.

471
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,996
White Spoon Chef
Venerable Sunjae survives.

472
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,748
Congratulations.

473
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,374
VENERABLE SUNJAE ADVANCES TO THE TOP 7

474
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:22,635
Temple cuisine
and vegetarian cooking was recognized.

475
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,929
So rather than my personal joy,

476
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,307
I feel very happy for the cuisine.

477
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,435
Eliminated chef, Kim Hee-eun,

478
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,854
please take your nameplate
and leave the kitchen.

479
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,066
Oh, no.

480
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,029
I wanted you to win, Hee-eun.

481
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,030
-It's okay.
-Gosh.

482
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,866
-I learned so much from you.
-Thank you.

483
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,827
Thank you.

484
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,919
I wasn't able to show everything
I was capable of as a chef.

485
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,296
I still had the will to fight,
so it's a shame.

486
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,257
The road may have ended here for me.

487
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,052
KIM HEE-EUN ELIMINATED

488
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:08,306
But I wanted to go back to my roots
and grow again from the ground up,

489
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,475
so I put mine at the very bottom.

490
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,437
KIM HEE-EUN

491
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,189
HOU DEOK-JUK VS CHUN SANG-HYUN

492
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,106
The lobsters.

493
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,651
Let's use two lobsters each.

494
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,617
It might be a bit challenging
for them over there

495
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,910
since their ingredients were…

496
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,287
-Lobster, mangoes, and mayonnaise.
-Mangoes, lobster…

497
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,705
A few sauces and that's about it.

498
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,541
TEAM WITH LEAST NUMBER OF INGREDIENTS USED

499
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,584
That put me in a predicament.

500
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:41,005
We'd bought lobsters and mangoes
as the main ingredients.

501
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:45,677
Since we had to use the same ingredients,
it was very challenging.

502
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,929
But from the feedback we received

503
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,765
when we used
a Chinese-style mayonnaise sauce…

504
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,435
The amount of mayonnaise
and the texture when I took a bite

505
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,646
felt a bit too rich.

506
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:01,776
So I thought of chow mein,
specifically "la chow mein."

507
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,154
I decided to make a spicy chow mein dish.

508
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:09,117
Chow mein is stir-fried noodles.

509
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:13,496
The character for "chow" refers
to the cooking method of stir-frying.

510
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,542
When you add the character for noodles,
it becomes "stir-fried noodles."

511
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,710
"LA" MEANS SPICY IN CHINESE

512
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:22,338
LA CHOW MEIN MEANS
SPICY STIR-FRIED NOODLES

513
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,631
RULE
PANTRY INGREDIENTS ALLOWED

514
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,259
I can only use what's there,

515
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,385
and when I looked,

516
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,306
I found fresh kalguksu noodles.

517
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,810
To be honest,
this is my first time making this.

518
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,979
I don't have anything else I can use.

519
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,773
Simply put,

520
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,192
it's kalguksu chow mein.

521
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,779
When making chow mein,
the base is the most important part.

522
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,365
I decided to use lobster for the sauce

523
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:53,036
and draw out its flavor
as much as possible.

524
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:02,045
I took the lobster shells
and stir-fried them

525
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,172
before making a really rich broth.

526
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,969
I'm using just the ingredients I have,

527
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,515
but I still put care
and effort into the dish.

528
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,685
I never do a half-hearted job.

529
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,733
And it's also because this is a match
between mentor and student.

530
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,322
Since I'm a student of Master Hou,

531
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,825
I need to make a dish
that won't disgrace his name.

532
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,329
The dish I prepared is
lobster and mango with chili sauce.

533
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,332
Since the ingredients
we can use are limited,

534
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,793
to make the chili sauce,

535
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,963
I took pasta sauce
that's usually used to make spaghetti

536
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,633
and added gochujang, apple cider vinegar,

537
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,970
and doubanjiang.

538
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:56,766
I reduced that and made something close
to a Chinese-style chili sauce.

539
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,478
The main ingredients
were lobster and mangoes.

540
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,316
I believe chefs should have the skills

541
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,820
to create a dish
no matter what they're given.

542
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,531
I tried deep-frying mangoes
and tasted them.

543
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,538
They were very soft inside,
and the sweetness came right out.

544
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,166
I thought this pairing worked pretty well,

545
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,335
so I deep-fried and added them.

546
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,256
DEEP-FRIED MANGOES

547
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,843
Since I simmered
the lobster into a rich broth,

548
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,053
it has a bit of a greasy taste.

549
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,391
So I added some spicy Chinese chili sauce.

550
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:47,567
It's spicy and full
of that lobster flavor.

551
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,820
The broth came out really rich.

552
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,823
It's a little different
from the standard la chow mein.

553
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,908
In the original la chow mein I made,

554
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,119
I'd parboil the noodles.

555
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,789
Then, I'd put them in a pan
with some oil and fry them.

556
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,710
It's crispy on the outside
and soft on the inside.

557
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,921
Then, I'd make the sauce
and pour it over the noodles.

558
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:13,634
But the kalguksu noodles I have
are quite thick.

559
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,680
They're also quite chewy.

560
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:21,684
So rather than frying them
to make the dish…

561
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,445
I thought it'd be better
to cook them in the rich broth.

562
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,489
So I changed the style a little bit.

563
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,122
What I find fascinating about cooking is

564
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:47,418
if you take something trivial
and use your head just a little,

565
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,464
a new flavor is discovered,
and a new dish is born.

566
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,966
Doing that is what I really enjoy.

567
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,389
Master Hou Deok-juk doesn't compromise
when it comes to cooking.

568
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,517
He's my mentor, and I truly respect him.

569
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,269
I'll try to the best of my abilities.

570
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,954
I didn't feel anxious at all
about being eliminated.

571
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,332
What matters most is that I did my best.

572
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,545
I did the best I possibly could.

573
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,939
I prepared lobster and mango
with chili sauce.

574
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,942
I also deep-fried mangoes,
giving it sweetness and softness.

575
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,738
-This is lobster.
-This is mango.

576
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,616
-Lobster.
-What should we taste first?

577
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,079
I think you should try the mango first.

578
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,689
You managed to use
doubanjiang and gochujang

579
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,275
and other ingredients well
to create the flavor.

580
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,402
The sauce is really important
for fried dishes.

581
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,321
It seems like there's a lot in here.

582
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:42,617
It's a chili sauce, so I tried my best
to recreate that flavor.

583
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,619
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

584
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,626
Thank you for your hard work.

585
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,419
We hardly did anything.

586
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,546
I used kalguksu noodles

587
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,341
to make lobster la chow mein.

588
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,386
It's not mala seasoning.

589
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,723
I didn't use Sichuan peppercorns,
so I can't use the character "ma."

590
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,726
That's why it's called la chow mein.

591
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,479
But for a chow mein,

592
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,981
it's quite soupy,
and you did this on purpose, right?

593
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,233
Yes, that's right.

594
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,249
Chow mein uses a lot of dark soy sauce,

595
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,293
-so I thought it'd be dark.
-Yes, that's right.

596
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,503
But this was unexpected.

597
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:21,007
If this had been stir-fried for too long,
the lobster broth and aroma

598
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,843
-would've been overpowered by the oil.
-Yes.

599
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,304
-The flavor is very clean.
-Yes, in a way,

600
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:30,850
it feels like a subtle
yet fragrant seafood kalguksu.

601
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,644
-Thank you for the dish.
-Thank you.

602
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,396
-Thank you for your hard work.
-You too.

603
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,609
Judges, please announce the result.

604
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,737
I chose…

605
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,034
Chef Hou Deok-juk.

606
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,286
PAIK JONG-WON
HOU DEOK-JUK

607
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,958
Stir-fried noodles have
a tendency to take away

608
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,002
from the flavor of the ingredients,

609
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:02,798
but you made the subtle lobster flavor
surround the entire dish,

610
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,883
so I chose Chef Hou.

611
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,636
I chose…

612
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,560
Chef Hou Deok-juk.

613
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,644
ANH SUNG-JAE
HOU DEOK-JUK

614
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,355
You've survived. Congratulations.

615
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,857
Thank you.

616
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,901
Out of all the dishes
I tasted in that round,

617
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,652
that impressed me the most,

618
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,321
and it was the most delicious.

619
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,948
One of the reasons was
they didn't have many ingredients.

620
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,117
I thought that would be very restrictive.

621
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,869
But when I tasted it,

622
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,039
it was very savory,
really delicious, and well-executed.

623
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,749
I thought, "Wow! He's amazing."

624
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:37,917
This is really…

625
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,794
So, in our industry right now,

626
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,963
Chef Hou Deok-juk is the most senior chef
among those who are active.

627
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,424
But from the way he works,

628
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,343
if you couldn't see his face,

629
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,888
you'd think he was just
a very hard-working young chef.

630
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,474
That's how energetic
and full of life he is.

631
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,396
I felt a lot of respect for him,

632
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,190
and it was a very humbling experience.

633
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,234
The one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle.

634
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,237
White Spoon Chef Hou Deok-juk survives.

635
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,282
HOU DEOK-JUK ADVANCES TO THE TOP 7

636
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,870
That's my mentor for you.

637
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,456
He's someone I cannot surpass.

638
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,086
-It was beyond comparison.
-Yeah, that difference.

639
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,712
-It was…
-Just incomparable.

640
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,965
It would've been even better freshly made.

641
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,843
Definitely. Then, it could've been
the best dish we had today.

642
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,263
Eliminated chef, Chun Sang-hyun,

643
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,849
please take your nameplate
and leave the kitchen.

644
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,103
You did great, Chef.

645
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,354
-What?
-You did great.

646
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,565
-Thank you, Chef.
-Great work.

647
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,776
-I should've been the one eliminated.
-No, you did so well.

648
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,237
I'm content. I have no regrets.

649
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,281
I'm really grateful.

650
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,491
All right. It was such a great experience.

651
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,660
-It was tough, but it was meaningful.
-No, please.

652
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,495
-It was great working together.
-Yes.

653
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,998
-Let's meet up once this is over, okay?
-Yes.

654
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,749
-Great job.
-Thank you.

655
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:07,047
Just being able to compete side by side
with him in the same space

656
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,966
was a great honor for me.

657
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:09,884
And…

658
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,344
I will forever be

659
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,889
Master Hou's student.

660
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:19,059
CHUN SANG-HYUN

661
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,523
It seems they were all wrapped up
in working together earlier,

662
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,862
but this time, they have a chance
to really show off their unique styles.

663
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,614
And I can already sense that.

664
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,157
KIM SUNG-WOON VS CHOI KANG-ROK

665
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,828
When we first planned our dish,

666
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,164
we decided to use
seasonal vegetables and seafood.

667
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,335
But my hometown of Taean
is known for a lot of these ingredients,

668
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:49,006
so I figured I'd be better
at using them to create a dish.

669
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,763
-I used one blue crab.
-Okay.

670
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,681
Can I use a little bit of the monkfish?

671
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,308
Hold on…

672
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,435
-Did you use all of it?
-No. Would this be enough?

673
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,354
-Gosh.
-I can give you another one.

674
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,313
No, it's fine.

675
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,565
I used all the seafood.

676
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,653
I thought about
how I could make all this seafood

677
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,738
come together nicely.

678
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,872
I decided to make a crepe.

679
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,751
There are a lot of dishes
where ingredients are wrapped in a crepe.

680
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:32,883
It'll be like eating a wrap that brings
all the seafood together as one.

681
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,971
For the seafood filling,
I stir-fry the ingredients together.

682
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,936
Then, I cut them into bite-sized cubes.

683
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,401
I add a béchamel sauce

684
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,487
and stir it well over heat.

685
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,449
Then, I'm going to combine
everything together.

686
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,458
I roll up the crepe.

687
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:11,171
It's like a dumpling,
and you eat it all together.

688
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,176
It's not possible to recreate
a dish you made with someone else.

689
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,722
The dish was only possible
because we made it together.

690
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,974
It's a just a one-time thing.

691
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,144
So then, what should I make?

692
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,773
What if I take the dish
we were praised for in the previous battle

693
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,026
and imagine if it were just me making it?

694
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,696
How would I present it?

695
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,865
"If it were just me."

696
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,492
To start with,

697
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,955
I quickly thought of all the elements
I'd made with Chef Kim Sung-woon.

698
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,166
First, the gnocchi.

699
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,128
I chose potatoes as my main ingredient.

700
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,131
I boil potatoes

701
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,217
and pass it through a sieve.

702
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,264
Then, I add butter

703
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,725
and potato starch.

704
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,977
And I knead it thoroughly.

705
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,690
With that prepared,

706
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,901
I braise some monkfish.

707
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,282
I put that inside the potato dough.

708
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,245
And I roll them into balls.

709
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,504
TWO-PERSON TEAM BLACK
AND WHITE SPOON ALLIANCE BATTLE

710
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,797
Seeing that gnocchi…

711
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,425
brought me to this point.

712
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,389
Then, I steam them.

713
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,019
The outer surface becomes nice and chewy.

714
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,188
I took that gnocchi,

715
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:57,903
and I developed it
into a potato dish I can make.

716
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,947
So, it'll be a new and unique taste.

717
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,663
This time, I need to really bring out
that savory flavor of blue crabs.

718
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,498
The bisque sauce is key.

719
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,919
First, I boil the blue crabs,

720
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,839
crush them,

721
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,802
and give them a nice sauté.

722
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,221
Gosh, this looks delicious.

723
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:28,642
When you sauté crabs,
their savoriness intensifies.

724
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,356
Next, I strain it through a sieve.

725
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,069
MASHED POTATOES

726
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,238
Once I add the potatoes and let it boil,

727
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,118
it becomes something like
crab clam chowder.

728
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,413
It's a cream soup
with a crab and potato base.

729
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,751
When Chef Kim and I
made our dish together,

730
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,628
I remembered the bowl we used.

731
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,630
If I just served
the potato balls on their own,

732
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,007
I would feel bad.

733
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,384
So I tried a lot of things.

734
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:05,804
I steamed the abalone.

735
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,517
Last time, he stuffed them
with pyogo mushrooms.

736
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,480
As for me, I'll cover them
with abalone innards.

737
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,151
I make a sauce with the abalone innards
and spread it on top.

738
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,820
DISH FROM TWO-PERSON TEAM BLACK
AND WHITE SPOON ALLIANCE BATTLE

739
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,364
Next, the blue crab.

740
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,993
I dip them in the innards sauce,

741
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,537
as if I'm coating them.

742
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,665
Before, I coated them in egg yolk.

743
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:38,879
I recreated that look
but with innards this time.

744
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,135
It's the process of carrying over
what we had made together.

745
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,432
The concept of the dish is
"If it were just me,"

746
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,893
but I also have knowledge of the past.

747
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:59,316
I have more of the ingredients I want
than Chef Choi does,

748
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,444
so I think
I'm in a slightly better position.

749
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,323
I think my dish came out perfectly.

750
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,582
I wanted to include
as many elements as I could from before.

751
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,502
I think it turned out well.

752
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,590
I tucked a bit of asparagus
in there as well.

753
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,846
-Please explain your dish.
-Sure.

754
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,976
The outer layers are crepes.

755
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,812
I rolled them up like gimbap with crepes.

756
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,605
With new potatoes,

757
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,401
I made mashed potatoes and used them
to make a white chowder-like base sauce.

758
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:47,030
For the filling, I mixed seafood in sauce

759
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,324
and put it in the crepes like dumplings.

760
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:52,661
The reddish garnish
you see on top isn't salmon roe.

761
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,704
It's crab innards.

762
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,914
I presented the innards
in the style of caviar.

763
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,751
When tasting it, you should cut it

764
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,838
and taste the sauce and crepe together.

765
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,050
I was expecting something similar,

766
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,430
but when I saw his dish,
it was so different from mine.

767
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,558
So I couldn't predict what would happen.

768
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:21,273
You should taste it
with the chowder-like bisque sauce.

769
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,862
I made the bisque sauce
a little spicy on purpose.

770
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,991
What did you add to make it spicy?

771
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,827
I added a bit of peperoncino.

772
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,393
That slight kick
from the peperoncino is pretty nice.

773
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,520
Yes.

774
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,231
Usually, food like this
kind of disintegrates.

775
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,775
You don't know what you're eating.

776
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:09,529
But with the size of the ingredients

777
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,823
and how they've been put together,

778
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,450
you can taste all of that.

779
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,536
Like the abalone and the crab,

780
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,415
all the ingredients inside
have great texture.

781
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,461
I think I have
a pretty good chance of winning.

782
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,594
I thought that was a rabbit.

783
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,554
Please explain your dish.

784
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:39,142
Right, so we did
a team battle together before.

785
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,647
But if the ingredients were the same

786
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,065
and if it were just me,

787
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,902
I think I would've made
bite-sized portions like this.

788
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,031
The potato ball is the star of the dish.

789
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,743
The rest are basically accompaniments.

790
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:01,081
I call it a potato manju.

791
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,458
What's inside the potato manju?

792
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:07,587
I braised some monkfish
and put it inside the manju.

793
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,424
In what order should we taste this?

794
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,677
I think you should start
with the potato manju.

795
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,720
And then?

796
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:19,099
Do we just bite into it?

797
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,392
You can cut it as well.

798
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,167
Now,

799
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,212
I get why you said
the potato manju was the star of the dish.

800
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:51,715
Next, the crab leg.

801
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,650
And then…

802
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,748
Thank you for your dish.

803
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,086
Oh, no. What do I do?

804
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,840
It just suddenly ended there,

805
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,053
so it left me feeling a bit deflated.

806
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,811
Now,

807
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:49,189
judges, please announce the result.

808
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,068
I chose…

809
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,946
Chef Kim Sung-woon.

810
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,572
ANH SUNG-JAE
KIM SUNG-WOON

811
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,866
The reason why I chose
Chef Kim Sung-woon is

812
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,620
when he combined
that seafood into one dish,

813
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,331
the natural flavors of the seafood,

814
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:10,669
like the sweetness,
savoriness, and saltiness,

815
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,796
were highlighted really well.

816
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,508
That's why I voted for Chef Kim Sung-woon.

817
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,014
I chose…

818
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,435
Chef Choi Kang-rok.

819
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,688
PAIK JONG-WON
CHOI KANG-ROK

820
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,941
To be honest,
the ingredients prepared today

821
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:36,987
all have strong, distinctive flavors,

822
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,947
especially when it comes to seafood.

823
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,116
But among all those,

824
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,703
there was a potato manju,
which I had never tasted before.

825
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:49,291
I was surprised
potatoes could taste like that.

826
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,084
It left a strong impression on me.

827
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:55,589
And the way each kind of seafood
was ordered so they flowed into the next

828
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,840
really impressed me.

829
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:00,427
TIED AT 1-1

830
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,804
It was really nerve-racking.

831
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,390
Just getting it over with at the start
would've been better.

832
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,225
I was on pins and needles.

833
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,062
I'm sad.

834
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,023
What I thought was

835
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,567
the composition
of Chef Choi Kang-rok's dish

836
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,821
jumped out in a completely unexpected way.

837
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,157
Despite all the seafood he had,

838
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,701
-he strategically chose potatoes.
-Exactly.

839
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:28,038
But they had crabs
and abalone available to them,

840
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:32,834
and if we think about who really showcased
these precious ingredients…

841
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,420
In this dish, he put
all the ingredients together

842
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:39,341
and made something that's easy to eat
with a well-executed sauce.

843
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,800
-For that balance.
-In the other,

844
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,179
when using the same ingredients
as the previous match,

845
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:48,058
I felt he stood out so much more
than the other chefs.

846
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,227
There's so much seafood,
but he says to taste the potato first?

847
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,395
As a manju?

848
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,148
I felt it was different, so I was a bit…

849
00:53:55,231 --> 00:54:00,195
Chef Kim Sung-woon's dish had
that wonderfully sweet taste of crab.

850
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,489
When I tasted that dish, it was fun.

851
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,325
-They were both delicious, but I…
-Right, they were. But…

852
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,955
I saw them, and it looked like
they were having a hard time.

853
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:13,792
I'm probably not the only one
having a hard time. I need to endure it.

854
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,126
Okay, let's go with that.

855
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,047
They were really close.

856
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,552
Now,

857
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:29,432
judges, please announce the result.

858
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,979
For this one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle,

859
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,022
the winner is…

860
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:42,487
As you probably saw,
it was a really difficult decision.

861
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,536
The winner of this one-on-one
Life-or-Death Battle is…

862
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,292
Chef Choi Kang-rok.

863
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,086
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

864
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:01,089
CHOI KANG-ROK ADVANCES TO THE TOP 7

865
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:08,054
He took something
that could never take center stage

866
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,223
and turned that potato
into the star of the dish.

867
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:12,600
That idea really surprised me.

868
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,270
In such a short time
and with these ingredients,

869
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,313
he was able to create something new,

870
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,441
and the flavor lived up to it as well.

871
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,736
Chef Choi Kang-rok presented us
with that enjoyment,

872
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,030
so we gave him a few more points.

873
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,282
Eliminated chef, Kim Sung-woon,

874
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,534
please take your nameplate
and leave the kitchen.

875
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:39,419
It can't be helped.
The world of competition is unforgiving.

876
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,795
KIM SUNG-WOON ELIMINATED

877
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,715
I believe the right thing to do
is to humbly accept it.

878
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,384
I hope Chef Choi survives until the end

879
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,137
and wins the competition.

880
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,432
I think I got lucky.

881
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,892
For the next round too,

882
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:59,064
I'll go into it as if it were my last.

883
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:07,113
ONLY ONE SEAT REMAINS IN THE TOP 7

884
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,751
SON JONG-WON VS

885
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:23,129
CULINARY MONSTER

886
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,590
I think he's one
of the strongest candidates to win.

887
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:28,093
But when I see
the other contestants saying that,

888
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,638
they're all talented chefs themselves,

889
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,681
so I wondered why they were so afraid.

890
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,058
They're all strong contestants.

891
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,060
"But Chef Jong-won is especially strong."

892
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:40,021
"Among the remaining ten,
Chef Jong-won is the strongest by far."

893
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,147
That's not the case.

894
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,065
I'm confident.

895
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,358
Yes, I'm confident.

896
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:46,569
I'm going to give it everything I have

897
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,029
and compete without regrets.

898
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:52,575
I hope we can each showcase
an impressive dish we're satisfied with.

899
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,370
It'd be embarrassing as hell
to be judged on two terrible dishes.

900
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,081
The one-on-one Life-or-Death Battle

901
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,792
begins now!

902
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:04,587
Split them fifty-fifty?

903
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,007
-How many?
-Let's do a crab and a half each.

904
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,175
A crab and a half? Okay.

905
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,095
I'll cut one in half for you.

906
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,805
-Okay.
-Fifty-fifty.

907
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,227
-Caviar?
-I need some.

908
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,604
We both used crabs and caviar.

909
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,732
-Do you need celery?
-Walnuts… Yeah, just one.

910
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:25,733
You can take that one.

911
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,027
Almost all of them overlapped.

912
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,530
We just split the leftover ingredients
evenly in half.

913
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,007
We're using the same ingredients again,

914
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,301
so we at least have
an understanding of them.

915
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,052
It's better than nothing.

916
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,556
The most important thing was…

917
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,018
Sauces are really the essence of cooking.

918
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,436
They're the most basic element.

919
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,108
I'll be using snow crabs.

920
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,489
I'm going to use snow crab broth
to make a sauce.

921
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,453
Hello.

922
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,999
You're making something
entirely different from before.

923
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,584
I'm making a warm dish this time.

924
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,169
-A warm dish?
-Yes.

925
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:29,547
SON JONG-WON AND CULINARY MONSTER'S DISH
WALDORF SALAD

926
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,174
-Then, earlier…
-Yes?

927
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:34,177
You didn't discuss this dish
with Chef Son Jong-won at all?

928
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,013
No, we didn't discuss any hot dishes.

929
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,766
I have no idea
what Chef Son will make either.

930
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,519
Are you confident you can win?

931
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:43,728
I am.

932
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:45,438
All right.

933
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,858
-Are you sautéing it to make stock?
-Yes.

934
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,277
I'm making a hot dish this time.

935
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,821
-A hot… Really?
-Be careful.

936
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,454
You make sauces like this every round.

937
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,040
-I think you're very good at it.
-It's important.

938
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,876
I have to make the broth,
which forms the base.

939
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,712
You place great importance on the sauce.

940
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,674
I'm adding Champagne this time.

941
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,968
Cognac and Champagne?

942
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,389
Culinary Monster said he's confident
he can win. What do you think?

943
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,849
-We'll see when it's over.
-Is that so?

944
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,435
We'll have to see.
It takes more than just resolve.

945
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,572
The dish I'm preparing today is

946
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,283
grilled snow crab egg custard

947
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,618
with champagne sauce and caviar.

948
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,204
When I looked at the ingredients I had,

949
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,541
I thought it was the best combination.

950
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,711
That savory flavor you get
from grilled snow crab shells,

951
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,463
the smoothness of eggs,
the saltiness of caviar,

952
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,132
and the aroma of Champagne.

953
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,093
I wanted to present
a smooth, delicate taste.

954
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:03,516
CUSTARD
GENTLY COOKED MIXTURE OF EGG AND MILK

955
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,602
I use the snow crab sauce

956
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,479
and a bit of cream

957
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,108
to make the egg custard.

958
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,320
I grill the crab legs over charcoal

959
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,571
and pick out the meat.

960
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,037
I'm going to combine
the egg custard and snow crab meat.

961
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,795
Then, I'm going to steam it
in the oven until it's nice and soft.

962
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:42,055
I could see the oven was set to steam,

963
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,098
and I saw a plate inside,

964
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,643
so I knew it was steamed eggs.

965
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,645
No offense to Chef Jong-won,

966
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,230
but in that moment,
I felt confident I'd won.

967
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:55,026
Even though I was thinking that I'd won,
he's a close friend of mine,

968
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,071
so I thought,
"He should've done a different dish."

969
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,365
We're only making a single dish,

970
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,785
so I felt that first bite should
make them go, "That's f***ing good."

971
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:09,624
To do that, I need to use
that rich shellfish flavor of crab meat.

972
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:14,087
I decided to do a warm dish
that could immediately burst with flavor.

973
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,268
I'll be making dumplings with crab meat.

974
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,437
While using the same ingredients,

975
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,439
I wanted to create
completely different flavors.

976
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,859
The easiest way to think of it is
a Western version of xiaolongbao.

977
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:41,114
CHINESE DUMPLINGS KNOWN FOR
BURSTING WITH BROTH WHEN BITTEN INTO

978
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:44,075
I wanted to create
that sensation of the juices

979
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,618
bursting from within the dumpling

980
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,704
but with a creamy texture.

981
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,789
I add a bit of extra soft tofu,

982
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,458
a bit of butter,

983
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,253
and the rich, reduced snow crab broth.

984
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,423
Then, I blend them all together.

985
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,885
I emulsify the sauce

986
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,179
and add the crab meat.

987
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:10,059
The dumpling filling isn't made
of solids like meat, tofu, or kimchi

988
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,521
but with runny,
liquid-like ingredients instead,

989
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:17,358
so the key was filling
the dumplings with that broth.

990
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:32,123
When you bite into the dumpling,
it's supposed to burst with crab broth.

991
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,427
When I tasted what I had made…

992
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,640
it was pretty good.

993
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,899
To be honest,
I'm not sure what dish he made.

994
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,235
I didn't pay much attention to it.
Not really.

995
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,279
I was just focused on my own dish.

996
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:11,788
I thought it would come down
to taste in the end.

997
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,830
Twelve minutes.

998
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,042
It was important to keep tasting it.

999
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,549
I think it came out really well.

1000
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,093
I kept thinking about what sauce
and what flavor I could add

1001
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,471
to really elevate the dish.

1002
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,142
I took Champagne

1003
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,728
to make a Champagne sauce.

1004
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,815
Caviar and Champagne pair well together,

1005
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,859
and Champagne has a lovely aroma.

1006
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,991
I'll be reducing it with cream
to concentrate that flavor.

1007
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,622
Then I'll blend it all together.

1008
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,833
The highlight of my dish is the balance.

1009
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,000
When you take a bite of it,

1010
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,502
there's a certain fullness to it.

1011
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:00,586
It's so well-balanced,

1012
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,421
and they'll instantly think
it's delicious.

1013
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,092
You don't know
how it tastes until you try it.

1014
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:10,513
So I decided to
complete the dish and taste it.

1015
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:11,931
TURNING CHAMPAGNE SAUCE INTO FOAM

1016
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,976
I wanted to perfect it until the very end,

1017
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,687
so I kept tasting it.

1018
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,398
I added some lime juice as well.

1019
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,485
I kept adding elements to elevate
the flavor on the first bite.

1020
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,489
I wanted the flavor
to just burst inside the mouth.

1021
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,700
That's the dish I was aiming for.

1022
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:38,082
New ideas were added
to what I had planned,

1023
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,126
so it kept getting upgraded.

1024
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,627
I was quite pleased with it.

1025
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,642
When Chef Son plates his dishes,

1026
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,896
he's very strategic
and detailed in his approach.

1027
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:05,526
My strength is in balancing
and bringing out flavors.

1028
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,528
I think I'm pretty good at that.

1029
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,282
On their own,
I thought the snow crab dumplings

1030
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:13,826
may have lacked a bit of impact.

1031
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,497
So, I used caviar to add some saltiness.

1032
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:25,963
And on the bottom, I placed a relish
made with apples and celery

1033
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:29,800
to give that sharp,
yet tangy and sweet note to the dish.

1034
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:32,428
The crab meat dumpling
was going to be quite rich,

1035
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:35,139
so I made the relish to balance it out.

1036
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,515
The sauce I used on top

1037
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,268
was a sabayon sauce made with Champagne.

1038
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:43,314
I added egg yolk, Champagne,

1039
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:48,027
and the snow crab broth.

1040
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:53,157
Caviar pairs really well
with mild-flavored ingredients,

1041
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,742
like dairy or eggs.

1042
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,413
The relish at the bottom, the dumpling
on top, and the sabayon sauce.

1043
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,083
I guess you could say
they taste very sharp.

1044
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,752
Each ingredient stands out,

1045
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:09,799
so anyone tasting this dish will know
if they taste apple or snow crab.

1046
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:24,855
I kept telling myself
to stay focused until the very end.

1047
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,150
I wanted to accomplish
everything I had intended to do.

1048
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,071
What matters most is doing your best.

1049
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:43,290
It features that contrast
between the smooth eggs,

1050
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,001
salty crabs, and caviar.

1051
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:48,462
There's a softness
brought out by the contrast.

1052
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,672
SNOW CRAB SAUCE

1053
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:53,801
I also added some croutons for balance.

1054
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,013
Rather than have a main ingredient,

1055
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,515
I wanted all the elements to shine.

1056
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,558
LIME ZEST

1057
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:04,729
Things like the aroma of lime zest
or the flavor of lime juice.

1058
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:12,278
I did exactly as I'd intended,
and that was the most satisfying part.

1059
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,206
Hello.

1060
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,293
The dish I prepared today is

1061
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,711
crab meat dumplings.

1062
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,840
There's crab broth inside.

1063
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:35,676
I blended it with extra soft tofu
to add some creaminess

1064
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,845
and mixed in crab meat as well.

1065
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:40,306
And I prepared a sabayon sauce.

1066
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:42,933
Scoop from the bottom
and eat it in one bite.

1067
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:43,976
-In one bite?
-Yes.

1068
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,732
Will it burst like xiaolongbao?

1069
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:51,609
-I hope so.
-You do? Okay.

1070
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,820
-So it's supposed to burst?
-Yes, it's supposed to burst.

1071
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,032
Like this? In one go?

1072
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,586
-Where was the Champagne used?
-In the sabayon.

1073
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,213
Champagne Sabayon.

1074
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,514
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1075
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,820
So, I used snow crabs.

1076
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:21,448
I prepared a snow crab custard
with Champagne foam

1077
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:25,161
and snow crab sauce with caviar.

1078
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:29,039
Please enjoy the balance of the crab,
caviar, Champagne sauce, and egg

1079
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,666
as you taste it.

1080
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:37,047
Take half the caviar with a spoon.

1081
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,091
-All in one bite?
-Yes, that's right.

1082
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,634
-I'll go first.
-You go first.

1083
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:43,948
They tasted it several times.

1084
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,866
I couldn't tell if it was
because it was good

1085
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,743
or if they weren't sure about it.

1086
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,462
What's inside the egg custard?

1087
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,798
Eggs, crab broth,

1088
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:02,883
a bit of cream, and a bit of milk.

1089
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,802
-So you made a broth and…
-Yes.

1090
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,178
I used that as the base.

1091
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:08,639
Thank you for your dish.

1092
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,352
It is time for the two judges

1093
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:16,438
to decide on a survivor.

1094
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:49,972
Judges, please announce the result.

1095
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,476
I chose…

1096
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:04,403
Chef Son Jong-won.

1097
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:07,865
PAIK JONG-WON
SON JONG-WON

1098
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:10,075
Chef Son Jong-won.

1099
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:13,370
It was a bit unexpected.

1100
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:17,541
When I saw his steamed eggs,
I thought I'd win for certain.

1101
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:19,710
Personally, I felt there was
a bit of a contrast.

1102
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:22,796
One dish had bold, sharp flavors,

1103
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,507
whereas the other one had
a gently seasoned flavor.

1104
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,259
Along with that gentle flavor,

1105
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,262
I thought the flavor of the crab
should shine through naturally,

1106
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,390
so I chose Chef Son Jong-won's dish.

1107
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,316
I chose…

1108
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:51,617
I chose…

1109
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:59,249
What bothered me the most…
And this is seriously just a tiny detail.

1110
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,877
This isn't even
a hair's breadth of a difference.

1111
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,089
By a seriously fine margin, I chose…

1112
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,770
