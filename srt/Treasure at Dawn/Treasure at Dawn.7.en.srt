in such a place where the sun doesn't shine,

00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,490
we'll catch a fatal chill.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,050
Be careful; they might kill to silence.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,210
Then say we committed suicide out of guilt.

All thanks to your training, Chairman.

I've already removed your slave status.

I don't want to see you in Xichuan again.

I won't leave.

52
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,630
So you wish to die?

53
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,150
It's precisely because I don't want to die

54
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,790
that I can't leave.

55
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,870
I'm afraid as soon as I leave Xichuan,

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,870

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,220
I could have done it here in Xichuan.

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,830
Yes, of course.

But killing me

63
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,870
would cause you trouble.

It's not worth it.

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,900
You flatter yourself.

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,390
I'm not overestimating myself.

67
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,390
After all,

68
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,550
I've been a horse slave of Song Jingye

69
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,070
for many years.

70
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,180
He just died,

71
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,070
and if I were to die now,

72
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,980
certain people

73
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,790
would definitely make connections

74
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,900
between these two deaths.

75
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,550
The dead don't speak,

76
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,940
but if someone investigates this thread,

77
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,070
it could lead back to you.

78
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,150
And then...

79
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,260
Are you threatening me?

80
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,150
I wouldn't dare, sir!

81
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,070
But if it because of my worthless life

82
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,630
that affects your future a bit,

83
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,420
it would be a net loss!

84
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,390
So, going by that logic,

85
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,180
I should keep you alive.

86
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,390
Me staying alive

87
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,870
won't cause you any trouble.

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,590
And

89
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,870
I can still be of use to you.

90
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,590
So tell me,

91
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,150
what do you want to do?

92
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,870
Whatever you need,

93
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,030
I can do it.

95
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,390

96
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,350
Yes.

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,390
But, Chairman Li,

102
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,700
I think he's blind.

103
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,460

are mostly useless.

110
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,590
If he had asked me more,

111
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,630
I might have thought more highly of him.

112
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,590
That's why he's not as good as you.

113
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,660
This servile dog looks meek,

114
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,420
like this quail,

115
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,260
but once he goes mad,

116
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,390
he's like a rabid dog.

117
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,030

119
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,940
he's still just a plaything in your hands.

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm hungry.

140
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,760
By your outfit, I see,

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,450
you hold some status.

142

Maybe you can help us get out.

143
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,890
Speaking of which, to be honest,

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,370
I've recently received good news.

145
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,800
I've been promoted to carriage steward at the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

146

My benefactor,

147
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,210
aren't you going to congratulate me?

148
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,760
That's true,

149
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,130
I really should congratulate you.

150
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,240
But it seems like

151
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,280
you're not too happy about it.

152
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,210
It cost me a life,

153
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,760
for the position of a carriage steward.

154
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,280
After all,

155
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,130
it's just a job managing horses.

What does it matter, steward or horse manager?

That makes sense!

164
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,800
For those words,

165
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,130
let's toast.

166
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,890
May you find peace on your journey!

Ominous.

168
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,130
I once said,

169
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,080
if one day I rise high

170
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,320
and you fall on hard times,

171
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,520
I would definitely save you.

172
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,730
But things don't always go as planned.

173
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,210
Now you are in trouble,

174
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,410
and I am just a minor steward.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,280
In the commerce, nobody listens to me.

176
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,840
However,

177
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,950
if you know someone else,

178
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,930
that is a high-ranking official,

179
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,320
just tell me,

180
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,240
and I will definitely

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,840
convey your message.

She and the two of us share a life-and-death bond.

190
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,200
Alright.

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,810
My benefactor,

192
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,560
because you saved my life,

193
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,850
I'd go through fire and water for you.

194
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,490
I'll definitely deliver your message.

195
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:08,800
Good.

196
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,120
[Lord's Mansion]

197
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,930
What do you want?

198
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,680
Sir,

199
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,720
could you please inform the Young Mistress,

200
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,930
the carriage steward of Jibei Chamber of Commerce wishes a meet?

201
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,770
The Young Mistress is not seeing anyone.

202
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,930
You haven't informed her yet.

203
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,560
How do you know she won't see me?

204
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,860
Our Young Mistress is the second most noble person

205
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,920
in the entire Xichuan City.

206
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,740
How could she know someone like you?

207
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,970
Get lost!

208
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,200
Sir,

209
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,680
I really have something urgent for the Young Mistress.

210
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,120
Please inform her.

211
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,850
Please.

212
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,890
Get going.

213
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,120
You're just a stable hand.

214
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,810
How dare you come to the Lord's Mansion acting important?

215
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:48,770
Get out!

216
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,080
Out!

217
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,410
Who are you?

218
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,560
Here to see the Young Mistress?

219
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,890
It's nothing.

220
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,910
Nothing.

221
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:15,820
[Lord's Mansion]

222
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,000
Miss, I bought your favorite snacks.

223
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,640
Miss, where are you going?

224
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,440
Just now, Jiu said

225
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,600
Fu Sheng and Gu Tian were captured.

226
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,410
I need to find my father.

227
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,480
Here, give it to me.

228
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,640
These two,

229
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,920
are the ones who killed the Chairman Song.

230
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,920
Today,

231
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,170
in front of all the brothers,

232
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,480
we'll give justice to the Chairman.

233
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,000
Behead them.

234
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,100
[Command]

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,640
They're about to be beheaded, how terrifying.

236
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,480
Mr. Wen, what's the meaning of this?

237
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,520
You want to execute them without even a trial?

238
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Vice Chairman Li,

239
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,250
aren't you being a bit too hasty?

240
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,330
We have both witnesses and evidence.

241
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,720
The proofs are solid.

242
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,970
What's the point of trial?

243
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,040
Since the evidence are solid,

244
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,490
why not,

245
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,520
show them to everyone?

246
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,330
First,

247
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,640
these two can die with clarity.

248
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,680
Second,

249
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,000
it'll also prevent any misunderstanding that Vice Chairman Li

250
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,120
is eager to execute

251
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,750
for some other reasons.

252
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,160
Then let's do as Mr. Wen suggests.

253
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,680
Qin Shi.

254
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,640
Mr. Wen.

255
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,560
I am Qin Shi,

256
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,410
the personal guard of Chairman Song.

257
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,850
That night,

258
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,330
these two were sneakily following Chairman Song.

259
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,520
I stopped them near the Lin's Mansion.

260
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,120
But shortly after,

261
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,680
at the Lin's Mansion,

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,290
I was drugged and knocked out.

263
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,680
Then Chairman Song,

264
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,200
was killed.

265
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,080
This Fu Sheng,

266
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,160
previously cured the poison of Xiangshui Lake.

267
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,520
He's an expert in herbs.

268
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,970
If it wasn't him,

269
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,850
then who could it be?

270
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,520
Is there any other evidences?

271
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,850
Present the physical evidence.

272
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,160
This is the murder weapon found at the scene.

273
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,410
What does this mean?

274
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,370
Take it.

275
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,370
I believe trouble clings to you.

276
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,970
We just arrived in Xichuan,

277
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,250
haven't even entered the gate,

278
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,530
and you've caused a such trouble.

279
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,160
If Wen Jue hadn't arrived in time,

280
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,000
we would have died here.

281
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,970
The Three Heroes of Xichuan.

282
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,970
Tell everyone,

283
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,370
where have you seen this?

284
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,370
Speak!

285
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,290
The Fortune Inn.

286
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,200
Both the witnesses and physical evidence are present.

287
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,370
Is Mr. Wen satisfied now?

288
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,330
Nonsense!

289
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,000
This dagger is mine.

290
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,720
It was a gift from Fu Sheng.

291
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,000
Father,

292
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,930
you must tell them.

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,810
Indeed,

294
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,600
this dagger

295
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,720
was indeed gifted to my daughter by Physician Fu.

296
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,450
However, as I've always disliked her handling weapons,

297
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,770
I took it away and discarded it.

298
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,040
Never did I imagine it would appear at the scene of the crime.

299
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,000
Vice Chairman Li,

300
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,160
this time

301
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,120
you've really arrested the wrong person.

302
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,030
It seems Lord Wen

303
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,250
is determined to protect the murderers.

304
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,250
Since neither the witnesses nor material evidence counts,

305
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,890
then

306
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,160
it wouldn't be right to convict easily.

307
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,970
How about this,

308
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,000
from now on,

309
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,770
my Lord's Mansion

310
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,160
will issue a bounty notice

311
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,000
together with Jibei Chamber of Commerce to capture the real murderer.

312
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,450
And give Chairman Song justice.

313
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,490
As for

314
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,750
these two

315
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,120
injured by Vice Chairman Li by mistake,

316
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,970
I will make decisions on their behalf.

317
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,200
They are not allowed

318
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,490
to pursue the responsibility further.

319
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,810
Alright,

320
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,330
since the matter is resolved,

321
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,640
we won't hold up Vice Chairman Li any longer.

322
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
We'll be leaving now.

323
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,370
Let's go.

324
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,720
What's wrong, Father?

325
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,250
We'll talk back at home.

326
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:36,930
Alright.

327
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:39,970
Take them away.

328
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,490
Physician Fu!

329
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,520
Thank you.

330
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,900
[Lord's Mansion]

331
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,810
How is my father?

332
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,770
Inserting the needle at the Baihui point

333
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,160
can unblock the Yin and Yang meridians,

334
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,850
connecting all the vital points throughout the body.

335
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
And combined with the acupuncture at Stomach 36 point,

336
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,530
Spleen 6 and Large Intestine 4 Point,

337
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,690
lord's headaches can be temporarily alleviated.

338
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,450
Fu Sheng,

339
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,290
including this time,

340
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,080
I have saved your life twice.

341
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,490
I ask for nothing else,

342
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,560
only that you save my father's life in return.

343
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,560
Do you understand?

344
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,010
I understand.

345
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,560
I will do my utmost.

346
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,010
However,

347
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,290
I don't know

348
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,240
the root of the city lord's illness.

349
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,640
So,

350
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,370
I'm not sure if I can help.

351
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,010
Jue.

352
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,080
Father.

353
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,560
How is it?

354
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
I'm much better now.

355
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,680
Go and make arrangements

356
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,490
to properly host Physician Fu.

357
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,640
Okay.

358
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,890
How long do I have to live?

359
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,600
From the pulse,

360
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,450
at most thirty days.

361
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,770
I have sought famous doctors all over the world

362
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,600
and they all gave me the same prognosis.

363
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,000
Do you have any solutions?

364
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,210
If my master were here,

365
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,560
maybe he would have one.

366
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,680
I heard from Jue that

367
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,000
you studied under Hua Yuanhua,

368
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,890
no wonder at such a young age

369
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,890
your medical skills are so advanced.

370
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,000
So, if you were to do it yourself,

371
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,810
do you have confidence?

372
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,160
I can only

373
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,960
try my best.

374
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,140
Fu Sheng,

375
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,900
including this time,

376
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,630
I have saved your life twice.

377
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,190
I ask for nothing else,

378
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,270
only that you save my father's life in return.

379
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,270
Do you understand?

380
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,170
I have sought famous doctors all over the world

381
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,970
and they all gave me the same prognosis.

382
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,900
Do you have any solutions?

383
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,250
If my master were here,

384
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,510
maybe he would have one.

385
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,410
[Treat with acupuncture...]

386
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,130
[Dissect the cadaver for closer inspection]

387
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,190
Fu Sheng.

388
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,070
What are you doing so late?

389
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,220
Don't speak.

390
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,660
I'm busy.

391
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,780
Almost there.

392
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,020
Where are you going?

393
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,070
Wait for me for a while.

394
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,950
I didn't expect you to be good at cooking.

395
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,220
I practiced it.

396
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,780
Do you have to practice cooking as you're a physician?

397
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,710
I accidentally killed a lot of animals

398
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,340
to study medicine.

399
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,190
I didn't want to waste them.

400
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,020
So...

401
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,630
What did I just eat?

402
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,430
That's the pork you saw when you walked in.

403
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,900
You're the first person to let me eat that.

404
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,270
Don't worry.

405
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,630
I've cleaned it up.

406
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,590
Anyway,

407
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,900
what do you want to see me about?

408
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,660
Well.

409
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,100
When will you treat my father?

410
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,750
I

411
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,460
was working on it.

412
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,340
But

413
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,220
I still haven't figured it out.

414
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,510
It's been so long.

415
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,750
You still haven't figured it out.

416
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,460
The medical skills are broad and profound.

417
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,900
If you want to save people,

418
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,980
it takes time.

419
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,950
Maybe it's because you're too stupid.

420
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,830
I'm stupid?

421
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,190
My master never said I was stupid.

422
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,960
He said I was a genius.

423
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,190
That's because your master didn't meet me.

424
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,460
If I had studied medicine,

425
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,740
I would have been much better than you.

426
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,790
No way.

427
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,220
Let's find out.

428
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,070
Will you learn?

429
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,550
Just teach me.

430
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,980
I can teach you now.

431
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,100
Go ahead. I'm listening.

432
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,980
Well.

433
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,310
It's a joke.

434
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,860
Do you really want to study medicine?

435
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,030
All right.

436
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,190
Listen and study hard.

437
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,710
The medical skills are broad and profound.

438
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,790
One wrong step leads to another.

439
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,830
That way,

440
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
instead of saving people,

441
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,340
you'll kill them.

442
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,100
Got it. Let's get started.

443
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,830
Listen carefully.

444
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,030
Medical practice means

445
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,070
are complex.

446
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,460
Pulse feeling is the most important one.

447
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,190
You can start with the pulse.

448
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,500
The pulse beats the same as the heart.

449
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,710
A normal person's pulse beats 60 to 100 times

450
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,030
every 15 breaths.

451
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,220
The elderly have a slower pulse.

452
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,500
It beats 55 to 60 times.

453
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,190
The child's pulse

454
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,830
beats faster.

455
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,580
It beats more than a hundred times.

456
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,220
However, the heartbeats and pulses

457
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,620
of people who are sick and dying

458
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,460
are obviously different

459
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,580
from those of normal people.

460
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,220
Really?

461
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,030
Absolutely.

462
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,740
Have a try.

463
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,710
Use three fingers.

464
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,070
Right.

465
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,980
Your heart is beating faster.

466
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,030
Well.

467
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,100
This is the basic content.

468
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,950
I'll list some books for you.

469
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,910
You should study hard.

470
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,860
I'll check on your studies.

471
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,310
Why is my pulse getting faster?

472
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,830
Palpitation?

473
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,670
It's impossible.

474
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,990
I didn't eat anything wrong.

475
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,340
How could I get palpitations?

476
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,940
This is the place I imagined.

477
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,150
Why is there someone else's voice?

478
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,630
Am I crazy?

479
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,340
[Longdan, Herba Lophatheri, Semen Strychni]

00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,660
What are you looking at?

483

Duck.

484
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,150
How can you speak?

485
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,220
You imagined everything in here.

486
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,240
Why are you asking me?

487
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,670
No.

488
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,320
No.

489
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,830
I didn't cure my palpitations.

490
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,030
Now I've lost my mind.

491
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,470
You can imagine a duck talking.

492
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,590
You're going to go crazy.

493
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,670
I think I can heal myself.

494
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,860
I'm sorry, it's so itchy.

495
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,430
I couldn't help myself.

496
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,790
Wood...

497
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:09,670
Man?

498
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,310
There's more?

499
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,460
There's less than half here.

500
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,830
They're still bringing in the books.

501
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,980
Princess, why do you need so many medical books?

502
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,790
Is this to cure the lord?

503
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,980
Yeah.

504
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,980
My father is sick.

505
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,500
I can't put all the pressure

506
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,740
on Fu Sheng.

507
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,380
Look.

508
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,380
Here's the list he gave me.

509
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,670
I don't believe

510
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,830
I can't do

511
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,790
what he can.

512
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,460
You're a filial daughter.

513
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,460
If the lord knows it, he'll be pleased.

514
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,780
I didn't expect

515
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,290
that I would have to memorize so many books to study medicine.

516
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,380
So,

517
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,260
according to our analysis,

518
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,620
I am not crazy.

519
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,380
I was deeply influenced by others,

520
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,510
so I involuntarily made you up

521
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,910
in my mind.

522
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,070
I think that's the case.

523
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,860
Otherwise, you can't explain

524
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,830
why I sound

525
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,070
like Wen Jue,

526
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,860
and Wood sounds

00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,310
like Gu Tian.

528
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,460
Wood?

529
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,030
It should have a name.

530
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
What's your name?

531
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,490
Duck.

532
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,380
You're so wooden.

533
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,740
No.

534
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,740
I've really lost my mind.

535
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,630
I'd better go to bed.

536
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,710
I should be fine when I wake up.

537
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,910
All right. Come in.

538
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,710
I know you're being forced.

Leader.

541

Leader.

542
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,670
From now on,

543
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,340
as long as you follow me

544
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,070
and do not betray me,

00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,310

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,710
in Xichuan,

547
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,030
I'll share it with you.

00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,190
Thank you, leader.

549
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,710
Leader, is it comfortable?

550
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,190
Not bad.

It's good to have you back.

Physician Fu.

555
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,030
Go check on him.

556
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,910
I brought a roasted lamb leg for you.

557
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,310
I didn't protect you in vain.

558
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,100
You thought about me.

559
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,380
I'm starving.

560
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,860
Don't just look at it. Eat it.

561
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,980
The lamb is disgusting when it's cold.

562
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,710
Look at it's outside.

563
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,670
It's like a dry corpse.

564
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,550
I don't want to eat it.

565
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,310
It looks good.

566
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,260
You don't appreciate good food.

567
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,830
All right.

568
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,030
Don't eat it.

569
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,430
It's always better than nothing.

570
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,030
I'll have a taste.

571
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,970
Fu Sheng.

572
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,780
Who did you give the dagger

573
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,740
I gave you?

574
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,420
[City God Temple]

575
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,820
Stop.

576
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,150
Don't run.

577
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,080
Did you give the dagger I gave you

578
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,080
to this cutie?

579
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,220
I'm not cutie.

580
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,260
I'm chubby.

581
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,490
I don't care if you're cutie or chubby.

582
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,910
Since you didn't run,

583
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,190
take your lumps.

584
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,950
Go.

585
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,020
I'll take you to the official.

586
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,430
Wait.

587
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,760
No rush.

588
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,910
I have questions for him.

589
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,820
Hulu.

590
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,190
Let me ask you something.

591
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,500
Why does Li Zhizhuo

592
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,590
have the dagger I gave you?

593
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,430
You harassed my sister.

594
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,820
I'll teach you a lesson.

595
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,540
Looks like I was overthinking.

596
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,430
What?

597
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,290
I thought it was a trap.

598
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,220
I didn't expect it to be you.

599
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,020
You...

600
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,710
You harassed my sister.

601
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,870
That's what happened.

602
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,870
I was afraid I couldn't make it clear.

603
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,780
So I ran away.

604
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,740
I didn't expect you to be considered murderers.

605
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,910
Hand me over to the Chamber of Commerce.

606
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,220
Or you can take me to the official.

607
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,630
I beg you to take care of my sister.

608
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,630
Don't let her be harassed again.

609
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,670
Forget it.

610
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,020
Wait. Where are you going?

611
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,630
You're not going to take him to the official, right?

612
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,980
When I saw him, I thought of Gu Bao and Gu Liang.

613
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,780
Forget it.

614
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,300
He didn't mean it.

615
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,630
You don't think Hulu is the murderer, right?

616
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,900
Even if he had a peerless knife,

617
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,350
he couldn't kill Song Jingye.

618
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,350
Your dagger is not peerless.

619
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,540
That's why you just gave it away?

620
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,540
Just give me a casual apology,

621
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,060
and I'll forgive you.

622
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,870
Wait.

623
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,390
What's wrong?

624
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,540
Song Jingye died mysteriously.

625
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,150
Am I missing something?

626
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,980
Think about it.

627
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,060
What am I missing?

628
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,300
Have you been thinking about this?

629
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,060
Haven't we been talking about this all the time?

630
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,590
I need to investigate further.

631
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,350
Are you coming?

632
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,740
No.

633
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,260
Fine.

634
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,710
What's the fuss?

00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,950
Fu Sheng.

636
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,500
From now on,

637
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,350
we'll go

Before I leave,

641
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,300
I have to earn some money.

642
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,740
It's weird.

643
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,940
There was a monkey.

644
