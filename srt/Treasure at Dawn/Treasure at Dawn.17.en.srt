00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,930
So this is...

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,360
Yeah.

194
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,630
You and me.

195
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,200
[Lord's Mansion]

196
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,750
Father.

197
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,510
Father.

198
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,730
Father.

199
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,180
What's the matter?

200
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,770
You've been so wild all day.

201
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,270
Look, you scared all my fish away.

202
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,610
Why did you ask Jiu to arrest Fang Zhiyuan?

203
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,450
Are you being foolish?

204
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,560
Fang Zhiyuan

205
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,080
is old and weak,

206
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,930
so he must not be the real killer.

207
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,380
Jue, come on.

208
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,300
Look at the fish in the pond.

209
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,870
The big fish eat the small fish, and the small fish eat the mud.

210
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,560
They kill each other every day,

211
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,110
so do you know

212
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,990
how we can quell this fight?

213
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,230
We just have to eat the big fish.

214
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,400
That's right,

215
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,960
but not totally right.

216
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,380
The only way to quell this fight

217
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,880
is to equalize the size of the fish

218
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,870
in order to get peace

219
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,320
and tranquility.

220
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,140
Is that different from what I said?

221
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,940
Why am I wrong?

222
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,040
The key is not to keep the big fish or the small fish

223
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,510
but the balance.

224
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,140
As long as the balance is achieved,

225
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
even if the small fish are eaten and the big fish survive,

226
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,040
the effect will be the same.

227
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,680
But what does this have to do with Fang Zhiyuan?

228
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,970
Balance is only the first step.

229
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,350
Even if the size of the fish is the same,

230
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,690
you will find that in a short time,

231
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,820
they will still be fighting each other.

232
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,280
Do you know why?

233
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,560
They are equal in strength,

234
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,870
but there is a limited amount of fish food,

235
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,100
and each fish receives unequal food,

236
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,230
so the balance will naturally be upset.

237
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,960
You're smart, Jue.

238
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,200
That's right.

239
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:31,870
Come on.

240
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,320
Now, the Three Heroes of Xichuan died bizarrely.

241
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,680
So far,

242
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,400
there have been four murders

243
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,400
and six deaths in Xichuan,

244
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,990
involving the Chamber of Commerce, Ma Gang, wealthy merchants, and bandits.

245
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,320
The forces that were in balance

246
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,960
have gone to war because of the chaos

247
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,710
created by a storyteller.

248
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,320
If we can't find the truth in time,

249
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,590
how can we quell the civil disorder?

250
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,990
We can't stand by and watch them

251
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,470
fight to the death

252
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,960
and spill over to the innocent people.

253
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,470
Fish food

254
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,920
is just a reason to fight.

255
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,830
So, father, you know he's not the real killer,

256
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,830
but you just want the fish food back

257
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,610
so that the source of the chaos disappears, right?

258
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,560
This is the way of balance

259
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,040
and the only way for Lord's Mansion

260
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,080
to protect the people in the midst of multiple forces.

261
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,720
You're wrong.

262
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,600
Even if Fang Zhiyuan is gone,

263
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,900
they can create other similar people

264
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,470
to make a reason to fight

265
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,510
as long as they want,

266
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,920
but Fang Zhiyuan, as the people of Xichuan,

267
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,440
should be protected by Lord's Mansion.

268
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,440
As the next Lord,

269
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,400
I cannot sit back and watch

270
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,710
Fang Zhiyuan die a worthless death.

271
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,440
Jue.

272
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,560
I'm impressed with you today.

273
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,960
Come on. Tell me.

274
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,280
What do you want?

275
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,870
I have two demands.

276
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,920
First,

277
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,200
release Fang Zhiyuan.

278
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,230
Second,

279
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,800
give me ten days

280
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,040
to get this done.

281
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,680
Tomorrow.

282
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,200
I'll find a reason to release Fang Zhiyuan tomorrow,

283
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,040
but I'll only give you seven days

284
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,630
because you're my daughter.

285
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,870
After seven days, if you can't do it,

286
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,200
I'll order Fang Zhiyuan to be killed.

287
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,440
I can only warn the people

288
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,080
by solving the trouble

289
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,350
with such cruelty.

290
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,630
I told you not to be so high-profile,

291
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,630
but you've still gotten yourselves into trouble.

292
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,160
You've worked with me for so long,

293
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,580
but why haven't you learned

294
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,230
any of my wisdom?

295
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,160
I value friendship.

296
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,680
Since you've worked with me,

297
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,630
you needn't worry about running out of wine at every festival.

298
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,470
Fu Sheng.

299
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,590
Look at this.

300
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,540
Hey.

301
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,750
Are you gonna put it in your mouth again?

302
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,470
It's knockout drops.

303
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,560
Who served the wine?

304
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,810
A maid named Cui.

305
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,400
Where is she?

306
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,280
She was here a moment ago.

307
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,350
Cui.

308
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,830
Cui, why are you running?

309
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,320
After her.

310
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,510
Wen Jue.

311
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,680
We were just here,

312
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,540
but why did you leave again?

313
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,000
There's a girl

314
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,780
in pink named Cui.

315
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,510
We must find her.

316
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:16,830
Okay.

317
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,470
We can't go after her like this.

318
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:27,960
Let's split up.

319
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,110
You guys go over there.

320
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,680
OK.

321
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,320
You guys go over there.

322
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,560
Fu Sheng, come with me.

323
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,510
What's going on?

324
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,080
Why are there so many Cui suddenly?

325
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,320
She replicated herself

326
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,680
and hired a few people to impersonate her.

327
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,800
What now?

328
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,250
We'd rather catch the wrong person than let them go.

329
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,920
Split up and chase her.

330
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,160
Get out of the way.

331
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,470
Stop right there!

332
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,680
You killed an innocent man.

333
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
This is a capital offense.

334
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,920
Surrender now.

335
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,320
You're hurt.

336
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,750
I'll take you to the clinic.

337
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,920
Let's go.

338
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,870
Okay.

339
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,470
Okay.

340
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
Pervert.

341
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,040
Someone molested me

342
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,470
in broad daylight.

343
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,580
[Wenfu Hall]

344
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,890
I'm going to take out the arrow.

345
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,110
Hold it.

346
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,320
Hold it.

347
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,230
Don't move.

348
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,560
How is she?

349
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,640
She's fine,

350
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,680
but she can't fight in a few days.

351
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,800
Help her rest over there.

352
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,630
Come on.

353
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,590
Be careful.

354
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,750
What do you think about the escaped Cui?

355
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,510
We were splitting up to track her today,

356
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,160
but we all ran into different kinds of trouble on the way,

357
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,710
so we must have missed something during that.

358
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,550
For example,

359
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,990
what kind of person do you think would kill someone?

360
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,840
Anyone

361
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,470
could do that.

362
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,160
That's the problem.

363
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,200
We all thought that anyone

364
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,920
who could commit such a big crime

365
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,270
must not be an ordinary person,

366
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,790
but we were wrong.

367
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,600
Anyone could have done it.

368
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,440
We can't go on like this.

369
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,920
We can't keep being led by the nose.

370
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,840
I have an idea.

371
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,710
I've always hated those of you

372
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,880
who run pawn shops.

373
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Other people have credibility,

374
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
but you guys

375
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,600
are always bullying.

376
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,200
He has something to say.

377
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,400
These pawn shop owners

378
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,690
never tell the truth,

379
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,840
so I've got to make him think twice.

380
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,680
Give me another one.

381
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,030
Not challenging.

382
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,030
It's a lot more fun.

383
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,750
Boring.

384
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,550
Sir.

385
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,400
I checked your ledgers.

386
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,880
That gold frame glass mirror

387
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
only cost you 800 coins,

388
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,120
which isn't even enough for a goat.

389
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,030
The merchant, however desperate for money,

390
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,120
could not have sold it for so little.

391
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,200
I'll say. I'll say it all.

392
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,640
Those things

393
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,990
are stolen.

394
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,550
Everyone in Xichuan has different skills.

395
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,180
Is a piece of stolen property

396
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,120
worth hiding?

397
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,400
How could someone making Night Owl do this

398
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
be an ordinary person?

399
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,680
I'm just afraid

400
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,380
of getting in trouble.

401
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,070
Still lying to me?

402
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,880
I'm not.

403
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,980
Night Owl

404
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,060
sold that thing for only 800 coins?

405
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,030
Is he stupid

406
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,160
or am I?

407
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,120
He didn't sell it.

408
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,710
His apprentice did.

409
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,600
His apprentice.

410
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,880
His apprentice?

411
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,930
Are you sure?

412
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:47,840
Yes.

413
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,400
His apprentice knows an employee

414
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,790
of my shop

415
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,200
and has pawned

416
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,600
a lot of stuff for Night Owl.

417
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,630
That's him.

418
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,460
When he

419
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,880
brought that item in,

420
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,310
I knew at a glance

421
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,690
he had it stashed away,

422
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,610
so

423
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,490
I made a lowball offer in bad conscience.

424
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,700
Stop right there.

425
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,070
What about that employee?

426
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,520
I kicked him out

427
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,880
after the warehouse burned down.

428
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,710
What's wrong?

429
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,860
No wonder that glass mirror was placed

430
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,550
right where direct sunlight could reach it

431
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,750
and that it so coincidentally ignited the silk cloth.

432
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,540
I'll inform Fu Sheng.

433
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,680
You go to Wen Jue.

434
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,600
Fu Sheng's suspicions were right.

435
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,840
Okay, let's go.

436
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,120
Oh, my God.

437
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,470
Young Mistress.

438
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,880
Madam has no desire to see guests today.

439
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Please forgive her.

440
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,880
This is the cook you were looking for.

441
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,510
You're alive. That's great.

442
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,960
I thought you'd been killed

443
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,650
by the Lei family to vent their anger.

444
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,920
Young Mistress, it was my fault.

445
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,680
Luckily, Madam was generous enough

446
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,310
to spare my life.

447
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,120
We are not murderous people,

448
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,500
and Master's death

449
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,560
was God's will.

450
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,280
He did it unintentionally.

451
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,860
He was not at fault.

452
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,890
God's will?

453
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,640
Now it's not, I'm afraid.

454
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,120
Young Mistress, what do you mean?

455
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,990
Mr. Lei's death was indeed a coincidence,

456
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,470
but now we suspect

457
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,750
that all these coincidences are man-made.

458
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,710
We are checking them one by one.

459
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,790
For example, when the caravan

460
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,710
returned that day,

461
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,630
why did you happen to prepare

462
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,760
so much green bean soup?

463
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,150
As far as I know,

464
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,550
mung beans need to be soaked for an hour in advance

465
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,870
and then be simmered for two quarters.

466
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,040
Plus the time to let it cool,

467
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,390
you need to prepare it

468
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,040
at least two hours in advance in total.

469
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,070
I...

470
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,040
Tell me.

471
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,040
Young Mistress.

472
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,760
I really had nothing to do with this.

473
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,630
I just saw the assistant Dou

474
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,630
making a big pot

475
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,350
of green bean soup the other day.

476
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,760
I asked him what it was for.

477
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,390
He said he'd heard that Master

478
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,550
was trapped near the fire,

479
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,280
so he wanted

480
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,790
to make soup for Master to relieve the heat.

481
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,760
I just...

482
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,240
So you took credit for his work

483
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,960
but didn't realize what you got

484
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,900
was the poison used to kill people.

485
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,960
But

486
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,550
how did Dou know

487
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,790
we were trapped in the fire?

488
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,790
Master didn't send anyone to report

489
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,350
in order to keep Madam from worrying.

490
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,070
Just ask him.

491
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,240
Where is Dou? Tell me.

492
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,130
He disappeared

493
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,370
after Master's accident.

494
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,320
This...

495
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,090
If Fu Sheng guessed correctly,

496

the dog meat vendor you met on the street

497
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,550

Spare me.

501
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,900
It's not my fault.

502
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,210
Please.

503
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,560
It's not my fault.

505
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,680
Wake up.

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,390
Where's Ye Shiliu?

507
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
I deserve to die.

The food brought at night

509
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,630

I'm afraid Ye Shiliu

512
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,920
has been taken away.

513
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,070
This is a deliberate attempt to cut off the clues

514
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,590
and prevent me from investigating.

515
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,890

such good herbs, aren't you?

00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,120
Little boy.

570
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,230
I didn't realize you had such a temper.

571
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,280
Come on.

572
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,490
Take this prescription.

573
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,410
Make a bowl of medicine with three bowls of water.

574
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,680
Take it once in the morning and once in the evening.

575
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,240
Come back in seven days.

576
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,760
Thank you, Physician Fu.

577
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,760
Also, my home is far away.

578
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,350
I've come all this way with a nature call.

579
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,150
Can I use your restroom?

580
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,070
Of course.

581
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,280
It's in the backyard.

582
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,070
Do you need me to take you there?

583
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,870
Don't bother.

584
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,830
I can go by myself.

585
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Be my guest.

586
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,610
What trick are you playing?

587
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,480
Hulu.

588
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,440
Why don't you go pack?

589
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,000
I don't really have anything to pack.

590
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,790
I just don't want to leave the chickens.

591
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,410
I'd like to

592
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,040
fix their nest while I'm gone.

593
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,480
By the way, sir.

594
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,590
What do you want from me?

595
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,350
Those people

596
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
are always hypocritically using us

597
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,590
like animals and exploiting us

598
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,520
in the name of teaching us our skills.

599
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,000
Hulu.

600
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,830
You're a gifted man.

601
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Are you willing

602
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,350
to spend your life here as a slave?

603
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,390
I...

604
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,660
Hulu.

605
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,040
Join us.

606
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,960
We can give you what you want.

607
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,690
What can you give me?

608
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,640
Understanding and dignity.

609
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,240
Wait a minute.

610
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,720
You said you'd give me understanding and dignity,

611
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,830
but you're all so secretive

612
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,520
and hide your identities.

613
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,070
You...

614
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,480
So

615
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,390
how can I feel comfortable joining you?

616
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,240
We want you to join us

617
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,790
because you're one of us

618
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,310
who's been ignored, discriminated against,

619
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,280
abused, and stepped on,

620
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,390
like the most insignificant

621
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,240
and useless stone in the road.

622
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,800
What can a bunch of stones do?

623
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,130
Stones can become a foundation

624
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,400
to form

625
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,790
or subvert a city.

626
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,920
What are you going to do?

627
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,860
Xichuan should have belonged to people,

628
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,770
but those in power and rich merchants have taken over Xichuan

629
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,470
and reduced us,

630
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,970
who have worked the hardest, to slaves.

631
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,520
Are you happy with that?

632
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,120
Are you willing?

633
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,780
No.

634
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,920
That's why

635
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,840
we'll take revenge on them

636
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,940
and drive them out.

637
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,600
So we can live here

638
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,940
with dignity.

639
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,360
Hulu.

640
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,260
When you complete the trials

641
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,840
and officially become a member of the Foundation,

642
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,960
you'll know who we are.

643
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,360
And by then,

644
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,640
you'll be able to do everything you want too.

645
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,930
What do you want me to do?

646
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,470
Hulu.

647
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,400
Do you find it interesting that an investigator

648
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,880
becomes a murderer?

649
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,270
What...

650
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,840
What do you want to do?

651
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,070
If I were a murderer,

652
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,120
you'd already be dead.

653
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,880
You know something's wrong,

654
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,030
but why would you still fall?

655
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,270
Only by being prepared can we reduce our strength in time.

656
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,750
In haste, a man is bound to fall.

657
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,400
How's that?

658
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,640
Look at this.

659
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,130
It's the light

660
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,570
that spooked the horses.

661
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,270
This is it.

662
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,050
Why is there a sword formation here?

663
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,090
The other day,

664
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,160
the bell was ringing for no reason.

665
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,420
We had looked into it for long

666
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,810
but couldn't find out the reason.

667
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,220
Then we invited an immortal

668
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,540
to set up this sword formation

669
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,510
to ward off evil spirits.

670
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,730
Then

671
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,030
it never rang again.

672
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,920
Immortal?

673
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,920
I don't think you're telling the truth.

674
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,270
It's not Eight Trigrams or Nine Palaces,

675
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,680
and it's not even an unpresentable Seven Luminaries.

676
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,470
The number's wrong.

677
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,860
The only thing it does

678
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,880
is totally reflect the sunlight

679
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,050
through this mirror

680
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,550
in the alley where Hua Lei died.

681
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,120
Is the immortal

682
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,030
you?

683
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,600
This...

684
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,650
Everything I said is true.

685
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,400
And

686
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,510
I've reported all the expenses

687
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,200
for the Immortal to Lord's Mansion.

688
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,680
The Lord's Mansion paid the immortal directly.

689
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,750
You can ask them

690
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,430
about that, Young Mistress.

691
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,030
Where is the immortal now?

692
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,940
[Glad for Your Coming]

693
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,680
Young Mistress.

694
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,890
Is there an old madman here?

695
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,320
Yes, there is.

696
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,160
You mean the immortal?

697
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,710
What immortal?

698
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,930
Call him out.

699
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,680
OK.

700
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,230
You don't need to.

701
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,030
I expected a noble visitor today

702
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,640
by cauterizing a tortoiseshell

703
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,920
and observing its patterns on a whim,

704
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,270
but I did not expect

705
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,920
Young Mistress Xichuan to come personally.

706
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,840
This made me feel shameful.

707
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,690
Do you know

708
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,170
why I've come to see you?

709
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:37,920
[Fortune-telling]

710
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,230
What I did in the bell tower was nothing.

711
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,270
It was a small token of my devotion

712
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
to the people of the city.

713
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,380
I lost ten years of my life

714
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,030
to exorcise the evil,

715
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,990
but I made the world peaceful,

716
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,230
which fulfilled one of my wishes.

717
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,380
He is indeed a madman.

718
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,160
Get him.

719
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,400
You talk a lot.

720
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,880
I...

721
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,270
Why did you do this?

722
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,510
You didn't see this coming,

723
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,240
did you, old man?

724
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,070
Tell me.

725
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,960
Who ordered you to kill Hua Lei?

726
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,160
What do you mean?

727
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,880
You must be mistaken.

728
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,280
Let him go.

729
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,150
What's wrong?

730
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,680
This bamboo slip

731
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,200
indeed details a sword formation to exorcise evil spirits,

732
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,520
exactly the same as the one on the bell tower.

733
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,350
What do you know?

734
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,760
This is our ancestral treasure.

735
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,760
How can you mortals

736
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,630
understand it?

737
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,310
It's an ancient artifact,

738
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,890
but the wooden document recording the chapter on evil breaking

739
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,680
has been switched,

740
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,160
so it's newer than the ones

741
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,720
in the other chapters.

742
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,540
The rope does look like it's been switched.

743
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,480
It's new.

744
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,920
Give it to me.

745
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,520
Little brat...

746
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:49,920
What do you mean?

747
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,150
The other day,

748
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
the rope of my book suddenly broke.

749
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,310
My pupil suddenly became diligent

750
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,000
and wanted to replace the string for me,

751
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,000
but I didn't realize he was so bold

752
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,550
as to dare tamper with the contents.

753
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,110
This is really...

754
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,310
Where is your disciple now?

755
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,630
He went out yesterday at noon

756
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,360
and hasn't returned yet.

757
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,880
When he comes back, I'll kill him.

I...

765
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,690
I heard it from my apprentice.

Another bullied esne.

767
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,320

The Jibei Chamber of Commerce is picking on us again?

The tongue coat is yellow.

776
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,710
Someone tampered with my prescription

777
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,670
and replaced it with a laxative.

778
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,710
Who did it?

779
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,000
It was that little pharmacist.

780
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,150
That little pharmacist

781
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,840

The patient's family has surrounded the place

786
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,230
and said we're killing people.

787
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,040

Regarding this matter,

796
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,820
I believe Physician Fu will give you an explanation.

797
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,360
An explanation?

798
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,920
What can you explain?

They are just killing people.

800
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,840
I heard earlier

801
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,750
that your doctor at the clinic

802
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,920
is a murderer.

803
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,590
Now,

804
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,070
they have really started killing people.

805
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,920

If Physician Fu was really a quack,

809
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,040
we'd have demolished the clinic.

810
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,440
Then he's up to no good.

811
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:14,800
That's right.

Physician Fu has been

815
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,000
Right.

I have some idea about the cause of his death.

Hua Lei, the unlucky jerk,

858
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,970
was killed by a man called Night Owl,

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,580
wasn't he?

860
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,220
So what are you still investigating?

861
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,580
Night Owl was just being used too.

864
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,860

Please.

872
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,580
On the day Lei Juekun died,

That's true.

Why?

877
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,480
On that day, the Chairman got news

878
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,400
that Che Hujue had gotten a shipment of weapons

879
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,960
and hid them in the western branch closest to the Chamber of Commerce

880

to find a time to sneak up on us.

881
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,000
So the Chairman decided to make a countermeasure

882
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,630
and took a group of men there,

883
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,800
but they came up empty

884
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,960
