Fu Sheng.

573
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,430
You came back so late.

574
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,560
Did you hang out with a girl?

575
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,080
Nonsense.

576
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,350
I ran into a kid.

577
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,320
He said his sister was sick.

578
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,350
He wanted me to treat her.

579
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,350
I asked him to meet me at the inn tomorrow.

580
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,430
Are you doing this because his sister is beautiful?

581
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,870
I don't know what his sister looks like.

582
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,040
It's too sour.

583
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,910
Madam.

584
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,800
Mr. Gu asked me to add more vinegar.

585
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,040
Eating more vinegar

586
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,000
will lead to a long life.

587
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180
It's nonsense.

588
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,060
Vinegar

589
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,870
can help to loosen phlegm,

590
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,630
ventilate lungs, and relieve dyspnea.

591
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,340
But

592
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,340
it's only good for your body.

593
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,520
It has nothing to do with longevity.

594
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,350
Anyway, there's no harm

595
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,350
in eating more vinegar.

596
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,390
Right?

597
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
Wen Jue, let's eat.

598
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,670
Eat more.

599
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,360
Taste it.

600
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,300
Eat some pork liver.

601
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,420
It replenishes blood.

602
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,450
Eat it if you want.

603
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,930
I don't eat vinegar.

604
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:42,960
Brother.

605
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,520
Guess what it is.

606
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,450
Plums.

607
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,850
It's expensive and delicious.

608
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,610
Have a taste.

609
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,470
Isn't it delicious?

610
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,900
Delicious.

611
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,660
Is it sour?

612
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:00,970
Wait.

613
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,770
It's mine.

614
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,160
I...

615
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,370
Tell me.

616
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,850
Where did you steal it?

617
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,460
We bought it.

618
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,620
My brother had no appetite recently.

619
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,310
I bought this to wake up his appetite.

620
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:10,860
Wake up my appetite.

621
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,660
Wake up your appetite?

622
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,630
Wait.

623
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,180
You're a horse slave.

624
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,670
Do you deserve this?

625
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,350
Get out of here.

626
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,700
It hurts.

627
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,590
Sir.

628
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,170
Please spare my brother.

629
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,110
We won't get in your way.

630
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,630
Don't you understand me?

631
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,550
Get away.

632
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,070
Is your hand okay?

633
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,630
It hurts.

634
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,400
It hurts.

635
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Nonsense. You pushed me away.

636
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,130
I...

637
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,090
No.

638
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,890
Let him go.

639
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,010
Get away.

640
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,160
Brother.

641
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,330
Lunatic.

642
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,760
You don't know who you are

643
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,740
if I don't teach you a lesson.

644
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,740
Brother.

645
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,540
Sir, please spare me.

646
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,450
I have money.

647
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,890
I'll give you money.

648
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,780
Brother.

649
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,040
Brother.

650
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,070
Don't come over, brother.

651
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,610
Turn around.

652
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,000
You...

653
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,580
You can step on my back.

654
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,890
But you can't step on my brother's hand.

655
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,760
You...

656
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,470
Fu Sheng.

657
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,270
Do you remember what you promised me

658
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,340
in Shangyi?

659
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,920
Of course.

660
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,030
Good.

661
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,230
When are you going to treat my dad?

662
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,980
Can you give me a few more days?

663
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,950
I want to visit Song Jingye first.

664
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,920
Song Jingye?

665
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,310
Why do you want to visit him?

666
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,330
I need the Cloud-shaped Jade, the Water-shaped Jade,

667
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,160
and the Mountain-shaped Jade

668
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,230
for the Bird Jade Plate

669
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,640
to unlock the Sealed Book.

670
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,880
The Cloud-shaped Jade

671
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,600
is right in Song Jingye's hand.

672
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,600
My dad said in his will

673
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,550
that Song Jingye could tell me the truth about the day.

674
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,600
Can I have a look?

675
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,230
Okay.

676
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,750
Gu Tian, do you want to have a look?

677
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,920
I'll have a look.

678
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,750
You look at it first.

679
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,160
Let me see.

680
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,120
Fu Sheng.

681
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,230
Since so many people

682
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,640
want to get the Bird Jade Plate,

683
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,510
we should keep it a secret

684
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,680
to protect you.

685
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,840
Don't worry.

686
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,270
I won't even tell my dad.

687
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,920
I understand.

688
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,790
Fu Sheng.

689
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,270
Don't

690
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,600
leave me out of this.

691
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,610
It's too dangerous.

692
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,610
You'd better not get involved.

693
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,420
I came with you all the way from Shangyi to Xichuan.

694
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,700
Isn't it too late for you

695
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,010
to tell me not to get involved?

696
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,940
Besides,

697
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,460
it's precisely because it's dangerous

698
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,050
that you need me even more.

699
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,250
I can protect you.

700
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,460
Thank you. But it's fine.

701
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,180
I can protect myself.

702
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,290
Princess.

703
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,610
Listen to this.

704
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,010
From Shangyi to Xichuan,

705
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,010
I protected him.

706
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,940
You didn't dare to go to the toilet at night.

707
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,330
Who risked his life

708
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,770
to go with you?

709
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,460
We finally got news

710
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,290
of the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

711
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,140
But you want to get rid of me.

712
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,330
I swore in front of his dad's grave

713
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,940
to protect him.

714
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,010
Hurt.

715
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,810
Fu Sheng, you're out of line.

716
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,940
Come on. Drop the act.

717
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,570
We'll go together.

718
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,530
Okay.

719
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,460
Wait.

720
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,250
I'll go together with you.

721
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,610
Don't mess around.

722
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,700
I'm not.

723
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,490
If you want to be safe in Xichuan,

724
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,510
you need me.

725
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,570
Besides,

726
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,250
you haven't treated my dad yet.

727
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,220
I can't let anything happen to you.

728
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,180
You...

729
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,460
You got me.

730
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,220
Okay.

731
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,050
We'll go together.

732
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,050
Okay.

733
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,330
That's a deal.

734
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,010
I don't ask for much.

735
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,330
When we get the Treasure of the Sealed Book,

736
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,250
give me a share of the treasure.

737
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,420
I want it enough for my two brothers to live a secure life.

738
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,420
That's a deal.

739
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,850
It's late.

740
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,050
I'll go home.

741
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,050
We'll escort you home.

742
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,050
No, thanks.

743
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,900
No one in Xichuan dares to hurt me.

744
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,050
See you.

745
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,420
Take care.

746
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,460
Okay, it's late.

747
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,460
Let's go to bed.

748
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,740
You go back...

749
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,740
Are you going to sleep here?

750
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,850
There is only one bed here.

751
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,140
If I don't sleep here, where do I sleep?

752
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,510
Besides, I have to protect you.

753
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,340
Come on.

754
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,340
[Lord's Mansion]

755
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:21,810
Jiu.

756
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,730
Princess.

757
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:25,880
Dad.

758
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,330
Jue.

759
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,550
Do you want to see me?

760
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,090
Jue.

761
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,730
Does your head hurt again?

762
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,790
I'll get Fu Sheng to treat you.

763
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,030
Jue.

764
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,900
It's an old trouble.

765
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,900
Don't worry.

766
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,470
You're my only dad.

767
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,950
I'm worried about you.

768
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,990
Jue.

769
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,790
You're a good daughter.

770
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,510
But Fu Sheng

771
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,230
is the miracle physician's disciple.

772
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,100
It's not good to invite him here like this.

773
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,900
How about this?

774
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,900
Tomorrow,

775
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,470
I'll send Jiu over to invite him over

776
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,030
with great gifts.

777
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,380
That's the right thing to do, right?

778
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,750
Now that you're here,

779
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,030
I'd like

780
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,550
to ask you a favor.

781
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,060
What's the favor?

782
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,470
Xubu Huai

783
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,950
came to visit me today.

784
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,950
I wasn't feeling well.

785
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,820
So I didn't meet him.

786
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,990
I want you

787
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,340
to meet him for me tomorrow.

788
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,190
In case he has something important.

789
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,660
He has nothing important to do.

790
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,950
Dad.

791
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,300
Do you think I'm still a kid?

792
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,580
Don't trick me with that.

793
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,510
He has asked to visit so many times

794
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,660
just to see you.

795
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,230
You shouldn't turn him down.

796
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,450
I don't want to meet him.

797
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,220
Princess.

798
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,820
Being angry

799
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,030
is not good

800
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,320
for the lord's headache.

801
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,770
All right, I'll meet him.

802
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,060
That's a deal.

803
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,430
Does your head still hurt?

804
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,220
Much better.

805
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,590
I'll leave.

806
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,980
Rest early.

807
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,460
[Beyond Fame and Gain]

808
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,200
Don't forget it.

809
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,860
Tomorrow.

810
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,190
My lord.

811
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,070
If the Princess is unwilling to marry him,

812
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,150
you shouldn't force her.

813
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,320
My lord, if you...

814
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,150
I'll do anything to make the Princess the Lord.

815
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,400
Get up.

816
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,230
Get up first.

817
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,880
Jiu.

818
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,640
I've always thought of you as my son.

819
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,840
You and Jue grew up together.

820
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,950
You're like brother and sister.

821
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,440
I didn't marry her to you.

822
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,990
That's not because I don't trust you.

823
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,080
It's just...

824
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,470
If I die,

825
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,470
Jue and you

826
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,640
cannot

827
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,270
guard Xichuan.

828
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,950
But why did you marry her to Ma Gang?

829
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,950
You don't know.

830
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,160
I used to be a bandit.

831
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,920
I fought on horseback

832
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,190
with my fighting skills.

833
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,640
I fought my way here.

834
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,030
I relied on the Star Gold to settle here.

835
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,640
Gradually, Xichuan City is founded.

836
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,030
Most of the people

837
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,710
in the Chamber of Commerce are businessmen.

838
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,950
They're calculating.

839
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,160
They're not reliable.

840
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,790
But Ma Gang is different.

841
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,710
They are rough guys.

842
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,550
But they are blunt

843
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,790
and strong.

844
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,680
Only these people

845
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,160
can protect Jue.

846
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,230
You worked so hard

847
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,360
for the Princess.

848
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,790

849
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,640
and have children

00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,620
in the future,

851
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,680
you'll understand me.

852
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,750
You guys,

853
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,650
kill someone for me?

854
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,050
You killed Song Jingye, the Chairman of Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

855
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,280
We have all the evidence.

856
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,980
Take them immediately!

857
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,570
Wait.

858
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,130
What?
