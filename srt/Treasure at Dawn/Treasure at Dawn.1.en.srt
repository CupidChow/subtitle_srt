00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,240
I've been

570
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,720
to everyone's house.

571
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,930
I know about their families,

572
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,040
relatives,

573
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,720
in-laws, and debts.

574
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,800
Let me put it this way. In Shangyi,

575
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,690
if I can't find something,

576
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,170
no one can.

577
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,450
Shangyi is a small place.

578
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,080
As strangers, if you look everywhere for it,

579
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,170
you will be noticed.

580
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,560
Then, it will be extremely difficult to find it.

581
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,010
Sit down.

582
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,420
Tell me.

583
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,290
How many days do you need?

584
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,660
Ten days at most.

585
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,860
I'll give you three days.

586
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,590
Dude,

587
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,590
there are many houses to search for.

588
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,350
Even if I have manpower,

589
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,790
I need time.

590
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,630
Get a writing brush and ink.

591
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,250
Yes.

592
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,460
Write down the names and addresses

593
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,630
of all the physicians in Shangyi.

594
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,390
Okay.

595
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,750
These are the addresses

596
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,360
of all the physicians in Shangyi.

597
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,230
That's all?

598
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,950
How about this?

599
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,320
We'll start our search at both ends.

600
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,950
Three days are enough.

601
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,990
Okay.

602
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,430
You start from the end, and I start from the beginning.

603
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,470
We'll each search half.

604
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,780
[Physician Cai, Physician Zhang, Physician Fu]

605
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,470
[Physician Cai, Physician Zhang, Physician Fu]

606
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,910
If you deceive me,

607
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,830
I'll chop you up and feed you to dogs.

608
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,060
Don't worry.

609
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,220
My lord, can we trust him?

610
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,030
What do you think?

611
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,740
Follow him.

612
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,180
Yes.

613
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,220
Search.

614
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,030
Yes.

615
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,580
Yinshu.

616
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,030
Leader.

617
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,400
Leader, what kind of business is this?

618
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,950
Come with me to Crazy Fu.

619
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,180
Leader,

620
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,870
I'm afraid we can't find Crazy Fu.

621
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:37,830
What?

622
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,230
Did he run?

623
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,030
It...

624
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,350
It's worse than that.

625
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,660
He was arrested.

626
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,620
They said he was the murderer of the Murder of Physicians.

627
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,110
Crazy Fu is crazy.

628
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,120
But he wouldn't kill that many people.

629
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,350
Leader, have you seen him today?

630
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,920
Yes.

631
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,350
And we had a fight.

632
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,190
[Two hours earlier]

633
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,540
You rascal.

634
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,140
In just a short while,

635
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,210
you've made more money

636
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,970
than I can in years.

637
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,860
Hurry up, you guys!

638
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,650
Gu Tian!

639
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,580
Open up, Gu Tian!

640
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,250
I hired you to put on a show,

641
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,620
- not to steal my customers! - Spring light's just rising,

642
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,540
the best time to sleep in with a lovely lady.

643
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,380
Gu Tian!

644
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,380
Open up!

645
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,580
Open the door!

646
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,860
Catch him.

647
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,250
He has a sprain in his lower back.

648
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,220
It caused his body to lose balance.

649
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,460
Judging by his landing spot,

650
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,900
he should have landed his left hip bone on the sack to reduce the force,

651
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,380
then rolled to the ground.

652
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,220
Crazy Fu.

653
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,420
Give me a hand.

654
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,420
Come on.

655
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,920
Darn it, how dare you trick me?

656
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,120
Crazy Fu, if you catch him,

657
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,810
we'll be even.

658
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,040
That's a good thing.

659
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,080
With your body, how can you owe money to a brothel?

660
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,960
It's not me. It's my dad.

661
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,120
Then it's none of your business.

662
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Don't leave.

663
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,830
There's an old saying,

664
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,910
"The son has to pay his father's debt."

665
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,120
Isn't that the truth?

666
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,950
Are you sure you won't let me go?

667
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,120
I'm sure. If I let you go, I can't pay my debts.

668
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,230
The Hundred Moves.

669
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,190
The Hundred Moves has a hundred skills.

670
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,230
If you underestimate me,

671
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,940
you'll regret it.

672
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,390
Lift left shoulder and lean forward.

673
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,020
Lower right shoulder and move back.

674
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,620
Push the ground with the left forefoot.

675
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,360
Your moves...

676
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,130
How about you?

677
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,920
Let me give you a hand this time.

678
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,980
I don't need your hand.

679
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,760
And I'm not convinced.

680
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,910
It hurts.

681
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,620
This is...

682
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,650
Don't touch it.

683
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,260
I told you not to touch it.

684
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,380
Hurry.

685
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,260
He's a paper tiger.

686
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,590
He doesn't have real abilities.

687
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,700
Take him away.

688
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,380
Yes.

689
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,110
Be careful.

690
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,450
I caught him for you.

691
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,430
Are we even?

692
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,210
We are even.

693
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,550
I didn't expect

694
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,950
you and your father to be both capable.

695
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,320
Come often.

696
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,550
Not me.

697
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,180
He looked like he had come back from outside the city.

698
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,630
Yinshu,

699
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,890
find out who he met today.

700
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,170
Bring those people back.

701
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:29,800
Be fast.

702
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,660
Okay, leader.

703
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,450
I'll do it right away.

704
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,020
[Shangyi County Yamen]

705
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,250
How is it, Magistrate Yang?

706
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,660
He's still treating him.

707
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,850
But he promised

708
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,250
he'll save my child.

709
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,780
You trust that kid's skills that much?

710
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,940
What if he can't save him?

711
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,580
Crazy Fu's methods

712
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,930
are strange, sure,

713
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,330
but under his care,

714
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,500
no one stays sick.

715
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,580
He's that amazing?

716
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,330
His master

717
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,140
is the heir of the miracle physician Hua Tuo.

718
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,540
So Fu Sheng learned extraordinary skills.

719
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,420
My lord.

720
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,650
What's going on?

721
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,530
Some people came

722
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,900
and claimed that they were witnesses in the Murder of Physicians.

723
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,300

I'm Gu Tian.

These two beside me are the witnesses in the case of Murder of Physicians.

727
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,670
They can prove

728
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,530
that Fu Sheng is not the one who poisoned the physicians.

729
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,620
You may stand up.

730
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,250
Speak the truth.

731
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,770
My lord, I'm an assistant in the kitchen of the inn.

732
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,030
Physician Fu booked a whole meal at the inn

733
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,540
and the time we agreed on was noon.

734
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,980
Yet, he was still absent

735
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,020
half an hour later.

736
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,330
My boss asked me to find him,

737
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,540
and I saw him halfway

738
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,300
when he had just returned to the city from collecting herbs.

739
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,020
My boss is asking

740
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,420
if your father wants to keep the table.

741
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,650
Why didn't he tell me

742
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,050
that he made a reservation?

743
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:50,740
At this moment,

744
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,170
all physicians of Shangyi

745
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,370
are at your home.

746
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,140
I think they are studying medicine.

747
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,820
I wondered why he was trying to get rid of me.

748
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,210
I need to go back now.

749
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,490
Wait!

750
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,020
So, I walk with Fu Sheng

751
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,770
to the clinic.

752
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,370
That's when

753
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,840
we met this lord here.

754
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,430
Are you Physician Fu?

755
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,880
Yes.

756
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,300
And he knocked me out.

757
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,820
Fu Sheng left

758
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,580
[1:00 PM]
at about 1:00 PM.

759
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,370
He arrived at the clinic at about 13:15.

760
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,330
I passed out for about 15 minutes

761
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,740
[1:15 PM]
and woke up at 1:15 PM.

762
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,140
Then I went to the clinic.

763
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,100
That leaves about a 7.5-minute gap.

764
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,860
So...

765
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,420
So, what does that mean?

766
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,860
That means if Fu Sheng is the one who poisoned the physicians,

767
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,820
he only had a window of 7.5 minutes.

768
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,650
Is that possible?

769
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,990
7.5 minutes might not be long,

770
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,980
but that's not enough to prove Fu Sheng's innocence.

771
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,860
What if he premeditated this

772
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,210
and poisoned the victims before leaving the city?

773
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,340
Crazy Fu might be crazy,

774
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,500
but he's not stupid.

775
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,180
Dr. Fu is his father.

776
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,090
Why would he poison his own father?

777
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,590
You just said

778
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,690
that he's crazy.

779
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,400
What if he had an episode today?

780
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,480
"What if?"

781
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,520
We speak on evidence,

782
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,130
not what-ifs.

783
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,010
Of course.

784
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,160
I put my foot in my mouth.

785
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,600
What did Fu Sheng do outside the city?

786
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,280
Was there any witness?

787
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,840
My lord,

788
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,820
I saw him at the time.

789
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,590
[5:00 - 7:00 AM]

790
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,650
This morning,

791
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,530
Physician Fu insisted that my ox was ill.

792
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,040
He opened up my ox

793
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,650
and removed the poisonous beans from the inside.

794
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,340
He asked for

795
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,070
a visit to our village

796
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,470
to find the perpetrator.

797
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,070
[7:00 - 9:00 AM]
Here we are.

798
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,360
Well, I'm surprised.

799
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,680
You are a rich guy.

800
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,880
You've got two oxen.

801
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,150
One of them belongs to Hu, my neighbor.

802
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,030
To save some construction materials,

803
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,440
we built a shared shed.

804
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,110
Last night when I was

805
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,670
feeding my ox,

806
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,850
I noticed that there were beans in Hu's feeding trough,

807
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,080
and I wanted my ox to have some as well.

808
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,080
The beans are poisonous,

809
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,370
and there could be trouble if someone ate the beans.

810
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,470
We need to go right now.

811
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,150
Now is the time.

812
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,550
Let's bury him.

813
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,790
Hold on!

814
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,140
[7:30 AM]

815
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,140
Crazy Fu,

816
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,420
what is this?

817
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,910
I need to open the coffin for an autopsy.

818
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,860
My fellow villagers!

819
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,420
Crazy Fu might be unconventional,

820
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,980
of the county office.

821
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,200
Autopsy

822
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,680
is within his pay grade.

823
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,440
As an administrator

824
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,680
of the village,

825
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,200
I cannot let a villager

826
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,410
pass away with the reason unclear.

827
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,190
In light of that,

828
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,490
Open the coffin.

829
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,980
Let's take a look, guys.

830
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,690
The corpse's eyes are yellowed,

831
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,130
and the face is bluish and swollen.

832
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,210
Besides, I'm sure

833
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,210
that there's poison residual in his stomach.

834
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,980
A silver needle can testify to that.

835
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,470
He's right!

836
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,050
The needle turned black.

837
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,240
What really killed him was

838
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,650
Kusnezoff monkshood mother root.

839
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,810
That's how he revealed the truth

840
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,240
of a murder.

841
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,450
That's impressive.

842
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,170
This lunatic

843
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,770
can cure diseases and solve cases.

844
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,770
He does have some tricks up his sleeves.

845
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,050
Agreed.

846
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,010
When did he leave the village?

847
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,720
I think it was

848
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,650
10:00 AM

849
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,150
The time fits

850
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,170
the cook's description.

851
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,570
If you spoke the truth

852
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,540
and he did stay outside the city for so long

853
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,860
without showing the intention of hurrying back,

854
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,910
then he didn't mind his time

855
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,230
of returning to the city.

856
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,030
Assuming he's the perpetrator,

857
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,770
he'd be rushing to get back

858
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,360
before the physicians go to lunch at 12:00 PM.

859
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,980
In that case,

860
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,790
his timeline doesn't fit with the perpetrator's.

861
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,980
Aide,

862
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,820
now that I'm hearing this,

863
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,970
I also think Fu Sheng is innocent.

864
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,020
My lord!

865
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,270
If we don't hold Fu Sheng accountable for the crime,

866
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,040
there will be even more trouble

867
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,680
now that the Princess is involved.

868
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,790
My lord!

869
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,310
There are so many things not clear about this case.

870
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,010
Fu Sheng has no time to commit the crime.

871
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,310
You arrested the wrong guy.

872
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,310
Who told you I arrested Fu Sheng?

873
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,620
Besides, the testimony of these two

874
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,360
is insufficient to clear the suspicion of Fu Sheng.

875
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,070
Can someone give me a hand?

876
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,000
What happened?

877
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,670
I need someone bold, cautious,

878
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,670
and with steady hands to assist me.

879
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,680
I can help!

880
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,510
My lord, you can't do that. That brings an ill omen.

881
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,650
I can go!

882
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:45,960
No!

883
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,520
You are a male. How can you enter a delivery room?

884
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,290
But...

885
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,640
I can help.

886
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,240
I heard that you have uncanny medical knowledge,

887
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,410
and I'd like to see for myself.

888
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,570
Blood doesn't bother you, right?

889
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,120
No.

890
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,000
Great. Let's go.

891
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,120
We are in an emergency, and I only have time to explain once.

892
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,480
I'll cut from here later,

893
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,080
and after I've opened up the abdomen,

894
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,690
hold the wound open for me.

895
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,360
Once I get the child,

896
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,930
cut the umbilical cord immediately

897
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,510
and get the baby.

898
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,450
Have you got all that?

899
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,340
Aren't you afraid?

900
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,050
You should be the one afraid.

901
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,290
You'd better make no mistakes,

902
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,120
or Lord Yang won't let you off.

903
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,240
Human lives are at stake here.

904
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,600
They come first.

905
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,740
[Tranquility]

906
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,720
They've been gone for long.

907
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,410
How did it go?

908
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,340
Thank you for your patience.

909
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:53,960
It's a boy.

910
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,540
A boy!

911
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,990
This family now has an heir.

912
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:03,790
Ah, Fu Sheng!

913
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,260
How is my wife doing?

914
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,420
She's fine.

915
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,770
She hasn't recovered her strength yet.

916
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,910
I have left a prescription.

917
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,990
Ask the servant to get the medicines on the prescription.

918
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,360
Do not get water on the wound,

919
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,970
or there could be an infection

920
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,030
that can be life-threatening.

921
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,410
Okay.

922
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,650
Fu Sheng.

923
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,890
You are a savior for my family.

924
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,410
My lord!

925
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,770
Fu Sheng, what is this about?

926
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,990
I need a favor.

927
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,090
Come on.

928
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:31,690
Stand up.

929
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:33,800
Tell me what you want.

930
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,330
I want to take over the investigation of this case.

931
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,100
Let me find my father's murderer and clean my name.

932
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,710
Fu Sheng,

933
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,700
you already pleaded guilty.

934
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,270
Guards!

935
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,170
Yes!

936
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,750
Get Fu Sheng to sign the confession.

937
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,440
Hold on!

938
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,780
Details of this case are not clear.

939
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,620
How can you give your judgment in haste?

940
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,060
Giving Fu Sheng the access to the investigation

941
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,740
is against the rules, my lord.

942
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,990
My lord,

943
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,290
the aide arrested me

944
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,800
for three reasons.

945
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,360
I also have three reasons

946
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,880
to be a part of the investigation.

947
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,920
Fu Sheng,

948
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,360
my reasons are logical.

949
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,560
I didn't make anything up.

950
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,410
Aide,

951
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,510
my reasons

952
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,990
are all genuine.

953
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,400
- What could you...- First,

954
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,080
I'm the clerk of the county.

955
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:24,320
Autopsy is within my duty.

956
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,120
Second, my father is a victim.

957
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,160
As his son,

958
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,640
I'm obligated to find the murderer and revenge my father.

959
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,270
Third,

960
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,360
and this is the most important one,

961
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,950
I'm a suspect in this case,

962
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,540
and I don't think there's anyone with a stronger desire

963
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,820
to find out the truth more than me

964
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:41,960
since it's my innocence that's on the line.

965
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,650
How many more lives

966
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,820
my sword will have to take?

967
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,520
[The animals in the show are props]

968
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,980
