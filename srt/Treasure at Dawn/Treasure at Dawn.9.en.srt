00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,630
How can there be ghosts during the day?

191
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,700
Is it charcoal?

192
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,300
No.

193
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,780
It's heat.

194
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,260
Something wrong with this painting.

195
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,460
Gu Tian.

196
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,390
Put the incense burner there.

197
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,830
If you have a vision later,

198
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,700
put this pill under your tongue.

199
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,580
If you feel you can't hold it,

200
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,670
chew it

201
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,780
and swallow it.

202
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,460
How was it?

203
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:55,870
It was scary.

204
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,590
I saw the monkey in this painting come to life.

205
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,630
I saw a monkey with a big piece

206
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,980
of Star Gold on its head.

207
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,870
Moneygrubber.

208
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
That's not right.

209
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,740
In this vision,

210
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,020
we didn't see the monkey

211
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,070
come out of the painting.

212
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,500
So that means the monkey we saw

213
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,590
was a human being in disguise?

214
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,350
Yingying.

215
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,740
Yingying.

216
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,780
Hand over your money.

217
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,070
Sir, we really don't have any money.

218
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,190
Dad, Mom.

219
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,830
No.

220
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,630
Don't come over.

221
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,220
Don't come over.

222
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,020
Don't come over.

223
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,070
Don't come over.

224
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,940
Don't come over.

225
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,700
Don't come over.

226
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,670
What’s going on with you?

227
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,030
Don't come over.

228
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,630
Be careful.

229
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,260
Don't come over.

230
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,590
Don't come over.

231
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,500
Don't come over.

232
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,590
What’s going on with her?

233
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,390
Hyperthymesia.

234
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,070
I was careless.

235
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,460
The vision and her symptoms

236
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,260
gave her no time to bite into the pill.

237
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,670
How are you doing?

238
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,350
Just a flesh wound.

239
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,350
Is she all right?

240
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,700
Let her rest.

241
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,260
Okay.

242
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,110
You're awake.

243
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,260
I want some water.

244
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,070
Water?

245
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,220
Feeling better?

246
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,830
Thanks a lot.

247
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,020
If it wasn't for me,

248
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,150
you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

249
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,150
What was going on

250
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,540
with you?

251
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,870
Why did you react so violently?

252
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,110
I was too abrupt.

253
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,760
Don't talk about it

254
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,430
if you don't want to.

255
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,630
I saw my parents killed

256
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,980
in front of me.

257
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,220
I told you we were alike.

258
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,780
We grew up suffering,

259
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,300
and we're all

260
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,150
in the same situation.

261
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,500
When I was little, my family was also victimized by bad people.

262
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,540
I've been living on the streets

263
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,260
since I was a kid,

264
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,350
so we should be

265
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,390
close.

266
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,390
Did you pull on your wound?

267
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,500
Why don't you hold yourself up?

268
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,300
I'm not in pain here

269
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,190
but here.

270
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,350
Don't pretend.

271
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,670
It hurts.

272
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,190
You really don't care about me?

273
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,350
Let me ask you a question.

274
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,110
If I was the one who went crazy,

275
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,110
would you protect me

276
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,460
like Gu Tian?

277
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,390
Would you?

278
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,460
If you didn't save me,

279
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,940
my father would be all alone,

280
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,500
so he definitely wouldn't let you go.

281
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,150
How are monkey head, peach,

282
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,980
and rockery

283
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,740
different from before?

284
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,540
Here, here.

285
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,350
Here, and here.

286
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,300
There are

287
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,260
thirteen differences in all.

288
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,700
The ink colors are all darkening.

289
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,630
Are they?

290
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,940
Trust me.

291
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,320
All the famous artists in Xichuan

292
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,350
have been hired by my father as tutors.

293
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,150
I'm a connoisseur

294
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,190
when it comes to paintings.

295
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,830
This painting is a fake made

296
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,390
by the ancient method of smudging.

297
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,260
Many counterfeiters

298
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,670
use this technique to deceive people.

299
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,150
People hang the painting

300
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,740
or calligraphy

301
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,110
in a relatively closed room

302
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,910
and bake it with the smoke

303
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,740
from the incense.

304
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,350
After a few days of baking,

305
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,870
the paper will take

306
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,350
on a light brownish-yellow color.

307
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,910
It's extremely similar to old paper,

308
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,300
so I didn't see anything wrong

309
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,190
with it before.

310
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,630
But now,

311
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,140
because the painting has been roasted by fire,

312
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,940
the potion on the paper continues to work.

313
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,110
You see.

314
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,500
The color just isn't right.

315
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,460
It seems to have aged

316
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,460
another several decades.

317
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,980
The painting was mounted on a scroll first,

318
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,870
so the paper inside the scroll

319
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,940
wasn't smudged.

320
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,670
Open up this scroll,

321
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,500
and then you can see if it's real.

322
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,540
Look.

323
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:14,770
Don't move.

324
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:17,940
What's wrong?

325
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,300
I've got it.

326
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,780
This is datura flower and aconite root.

327
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,540
This scroll was soaked in herbs.

328
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,220
And then?

329
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,950
Datura flower and aconite root

330
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,300
are toxic and hallucinogenic.

331
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,670
And, when exposed to heat,

332
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,540
the toxins are released

333
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,870
and cause hallucinations.

334
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,540
So that's what Qin Shi

335
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,020
was smelling.

336
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,830
Who made this fake painting

337
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,300
to bluff people?

338
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,430
If I find him,

339
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,390
I'll teach him a lesson.

340
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,540
You know what?

341
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,540
I have so many ways of torturing people

342
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,020
but I've never tried them on anyone.

343
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,740
My father and Jiu

344
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,220
never let me do it.

345
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Believe it or not.

346
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,020
I really have a lot of methods.

347
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,870
Crazy Fu.

348
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,870
Crazy Fu.

349
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,780
Crazy Fu.

350
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,960
You haven't been here for a long time.

351
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,270
And now you're finally here

352
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,590
but no gift.

353
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,390
It's so insincere.

354
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,190
Tell me.

355
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,980
What are you doing this time?

356
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,670
What are you doing?

357
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,980
Why didn't you use a silver needle this time?

358
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,070
Probably under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs.

359
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,820
Datura flower and aconite root are strong.

360
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,110
If you're not careful,

361
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,300
you'll fall into a hallucinogenic state,

362
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,190
but based on these two herbs,

363
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,510
I've come up with a remedy.

364
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,740
Found it.

365
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,650
What's this book?

366
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,300
[Medical book]
It's a medical book from my master.

367
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,110
It contains

368
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,550
a special prescription.

369
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,950
What is it?

370
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,470
Datura flower and aconite root are poisonous,

371
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,070
but if the poison is removed by a secret method,

372
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,300
they are also a good remedy.

373
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,220
If you add Gastrodia,

374
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,950
[Medical book]
Uncariarhynchophylla, and Glycyrrhiza,

375
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,510
it will cure headaches and dizziness.

376
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,700
For Lord Wen's illness,

377
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,860
this will be a countermeasure.

378
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,630
Saving lives with poison?

379
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,810
Are you sure?

380
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,860
I understand.

381
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,150
I understand everything.

382
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,110
Does finding someone excite you so much?

383
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,030
I'm sorry.

384
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,590
I'm so excited.

385
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,990
Let me do the searching.

386
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,420
Leave it.

387
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,340
Wait for me.

388
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,540
[Lord's Mansion]

389
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,900
[Firm as a rock]

390
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,150
There it is.

391
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,780
Sir.

392
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,860
What are you doing?

393
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,070
Young Mistress, have you forgotten?

394
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,510
We're painting.

395
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,900
Didn't you want

396
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,990
the Golden Monkey?

397
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,300
Where is the monkey?

398
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,110
Monkey?

399
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,630
This is freestyle brushwork.

400
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,670
When I finish the whole painting,

401
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,990
you'll know it at a glance.

402
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,070
Let me continue.

403
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,070
Wait a minute.

404
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,510
That's not necessary.

405
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,220
It wouldn't be worth it

406
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,900
if you hurt your back,

407
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,860
would it?

408
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,860
Why don't you

409
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,150
have some grapes

410
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,510
or sit over there

411
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,300
with some tea?

412
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,990
Young Mistress, what do you mean by that?

413
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,030
Are you looking down on me?

414
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
I'm old,

415
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,590
but I still have energy.

416
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,590
Let me continue.

417
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,070
Master Wang.

418
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,420
There's something not right

419
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,910
with the monkey you drew.

420
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,470
What?

421
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,190
Something's wrong?

422
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,340
Let me see

423
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,310
what's wrong.

424
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,120
I didn't expect this monkey

425
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,670
to have two dull eyes.

426
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,150
Maybe it didn't get enough to eat.

427
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,900
A mess.

428
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,980
How dare you call yourself a painter?

429
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,510
What...

430
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,470
What do you know?

431
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,780
This is splashed-ink freestyle painting.

432
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,590
I didn't realize

433
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,950
you called yourself

434
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,220
Xichuan's chief painter,

435
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,030
but your painting is...

436
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,070
Is what?

437
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,220
Nothing.

438
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,900
What...

439
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,820
What do you know?

440
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,510
I'm imitating the ancient method.

441
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,190
A shallow person like you

442
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,260
can't even understand it.

443
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,740
You...

444
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,700
You always talk

445
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,070
better than you act.

446
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,820
Shut up.

447
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,900
I invited you here to see

448
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,780
who copied this picture

449
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,700
not to argue.

450
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,380
You're all swindling

451
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,780
in the name

452
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,300
of Lord's Mansion.

453
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,260
Listen up.

454
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,030
If you can't find this man,

455
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,380
you can all get out of Xichuan.

456
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,420
Young Mistress.

457
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,220
Please don't be angry.

458
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,510
The lines in this painting are clean.

459
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,590
It's hard to find the source

460
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,670
of this technique.

461
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,510
It's not for mundanes like us

462
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,470
to do.

463
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,550
Outrageous.

464
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,670
Nonsense.

465
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,550
I don't know

466
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,820
who could have done this painting,

467
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,070
but I've seen the same brushstrokes

468
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,190
and ink colors on another painting.

469
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,860
Where is it?

470
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,820
Chunyun House.

471
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,070
Chunyun House?

472
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,470
How does it feel?

473
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,990
Very good.

474
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,240
Physician Fu's medical skills

475
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,700
are truly renowned.

476
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,510
Good.

477
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,740
The prescription is complete.

478
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,950
You only need to follow the prescription

479
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,340
to remove the phlegm and dizziness.

480
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,260
In a few days,

481
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,300
you'll be cured.

482
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,700
Master.

483
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,820
Master, emergency.

484
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,590
Don't be rude.

485
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,070
Jiu, calm down.

486
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,820
What's going on?

487
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,510
Young Mistress...

488
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,420
Young Mistress has gone to Chunyun House.

489
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,950
What?

490
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,040
Lord, don't panic.

491
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,780
You...

492
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,470
Go.

493
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,070
Probably something about the case was found.

494
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,740
How about this?

495
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,860
Fu Sheng and I will go and have a look.

496
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,670
We don't want to trouble you.

497
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,700
Here's the prescription.

498
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,700
Picking the medicine is more important.

499
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,340
Hurry up.

500
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,260
Let's go.

501
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,380
How's it going?

502
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,220
Is it?

503
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,380
Young Mistress.

504
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,630
Descending Lion

505
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,860
is the same as the Golden Monkey

506
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,110
we see today in terms of brushwork

507
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,030
and ink colors.

508
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,590
Is this by Li Ye?

509
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,470
It should be.

510
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,420
That's great.

511
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,350
Who is Li Ye?

512
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,550
He's such a good painter

513
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,630
but not well-known in Xichuan.

514
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,630
Li Ye is Li Zhi's grandson.

515
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,470
After Li Zhi's death,

516
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,510
his son wasn't good at painting,

517
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,820
so the family business fell into decline.

518
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,260
In Li Ye's generation,

519
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,630
his father wanted him to revitalize the family.

520
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,900
Li Ye practiced his painting skills

521
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,030
and became a painter.

522
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,190
He was from a famous family.

523
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,740
His paintings are not expensive now, are they?

524
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,860
Do you want to get a windfall again?

525
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,740
No, I don't.

526
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,110
Li Ye's paintings aren't expensive.

527
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,260
No,

528
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,900
they're worthless.

529
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,950
Every year, no one invites him

530
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,990
to the Xichuan painters' party.

531
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,860
Over time, he lost his fame.

532
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,550
His paintings have been in idle.

533
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,380
Why?

534
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,550
People said he was eccentric

535
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,420
and uncaring,

536
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,740
so no one wanted to talk to him.

537
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,780
The old gentleman who painting freely today

538
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,630
once judged him in public

539
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,630
and said he could never

540
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,780
match his grandfather

541
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,740
in any way in his life.

542
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,600
But it's a great painting,

543
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,190
so how did he end up in that?

544
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,820
Because Li Ye painted

545
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,190
a Monkey With A Hat

546
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,700
on Master Wang's birthday

547
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,990
to mock him for having only a nice look

548
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,220
instead of real skills.

549
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,510
Master Wang was so angry that he scolded Li Ye in public

550
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,900
and said that he was obsessed with women

551
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,070
and had a narrow mind.

552
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,260
Even if he was good at painting,

553
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,070
he would never become a famous artist.

554
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,590
Since then, the painters in the city

555
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,740
have not gotten along with him.

556
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,590
These painters in the city

557
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,900
are just jealous.

558
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,820
He paints better

559
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,150
than those

560
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,340
so-called famous painters

561
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:58,990
even when he's drunk.

562
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,070
Where is Li Ye now?

563
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,950
[Douhua]

564
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,790
Aren't we going to look for Li Ye?

565
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,220
Why are we eating here?

566
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,030
Please.

567
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,950
What time is it?

568
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,070
My stomach has been wailing.

569
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,260
If I don't eat,

570
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,190
I won't last long enough

571
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,470
to see Li Ye.

572
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,260
Okay. Just eat.

573
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,150
Don't forget to bring some to Wen Jue when you're done,

574
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,380
so she doesn't get upset.

575
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,670
Fu Sheng.

576
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,470
Have you ever wondered

577
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,740
why Wen Jue went to the other side of the street

578
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,220
to buy you watermelons?

579
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,470
Didn't she say so?

580
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,340
She's been eating that since she was a kid.

581
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,260
It's the best thing to eat

582
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,220
in Xichuan.

583
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,070
What's wrong?

584
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,380
Do you think that's just food?

585
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,070
Think back.

586
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,260
Since we came to Xichuan,

587
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,740
how much good food did she buy you?

588
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,420
Haven't you figured it out yet?

589
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,070
What do you mean?

590
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,420
She's trying to control your stomach with food

591
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,080
to keep you here.

592
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,430
Do I need you to remind me?

593
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
I can treat her father

594
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,900
only if I stay.

595
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,340
You still don't get it.

596
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,030
Get what?

597
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,470
He's coming.

598
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,510
Who?

599
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,420
Why don't you dance anymore?

600
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,820
No one appreciates it,

601
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,550
so I don't want to dance.

602
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,950
Is not being appreciated

603
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,070
the reason why you don't dance?

604
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,590
Well.

605
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,300
Then I'll dance.

606
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,300
Let's go.

607
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,110
Get down to business.

608
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,150
We're not waiting for Wen Jue?

609
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,860
She'll be waiting for us

610
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,150
when she gets back.

611
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,550
Let's make this quick.

612
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,550
You don't even let me eat.

613
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
Prepare ink for me.

614
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,050
Good.

615
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,010
Two coins for one cabbage.

616
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,240
Let her pay.

617
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,610
Madam, here you are.

618
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,330
Come and see.

619
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,040
Come and see.

620
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,310
He's holding a cabbage.

621
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,410
Bravo.

622
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,680
- Bravo. - Bravo.

623
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,560
- Bravo. - Bravo.

624
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,440
What's wrong, beauty?

625
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,410
You didn't dance.

626
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,850
Won't you let me dance?

627
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:07,850
It's a waste of it.

628
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,410
The painting should be framed.

629
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,930
Why?

630
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,730
It will bring you wealth.

631
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,000
Wealth?

632
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,210
What do you want?

633
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,540
Forget about wealth.

634
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,240
It's a good painting.

635
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,170
It's fake.

636
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,090
It's all fake.

637
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,650
Is the painting also fake?

638
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,580
Let's go.

639
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,760
Who are you?

640
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,050
My name is Fu Sheng.

641
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,880
I want to ask you about a painting.

642
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,800
What painting?

643
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,530
Golden Monkey.

644
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,170
My grandfather is dead.

645
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,050
You can ask him.

646
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,650
You drew the Golden Monkey.

647
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,850
Are you a painter?

648
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,050
I'm a physician.

649
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,320
Xichuan is big.

650
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,680
But only a physician admires my painting.

651
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,680
Pathetic.

652
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,810
Pathetic.

653
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,000
Why did you poison the painting?

654
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,800
I gave them a chance.

655
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,490
If they believed me,

656
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,360
they wouldn't have died.

657
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,320
Let's talk somewhere else.

658
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,170
Is there any good wine there?

659
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,410
It's better than your wine.

660
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,050
Okay.

661
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,680
What are we waiting for?

662
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,280
Go.

663
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:11,700
Take me there.

664
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,570
Keep up with him.

665
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,610
Let's go.

666
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,760
It's really good wine.

667
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,200
Good wine.

668
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,590
Do you want to drink it?

669
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:30,970
You should trade for it.

670
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:34,760
I'll just drink one bowl.

671
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,460
I'll tell you after drinking.

672
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
You've had a drink.

673
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:49,250
Tell us about it.

674
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,720
Five years ago,

675
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,160
Master Lin

676
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,320
got my painting,

677
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,720
the Golden Monkey.

678
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,400
It was his birthday.

679
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,640
So he took out the painting

680
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,160
and showed it to everyone.

681
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,930
Guess what?

682
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,280
Everyone praised it.

683
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,930
Everyone praised Li Zhi for his good painting skills

684
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,610
and the auspicious connotations of the painting.

685
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,190
I told them

686
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,280
the painting was fake,

687
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,890
and I painted the real thing.

688
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,400
Guess what?

689
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,160
Not only did no one believe me,

690
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,850
but they kicked me out.

691
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,660
Was you the one

692
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,210
who put datura flowers and aconite roots

693
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,400
in the fake Golden Monkey?

694
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,560
Yes.

695
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Using datura flowers and aconite roots as dyes

696
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,130
not only gives the painting

697
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,920
a tawny, ancient effect

698
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,250
but also makes the painting less perishable.

699
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,920
Did you

700
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,250
kill them?

701
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,130
They were fame-seekers

702
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,250
who couldn't tell the fake from the real.

703
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,210
They deserved to die.

704
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,440
So,

705
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,150
Song Jingye

706
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,730
was also killed by you, right?

707
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,040
No.

708
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:26,920
No.

709
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,610
Datura flowers and aconite roots can only cause hallucinations.

710
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,520
I heard

711
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,250
Chairman Song was cut up.

712
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,130
My hands

713
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,800
are for painting

714
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,330
and hugging beautiful women.

715
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,400
They can't kill people

716
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,330
and cut up bodies.

717
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,010
Besides,

718
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,920
I didn't go to the Lin's Mansion that night.

719
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,940
Who killed Song Jingye then?

720
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,850
They were up to no good.

721
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,640
They killed each other.

722
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,610
Who was the murderer?

723
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,090
The person at the scene

724
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,280
was the murderer.

725
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,280
Who was in the Lin's Mansion

726
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,250
that night

727
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,130
except Song Jingye and Hulu?

728
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,160
It couldn't be Hulu.

729
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,440
He wouldn't lie.

730
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,250
Don't worry.

731
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,850
We all believe in Hulu.

732
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,130
When I get back,

733
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,400
I'll ask Jiu to investigate it.

734
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,680
Fu Sheng.

735
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,330
I suddenly remembered someone

736
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,330
we had missed.

737
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,090
Do you remember

738
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,160
who found us

739
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,800
following Song Jingye?

740
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,800
Qin Shi.

741
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,740
I'll see

742
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,900
who you are.
