But you made the same choice

as the Jibei King.

you must

killed my father,

91
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,990
Su Rang set me up to kill me.

92

Sage Zhu stole the Bird Jade Plate

93
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,960
and helped me escape from the Jibei Palace.

94
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,600

95
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,550
with part of the Royal Army

96
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,520
that was still loyal to me.

97
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,720
In Xichuan,

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,470
we found the retreat

104
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,130
That's right.

105
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,160

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,720
countless treasures

107
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,080
and Star Gold weapons

108
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,550

109
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,840
We planned

110
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,520
to hide here for months

111
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,310
and then

112
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,310
go after the rebels.

113
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,280
We didn't realize the underground palace

114
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,320
wouldn't open from the inside.

115
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,570
Only the person with the Bird Jade Plate and the Painting of Luan

116
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,810
can open the underground palace

117
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,440
and get us out of there.

118
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,370
Just to be safe,

119
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,490
before I entered the underground palace,

120
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,440
I asked the Royal Army

121
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,440
to send out the jade and the painting.

122
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,880
But

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,540
no one ever came.

124
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,760
That's because Su Rang

125
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,640
forced the lord of Xichuan

126
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,090
in the name of the palace

127
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,290
to send his army

128
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,910
to kill the Royal Army.

129
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,270
That's what I thought.

130
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,880
The environment

131
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,760
is terrible.

132
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,320
During the long wait,

133
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,680
many people

134
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,680
fell ill

135
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,640
and died.

136
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,120
I was also

137
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,720
seriously ill.

138
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,840
I know I don't have long to live.

139
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,510
So I had them use illusions

140
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,080
to recreate the scenes from back then

141
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,730
so that the person who opens the underground palace

142
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,870
can learn the truth.

143
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,480
So,

144
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,060
after you entered the underground palace,

145
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,240
you were confused by the miasma here.

146
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,660
Those illusions

147
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,920
were created by us

148
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,330
with miasma that was unique to this place

149
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,760
and poisons.

150
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,280
No wonder

151
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,200
we've been seeing illusions

152
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,680
since we came in.

153
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,660
That's right.

154
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,920
We want to use these illusions.

155
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,610
First,

156
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,060
we can pass down history.

157
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,490

158
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,660
to destroy the Breakwall.

159
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,320
Second,

160
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
I want to test my successor.

why you chose me.

166
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,680
Because every choice you make

175
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,230
I didn't expect you to want to take revenge on me.

176
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,870

177

has received the grace of the Jibei King for generations.

195
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,590
Today,

196
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,590
I'll

197
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,950
fight you.

198
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,630
How dare you!

199
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,710
Sishui.

200
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,680
You now know

201
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,080
why I came to Xichuan.

202
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,710
The Jibei State has been established for more than a hundred years.

203
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,830
There may be some loyal servants

204
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,320
who come out of nowhere

205
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,350
to protect their king.

206
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,210
If I can't get rid of Liu Luan,

207
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,800
I can't sleep.

208
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,260
I'm willing to handle it.

209
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,210
Good.

210
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,400
Come on. Arrest him.

211
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,750
Madam.

212
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,680
Don't help the bad man, madam.

213
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,920
Don't do it.

214
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,830
No.

215
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,160
Don't help the bad man, madam.

216
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,830
Madam, wake up.

217
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,920
Liu Luan.

218
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,830
I don't think you're 40 yet.

219
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,080
Why are you so old?

220
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,870
I have hatred in my heart.

221
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,400
I want you to die.

222
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,110
I can't sleep.

223
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,760
You don't have to do this.

224
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,920
Isn't it good to be a useless man in the palace?

225
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,440
Maybe you can live a hundred years.

226
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,920
There are many people in the Liu family.

227
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,350
When I am dead,

228
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,400
maybe you can control the state again.

229
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
You don't have

230
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,110
to die here.

231
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,980
The Liu family

232
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,280
is royalty.

233
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,870
We'll never live under you,

234
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,200
a eunuch.

235
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,070
The winner takes all.

236
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,110
If you want to kill me, just do it.

237
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,110
Don't talk nonsense.

238
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,470
Sishui.

239
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,870
Kill them all.

240
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,280
Let's go back home.

241
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:40,580
- Long live the king. - Long live the king.

242
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:52,060
[Years later]

243
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,160
Your Majesty.

244
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,280
What is it?

245
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,160
Who rebelled?

246
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,440
The three commanderies outside Jibei.

247
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,680
They rebelled in the name

248
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,870
of restoring the Liu family's power.

249
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,110
Liu family.

250
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,560
I killed all the Lius

251
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,800
more than ten years ago.

252
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,150
There is no Liu family anymore.

253
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,080
They think

254
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,320
I don't have children,

255
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,440
so they want to fight for power.

256
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,510
They thought I didn't know who was behind them.

257
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,560
Maybe

258
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,480
that man is in the court

259
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,010
of my Jibei State.

260
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,910
Your Majesty.

261
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,080
What do we do next?

262
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,480
Kill them.

263
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,030
Kill them all.

264
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,840
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

265
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,990
I'll lead an army to quell the rebellion.

266
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,510
I'll kill them.

267
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,240
Medicine. Give me the medicine.

268
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,510
Your Majesty.

269
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,630
Japonicus is poisonous.

270
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,910
Why are you still using it?

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,870
After I became the Jibei King,

272
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,430
I handled everything personally.

273
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,840
I don't have enough energy.

274
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,520
If it weren't for that,

275
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,030
I wouldn't be able to make it this far.

276
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,960
Your Majesty, you will live a long life.

277
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,360
Go.

278
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm waiting for your good news.

279
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,120
Who's making a big noise?

280
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,360
It's you.

281
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,030
Where is Guo Sishui?

282
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,240
General Guo

283
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,670
is waiting for you in the netherworld, My Lord.

284
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,560
No, Your Majesty.

285
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,950
Your Majesty.

286
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,120
Don't keep General Guo waiting too long.

287
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,950
Am I right?

288
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,800
You...

289
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,320
I should...

290
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,520
I should have killed you back then.

291
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,080
You rat.

292
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,670
What's the point of all this?

293
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,430
The winner takes all.

294
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,710
I learned it from you.

295
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,390
How about it?

296
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,910
Do I look like you?

297
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,760
You...

298
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,840
Medicine...

299
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,390
Medicine.

300
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,600
Give me the medicine.

301
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,230
Get it yourself.

302
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,630
Give me...

303
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,490
Medicine.

304
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,120
Give me the medicine.

305
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,390
Call me father,

306
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,520
and I'll give you the medicine.

307
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,560
Rat.

308
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,320
Fu Sheng.

309
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
Why aren't you dead?

310
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,670
I see.

311
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,910
Come on.

312
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,120
I, Su Rang,

313
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,230
have never been afraid of anyone.

314
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,730
I'm also not afraid of ghosts.

315
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,840
Look at the situation.

316
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,360
You still won't give up.

317
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,800
You fought for fame and fortune all your life.

318
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,470
Is this

319
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,560
what you want?

320
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,430
I don't regret it.

321
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
I regret...

322
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,950
that I have only now

323
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,120
seen through your tricks.

324
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,560
So you've seen through it?

325
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,000
It's too late.

326
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,140
Si...

327
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,360
When did I fall for your trick?

328
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,080
From the moment you entered this place.

329
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,760
I don't regret it.

330
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,230
I'm a eunuch.

331
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,710
I'm happy

332
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,670
to get to where I am today.

333
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,410
I...

334
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,950
Your Majesty.

335
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,710
I have killed sinners.

336
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,670
Reliable servant.

337
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,630
You're my reliable servant.

338
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,630
Get up.

339
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,080
Why didn't anyone recognize his true face?

340
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,600
He was right again.

341
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,390
Looks like he's going up again.

342
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,390
Your Majesty.

343
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,040
Fu Sheng.

344
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,630
Help me.

345
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,520
Fu Sheng.

346
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,040
Twenty years ago,

347
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,560
I met someone like you.

348
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,080
Because of him,

349
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,670
I spent twenty years

350
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,600
in this dark underground palace.

351
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,520
I won't make the same mistake again.

352
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,150
Help me.

353
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,800
Fu Sheng.

354
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,600
The knife was poisoned.

355
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,470
You can't save him.

356
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:28,950
Help me.

357
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,360
Fu Sheng.

358
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,760
Am I going to die?

359
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,280
Mother.

360
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,630
Brother.

361
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,040
I saw Mother

362
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,430
again.

363
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,830
If you see anything you want to eat

364
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,840
in the Chamber of Commerce,

365
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,470
no, the whole of Xichuan,

366
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,840
just eat it.

367
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,710
You can have whatever you want.

368
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,190
What if someone kicks us out?

369
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,080
I'm in charge now.

370
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,560
It doesn't hurt.

371
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,000
It doesn't hurt.

372
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,670
What are you doing here?

373
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,950
Where's my father?

374
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,390
Su Rang rebelled.

375
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,000
We killed him.

376
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,120
Rebelled?

377
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,470
He's the Lord of the Breakwall.

378
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,630
You...

379
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,870
Come on.

380
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,910
Come on.

381
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,520
They killed Attendant Su.

382
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,430
Shoot them.

383
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,840
Wait.

384
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,950
He's fake.

385
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,390
He's fake.

386
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,600
He's impersonating me.

387
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,360
Shoot him.

388
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,600
You are the fake one.

389
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,080
Su Rang is dead.

390
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,150
Only I

391
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,390
can make Japonicus.

392
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,320
Don't resist.

393
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,670
Think about your old days.

394
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,270
Your Majesty.

395
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,430
Your Majesty, please spare me.

396
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,630
Your Majesty, please spare me.

397
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,280
I'm fake.

398
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,710
I'm fake.

399
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,040
It's Su Rang's fault.

400
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,840
Su Rang made me do it.

401
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,760
Your Majesty.

402
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,040
Your Majesty, please spare me.

403
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,710
Your Majesty.

404
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
Your Majesty, please spare me.

405
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,910
Your Majesty.

406
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,910
Get up.

407
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:49,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

408
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,950
Thank you, Your Majesty.

409
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,910
Your Majesty.

410
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm back.

411
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,760
Congratulations on your return, Your Majesty.

412
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,600
Congratulations on your return, Your Majesty.

413
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,390
Congratulations on your return, Your Majesty.

414
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,120
Congratulations on your return, Your Majesty.

415
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,760
Get up.

416
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

417
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,920
Twenty years have passed.

418
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,480
I almost forgot

419
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,520
how warm

420
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,070
the sun was on me.

421
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,870
All this time,

422
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,310
people say

423
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,720
that the person who gets the Sealed Book rules the world.

424
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,110
But I don't understand

425
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,150
the point of the Sealed Book.

426
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,840
At first,

427
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,360
I didn't understand the Sealed Book.

428
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,470
I took people into the underground palace and rummaged around.

429
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,760
We only found a lot of treasure.

430
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,630
We didn't find any books.

431
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,000
Is the legend

432
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,630
of the Sealed Book fake?

433
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,670
That's what I thought at the time.

434
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,150
Since then,

435
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,040
I've been getting depressed.

436
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,310
I sat in the empty court all day,

437
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,520
looking at the stone wall.

438
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,360
I sat there for twenty years.

439
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,760
There were countless treasures beside the stone wall.

440
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,470
One day,

441
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,840
all of a sudden,

442
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,120
I realized

443
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,050
what the Sealed Book is.

444
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,000
What is it?

445
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,040
It's the best way to run a state.

446
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,800
To a state, the people are the most important. The state comes second.

447
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,470
The ruler is the least important.

448
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,800
It's ridiculous.

449
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,840
I used to think

450
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,560
that I was the most important.

451
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,710
The world works

452
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,800
only when I'm in it.

453
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,520
Otherwise,

454
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,560
people will live in misery.

455
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,280
You,

456
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,280
to be precise,

457
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,190
most of the rulers,

458
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,950
think too much of themselves.

459
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,230
You're right.

460
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,950
It wasn't until that moment that I understood

461
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,470
it was not me

462
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,490
who kept the world running,

463
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,700
nor those treasures,

464
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,560
but the people.

465
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,840
For them,

466
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,600
as long as they have a home,

467
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,120
grain fields,

468
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,080
and livestock,

469
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,760
they can live a life

470
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,320
in peace.

471
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,230
Even without me as a king,

472
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,800
their lives wouldn't be affected.

473
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,870
The people are the most important, but that doesn't mean the king is useless.

474
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,910
You have your responsibilities.

475
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,360
You're right.

476
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,760
What I should do

477
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,710
is protect the people

478
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,080
and let them live a stable and prosperous life.

479
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,010
This

480
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,840
is what a king should do,

481
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,090
the way of running a state.

482
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,760
This

483
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,630
is the real treasure of the Sealed Book.

484
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,560
In that case,

485
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,390
I also have a Sealed Book.

486
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,150
What is it about?

487
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,080
A physician should have professional skills and a kind heart.

488
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,520
This book

489
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,360
is from my father.

490
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,230
Father, you made it.

491
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,510
You're awesome.

492
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,240
Am I good?

493
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,600
Have a taste.

494
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,030
Okay.

495
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,690
Come on.

496
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,710
Come on.

497
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,410
Come on.

498
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,000
Is it sweet?

499
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,190
Jue.

500
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,360
I'm getting old.

501
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,710
I want to retire.

502
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,800
I'll leave the Xichuan

503
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,870
to you.

504
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,280
Father.

505
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,630
You're not old.

506
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,280
Yeah, I'm not old.

507
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,080
Look.

508
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,230
You've grown up.

509
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,150
I'm relieved to hand the Xichuan

510
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,870
over to you.

511
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:42,840
Father.

512
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,420
Jue.

513
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,870
Look at Dove.

514
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,080
She's younger than you.

515
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,600
But she has become the butler of the Lord's Mansion.

516
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,760
Dove.

517
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,600
My lady.

518
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,360
My lady.

519
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,350
You've been at the clinic a lot lately.

520
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,710
I haven't seen you in a long time.

521
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,870
It's not because I've been at the clinic a lot.

522
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,520
It's because you've been busy

523
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,630
since you became the butler.

524
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,910
My father is to blame.

525
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,110
You are young. But he gave you a heavy position.

526
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,040
Thank you, my lord.

527
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,040
Not at all. Get back to work.

528
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,800
Father.

529
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,840
I can see what you mean.

530
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,080
I can take over the Xichuan.

531
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,280
However,

532
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,950
I have to get some work done first.

533
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,630
Before it's done,

534
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,670
I need you

535
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,760
to keep to your post.

536
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,840
Jue, what are you going to do?

537
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,470
I have to go.

538
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,120
Jue, you...

539
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,760
Father.

540
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,040
It may take a while before I can come back to see you.

541
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,600
See you.

542
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,630
Forget it.

543
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,000
She doesn't eat. We'll eat.

544
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,630
Jiu, have one piece.

545
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,800
Eat.

546
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,430
Eat.

547
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,190
Watermelon is cold.

548
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,280
Don't eat too much.

549
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,600
I always thought of you as my adopted son.

550
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,870
Jue and you grew up together.

551
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,800
You're brother and sister.

00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,230
Father.

553
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,400
I can't bear drinking

554
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,800
the Xinghua Wine you gave me.

555
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,600
Today is a good day.

556
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,040
I'll drink it.

Where is your master?

562
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,600
My master went out.

563
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,520
Ms. Tuoba, do you want to see him?

564
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,520
No, it's all right.

565
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,190
Please give this to him.

566
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,000
Sister, you don't know.

567
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,440
Gu is nagging.

568
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,830
He nagged and kept crying

569
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,630
at your bedside this morning.

570
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,150
He woke me up.

571
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,520
I said you need to recuperate quietly.

572
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,960
I didn't expect him to start crying silently.

573
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,670
It's so weird.

574
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,750
So I drove him out.

00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,560

I'll go to collect herbs.

577
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,480
You stay at home.

578
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,880
Are you here to collect herbs?

579
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,790
I'm planting radishes.

580
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,790
It's you.

581
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,120
Do you know me?

582
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,040
No, I don't know you.

583
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,960
Why are you planting radishes?

584
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,230
My brother told me

585
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,440
that we would never be kicked out

586
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,750
of the Chamber of Commerce.

587
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,710
I listened to him. So I didn't farm.

588
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,080
But I got kicked out.

589
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,400
I have to farm.

590
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,630
When the radish trees grow up,

591
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,920
I'll lie under them

592
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,440
and wait for the radishes to fall into my mouth.

593
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,350
When my brother comes back, he'll have food.

594
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,630
Do you think radishes grow on trees?

595
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,350
You know

596
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,040
nothing about farming.

597
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,560
You don't even know radish trees.

598
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,400
Good thing you didn't plan on planting a pig tree.

599
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,880
You didn't bury piglets in the ground.

600
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,350
Do you think I'm stupid?

601
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,440
Can you plant pigs in the field?

602
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,710
When the trees bear a lot of piglets,

603
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,080
they will shit over my head

604
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,400
as I lie under the trees.

605
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,880
When they grow into pigs,

606
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,420
they will run all over the mountain.

607
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,520
I can't catch them.

608
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,270
Hum.

609
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,230
What are you doing?

610
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,790
These are my brother's things.

611
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,230
My brother hasn't been back for a long time.

612
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,630
I miss him.

613
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,080
If I

614
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,830
plant these in the ground,

615
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,560
maybe a new brother will grow out of them.

616
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,880
Brother.

617
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,920
I miss you.

618
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:57,850
Fu Sheng.

619
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,400
Don't you want

620
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,960
to be Jibei King's physician officer?

621
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,640
Forget it.

622
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,600
I don't want to be an officer. It's not free.

623
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,630
You don't know how good that would be.

624
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,080
If I were you,

625
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,790
I would go with him.

626
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,440
You love money, don't you?

627
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,920
Jibei King gave you some gold bars.

628
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,790
Aren't you satisfied?

629
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,670
Don't even mention it.

630
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,510
Jibei King is petty.

631
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,150
He only gave me a few gold bars.

632
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,600
I thought about it last night.

633
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,000
We had many dangers

634
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,080
along the way

635
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,830
and almost died.

636
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,480
It's not worth it.

637
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,440
Forget it.

638
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm easily satisfied.

639
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,630
I'm not very rich.

640
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,230
But I have enough money

641
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,520
to buy a house and land.

642
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,040
I'll get my brothers here

643
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,270
and give them a good life.

644
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,710
Guys, what are you talking about?

645
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,960
Wen Jue, why are you so late?

646
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,630
I got stuck.

647
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,190
Let's go.

648
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,480
Wen Jue.

649
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,880
Fu Sheng and I are from Shangyi.

650
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,560
We're going home to have a look.

651
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,120
Why do you want to go with us?

652
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,790
We will go to Shangyi first.

653
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,350
Then, we'll go to the Central Plains.

654
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,560
The Central Plains?

655
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,710
Don't you know?

656
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,600
What are we going to do?

657
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,480
I heard that my master appeared in the Central Plains.

658
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,830
If we can

659
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,520
take him to Xichuan,

660
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,710
we can save Yingying.

661
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,520
Really?

662
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,750
I've never lied to you.

663
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,230
All right. Let's go.

664
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,150
The sun is going down.

665
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,400
