I also have three reasons

to be a part of the investigation.

Fu Sheng,

73
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,360
my reasons are logical.

are all genuine.

78

- What reasons... - First,

79
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm the clerk of the county.

80
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,320
Autopsy is within my duty.

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,120

As his son,

I'm obligated to find the murderer and revenge my father.

and this is the most important one,

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,950
I'm a suspect in this case,

87
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,400

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,100
My lord,

192
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,620
we've never seen that thing you want.

193
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,230
Please have mercy.

194
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,070
- Spare us, my lord! - We've never seen it!

195
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,100
Please have mercy.

196
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,180
We are speaking the truth, my lord!

197
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,100
We've never seen that, my lord!

198
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,660
Sir.

199
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,950
- We've never seen it! - My lord, we really haven't!

200
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,100
We really haven't!

201
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,790
Don't hurt my mom!

202
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,580
Kiddo,

203
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,580
have you seen the thing I'm looking for?

204
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,420
No.

205
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,990
I really want to find what I've lost.

206
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,510
You shouldn't lie to me.

207
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,710
No, I haven't seen it.

208
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,950
Really?

209
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,230
Yes.

210
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,150
We've never seen something like that,

211
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,660
my lord!

212
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,950
What a pity.

213
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,470
You've seen my face.

214
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,230
My lord!

215
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,030
We've seen nothing!

216
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,340
My lord!

217
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,950
I've seen nothing!

218
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,420
My lord!

219
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,750
My lord!

220
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,900
[Clinic]

221
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,060
[Medicine Hut]

222
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,890
Is this Physician Zhang's clinic?

223
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,910
Yes.

224
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,610
You are late.

225
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,780
My master has passed away.

226
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,260
This city

227
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,510
will never get another gynecological master like him.

228
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,370
Master!

229
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,790
You shouldn't have suffered so much!

230
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,070
My man, I'm not looking for him.

231
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,480
I'm looking for you.

232
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,290
Master! You...

233
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:13,830
What?

234
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,750
You are looking for me.

235
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,940
What kind of medicine could be so powerful?

236
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,460
How come my father's expression

237
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,660
looks different from the others?

238
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,940
Fu Sheng!

239
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,700
Fu Sheng.

240
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,830
Why is Wen Jue waiting outside?

241
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,940
She refused when I asked her to come in together,

242
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,460
and said I should also stay outside.

243
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,150
I wasn't sure

244
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,940
about what kind of the poison is in this room

245
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,150
and I was afraid she'd touch it accidentally,

246
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,590
so I asked her to wait outside.

247
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,980
Am I going to be okay?

248
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,110
Yes.

249
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,150
I've figured out the source of the poison.

250
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,310
As long as you don't drink it,

251
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,550
nothing's going to happen.

252
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,310
Good.

253
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,790
Oh, right!

254
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,910
I brought you the guy.

255
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,440
Dr. Fu.

256
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,110
Liu Ji,

257
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,910
do you know

258
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,040
the ingredients of the medicinal tea?

259
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,390
The gang

260
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,940
bought the ingredients together.

261
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,150
A few days ago, my master learned

262
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,550
from the Eastern Market

263
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,700
that some merchant

264
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,500
is selling a batch of rare medicine at low prices.

265
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,910
The amount was huge

266
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,310
and he couldn't seal the deal himself.

267
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,500
That's why

268
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,400
he told the other physicians

269
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,860
and they bought the medicines together.

270
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,740
After they got the medicines,

271
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,740
they noticed changes in the smells.

272
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,590
Physician Fu brought everyone together to discuss

273
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,350
if the properties of the medicines have changed

274
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,410
and if they can be used.

275
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,100
Could the medicines have been poisoned?

276
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,960
Oh!

277
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,120
I brought some.

278
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,050
Here.

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,160
Is the seller

280
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,290
still in Shangyi?

281
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,090
Their young master got sick a few days ago

282
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,680
and stayed in our clinic.

283
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,490
My master diagnosed him.

284
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:25,420
[Fu's Medicine Clinic]

285
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,500
Leader!

286
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,260
What are you doing here?

287
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,280
Leader,

288
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,470
maybe we should drop this deal.

289
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,410
What happened?

290
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,420
These people don't have a moral compass.

291
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,870
They'll get us in huge trouble.

292
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,740
Stop beating around the bush.

293
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,130
Be straight with me. What is this?

294
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,050
They killed everyone in Physician Zhang's house.

295
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,460
What?

296
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,180
Where are they?

297
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,330
They just went to Physician Liu's place.

298
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,410
Stop!

299
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,850
Why are you killing people?

300
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,460
They don't have what I'm looking for.

301
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,940
Why keep their lives?

302
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,850
You treat the lives of the people of Shangyi like nothing.

303
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,650
I'm dropping this gig.

304
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,370
Let's go.

305
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,220
Don't come after me when you're a ghost.

306
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,740
He's the one who killed you.

307
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,090
Since you are turning the gig down,

308
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,210
I'll handle things my way.

309
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,770
I wonder how many lives

310
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,450
will my sword take.

311
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,890
Did I get under your skin?

312
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,670
Listen up.

313
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,680
You don't need to keep on this killing spree.

314
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,010
I'll get you what you want as soon as possible.

315
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,330
What do you say?

316
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,840
Hurry up, then.

317
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,730
I'm not a man of patience.

318
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,060
Keep him close.

319
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:55,920
Yes.

320
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,810
Leader, what should we do?

321
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,200
Leave with my brothers

322
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,440
and hide them for the time being.

323
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,840
But

324
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,090
what about that guy?

325
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,570
He did kill all the familiar members

326
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,290
of the deceased physicians.

327
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,070
If we can't get him what he wants,

328
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,480
- then... - Then not only will we die,

329
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,790
but family members of all physicians in Shangyi

330
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,230
will meet their miserable fate.

331
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,480
Leader,

332
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,440
should we...

333
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,650
We'll have to move fast

334
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,110
for the sake of all those innocent lives.

335
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Time to go!

336
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,570
Hold on!

337
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,680
Who's standing in the way?

338
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,910
I need to talk to your boss.

339
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,380
Stop!

340
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,440
Guys,

341
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,870
let's not get rough here.

342
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,170
I apologize for the tension.

343
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,480
Our caravan encountered bandits before,

344
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,850
that's why the guys

345
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,060
has been vigilant lately.

346
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,210
You must be their young master.

347
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,370
Yours truly.

348
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,360
Are you the one who sold all those medicines

349
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,500
with low prices in Shangyi?

350
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,440
Our caravan was looted

351
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,880
and all our medicines were lost.

352
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,290
The medicines must have come from them.

353
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,350
Your caravan

354
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,650
is fully staffed.

355
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,760
How did the bandits pull it off so easily?

356
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,600
You don't know the whole truth.

357
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
The bandits have excellent combat skills

358
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,160
and are well organized.

359
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,850
They retreated in an instant after they got the medicines.

360
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,790
My security head didn't get to chase them.

361
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,000
They are not new to this.

362
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,440
I did notice that the bandit leader

363
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,330
was wearing heavy armor.

364
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,410
He doesn't seem to be an ordinary bandit.

365
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,130
I don't think the answer

366
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,330
is too complicated.

367
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,330
Zhao Sihu, one of the four pests,

368
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,130
is the only one with a team

369
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,200
equipped with horses.

370
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,330
I think we just need to find him

371
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,690
and ask him in person.

372
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,920
Why haven't the bandits come yet?

373
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,790
Are you sure they're here?

374
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,700
It can't be.

375
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,000
They should

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,840
have arrived by now.

377
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,070
You mean those masked men,

378
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,440
the bandits,

379
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,600
always rob along this road?

380
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,120
You are just sitting back and waiting.

381
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,160
Here they are.

382
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
It took so long.

383
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,400
We're here.

384
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,030
Here.

385
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,840
We're friends.

386
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,600
I thought he had some tricks.

387
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,080
But he's just a fool.

388
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,200
What's going on?

389
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,870
Gu Tian.

390
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,230
If you have anything to save your life, take it.

391
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,540
Are you okay?

392
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:46,620
Move.

393
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,140
When County Magistrate Yang sees this,

394
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,190
he will know I'm in danger

395
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,540
and the backup will be here soon.

396
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,540
You think we can hold that long?

397
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,070
We are friends.

398
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,830
Don't...

399
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,630
Sorry.

400
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,830
It's you.

401
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,020
The armor! You are the fake bandit who stole the herbs.

402
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,220
I will die anyway,

403
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,190
so does it matter who kills me?

404
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,950
Let's go.

405
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,780
Forward!

406
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,920
Let's go.

407
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,460
Retreat!

408
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,540
They're not Shangyi's rescuers.

409
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,870
They're real bandits.

410
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,390
What should we do?

411
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,020
Long time no see, Crazy Fu.

412
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,510
Didn't expect you would have this day.

413
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,020
Dismount and take off your clothes.

414
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,980
[Zhao Sihu]

415
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,560
Nice.

416
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,750
I should have seen you again yesterday.

417
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,590
But I was occupied.

418
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,780
How are you feeling these days?

419
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,070
Feel the same.

420
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,460
I can't get the energy to do anything.

421
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,780
Not even interested in robbing people.

422
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,950
If I hadn't heard that

423
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,580
you had this problem,

424
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,050
I would be drinking in the village right now.

425
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,620
You're drinking again?

426
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,130
No, I'm not.

427
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:04,940
I just

428
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,250
took a little sip.

429
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,740
You can ask them.

430
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,060
How much did he drink?

431
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,980
No, stop.

432
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,650
Easy.

433
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,330
Stop yelling.

434
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,210
Listen.

435
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,300
The heart is to circulate blood,

436
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,060
and the liver is to keep it.

437
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,510
This liver conflicts with alcohol.

438
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,680
Your internal organs are already at the end of their strength.

439
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,480
If you still don't listen to me,

440
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,860
you won't survive the end of the month.

441
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,020
This life is your own.

442
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,460
But when you go out, don't tell others

443
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,780
that I saved you.

444
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,990
I can't afford to lose face.

445
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,780
I told you I had palpitations and couldn't breathe.

446
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,020
But you aimed at my liver.

447
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,950
If your liver is damaged, your heart will also be affected.

448
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,950
That's why I don't let you drink, okay?

449
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,940
Alright, alright.

450
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,590
Crazy Fu.

451
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,060
No.

452
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,180
Physician Fu.

453
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,590
I saved you.

454
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,710
So

455
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,140
you won't charge me, right?

456
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,870
Sure.

457
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,270
It's not fair.

458
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,630
It's fine. His words make sense.

459
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,710
Are you silly?

460
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,270
Who do you think you are?

461
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,990
These people are kidnapping and extorting people

462
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,110
under your name.

463
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,850
If it weren't for us,

464
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,100
you would have been blamed.

465
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,630
So this time you saved us

466
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,820
and it can be even,

467
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,390
but you should pay him

468
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,430
for the treatment.

469
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,940
This is the first time

470
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,630
I've heard of such a thing.

471
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,820
Take them back

472
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,510
and torture them.

473
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,060
I want to see

474
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,220
who has the guts

475
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,180
to do this.

476
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,980
Here.

477
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,430
Leader.

478
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,030
Troops from Shangyi are coming soon.

479
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,750
Guys.

480
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,220
Farewell.

481
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,510
Let's go.

482
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,460
No wonder you dared to meet Zhao Sihu.

483
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,790
You two had such a connection.

484
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,580
I repaid the favor Zhao Sihu did

485
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,910
for saving us today,

486
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,910
so you two

487
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,580
should also owe me a favor.

488
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,860
Now you become smart.

489
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,750
Fine.

490
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,470
But my favor is valuable,

491
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,020
don't waste it.

492
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,780
I know.

493
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,950
Physician Fu.

494
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,230
I almost forgot your father's instructions.

495
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,090
He asked me to give this to you.

496
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,150
Bye.

497
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,510
What's this?

498
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,670
My father's medical book.

499
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,430
I left it there.

500
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,320
Sir.

501
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,080
This time we are defeated.

502
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,750
This is the first time we've lost so many men.

503
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,020
Go.

504
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,240
Block all the intersections in Shangyi.

505
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,080
As long as this person is in Shangyi,

506
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,790
we have a chance.

507
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,440
Yes.

508
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,790
What do you mean?

509
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,480
That's what I want to ask you.

510
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,100
I've been following Fu Sheng,

511
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,460
just testing him.

512
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,480
Now I'm sure the jade plate is with him.

513
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,030
I'll go back to him for dinner later.

514
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:26,840
And then...

515
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,390
Do you think I will still believe you?

516
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,970
No.

517
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,810
But it's your only chance.

518
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,550
You're back.

519
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,810
Come on then.

520
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,620
Here.

521
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,500
Try this.

522
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:02,820
Eat.

523
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,680
Fu Sheng, I want to ask you a favor.

524
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,390
We're friends.

525
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,480
You don't have to ask.

526
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,510
Just say it.

527
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,600
Can I borrow your

528
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,600
Bird Jade Plate?

529
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,510
How do you know the Bird Jade Plate?

530
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,030
What are you going to do with it?

531
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,030
Lend it to me or not?

532
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,080
I've helped you much.

533
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,750
You can't just pretend to be stupid.

534
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,930
They all say I'm crazy,

535
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,770
but I don't think you're any better than me.

536
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,620
You came to my place to grab things

537
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,500
and you are still so tough?

538
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,690
So you won't lend it to me.

539
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,650
You are on the same side.

540
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,340
Fu Sheng.

541
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,380
My final advice to you.

542
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,300
Hand over the Bird Jade Plate

543
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,940
and I will let you go.

544
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,220
I didn't expect you could do this.

545
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,850
I saw you as a friend.

546
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,820
But you are here for the plate, too.

547
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,300
A man is innocent,

548
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,490
but guilty of possessing a treasure.

549
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,180
Hand it over.

550
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,820
Stop hurting innocent people.

551
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,220
You killed my father?

552
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,610
Sort of.

553
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,220
And you also killed those physicians

554
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,060
and their families?

555
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,730
Now you know how worthy these things are.

556
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,820
Yeah.

557
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,420
And then?

558
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,970
I'm not giving it to you.

559
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,890
Then don't blame me

560
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,420
for being rude.

561
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,580
You do have some tricks.

562
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,420
Thank you

563
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,850
for helping me take down two losers.

564
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,820
Don't get me wrong.

565
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,610
I never kill anyone.

566
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,540
They just fainted.

567
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,610
Gu Tian.

568
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:44,940
Gu Tian.

569
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,420
We've known each other for a while.

570
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,700
I'm warning you

571
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,490
My Ghost Needle has something.

572
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,650
Ghost Needle?

573
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,010
Isn't that something from the tale?

574
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,890
Hurry up.

575
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,220
You want to die with him?

576
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,420
Do it!

577
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,420
Take him!

578
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,940
It's a mess, huh?

579
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,890
You little brat,

580
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,460
dare to fight against us?

581
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,370
It's a good trick.

582
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,070
You performed well.

583
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,670
I have something to confess to you.

584
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,910
Tell me.

585
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,980
The man pretending to be a bandit

586
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,740
came after your Bird Jade Plate.

587
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,670
Jade plate?

588
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,370
How did he know it?

589
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,920
Wait, you know it too?

590
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,330
You know

591
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,170
what I

592
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,660
live on.

593
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,090
My men heard about these outsiders,

594
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,420
and they were looking for

595
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,020
a Bird Jade Plate with a high reward.

596
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,690
I happened to see it

597
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,090
in your medicine box,

598
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,900
and wanted to make a fortune,

599
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,810
so I planned to steal your plate.

600
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,380
No wonder you looked so wrong.

601
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,500
You approached Fu Sheng

602
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,260
just for that plate thing?

603
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,620
At first I was.

604
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,140
But

605
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,900
I never told anyone

606
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,970
that you have the jade plate.

607
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,320
But I didn't expect

608
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,450
those people

609
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,530
would be so cruel.

610
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,000
They killed many people

611
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
for the jade plate.

612
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,560
I realized something was wrong,

613
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,040
but he threatened me with more innocent lives,

614
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,450
so I could only pretend to obey.

615
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,590
What are you going to do?

616
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,570
I need your help.

617
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
They disguised as bandits to launch attack,

618
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,760
so their target is you.

619
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,760
We can only take the initiative

620
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,110
and never let him leave Shangyi.

621
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,590
Alright.

622
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,070
I'll help you.

623
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,580
[Fair and Impartial]

624
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,100
Looks like you picked the wrong path.

625
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,510
No, you chose the wrong path.

626
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,300
Within the three-day deadline,

627
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,580
Fu Sheng fulfilled his mission

628
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,150
and found the real culprit for the death of the physicians.

629
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,340
He's also the thief who pretended to be a bandit and kidnapped the caravan

630
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,860
and attacked us on the way.

631
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,060
Yes.

632
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,020
He has just admitted the guilt

633
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,100
in his confession.

634
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,230
The taste

635
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,860
of those medicinal herbs

636
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,780
changed after they were poisoned.

637
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,510
And the herbs the physicians used

638
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,900
to make medicinal tea

639
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,820
were the poison that killed them.

640
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,190
Suspect,

641
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,620
do you plead guilty?

642
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,750
He's telling the truth.

643
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,620
Well.

644
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,390
Since you confessed.

645
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,470
Guards!

646
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,950
Let him sign.

647
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,100
Wait.

648
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,580
Sir.

649
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,430
I have a piece of evidence in my arms.

650
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,230
Do you want to see it?

651
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,020
Don't play tricks on me.

652
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,820
For your future, sir,

653
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,990
I suggest you

654
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,580
to take a look at it yourself.

655
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,580
Don't you dare?

656
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,060
Why don't I dare?

657
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,660
[Jibei King]

658
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,230
Forgive me...

659
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,020
Untie him, now!

660
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,880
Magistrate Yang, what do you mean?

661
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,580
The little Xichuan.

662
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,150
You're so arrogant.

663
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,340
How dare you?

664
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,020
Shut up!

665
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,020
Princess.

666
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,750
[Jibei King]
This is the official

667
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,430
sent by the Jibei Mansion.

668
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,540
Though Xichuan, to which you belong,

669
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,910
is also an independent country,

670
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,390
it is still a small vassal state,

671
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,300
its strength is far inferior

672
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,060
to that of Jibei State.

673
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,160
Princess.

674
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,910
Don't bring

675
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,620
unnecessary trouble upon Xichuan.

676
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,060
What king?

677
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,190
Jibei King?

678
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,020
I told you

679
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,830
you chose the wrong path.

680
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,530
I was blind.

681
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,970
I believe you're generous.

682
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,690
Don't blame me.

683
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,450
Your look now

684
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,690
is quite cute.

685
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,690
We can talk

686
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,210
later.

687
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,450
Why did the Jibei King kill my father?

688
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,930
Fu Sheng, what are you talking about?

689
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,040
But they did it.

690
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,040
They also robbed caravans

691
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,080
and sold the stolen herbs at low prices in Shangyi.

692
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,000
How dare you?

693
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,170
He's right.

694
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,650
Try it.

695
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,410
Fu Sheng!

696
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,840
How about it?

697
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,320
It's not poisonous.

698
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,410
It doesn't make sense.

699
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,690
Because this drug

700
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:55,890
is not toxic at all.

701
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,760
There was

702
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,520
a mysterious group lurking in Jibei for years,

703
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,760
plotting a rebellion,

704
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,210
and the mansion

705
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,560
had long been eyeing them.

706
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,560
Among them was an important figure,

707
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,800
who was meticulous and good at disguise.

708
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,210
He settled in Shangyi as a physician.

709
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,170
He was poisoned strangely, so he was immune to all poisons.

710
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,560
Only this medicine called Quexian

711
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,760
could force out the strange poison in his body.

712
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,410
Others won't be poisoned if they eat this.

713
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,690
I wanted to use this trick to lure this man out,

714
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,600
but he poisoned

715
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,970
all the physicians

716
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,410
and confuse the public.

717
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,080
What a cruel person!

718
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,040
But they're already dead,

719
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,730
why does he still hide his identity?

720
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,600
Because he stole

721
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,520
an important thing from the mansion.

722
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,950
Do you know what it is?

723
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,630
Sir.

724
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,300
I want an autopsy.

725
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,280
Well...

726
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,350
Let him.

727
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,280
Don't escape with the treasure.

728
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,240
Send two men to keep an eye on him.

729
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,520
I'm on it now.

730
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,310
After examining so many bodies,

731
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,520
have you found anything?

732
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,520
What do you mean?

733
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,480
It's the heart.

734
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,590
From the extent of damage to their organs,

735
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,550
I could tell

736
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,960
they had been poisoned.

737
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,960
The poison entered the blood from the stomach

738
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,520
and then to the heart.

739
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,390
My father's blood contains a strange poison,

740
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,390
which will be activated once it meets with Quexian,

741
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,480
and become a deadly poison.

742
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,110
So my father's organs are least affected,

743
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,720
which explains why his expression

744
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,040
is different from those people.

745
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,760
I don't get it. Why?

746
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,550
It means

747
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,000
The man they are looking for is my father.

748
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,760
He knew he was going to die,

749
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,390
so he gathered the physicians,

750
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,150
shared ancient prescriptions,

751
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,630
and finally killed them.

752
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,590
But I really don't understand,

753
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,280
if he knew he was going to die,

754
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,350
why didn't he take refuge?

755
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,390
So many lives were gone

756
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,760
just like that.

757
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,010
Because of the Bird Jade Plate in your hand.

758
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,550
The Bird Jade Plate?

759
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,490
Mr. Ruan.

760
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,220
I didn't recognize you today.

761
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,090
Please accept my apologies.

762
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,820
I will take Fu Sheng away

763
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,230
after he finishes the autopsy.

764
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,670
Mr. Ruan.

765
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,990
I checked

766
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,100
the warrants issued by the imperial court before,

767
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,860
and Fu Sheng doesn't seem to be on them.

768
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,510
What do you mean?

769
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,590
After all, Fu Sheng

770
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,970
is a person under my jurisdiction.

771
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:21,780
And the murderer of physicians has not been found yet.

772
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,000
I think it's not the right time

773
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,890
to let him leave.

774
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,690
You mean that

775
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,270
the mansion needs to report to you

776
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,210
when carrying out missions?

777
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,140
Let me tell you.

778
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,300
No matter what his autopsy says,

779
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,780
I'm taking him away.

780
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,350
Yes.

781
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,140
I shouldn't say that.

782
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,090
Sir.

783
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,940
She has not woken up since giving birth.

784
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,290
Her body is burning hot.

785
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,700
Didn't Fu Sheng prescribe her medicine?

786
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,020
Ask someone to get it

787
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,280
and bring it back for her to drink.

788
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,520
Yes.

789
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,790
Mr. Ruan.

790
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,930
Sorry.

791
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,110
She disturbed our fun.

792
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,680
Here.

793
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,680
Let's drink.

794
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,550
I heard you are quite good

795
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,630
at being an official.

796
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,820
I've carried it with me since I was a child.

797
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,210
What's so special about it?

798
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,590
My father always had this book in his hand before,

799
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,270
but it ended up in Zhao Sihu's hands.

800
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,880
Could the secret be in this book?

801
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,530
But the medicinal materials in the book

802
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,640
are all incompatible with each other,

803
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,640
and even the order of performing the treatment is wrong.

804
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,630
But my father's skills were good.

805
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,730
He wouldn't make such small mistakes.

806
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,400
Is there another mystery?

807
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,450
Dark ink, strong smell.

808
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,730
These comments are new.

809
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,530
I didn't realize there were people

810
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,680
you could amass so much wealth

811
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,880
in this small place.

812
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,160
Sir, I know I was wrong.

813
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,840
I'm sorry.

814
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,250
What's your fault?

815
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,530
I admire your ability

816
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,600
to amass wealth.

817
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,970
I wonder if Mr. Yang

818
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,120
would be willing to be my friend.

819
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,730
I... I couldn't ask for more.

820
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:18,920
Couldn't ask for more.

821
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,290
Here.

822
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,360
Sir, take a seat.

823
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,530
I told you that you're good at this.

824
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,680
Sir.

825
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,160
Have some tea, please.

826
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,530
After drinking the tea,

827
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,810
then the gift...

828
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,050
It's all yours.

829
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,320
It's all yours.

830
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,360
You're a good man.

831
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,810
If you cut off my source of wealth,

832
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,590
I will cut off your life.

833
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,830
Here,

834
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,920
I'm the king.

835
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,120
You dare to threaten me?

836
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,160
Die.

837
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,790
Sir, Sir, Sir!

838
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,210
What's the rush?

839
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,100
Sir, your lady is dying.

840
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,050
She's dying now.

841
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,050
Let's go.

842
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,130
My lady.

843
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,100
My lady!

844
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,530
My lady.

845
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,650
Madam.

846
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,920
Is Fu Sheng's prescription not working?

847
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,400
At first I thought

848
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,760
she had caught a cold,

849
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,740
but she kept having a high fever.

850
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,130
When I wiped her body,

851
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,090
I found that pus and blood were oozing from the place

852
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,290
where Crazy Fu had operated on her.

853
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,210
I began to think

854
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,850
maybe this ties back to Crazy Fu?

855
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,940
You Crazy Fu.

856
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,170
I have been kind to you,

857
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,260
but you want to murder my wife.

858
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,490
If that is the case,

859
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,170
don't blame me for being strange.

860
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,570
Help! Someone is killed!

861
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:40,780
Let's save them.
