Apricot Kernel and Perilla Powder.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,070
It's used to treat colds.

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,210
As expected, the blessed water is just a disguise.

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,770
The medicine is in the copper pot.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,120
They only know this one remedy.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,030
But they are treating people.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,960
That's why they can only treat colds

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,280
and can't treat other diseases.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,310
You're right.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,030
The three Heavenly Tutors asked us

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,200
to use the heart-eater grass unique to the Tianyi tribe

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,630
to make the poisonous fog,

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,200
pretending to be the Hole Ghost

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,850
to snatch babies under the age of one year

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,930
to expand our tribe.

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,600
I thought the Tianyi tribe would get better and better.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,430
However, I found out that they were trying to control the Tianyi tribe

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,900
to make a profit for themselves.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,280
Are you coming to us

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,160
to get rid of those three witch doctors?

21
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,080
We are going to hold a blessing ceremony

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,110
for the babies who join our tribe.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,310
I'd like to ask you

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,110
to expose those witch doctors in public.

25
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,240
Now that you know their evil deeds,

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,550
why don't you expose them?

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,080
The witch doctors have been here for more than a decade.

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,310
Their God's Blessing scam

29
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,110
deceived a generation of the Tianyi tribe.

30
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,640
In the Tianyi tribe, they are the embodiment of the gods.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,390
Even if you tell everyone

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,320
the truth,

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,810
they won't believe it.

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,740
Are you saying

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,600
the people of the Tianyi tribe

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,520
don't believe you?

37
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,000
Exactly.

38
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,800
That's true.

39
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Did you forget it? They said the people you healed

40
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,910
were healed by the gods.

41
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,830
Yeah.

42
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,030
What should we do?

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,080
Only by letting the people of the Tianyi tribe know

44
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,390
who the witch doctors really are

45
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,520
will they understand

46
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,110
that they have been deceived.

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,470
Okay.

48
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,310
We'll take care of it.

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,480
But we have a question.

50
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,770
What is it?

51
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,830
Five years ago, you snatched a baby

52
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,240
in the Chang's Mansion.

53
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,990
A doorman chased you.

54
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,200
His name is Song Yuan.

55
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,150
Do you know him?

56
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,760
He was the first warrior before you

57
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,430
to brave the fog

58
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,640
and retrieve a child.

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,200
Although he was poisoned by the heart-eater grass,

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,040
he got out.

61
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,270
When he was about to die,

62
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,920
our people

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,250
took away the Mountain-shaped Jade from him

64
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,940
and gave it to the Heavenly Tutors.

65
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,080
Anyway, he broke out of the fog. We don't know if he was dead or alive.

66
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,430
Is the Mountain-shaped Jade in the Tianyi tribe?

67
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,730
If you can get rid of the witch doctors for us,

68
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,460
I can call the shots

69
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,240

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,560
I cast the spell to make the ghost appear.

189
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,920
Look.

190
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
There is a ghost.

191
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,680
Die.

192
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,590
Immortal.

193
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:12,820
What's wrong with you?

194
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,800
Last night...

195
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,270
Last night, I ran 1500 kilometers.

196
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,490
I'm exhausted.

197
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,590
I fought the Hole Ghost

198
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,350
for four hours

199
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
to take back the baby.

200
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,320
I had severe internal injuries.

201
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,080
Just now,

202
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,470
I used all my skills

203
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,870
to expel the ghost in the baby.

204
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm afraid

205
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,920
I'm going to die.

206
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,800
Immortal.

207
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,280
Thank you

208
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,830
for everything.

209
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,160
Immortal, tell us.

210
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
What can we do to save you?

211
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,990
There is only one medicine

212
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,870
that can save me.

213
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,830
But it's very expensive.

214
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,350
I can't afford it.

215
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,560
Forget it.

216
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,990
It's my destiny.

217
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,750
Honey, get the money.

218
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,870
Get all our money.

219
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,510
Immortal.

220
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,400
It's all we have.

221
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,800
I know it's not enough.

222
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,110
I'll raise money for you.

223
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,080
Take it first.

224
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,710
No.

225
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,020
I can't take it.

226
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,990
Immortal, you almost lost your life

227
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,510
trying to save our baby.

228
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,470
You must take it.

229
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,800
Otherwise, we won't sleep well.

230
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,200
I...

231
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,710
Immortal, please take it.

232
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,440
I...

233
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,320
All right. I'll take it.

234
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,560
Please stop here. I don't want others to see me.

235
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,230
What are you afraid of?

236
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,040
Immortal, you got my baby back.

237
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,320
I'll tell everyone in the slums

238
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,080
what you did.

239
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,510
Don't.

240
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,630
Please don't do that.

241
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,160
I forgot to tell you.

242
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,830
The Hole Ghost

243
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,990
comes every month on the 15th.

244
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,960
I wounded him this time.

245
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,230
He dares not get back at me.

246
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,710
But he would get back at you.

247
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,960
Maybe the next time he comes,

248
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,440
he will not only snatch your baby

249
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,040
but also hurt you.

250
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,080
Immortal.

251
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,590
What should we do?

252
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,870
You'd better move out of here

253
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
and leave Xichuan.

254
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,280
Don't tell anyone your baby is back.

255
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,400
In case you get into trouble.

256
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,680
I...

257
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,320
What's wrong?

258
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,400
What's more important than life?

259
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,680
All right.

260
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,710
Immortal, we'll do what you say.

261
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,040
Good for you.

262
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,080
People of the Tianyi tribe.

263
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,940
Yesterday, Fu Sheng touched his sick body

264
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,040
when the gods appeared.

265
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,470
He pissed the gods off.

266
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,840
The gods don't save those who do not respect him.

267
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,230
So, this young man got sick again.

268
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,750
The gods love people.

269
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,590
I'll make the sick ghost show up

270
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,980
and expel it.

271
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,480
Expel it.

272
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,580
Expel it.

273
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,690
Bring Fu Sheng up.

274
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,280
Expel it.

275
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,100
Expel it.

276
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,640
Go.

277
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,920
Expel it.

278
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,820
- Expel it. - Expel it.

279
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,690
Expel it.

280
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,240
Go.

281
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,590
Did you see it?

282
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,710
The sick ghost showed up.

283
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,160
Put out the fire.

284
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,080
Ashes would trigger his asthma.

285
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,320
The sick ghost found his ally again.

286
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
I'll invite the gods

287
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,510
to expel the ghost.

288
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,080
This smell is familiar.

289
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,350
The earth is under the feet, and the sky is above the head.

290
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,560
Set up the incense table to invite the gods.

291
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,080
Gods, bless us.

292
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,370
I'll show you the gods.

293
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,830
I'll show you the gods.

294
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,510
There are really gods in this world.

295
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,200
There is a sick ghost in him.

296
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,590
It got its ally here to make trouble.

297
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,040
All internal organs are gates.

298
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,470
The good and the bad meet here.

299
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,510
Gods, please help us.

300
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,230
Please expel the ghost in the Tianyi tribe.

301
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,320
You'll strangle him.

302
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,870
Out of the way.

303
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,510
Fu Sheng.

304
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,710
You're really the ally of the sick ghost.

305
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,960
How dare you interrupt my spellcasting?

306
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,270
No. The sick ghost comes back.

307
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,510
Gods, please help me.

308
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,790
Help me.

309
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,960
Here are doubles of the gods.

310
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,160
They're only half as powerful.

311
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,160
If this continues,

312
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,440
the Tianyi Tribe will be under the shadow of the sick ghost

313
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
and destroyed.

314
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,510
Please help me.

315
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,100
Help me.

316
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,600
The sick ghost entered your body.

317
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,510
Are you all right?

318
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,160
I'm fine.

319
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,750
It means

320
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,750
he's deceiving everyone.

321
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,750
Let's take him away.

322
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,400
Okay.

323
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,270
Aren't you afraid of the ghost? Out of my way.

324
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,680
Fu Sheng is the sick ghost.

325
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,030
Catch Fu Sheng.

326
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,610
Catch Fu Sheng.

327
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,620
Stop.

328
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,850
Hurry.

329
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,750
Stop.

330
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,680
Immortal.

331
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,840
Immortal, what's wrong with you?

332
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,790
I fell.

333
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,470
Who are you?

334
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,920
How could you do this to him?

335
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,160
Tell them about it, Immortal Wang.

336
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,200
Tell them how you tricked them

337
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,160
into giving you all the money.

338
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,510
He has the ability.

339
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,990
My wife and I saw it with our own eyes.

340
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,660
Kid, don't talk nonsense.

341
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,640
Look.

342
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,270
Look how miserable they are.

343
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,440
He was willing to believe me.

344
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,790
Are you a liar?

345
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,360
I wouldn't say that.

346
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,550
I just played some tricks

347
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,930
to make some money.

348
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,440
No way.

349
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,780
I heard a knock on the door but didn't see you.

350
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,200
I saw the ghost you caught

351
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,470
on the yellow paper.

352
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,880
Draw a ghost with alkaline water

353
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,200
on the paper.

354
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
When the alkaline water is dried up,

355
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,120
the ghost disappears.

356
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,600
Then, spray turmeric water on the paper.

357
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,920
The ghost will appear.

358
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,510
He tricked you.

359
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,200
Here's your money.

360
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,680
This is all that's left.

361
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,840
He spent all the other money.

362
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,360
You liar.

363
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,320
Get up.

364
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,600
Get up.

365
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,090
You stole my baby?

366
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,200
It was the Hole Ghost, to be precise.

367
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,230
The Hole Ghost stole your baby.

368
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,600
Then, he pretended to be a Heavenly Tutor and sent him back.

369
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,030
Their purpose is to make money.

370
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,520
Do you remember

371
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,990
what he asked you to do last night?

372
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,920
You'd better move out of here

373
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,270
and leave Xichuan.

374
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,470
Don't tell anyone your baby is back.

375
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
In case you get into trouble.

376
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,200
Nonsense.

377
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,920
You fooled me.

378
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,990
Now I know why you were afraid

379
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,310
people would see you.

380
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,200
You want the people you cheated out of all their money

381
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,790
to leave their homes.

382
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,070
You're awful.

383
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,360
You liar.

384
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,550
I'll kill you.

385
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,880
I'll kill you.

386
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,960
If you kill him,

387
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,120
you'll be a murderer.

388
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,440
You just got your baby back.

389
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,710
Think about it.

390
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,710
He stole my baby.

391
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,400
I can't calm my anger unless I kill him.

392
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,230
I asked you not to kill him.

393
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,510
I didn't ask you not to hit him.

394
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,880
Wait.

395
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,270
Screw you.

396
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,310
We can't go on like this.

397
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,710
They will catch up with us.

398
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,750
Let's split up.

399
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,600
I'll draw them away.

400
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,160
No.

401
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,270
We should save him.

402
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm from the Lord's Mansion.

403
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,400
They won't do anything to me.

404
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,960
Don't worry.

405
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,310
Be careful.

406
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,440
Come on.

407
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:47,920
Chase them.

408
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,960
Stop.

409
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,440
This way.

410
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:50,650
Hurry.

411
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,780
Stop.

412
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,160
Chase them.

413
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,560
Stop.

414
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,050
Hurry.

415
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,710
Stop.

416
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,300
Chase them.

417
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,990
Stop.

418
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,700
Chase them.

419
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,920
- Chase them. - Hurry.

420
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,250
Go.

421
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,250
Hurry.

422
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,010
Stop.

423
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,640
Hurry.

424
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,550
Stop.

425
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,160
You're running fast.

426
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,360
Tie her up.

427
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,720
Let go.

428
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,570
Why are you tying me up?

429
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,660
Young Mistress.

430
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,720
We don't want to give you a hard time.

431
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,880
I'll let you go

432
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,790
as long as you tell me where Fu Sheng is.

433
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,080
Are you Wang Zhong?

434
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,990
Yes.

435
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,160
Young Mistress, you got there, huh?

436
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,310
I want to cooperate with you.

437
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,420
But I don't know.

438
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,310
What should we do?

439
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,790
Tian Gou.

440
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,230
Young Mistress.

441
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,310
I'll give you one last chance.

442
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:44,950
If you...

443
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,180
I don't know.

444
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,310
It's useless for you to force me.

445
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,360
Okay.

446
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,710
It's your choice.

447
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,140
Tian Gou.

448
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,600
Lead the way.

449
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,610
How are you doing?

450
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,080
Physician Fu.

451
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,280
Physician Fu, I'm sorry.

452
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,080
It's all my fault.

453
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,440
I overheard your conversation with the chief

454
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,310
and told Immortal Qin.

455
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,950
I didn't expect to be taken advantage of by him.

456
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,470
That's why we're here today.

457
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,400
I thought I was going to die today.

458
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,080
I didn't expect you to save my life.

459
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,310
Physician Fu, I'm really sorry.

460
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,680
You don't have to.

461
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,340
You had an asthma attack.

462
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,160
You're lucky to be alive.

463
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,790
Get up, Tian Yu.

464
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
What's done is done.

465
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,680
Can you tell me why you did it?

466
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,400
I have asthma.

467
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,750
Immortal Qin saved me several times.

468
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,750
I thought

469
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,600
he was my lifesaver.

470
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,360
If that's the reason,

471
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,510
I won't blame you.

472
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,160
Physician Fu.

473
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,440
Do you want to continue to fight against Immortal Qin?

474
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,880
The villagers have seen his magical power.

475
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,120
They trust him.

476
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,790
You'd better

477
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,990
leave here.

478
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,360
You are no match for him.

479
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,880
What did he do?

480
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,600
Is it like what he did today?

481
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,640
It's the first time

482
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,470
I've seen such powerful magic.

483
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,510
Ordinary people

484
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,230
cannot see the gods appear.

485
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,640
Tian Yu.

486
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
Have you ever seen clay dolls

487
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,470
in the Tianyi Tribe?

488
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,080
Clay dolls?

489
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,640
Yes.

490
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,840
I have one with me.

491
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,640
Really?

492
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,550
Show me.

493
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,550
It's smaller than the clay doll I've seen.

494
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,440
The clay doll head that I've seen is hollow.

495
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,680
Physician Fu.

496
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,230
How come you've seen this before?

497
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,030
I saw it in a family where their baby was snatched by the Hole Ghost.

498
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,470
That one was used.

499
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,160
Used?

500
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,750
How do you tell them apart?

501
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,400
Physician Fu.

502
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,030
Have you ever made a clay doll?

503
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,680
You must know

504
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,920
that clay dolls are made not only with clay

505
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,400
but also

506
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,750
with honey, cotton, and paper.

507
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,440
They are used to increase the stickiness of the clay.

508
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,160
When Immortal Qin

509
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,200
makes a clay doll,

510
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,880
he makes

511
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,920
a hollow head first.

512
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,990
Then stuff it with cotton

513
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,750
and heart-eater grass.

514
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,620
When he goes to steal a baby on the 15th,

515
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,400
he ignites the clay doll's head

516
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,840
and puts it in the house.

517
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,200
When everyone in the house

518
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,710
is poisoned and hallucinated,

519
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,230
he sneaks into the house

520
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,710
and trades the clay doll for the baby.

521
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,600
I see.

522
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,950
The clay doll's head was hollow

523
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,310
because it had heart-eater grass in it.

524
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,200
It became hollow

525
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,470
after it was ignited.

526
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,440
Heart-eater grass.

527
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,200
Your chief said

528
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,270
it was the raw material for the poisonous fog outside your tribe.

529
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:37,990
Right?

530
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,750
Yes.

531
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,840
Chief.

532
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,880
Where is everyone?

533
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,750
Gu, you're finally back.

534
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,030
Something happened this morning.

535
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,000
Everyone thought Fu Sheng

536
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,280
had become a ghost

537
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,830
and would kill everyone.

538
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,480
They went to the mountains

539
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,040
to catch Fu Sheng.

540
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,760
What?

541
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,160
Where is Wen Jue?

542
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,150
The Young Mistress left with Fu Sheng.

543
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,080
Her whereabouts are unknown.

544
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,960
Keep an eye on him.

545
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,280
I'm going to the city to get help.

546
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,910
Okay.

547
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,520
Go get help.

548
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,910
Come back before something big happens.

549
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,460
You, the Tianyi tribe,

550
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,370
have lived in this environment for a long time.

551
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,890
Will you be poisoned by the heart-eater grass?

552
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
We developed an immunity

553
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,160
to the heart-eater grass.

554
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,990
We don't hallucinate because of it.

555
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,950
Why do you know so much?

556
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,710
I have asthma.

557
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,840
So,

558
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,080
I am often with Immortal Qin.

559
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,270
I helped him make clay dolls.

560
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,160
Did you make this?

561
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,160
Yes.

562
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,880
Immortal Qin saved my life several times.

563
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,200
So I made a doll of him

564
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,680
and carried it with me.

565
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,790
Are those clay dolls

566
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,600
made of the same material?

567
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,440
Yes.

568
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,710
I see.

569
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
It smells the same

570
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,310
as what Qin Miao

571
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,400
threw into the fire.

572
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,990
What does it taste like?

573
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,600
There's agarwood,

574
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,510
sandalwood,

575
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,710
cinnabar,

576
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,510
and mandragora in it.

577
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,600
I see.

578
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,710
People of the Tianyi tribe

579
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,920
are immune to the heart-eater grass.

580
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,230
If Qin Miao wants to establish his authority

581
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,600
in the Tianyi tribe,

582
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,680
he has to find a new hallucinogen.

583
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,310
So that

584
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,710
you will be hallucinated.

585
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,080
Physician Fu,

586
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

587
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,640
What hallucinogen?

588
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,200
There's only one hallucinogen in the Tianyi tribe.

589
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,710
And that's the heart-eater grass.

590
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,230
The first three herbs are easy to get.

591
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,440
But mandragora

592
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,840
is difficult to get.

593
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,440
As far as I know,

594
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,400
There are very few medicine shops

595
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,200
in Xichuan that sell it.

596
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,840
Tian Yu.

597
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,310
Qin Miao is a witch doctor.

598
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Have you seen where he collects herbs?

599
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,440
Wang Bo and Wang Zhong

600
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,550
go to the Dead Man Cliff

601
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,030
every once in a while.

602
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,000
Maybe that's where they collect herbs.

603
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,360
Dead Man Cliff.

604
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,790
Where is it?

605
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,360
Immortal Qin named it.

606
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,030
He said he saw ghosts

607
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,310
wandering

608
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,030
under the cliff.

609
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,030
They will catch people who pass by

610
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
so that they can be reincarnated.

611
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,120
Have any of you seen it?

612
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,990
A bold villager went there.

613
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,510
He said he saw ghost fire

614
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,200
floating up under the cliff.

615
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,990
After that,

616
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,640
no one dared to go there anymore.

617
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,470
Tian Yu.

618
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,470
Can you take me to the Dead Man Cliff?

619
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,310
Physician Fu.

620
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,640
You saved my life.

621
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,270
I'm willing to take you there.

622
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:44,400
Good.

623
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,030
They must be in this cave.

624
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,880
You four, search.

625
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,510
Yes.

626
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,840
There's someone over there.

627
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,600
You, keep an eye on her.

628
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,310
The rest of you, chase him.

629
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,170
Yes.

630
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,360
Go.

631
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:56,760
Untie me.

632
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,110
Let's go.

633
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,090
Stop.

634
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,670
Wait.

635
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,330
We're tricked.

636
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,920
Go back to the cave. Hurry.

637
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,830
Fu Sheng, I saved you again.

638
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,170
This is the Dead Man Cliff.

639
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,120
Don't be scared.

640
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,710
The so-called ghost fires

641
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,440
are just wildfires.

642
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,120
It's beautiful.

643
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,230
Where did the wildfires come from?

644
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,720
It is beautiful.

645
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,280
I used to see wildfires

646
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,910
in mass graves.

647
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,360
Physician Fu, I've told you.

648
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,340
There are ghosts under the cliff.

649
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,880
Let's get out of here.

650
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
I'm going down there and have a look.

651
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,550
What if the vine breaks?

652
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,990
Please

653
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,360
grab the other end of the vine.

654
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,990
My life is in your hands.

655
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,120
Mandragora. Just like I thought.

656
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,560
Useless.

657
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,830
You're all useless.

658
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,270
Good-for-nothing.

659
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,640
You can't even catch Fu Sheng, the sick ghost.

660
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,230
Forget it.

661
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,310
Forget it.

662
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,960
I've treated you well.

663
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,640
When the sick ghost attacks again,

664
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,390
I can save my life.

665
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,960
But you...

666
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,160
Immortal, please save us.

667
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,390
Immortal, please save us.

668
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,200
I can't save you.

669
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,750
You can only save yourselves.

670
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,790
Immortal, please point out the way to us.

671
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,520
If you want to save yourself, you should catch Fu Sheng, the sick ghost.

672
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,640
I caught Fu Sheng, the sick ghost.

673
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,350
I caught Fu Sheng, the sick ghost.

674
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,640
Tian Yu.

675
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
How did you catch them?

676
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,960
Heavenly Tutor.

677
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,710
I woke up in the mountains

678
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,230
and found them sleeping next to me.

679
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,200
So, I found a chance

680
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,040
to knock them out, tie them up,

681
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,910
and bring them here.

682
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,950
Good.

683
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,160
Good job.

684
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,080
The gods will bless you.

685
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,520
Thank you, Heavenly Tutor.

686
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,480
Bring Fu Sheng up.

687
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,160
Immortal-binding Rope.

688
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,350
Ghost-binding Rope.

689
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,640
Demon-capture Bottle.

690
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,680
With these three treasures,

691
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,640
I'll expel the sick ghost.

692
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,200
No.

693
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,750
The sick ghost has become one with the Fu Sheng.

694
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
The sick ghost is Fu Sheng.

695
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,350
Fu Sheng is the sick ghost.

696
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,080
If we want to destroy the sick ghost,

697
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,830
we have to kill Fu Sheng.

698
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,640
Wang Zhong, beat the drum.

699
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,530
Okay.

700
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,200
There are three lights on you.

701
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,390
One on your head and two on your shoulders.

702
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,350
Put out the three lights.

703
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,270
The sick ghost has nowhere to run.

704
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,200
What happened?

705
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,350
That's the body of the sick ghost.

706
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,270
Wang Zhong, stop beating.

707
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,830
Heavenly Tutor.

708
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,910
It's not me.

709
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,960
Who's there?

710
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,290
What happened?

711
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,630
What happened?

712
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,680
Who's there?

713
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,680
Who?

714
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,640
Looks like you're not the only one who's sober.

715
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,560
Chief.

716
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,080
It's so loud over there.

717
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,350
Did something happen?

718
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,120
Won't you go there?

719
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,270
No rush.

720
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,680
Wait for a while.

721
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,430
I'm your double.

722
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,080
I did all the bad things.

723
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,480
You took all the merits.

724
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,000
It's you.

725
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,230
You got everybody sick.

726
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,960
You killed everyone who disobeyed you.

727
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,200
You've killed many people.

728
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,730
I'm wronged.

729
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,790
I hate it.

730
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,310
Shut up.

731
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,040
Shut up.

732
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,230
Nonsense.

733
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,000
Fu Sheng, this is your trick.

734
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,350
Don't trust him.

735
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,430
Fu Sheng is the essence of the sick ghost.

736
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,390
It's Fu Sheng's trick.

737
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,680
Don't trust him.

738
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,600
Whether I'm a ghost or not

739
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,350
is not up to you.

740
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,480
How about this?

741
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,430
Let's invite all the gods here.

742
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,860
Let them say

743
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,050
which one of us

744
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,100
is a ghost.

745
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,260
Do you dare?

746
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,830
Yes, let the gods judge.

747
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,430
Let's see whose problem it is.

748
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,410
Let the gods judge.

749
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,380
Let the gods judge.

750
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,250
Let the gods judge.

751
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,860
Let the gods judge.

752
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,520
Let the gods judge.

753
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,230
Immortal Qin.

754
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,960
Do you want me to invite the gods?

755
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,200
I'll invite them.

756
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
What's

757
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,710
your spell?

758
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,770
The earth is under the feet, and the sky is above the head.

759
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,600
Set up the incense table to invite the gods.

760
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,540
Gods, bless us.

761
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,910
Ladies and gentlemen, don't worry.

762
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,960
I'll show you the gods.

763
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:26,700
Come on.

764
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,640
No.

765
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,330
No way.

766
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,080
How could I have a hallucination?

767
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,560
Are the gods here?

768
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,830
The momentum is great.

769
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,960
- The gods are here. - The gods are here.

770
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,780
The gods are here.

771
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,680
It's fake.

772
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,600
It's all fake.

773
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,660
It's his trick.

774
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,330
Qin Miao.

775
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,120
You've sinned greatly.

776
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,850
You do bad things in our names.

777
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,010
We'll punish you today.

778
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,750
It's fake.

779
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,720
There are no gods or ghosts in the world.

780
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,350
It's an illusion.

781
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,440
You finally admitted it.

782
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,900
There are no gods or ghosts in the world.

783
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,440
Your tricks

784
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,480
are all illusions.

785
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,400
So what?

786
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,880
I let them see

787
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,520
what they see.

788
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,960
If I don't want them to see this,

789
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm still the Heavenly Tutor here

790
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,670
when they wake up.

791
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
What a coincidence.

792
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,670
Wang Zhong has long stopped beating the drum.

793
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,920
That is to say, you're in a hallucination.

794
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,880
So,

795
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,620
they will hear

796
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,510
what I want them to hear.

797
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:19,800
Have a guess.

798
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,920
Did they hear what you just said?

799
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,550
You tricked me.

800
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,000
Who was responsible

801
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,870
for the Raid outside Xichuan?

802
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,300
Lord Wen.

803
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,760
My father?

804
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,450
Kill them as soon as possible.

805
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,140
All of them.
