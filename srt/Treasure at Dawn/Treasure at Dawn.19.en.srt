That's right.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,880
Eat more.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,090
You won't get strong if you don't eat at night.

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,180
Are you already capable enough to kill?

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,750
Shouldn't you kill me next?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,680
Mr. Chairman.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,050
No matter how bold I am,

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,040
I wouldn't dare.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,540
You dare to kill a suspect,

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,060
so what else do you dare not do?

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,960
Mr. Chairman.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,470
If I were a steward,

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,790
I wouldn't dare to do anything,

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,470
but if I were a horse slave,

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,150
I might dare to do anything.

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,370
Is that a threat?

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,510
Please let me explain.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,920
My brother told me

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,320
that if a relationship

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,710
comes to a point

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,860
where one of us has to die,

22
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,330
it's better if you do.

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,640
This day didn't have to come so soon,

24
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,430
but you forced me.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,470
I've

26
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,140
treated you well.

27
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,380
Treated me well?

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,080
How dare you say that?

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
I can tolerate everything else,

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,110
but if you make me live in poverty again,

31
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,800
I can't tolerate it.

32
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,110
Because I'm afraid of poverty.

Chairman Li,

107
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,120
did you order me

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,470
to set fire to Lin's Mansion?

109
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:36,790
Yes.

110
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,680
What's wrong?

111
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,960
Why did you set fire to Lin's Mansion?

112
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,690
Chairman Song died in Lin's Mansion,

113
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,300
so wasn't it right for me to burn it down?

114
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,680
Your Excellency.

115
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,280
You've heard it all.

116
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,940
Please don't blame me for this.

117
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,080
Your Excellency.

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,140
As a Breakwall man,

119
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,080
what's wrong with me wanting

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,870

121
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,390

122
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,960
Since Mr. Chairman told the truth,

123
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,980
I'll also tell you my course of action that day.

124
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,120
On that day, I went to burn Lin's Mansion as you said,

125
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,790
but I was knocked out when I arrived.

126
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,440
I don't remember what happened after I fainted,

127
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,830
but when I opened my eyes,

128
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,760
I saw a man collapsed and dying

129
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,580
in front of me.

130
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,030
He delivered the handkerchief and Xun to me.

131
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,470
Your Excellency,

132
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,230
you know all about the aftermath.

133
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,030
Nonsense.

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,830
It was you who killed the man.

135
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,880
I saw it with my own eyes.

136
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,440
With your own eyes?

137
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,200
That's strange.

138
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,320
Has Mr. Chairman been to Lin's Mansion too?

139
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,150
Or were you secretly following me

140
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,560
because you were worried

141
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,440
that I couldn't do the job?

142
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,520
Your Excellency.

143
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,400
I did send someone to keep an eye on Lin's Mansion,

144
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,680
but believe me.

145
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,590
Sun Siming must be the murderer

146
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,000
because he was already dead

147
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,910
when I went there.

148
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,880
Just now, you said

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,230
you saw me kill him with your own eyes,

150
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,270
but now...

151
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,880
I know you can

152
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,080
turn black and white upside down,

153
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,200
so I said that

154
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,230
to prevent him from framing me.

155
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,350
Your Excellency, the truth is

156
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,080
that when Master Lin appeared,

157
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,960
I had fainted,

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,880
but the man sent by the chairman

159
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,880
was sober,

160
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,960
so we don't know

161
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,440
whether Master Lin was killed

162
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,640
by the man he sent

163
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,200
or by Mr. Chairman himself,

164
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,560
but when I opened my eyes,

165
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,390
what I saw was

166
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,230
that Master Lin was already dying.

167
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,350
Mr. Chairman was going to kill me.

168
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,440
Fortunately, Xichuan's Young Mistress

169
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,880
suddenly arrived,

170
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,760
so I was saved from being killed.

171
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,790
Xichuan's Young Mistress?

172
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,480
How can you prove it?

173
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,120
You can ask the Young Mistress yourself,

174
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,390
and she can testify for me.

He's a madman.

catching that traitor

182
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,800
would be the best credit I could have,

183
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,420
so why would I kill him,

Your Excellency?

185
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,590
If you put it that way,

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,030
it seems to make sense.

Let me tell you something.

361
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,510
I went to every morgue in Xichuan today

362
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,400
and searched through all the records for several years

363
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,400

00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,320
I had no choice,

365
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,590
so I asked my maid and waiter to search with me.

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,440
Finally, I really found Han Shuo

It seems that Jia Xiaolong didn't lie,

372

He's been dead for so long,

so there's no way to verify this.

376
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,710

00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,810
errand boy before he died.

380
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,630
Why don't we go to the Luo's?

381
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,440
Maybe we can get some useful clues.

382
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,040
We don't know the Luo family well,

383
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,680
so we'll have to bother

384
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,470
Xichuan's Young Mistress with this.

385
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,080
No need to be polite.

386
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,040
I just want to ask you

387
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,200
why we didn't ask Yingying to help us

388
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,840
with this kind of laborious work.

389
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,750
Do you know how much dust

390
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,470
accumulates on the booklet in Morgue?

391
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,960
And it stinks.

392
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,880
I've washed my hands

393
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,560
a dozen times, but they still smell.

394
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,230
Because it costs money.

395
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,200
What are you saying?

396
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,470
No money again?

397
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,160
Didn't you bring a lot of stuff

398
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,040
from my house when the clinic opened?

399
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,470
That's not my fault.

400
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,040
Jia Xiaolong and the others got hurt often.

401
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,350
They spent a lot of money

402
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,080
on treatment and healing.

403
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,300
Those people

404
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,680
were so poor

405
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,560
that they didn't have even a penny.

406
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,870
We paid it all for them.

407
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,800
Because I promised Jia Xiaolong

408
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,870
the Water-shaped Jade in exchange for their safety.

409
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,470
I can't go back on my word, right?

410
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,590
So

411
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,750
you're using my clinic as a charity?

412
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,800
We're not.

413
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,350
You guys.

414
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,320
Find me the books of the clinic.

415
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,630
Go make money for the clinic.

416
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,960
Otherwise, sleep on the streets.

417
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,230
How do we make money?

418
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,040
How should I know?

419
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,710
Thank you, Chairman.

420
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,560
Thank you, Chairman.

421
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,400
Thank you, Chairman.

422
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,920
Can't you say something pleasant?

423
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,440
Let me do it for him.

424
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,110
Congratulations to Chairman Sun on his appointment as Chairman

425
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,350
and his ability to do good deeds

426
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,470
on his own terms.

427
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,550
Knowing it's a happy day,

428
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,120
I brought some gifts to the mine

429
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,330
to cheer up the poor pals,

430
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,640
but I didn't realize I'd alerted you.

431
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,840
Steward Wang.

432
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,510
Yes.

433
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,470
Distribute all our gifts

434
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,790
to everyone.

435
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,470
Okay.

436
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,120
Thank you, Chairman.

437
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:23,680
Jiu.

438
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,920
Show them the way.

439
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,310
I used to starve every day

440
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,640
when I had no money,

441
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,120
so my brother and I went robbing with hunger.

442
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,230
My brother offered

443
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,680
to buy flatbread with the money,

444
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,070
but I was afraid I'd be hungry the next day

445
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,270
after the day I'd eaten enough,

446
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,470
so I used the money to buy a shovel

447
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,840
and came to this mine.

448
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,470
I thought if I could dig up

449
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,160
the Star Gold that belonged to me,

450
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,030
I wouldn't have to starve any longer.

451
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,310
I thought you should know

452
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,310
that Star Gold is hard to find.

453
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,360
I know,

454
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,920
so I sharpened

455
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,120
my shovel,

456
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
crouched at the foot of the mine wall,

457
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,360
and listened for footsteps.

458
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,230
The one whose footsteps were more rapid

459
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,960
than the others must have Star Gold,

460
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,990
so

461
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,440
I waited,

462
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,880
kept waiting,

463
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,270
for someone

464
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,790
to bring out

465
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,270
my Star Gold,

466
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
but I waited for nothing.

467
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
I passed out from hunger,

468
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,920
but looking back on it,

469
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,200
I know I was lucky to have survived

470
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,650
because I didn't know

471
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,270
that the whole mine

472
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,120
was being watched by Jiu.

473
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,960
If I had actually robbed it then,

474
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,880
I'm afraid I'd be dead.

475
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,030
You were lucky.

476
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,710
My luck was okay,

477
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,200
but my brother's luck wasn't.

478
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,310
Finally, he couldn't stand the hunger,

479
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,960
so he stole food from Song Jingye.

480
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,200
Siming.

481
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,230
Siming.

482
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,440
Siming.

483
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,710
Siming.

484
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,160
Where have you been?

485
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,270
Flatbread.

486
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,120
Flatbread.

487
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,680
Eat the flatbread.

488
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,920
Have you eaten?

489
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,470
Eat it.

490
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,580
Do you want it?

491
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,550
Eat it.

492
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,200
Eat it.

493
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,070
Come on.

494
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:28,840
Is it good?

495
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,640
What happened to your head?

496
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,510
Who did this to you?

497
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,200
Eat it.

498
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,070
He got hit in the head with a stick

499
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,310
and became retarded.

500
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,960
Now.

501
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,840
Eat.

502
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,400
Eat.

503
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Why am I telling you this?

504
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,310
But I've always felt

505
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,550
that a man can suffer

506
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,470
as much as

507
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,070
he will enjoy.

508
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,270
If I hadn't lived through those days,

509
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,880
how could I

510
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,960
be talking to you today?

511
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,600
Right?

512
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,400
By the way,

513
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,200
this gong.

514
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,440
Anyone who finds Star Gold

515
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,470
needs to hit the gong.

516
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,960
I've been wondering

517
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,470
when I'd be able to hit this gong,

518
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,200
but so far,

519
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,360
I've never succeeded.

520
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,880
Maybe it's not in my destiny

521
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,230
to hit the gong.

522
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,960
I've always wanted to do it.

523
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,710
Feels good!

524
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,230
Villains holding sway.

525
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,800
Almost done?

526
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,930
You've eaten so much already.

527
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,880
Have you got a conscience?

528
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,030
You've enjoyed yourselves,

529
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,440
but I haven't had enough.

530
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,640
All right.

531
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,680
Have some more.

532
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,270
Is it good?

533
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,790
It's a mixture of fat and lean meat,

534
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,160
and the purple perilla is good

535
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,440
for relieving the fat.

536
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,030
All right, go ahead.

537
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,640
Let me ask you about something while you eat.

538
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,510
Actually, I think

539
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,510
Wen Jue was right.

540
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,320
Our clinic has at least a few dozen people

541
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,960
registering and picking up medications every day,

542
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,510
but I did the math and realized

543
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,070
that it couldn't make the balance zero,

544
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,160
so whose pockets

545
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,990
did the money go into?

546
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,160
And who suffered the loss?

547
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,680
I have two younger brothers.

548
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,370
Junior eats the most.

549
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,640
[Hu's Flatbread Shop]
As an older brother, I couldn't

550
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,750
let them starve, so I asked the merchants back to Shangyi

551
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,030
to send them money a couple of times,

552
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,750
but I just took a little bit.

553
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,200
Just a little bit.

554
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,030
See?

555
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,510
They say

556
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,120
thieves from within

557
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,680
are the hardest to guard against.

558
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,680
Don't speak so harshly.

559
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,640
When I find the Treasure of the Sealed Book,

560
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,640
I'll pay you back tenfold, no,

561
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,600
a hundredfold.

562
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,640
Speaking of the treasure,

563
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,360
I never asked you.

564
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,790
You're so obsessed with the treasure,

565
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,470
so if you really find it,

566
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,440
what are your plans?

567
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,070
Give it to my brother, of course.

568
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,710
I'm talking about you.

569
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,120
What will you do?

570
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,230
Me?

571
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,200
After I settle my brothers,

572
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,990
I'll pursue the three necessities of my life.

573
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,750
Tell me.

574
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,600
What are the three necessities?

575
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,990
Wine,

576
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,120
meat,

577
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,510
and the world.

578
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,310
Those are my three necessities.

579
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,200
In all the time I've known you,

580
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,790
this is the first time you've told me

581
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,230
what you're going to do.

582
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,470
That's good.

583
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,440
What's the point?

584
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
We haven't found the treasure yet.

585
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,920
I don't know when I'll be able

586
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
to live like this.

587
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,160
Speaking of which, we've found two pieces of jade now.

588
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,270
Still missing the last piece.

589
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,990
What's next for you?

590
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,510
I have no idea.

591
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,270
So many things have happened

592
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,680
since we came to Xichuan.

593
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,120
They're pretty scary.

594
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,010
Think about it.

595
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,600
Anyone related to jade

596
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,270
is either dead or missing,

597
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,550
so I always feel like

598
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,500
there's someone behind it all.

599
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,470
It gives me the creeps every time I think about it.

600
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,920
Then let's stop

601
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,840
and go back to Shangyi.

602
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,550
No for sure.

603
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,550
Since we can't go back to Shangyi,

604
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,270
let's hurry.

605
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,120
Whoever this person is,

606
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,550
if we're fast enough,

607
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,200
he or she won't catch us.

608
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,990
Leader, Sun Siming is here.

609
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,710
Go around and see if there are any ambushes.

610
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,550
Yes, sir.

611
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,710
Sun Siming.

612
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,170
What are you doing in my tent?

613
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,360
Celebrating.

614
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,880
Celebrating?

615
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,470
Celebrate what?

616
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,640
Celebrating that I'm the Chairman of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

617
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,640
Anything to do with me?

618
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,120
Che.

619
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,030
I'm sad to hear you say that.

620
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,160
I've known you for a long time

621
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,550
and have been looking forward

622
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,840
to having a drink with you someday,

623
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,400
but I've never been in a position

624
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,790
to do so.

625
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,710
Today, I became the Chairman,

626
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,880
so I rushed over to share the joy with you,

627
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,880
but you said it had nothing to do with you,

628
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,070
so how could I not be sad?

629
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,440
What are you doing here?

630
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,880
Can't I just come and visit?

631
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,470
I've come to be your guest

632
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,070
and welcome you

633
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,360
to the Jibei Chamber of Commerce

634
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,990
when you're free.

635
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,600
Me,

636
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,710
the food,

637
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,600
and the wine.

638
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,600
I've prepared everything for you.

639
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,790
Cut the crap. Now

640
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
let me feel

641
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,160
the flavor of Xiangshui Gang.

642
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,120
Leader, there's no ambush outside.

643
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,440
What now?

644
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,160
Okay, come on.

645
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,600
Set the banquet.

646
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,440
Yes, sir.

647
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,660
[Luo's Mansion]

648
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,400
Who do you want to see?

649
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,760
I am Fu Sheng,

650
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,240
a physician of Wenfu Hall.

651
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,680
I've come to Mr. Luo to ask for something important.

652
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,830
Are you here to apply for a job as a physician too?

653
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,000
Why didn't you come earlier?

654
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,920
Master has already met

655
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
a group of physicians in the afternoon

656
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,240
and is now taking a break.

657
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
I was delayed

658
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,440
looking for a remedy

659
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,760
for Mr. Luo.

660
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,760
Please excuse me.

661
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,390
OK.

662
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:35,870
[Luo's Mansion]

663
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,350
Come in with me.

664
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,040
Thank you.

665
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:43,820
[Luo's Mansion]

666
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,200
Mr. Luo, are you feeling a bloated abdomen,

667
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,480
loss of appetite,

668
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,670
and even blood in your stool lately?

669
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,390
Please speak frankly.

670
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,760
Lumps in the abdomen

671
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,040
accumulate on the intestines.

672
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,650
Lumps in the abdomen?

673
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,730
Then this is a serious illness.

674
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,870
It seems that you are prepared

675
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,450
for this disease as well.

676
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,810
Many physicians in the city

677
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,920
have informed me truthfully,

678
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,890
but they understand the disease

679
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,890
without the ability to cure it,

680
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,740
so it remains incurable

681
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,340
to this day.

682
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,090
Physician Fu.

683
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,370
It seems that you were not prepared

684
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,160
for this disease,

685
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,590
so you did not

686
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,830
come here today

687
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,340
for my disease, did you?

688
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,830
Then I'll tell you the truth.

689
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,480
I came to you today

690
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,000
to ask for something.

691
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,550
Five years ago,

692
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,390
you had an errand boy

693
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,870
named Han Shuo.

694
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,000
Do you still remember?

695
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,720
He has been dead for years.

696
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,000
Physician Fu.

697
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,350
Why are you asking about him?

698
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,790
I want to know

699
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,760
who he knew well

700
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,980
before he died

701
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,400
or what friends he had

702
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,030
or

703
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,990
who was in his family.

704
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,070
Physician Fu,

705
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,470
my master is tired.

706
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,600
Han Shuo's parents were also servants here.

707
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,650
Their ancestors worked at Luo's Mansion.

708
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,270
Han Shuo's father died young,

709
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,550
and he was orphaned.

710
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,680
My master took pity on him

711
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,680
and took him in,

712
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:36,880
but he died

713
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,880
suddenly and unexpectedly.

714
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,200
My master doesn't want

715
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,820
to talk about it.

716
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,610
Physician Fu, please forgive him.

717
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,680
Physician Fu.

718
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,400
My master is physically ill.

719
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,070
Can we talk about it next time?

720
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,770
Mr. Luo.

721
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,210
I'm afraid

722
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,340
I'm the only one who can cure you.

723
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Really?

724
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,070
Of course.

725
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,750
I came here

726
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,030
to ask about Han Shuo,

727
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,790
but when it comes to the sick,

728
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,840
as a physician, I must do my best.

729
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,550
I don't mean to be secretive,

730
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,360
but this is really a matter

731
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,680
of my best friend's secret

732
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,400
and even

733
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,550
the lives of his entire family.

734
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,440
So don't you care about your own life?

735
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,990
Have you lived long enough?

736
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,150
If you

737
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,680
can really cure me,

738
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,050
I will tell you everything I know.

739
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,440
Good.

740
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,380
Then we have a deal,

741
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,050
but I need some time to prepare.

742
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,630
I will let you know

743
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,830
when I am ready.

744
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,440
Physician Fu, how do you heal?

745
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,040
My method of healing is

746
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,680
to cut open your stomach

747
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,440
to extract the accumulation.

748
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,030
If it's accumulated in the intestines,

749
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,470
I'll need to cut, clean, and suture the intestines.

750
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,330
Okay.

751
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,850
Then,

752
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,440
thank you, Physician Fu.

753
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,230
It's my job.

754
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,980
Mr. Luo, get a good rest.

755
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,270
Nice!

756
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,750
Che.

757
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,360
The wine is drunk up.

758
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,790
I come

759
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,840
from a poor family,

760
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,680
but I didn't expect

761
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,470
myself to,

762
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,310
here in your tent,

763
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,070
drink the best wine,

764
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,990
eat the best meat,

765
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,070
and see the most beautiful killers

766
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,230
I've ever drunk, eaten,

767
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,550
and seen in my life.

768
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,510
Che.

769
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,710
You didn't

770
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,400
disappoint me.

771
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,510
You can come back

772
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,710
more often if you want.

773
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,400
You didn't disappoint me.

774
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,640
Good friend.

775
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,710
Should I kill him?

776
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,790
Send him back.

777
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,550
It's good for us

778
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,440
to have this idiot in there.

779
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:47,540
[Recover from the Disease]

780
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,470
What are you two doing?

781
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,030
Improving the food?

782
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,470
If we could stew you.

783
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
Fu Sheng is doing this to cure Luo Ye.

784
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,310
Luo Ye?

785
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,600
Han Shuo's master?

786
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,270
Fu Sheng, you're good.

787
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,310
Luo Ye got sick when you went there.

788
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,230
He got sick when I went there?

789
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,920
He was already sick.

790
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,680
And Luo Ye promised

791
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,750
to tell me about Han Shuo

792
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,120
if I cured him.

793
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,990
From his words, I can tell

794
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,310
there must be something strange

795
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,750
about Han Shuo's death.

796
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
You, idle punk, come and help.

797
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,400
Who's the idle punk?

798
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,360
This is so unsightly.

799
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,680
This is just a temporary chicken coop.

800
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,120
If the chickens are unhappy living here,

801
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
the eggs they lay won't taste good.

802
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,400
Right?

803
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,470
Give me one.

804
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,710
Nonsense.

805
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,600
Wen Jue.

806
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,200
Take the rabbit. Let's go.

807
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,360
If you think you can do it,

808
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,230
Come on.

809
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,360
Come on.

810
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,200
Do it right.

811
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,030
You do it.

812
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,440
So what even if I do?

813
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,320
Come on.

814
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,510
I'll build you a new house.

815
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,990
Is the thread ready?

816
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,280
Yes, sir.

817
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,800
I'm going to try the thread to see

818
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,110
if it's usable for sewing up intestines.

819
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,880
Take notes.

820
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,070
Don't worry.

821
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,240
Fu Sheng.

822
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,960
Don't worry. I'm just doing an experiment.

823
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,670
It'll be fine.

824
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,400
The blade isn't very good.

825
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,840
The thread suture failed?

826
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,840
Quite successful, actually.

827
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,550
Why did the rabbit die?

828
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,760
It was the knife's fault.

829
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,170
This knife has an elaborate pattern,

830
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,670
but it's prone to harboring dirt.

831
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,030
Surgery with this knife

832
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,990
can easily lead to pus in the wound.

833
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,400
I'll have to use a different set

834
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,510
of knives to cure him.

835
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,280
More than that.

836
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,030
We'll have to try more things

837
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,990
to know what's best.

838
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,190
Right.

839
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,780
Being wider might be too much,

840
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,840
but being narrower might not be enough.

841
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,760
We have to get the right size for this.

842
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,590
Why don't I try it for you first?

843
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,280
Stop.

844
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,880
Stop.

845
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,670
Stop.

846
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,070
Stop.

847
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,990
Really.

848
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,030
Let me cut you. Just one cut.

849
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,800
Why don't you experiment on Wood?

850
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,400
His skin is too hard.

851
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,110
It's fine for internal experiments,

852
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,360
but it's not suitable

853
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,550
for anything else.

854
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,510
Nonsense.

855
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,640
Get down.

856
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,920
Wood, you...

857
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,240
Let's talk this over. Don't be impulsive.

858
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,360
What are you doing with all these knives?

859
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,670
Help!

860
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,590
Help!

861
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,110
These four knives are drawn

862
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,280
by my heart and soul,

863
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,360
so I'd like to try these knives

864
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,760
on you today to see

865
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,880
if they are good.

866
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,180
Then explain to me what's the meaning

867
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,840
of the stir-fried duck meat,

868
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,030
cold duck intestines,

869
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,110
deep-fried duck collarbone,

870
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,280
and braised duck head behind you.

871
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,720
I'm imagining wildly again.

872
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,110
I need to forget about that.

873
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,760
Let's test the knife first.

874
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,440
Get away from me.

875
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,360
Don't come any closer.

876
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,110
Sir.

877
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,670
How's my knife?

878
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:24,800
It's done.

879
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,760
Just a minute.

880
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,760
Come on.

881
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,190
Try it.

882
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,720
It's an elaborate knife.

883
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,320
Good knife.

884
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,960
It's a masterpiece.

885
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,030
Thin as a cicada's wing.

886
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,720
It would be a marvelous tool

887
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,440
for surgery.

888
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:00,880
How was it?

889
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,360
Did it work?

890
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,590
It's

891
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,670
sharp

892
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,580
but not precise enough.

893
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,920
Look.

894
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,570
The strength

895
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,250
of the cuts varies,

896
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,190
and there are some tiny serrations here.

897
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,510
If this knife were used for surgery,

898
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,800
it would hurt other tiny parts.

899
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,590
Sir.

900
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,110
Please make it a little finer.

901
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,150
Young Mistress.

902
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,410
I've done my best.

903
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,240
These past few days,

904
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,280
I've really used all my special skills.

905
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,150
Physician Fu's demands are too high.

906
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,440
I'm afraid there's only one person

907
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,590
in Xichuan who can

908
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,070
build this set of knives.

909
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,590
You mean my father?

910
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Your father can build weapons?

911
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,280
Physician Fu, you don't know

912
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,190
Lord Wen is the No. 1 craftsman in Xichuan.

913
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,190
His craftsmanship is unrivaled so far.

914
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,030
Okay. Leave it.

915
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,550
I'll find a way to convince my father.

916
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,510
Can you do that?

917
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,880
My father always listens to me.

918
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:57,840
If I want him to make iron,

919
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,880
how can he not agree?

920
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,510
[Lord's Mansion]

921
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,320
Father.

922
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,320
Help me.

923
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,070
Am I going to help you or him?

924
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
Isn't it the same thing?

925
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,110
Helping him is helping me.

926
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,440
Besides,

927
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,280
Fu Sheng is your savior,

928
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,800
but is this how you treat him?

929
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,550
Won't you even grant him

930
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,720
such a small favor?

931
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,030
You're blackmailing me with favors.

932
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,440
I'm old but not stupid.

933
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,400
If I hadn't taken care of him

934
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,920
in Xichuan,

935
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,040
would he have survived this long?

936
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,800
Isn't that a favor?

937
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,880
Father.

938
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,440
Think of it this way.

939
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,960
In case you have any more illnesses,

940
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,190
you'll still have to turn to him.

941
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,550
Father, just this time.

942
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,230
I'm begging you.

943
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,720
You're the best.

944
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,660
That's enough.

945
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,470
Can't you say something auspicious about your father?

946
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,920
So you agree?

947
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,840
You can show me your skill while I

948
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,630
can take this opportunity to learn.

949
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,720
You want to learn this?

950
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,690
Why did you refuse to learn

951
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,990
when I asked you to before?

952
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,110
Father, you are the Lord of Xichuan.

953
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,510
Breaking the rule once is not easy for you.

954
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,190
After I learn it,

955
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,110
I can handle him.

956
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,030
OK.

957
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,720
I'll ask Jiu to get ready.

958
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,880
You...

959
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,550
A grown girl can't be kept at home.

960
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,800
That's true.

961
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,440
You plotted against me before,

962
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,510
so it's your turn.

963
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,990
I'm painless.

964
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,320
Duck, take notes for me.

965
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,920
I need to find the flow of human blood

966
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
before I operate on Luo Ye.

967
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,550
Okay.

968
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,280
Too deep?

969
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,630
You stabbed my spleen

970
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,720
and severed three adjacent blood vessels.

971
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,960
The affected area is below it.

972
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,110
What's wrong this time?

973
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,030
Two more vessels were severed.

974
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,440
Can't you just hold on?

975
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,670
There are eleven blood veins

976
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,400
below the intestines,

977
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,440
five of which are main blood veins.

978
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,110
I can't touch them while operating.

979
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,760
Otherwise,

980
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,990
this bleeding

981
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,030
will kill him.

982
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:58,960
I'm dead.

983
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,720
I know.

984
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,360
Let's continue the good work.

985
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,020
[Jibei Palace]

986
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,280
My Lord.

987
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,680
I offered to go to Xichuan

988
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,320
to find the Bird Jade Plate for you.

989
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,570
Sishui.

990
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,550
I know you're capable,

991
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,880
but don't rush.

992
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,030
Wait a little longer.

993
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,360
My Lord.

994
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,470
Liu Yunting has been ineffective,

995
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,920
but you've honored her repeatedly,

996
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,280
so I'm not convinced.

997
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,280
Come here.

998
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,280
You two are my right-hand women.

999
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,360
As such,

1000
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,990
you are equally important

1001
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,320
to me.

1002
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,110
Lord, this is Liu Yunting.

1003
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,150
Come in.

1004
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,400
Yunting.

1005
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,800
Why are you giving me

1006
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:25,920
such a big salute?

1007
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,470
My Lord.

1008
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,470
I have been in Xichuan for over a month.

1009
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,400
You sent me to look for the jade plate,

1010
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,510
but I failed to get any news.

1011
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,840
This is my fault.

1012
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,190
I heard from Sishui

1013
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,190
that you were amazing in Xichuan.

1014
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,030
Tell me.

1015
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,800
How amazing were you?

1016
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,150
I'm too stupid

1017
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,550
to know what you mean.

1018
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:47,590
Please inspire me.

1019
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,920
You ignored Li Zhizhuo,

1020
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,990
whom we had nurtured for years,

1021
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,400
and chose a lowly horse slave

1022
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,960
named Sun Siming

1023
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,840
to do your bidding.

1024
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,950
What's even more ridiculous is

1025
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,910
that you killed Li Zhizhuo

1026
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,410
for him.

1027
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,240
How dare you?

1028
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,400
My Lord.

1029
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,550
You have misunderstood me.

1030
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,990
Li Zhizhuo would not obey

1031
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,240
or cooperate with me,

1032
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,920
so I chose the obedient Sun Siming

1033
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,670
to work for you.

1034
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,800
Does this man have some skills?

1035
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:13,550
Yes.

1036
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,770
He is ambitious, skillful, and obedient.

1037
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,840
If he becomes the chairman of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce,

1038
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,920
we will have a much smoother ride from here on out.

1039
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:22,840
Yunting.

1040
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,030
You said that you

1041
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,190
recommended Sun Siming as the Chairman

1042
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,760
because he was obedient

1043
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,440
and that you killed Li Zhizhuo

1044
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,470
because he was disobedient.

1045
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,190
In that case,

1046
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,190
if you are disobedient,

1047
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,110
should I

1048
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,510
kill you too?

1049
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,590

Whatever.

Don't worry, My Lord.

1058
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,150
