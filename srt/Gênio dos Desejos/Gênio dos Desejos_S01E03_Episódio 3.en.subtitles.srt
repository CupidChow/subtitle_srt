1
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,982
GENIE, MAKE A WISH

2
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,485
I told you to prove it to me.

3
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,071
Prove that humans are bound to be corrupt.

4
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,073
This is my first wish.

5
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,660
I've been tempted by you.

6
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,041
You'd bet your life
on something as fragile…

7
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,628
as the goodness of humanity?

8
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,463
This is unbelievable.

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,384
You will lose no matter what.
Just wait and see.

10
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,304
I'll see to it that you lose.
You'll be begging me to please--

11
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,056
Save it for when you actually win.

12
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,266
And wear this.

13
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,896
No, I'm going to celebrate early.

14
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,816
I decide when to do what.

15
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,112
Get a move on, human.
Spring nights are short.

16
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,576
If you were, in fact,
locked up for 983 years,

17
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,912
how are you the most famous genie?

18
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,874
I was famous even before I was locked up
for defying his orders.

19
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,209
Why did you do that?

20
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,419
You've tempted me.

21
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,587
I was tempted… No.

22
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,760
I refused to bow my head
to a lowly human molded from clay.

23
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,846
-Look, 1,000 won!
-Where?

24
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,060
I was just tying my laces.

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,151
Take your time tying them.

26
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,945
Tie them to your heart's content.

27
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,866
I swear I'll corrupt you,

28
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,702
even if it's the last thing I do.

29
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,954
I will wring your neck, you hear?

30
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,624
I'll hang your head
at the gates of hell, and…

31
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,918
Is that you, Ka-young?

32
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,093
Here comes the first human
to be corrupted.

33
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,721
I should come by for an oil change.

34
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,599
I'll stop by on my next day off.

35
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,267
Sure. Come by.

36
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:10,106
Kang Im-seon. A supermarket employee
and Granny An's eldest daughter-in-law.

37
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,859
I know that kind of face well.

38
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,112
The face of someone
who wants the world to end tomorrow.

39
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:21,993
Gu Bo-gyeong.

40
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,164
A bank employee.
We were classmates until high school.

41
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,755
Did you get a text from the bank
about our new towel sets?

42
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,843
I'm sure you use nicer ones, but still.

43
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,225
-Are you going somewhere?
-I'm not. Go ahead.

44
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,142
What?

45
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,144
Okay.

46
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,319
I know that kind of face well too.

47
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,405
The face of someone who wants
the world to end as soon as today.

48
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,205
So two are confirmed for corruption.

49
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,507
Another familiar face, I see.

50
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,802
What, do I not smell like
I belong in this neighborhood?

51
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,303
Do I reek of oil?

52
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,892
It's barking at you.
Did you take the hair clip out?

53
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,311
Take a look.

54
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,190
Dogs are spiritual animals,
so they can see me in any form.

55
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,359
Really? Paw-sitively fascinating.

56
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,946
Of all the village dogs,
this one barks at me the most.

57
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,614
Really?

58
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,742
I guess that makes you
tonight's third wishmaker.

59
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,744
Nice to meet you, mutt.

60
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,415
What a load of dog shit.
Dogs aren't included.

61
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,626
Why not?

62
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,046
You said the first five
we meet on this road.

63
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,049
That should include all living beings.
Those are the rules.

64
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,302
Don't you agree,
Ki Ka-young, lover of rules?

65
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,723
THIS WAY TO CHEONGPUNG VILLAGE HALL

66
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,311
Ms. Ki?

67
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,479
Where are you headed this late?

68
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,190
It's dangerous to be out alone at night.

69
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,109
Need a lift?

70
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,068
No, thanks.

71
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,988
I'm not alone, and I'm meeting someone.

72
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,244
Is that so? Take care, then.

73
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,085
Eom Sang-tae.

74
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,672
You know the gamja-tang spot?
He's the son of Granny Sa, the owner.

75
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,718
Eom Sang-tae must not know
that you're the truly dangerous one here.

76
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,512
Of course he does.
The entire village knows about me.

77
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,224
But he probably doesn't know what I know.

78
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,438
Yikes, you scared me.

79
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,359
You must be out on a walk

80
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,194
in the dead of night.

81
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,654
How's your YouTube channel doing?

82
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,741
-Is Da-jin well?
-Choi Da-jin, lock the doors!

83
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,992
Only joking.

84
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,745
Good night, then.

85
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,628
I guess it must have been
about a year ago.

86
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,339
He moved here for the farm life.

87
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,716
He and his wife run a YouTube channel.

88
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,260
So I guess we have our five.

89
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,137
It's the best of five.

90
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,181
I'll make it a clean sweep.

91
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,767
You'll see it in no time.

92
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,519
Those five will hit rock bottom.

93
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,939
And that bottom is quite deep.

94
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,817
Humans only realize their true colors

95
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,903
when faced with the prospect of wishes.

96
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:45,863
Is that so?

97
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,658
And what does my wish say about me?

98
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,577
That you're a psychopath.

99
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,041
With a single wish, you led
four humans and a creature to corruption.

100
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,296
And I forgot to mention something.

101
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,175
There are both good and evil genies.

102
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,887
Of them, there is one who conjures hell.

103
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,515
They call him

104
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,850
"Iblis"

105
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,811
or "Shaytan."

106
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,106
To use a name you may recognize…

107
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,359
it's "Satan."

108
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,531
It appears as though…

109
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,869
I have encountered an evil genie.

110
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,547
What are you going to do now?

111
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,967
Even in this life,
she used her first wish selflessly.

112
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,595
It wasn't exactly selfless, was it?

113
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,932
She bet her life on people being kind.
What else is that but selflessness?

114
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,100
And what did you call her? "A psychopath"?

115
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,186
"I am Satan"?
What's with the sudden honesty?

116
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,688
So the rats are
surprisingly accurate informants.

117
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,736
I just didn't want to lose.

118
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,072
What should I do?

119
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,824
Maybe I should just skip this life?

120
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,702
Ki Ka-young will live until 80 at most.

121
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,208
With this lamp and those aluminum kettles,
those years should fly by.

122
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,126
And how would you fund that habit?

123
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,213
Yes, good plan. Let's just skip this life.

124
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,507
For now, I'll try my best to avoid her.

125
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,552
You go get a job at her auto shop
and gather some intel.

126
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,469
What do you think?

127
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,722
Right, so you'll be using my money.

128
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,267
But where will you hide, Master?

129
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,313
Somewhere very far away from here.

130
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,899
Somewhere closer to him.

131
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,160
Come on out. Let's eat.

132
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,579
No, I was just rushing out…

133
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,707
Hey, that!
I know the perfect place to eat that.

134
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,543
And don't tell Ka-young that you saw me.

135
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,778
How delicious.

136
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,496
What? Status report?

137
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,333
I have just spotted
an unidentified flying object!

138
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,502
I see a carpet. Over!

139
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,549
He's eating bibimbap. Over.

140
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,135
What are you talking about?
Give me a proper report!

141
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,393
What's the matter?

142
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,478
Come on, what is it?

143
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,775
Oh, did you two arrange to meet here?

144
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,569
He's escaping. Awaiting orders. Over.

145
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,488
Should we shoot him down? Over!

146
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,990
At around 3:38 p.m. today,

147
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,619
the Ministry of National Defense
reported an unidentified flying object

148
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,498
near the Korea-Japan maritime border,
which prompted a fighter jet standoff.

149
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,585
They avoided providing specific details
regarding the unidentified flying object.

150
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,051
I guess I've identified
the unidentified flying object.

151
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,387
With my very eyes.

152
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,806
I needed some time to myself
to mull things over.

153
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,974
Shut it.

154
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,811
You almost sparked a war
between two countries,

155
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,313
then tucked into an in-flight meal?

156
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,190
Bibimbap!

157
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,610
Ms. Ki. You're hiring, aren't you?

158
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,368
Please hire me for the job.

159
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,495
I was practically raised
on rice and engines.

160
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,373
Why don't you avoid

161
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,292
talking about rice today?

162
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,839
Did you two plan something?

163
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,092
You clearly know each other.

164
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,058
You said you'd stay hidden.

165
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,352
How can you get caught
in less than 12 hours?

166
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,938
Don't worry. I have a plan.

167
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,692
I need a change in direction.

168
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,570
Half a day in, and you're doing this here?

169
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,324
Why did Ki Ka-young die for them
when she had no interest in dying for me?

170
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,452
What makes me different from them?

171
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,163
I should've checked that.

172
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,290
I'll be back.

173
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,419
Where are you off to now?

174
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,132
Comrades.

175
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,258
OCTOBER, 1909
PRIMORSKY KRAI

176
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,677
Let us meet again
at Harbin Station. Alive.

177
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,262
Yes.

178
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,143
Ki Ka-young?

179
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,314
Who are you?

180
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,774
Hi, past-life Ki Ka-young.

181
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,525
I need to ask you something.

182
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,445
Know of An Jung-geun?

183
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,572
Comrades!

184
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,658
Our location has been compromised!
Run, now! Hurry!

185
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,329
So you are a spy.

186
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,371
A spy?

187
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:10,873
What's that?

188
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,167
No, I just have a question.

189
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,630
Fire!

190
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,966
So loud. No, stop!

191
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,597
Come on, that stings!

192
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,308
Hey! We were talking over here!

193
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,851
What do you keep throwing at me?

194
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,570
I was only trying to return them to you.
Right, Ki Ka-young.

195
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,907
Where are you going? Wait for me!

196
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,827
I said I have a question.
I swear it won't take long!

197
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,247
Thanks for saving me.

198
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,375
If we are granted another life,

199
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,710
I hope we meet again.

200
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,547
Wait, no.
I want to talk to you in this life…

201
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,340
Get him first!

202
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,675
Fire!

203
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,884
That stings!

204
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,970
Stop giving me these things!

205
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,140
-There he is!
-Right, Ki Ka-young.

206
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,350
Wait, I…

207
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,561
This life just won't do.

208
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,027
THE YEAR 1592

209
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,372
A messenger is here
from Jeolla's naval command.

210
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,290
Let him in.

211
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,504
-You may approach.
-Yes, sir.

212
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,011
Ki Ka-young.

213
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,269
Ki Ka-young.

214
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,898
-What was that?
-What was that sound just now?

215
00:14:58,981 --> 00:14:59,899
You're a man now?

216
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,745
Ki Ka-young. I have a question for you.

217
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,704
Your Majesty.

218
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,166
I, Yi Sun-sin, Left Naval Commander
of Jeolla Province, humbly report.

219
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,127
Yes. It's about that man, Yi Sun-sin.

220
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,464
Our forces struck Busan Port's
enemy base, sinking 130 ships…

221
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,757
-Ki Ka-young.
-Ki Ka-young.

222
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,844
No, kicking, no, killing…

223
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,429
Command my death, Your Majesty.

224
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,390
Who was that? Come on out.

225
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,852
Who keeps going on about "Ki Ka-young"?

226
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,735
Goodness, how can this be?

227
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,778
What is that?

228
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,530
Who is that?

229
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,990
Is he a person or a ghost?

230
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,909
I have a pressing question, you see.

231
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,663
That peculiar, freakish…

232
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,458
Seize that monstrous being
and decapitate it at once!

233
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,669
Decapitate?

234
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,546
What does that mean?

235
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,635
And so, it was recorded
in one unofficial Joseon text

236
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,722
that the being stayed alive
for three days even after being beheaded

237
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,142
and, for all three days,
continued its bizarre cries,

238
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:22,815
saying "Kay Young, Kay Young"
before vanishing into thin air.

239
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,610
Where have you been?

240
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,153
Far away.

241
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,957
There were some people
I needed to meet up with.

242
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,252
What the hell are you playing at?

243
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,588
I made a wish like you wanted.
Why aren't you doing any work?

244
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,425
You're just stalling for time, aren't you?

245
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,926
Not at all!

246
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,597
I've arranged it so that the lamp
will show itself when their desire peaks.

247
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,812
But if someone's wish changes things,
how would I know?

248
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:02,771
What about that?

249
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,404
Once you write with this pen,

250
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,532
your words are eternally binding,
no matter how things may change?

251
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,702
And we're here to get it?
At the crack of dawn?

252
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,328
Yes. It'll be right here.

253
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,081
But the process is complicated,

254
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,251
and I'll need your help.

255
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,262
He owns this building.
Did you get permission to be up here?

256
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,890
Between us,
permission will never be necessary.

257
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,226
Pluck a feather while he's distracted.

258
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,771
Then run.

259
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,565
What?

260
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,944
Why, you…

261
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,367
This is so much fun!

262
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,263
Are you okay?

263
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,140
Yes, well, I'm fine.

264
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,228
Why were you screaming
when you have wings?

265
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,480
I was just nervous
since it's been a while.

266
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,649
Is your auto shop doing well?

267
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,900
You could say that.

268
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,612
Anyway, you'll feel a pinch.

269
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,742
Damn it!
I'm already stressed from molting.

270
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,328
Hey! How many did you pluck?

271
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,624
Long time no see, brother.

272
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,378
I heard you got out, brother.

273
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,171
It's been, what, almost 1,000 years?

274
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:55,217
So, in my absence,
was the world full of peace and quiet?

275
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,804
You condemned me,
saying I led humans astray.

276
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,683
So tell me. In a world without me,
were all humans kind?

277
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:07,062
I've seen that war, murder, greed,
and selfishness all continued to exist,

278
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,148
even in my absence.

279
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,316
Ever think they're the seeds you sowed?

280
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,445
The idea of humans getting a chance
to make a wish is just wrong.

281
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,407
-Hasn't it ever occurred to you?
-No, it hasn't.

282
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,658
All that occurs to me

283
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,536
is how those flawed lumps of clay
are his mistake.

284
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,164
Proving that hell is fitting
for those lumps of clay

285
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,791
is the task that he bestowed upon me.

286
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,377
Don't forget that
he also bestowed me with a task.

287
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,089
I'm pretty sure you took from my wing
before you were locked up.

288
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,674
What are you up to this time?

289
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,884
Never you mind.

290
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,927
While I was locked up,

291
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,306
for 983 years
without skipping a single day,

292
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,726
you came to visit the desert
where I was locked up

293
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,854
and poured a handful of sand over my lamp.

294
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,689
Was it heavy?

295
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,151
You ought to experience
the burdens humans live with.

296
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,654
My goodness.
You really are an angel, aren't you?

297
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,367
Enough chitchat. Let's truly catch up.

298
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,412
If you wish.
Though, this will be the last time.

299
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,665
I'll be coming for your throat soon.

300
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,431
Wait, where did he go?

301
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,296
Hey! Damn you!

302
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,094
Are you nuts?
Did you just bust through my building?

303
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,514
All the units are sold,
and everyone's due to move in next week!

304
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,642
Any idea what this building's worth?

305
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,643
Let's see.

306
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,980
Would it be worth
the weight of your hypocrisy?

307
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,981
Why, you little!

308
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,693
For a second there,
I almost forgot you were Satan.

309
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,195
Is it hitting home now?

310
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,408
You better watch your back,

311
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,952
for I have returned, brother.

312
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,958
That damn little…

313
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,229
It can only write truths?

314
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,489
WRITTEN BY KI KA-YOUNG

315
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,744
A NEGATIVE ONE AND A STONE IN A SHOE

316
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:19,212
GENIE HAS GOOD LOOKS

317
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,757
It works.

318
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,051
GENIE HAS LOOKS

319
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,803
Wow. Brutal.

320
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,436
I AM

321
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,400
I AM GRANDMA'S BURDEN

322
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,697
I AM GRANDMA'S STRENGTH

323
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,540
Ka-young.

324
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,209
Try some of these.

325
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,880
Chang-sik dropped off a huge basketful,
and they're incredibly sweet.

326
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,510
-Grandma.
-Yes?

327
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,347
All this time,
I've been fooled by everyone.

328
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,974
I'm not a burden to you, Grandma.

329
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,810
I'm your strength.

330
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:15,936
Goodness me.

331
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,147
You must not be all that smart
if you're only just figuring that out.

332
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,024
I guess being first doesn't mean much.

333
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,111
Eat up. It'll give you strength.

334
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:31,576
Actually, Grandma,
strawberries have vitamin C, not strength.

335
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,539
For strength, you want to consume
a primary energy source, like carbs…

336
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,456
Grandma?

337
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,180
Seriously, what's going on
in that head of yours?

338
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,765
Aren't you going to do any work?

339
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,018
-Gonna sell the strawberries next year?
-Aye, ma'am!

340
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,395
It's no big deal.

341
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,272
It wasn't mutual.

342
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,774
It was one-sided.

343
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,276
By the way,

344
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,071
I heard that men in the Middle East
really do rub noses like that.

345
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,867
I hear they only do that to dignitaries
whom they deeply respect.

346
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,618
What, so I'm a dignitary?

347
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,661
I guess so.

348
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,255
You're the only one for me!

349
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:28,300
Peace has been restored
to our briefly rattled family!

350
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,968
Sure, all right.

351
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,805
What kind of fresh bullcrap is this?

352
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,225
Didn't you say there was a draw
to assign festival booths?

353
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,478
-Get to work, will you?
-Aye, ma'am!

354
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:44,065
Please do your best to keep sales steady
during the festival period.

355
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,859
Our branch manager is very concerned.

356
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:49,404
Pay closer attention to the displays
and offer samples proactively.

357
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,281
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,991
Ms. Kang Im-seon?

359
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,869
I've told you multiple times
to wear makeup.

360
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,079
And remove that pain relief patch.

361
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,083
Hello?

362
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,793
Answer me, please.

363
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,545
Yes, Assistant Manager Lee.

364
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,981
What's this?

365
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,527
I didn't know we sold anything like this.

366
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,474
What is that?

367
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,852
I am Genie, the lamp spirit.

368
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,855
I shall grant you three wishes.

369
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,693
Make them.

370
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,405
No bringing back the dead.

371
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,574
No traveling to the future.

372
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,828
Anything besides that, your wish…

373
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,456
is my command.

374
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,509
She made her first wish?

375
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,098
I get what the negative one means,

376
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,184
but what's with the stone?

377
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,479
-There's always something.
-Not your concern.

378
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,524
So what did Ms. Kang wish for?

379
00:26:55,989 --> 00:27:00,910
KANG IM-SEON, SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE

380
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:07,626
APRIL 19, 2024, MADE HER FIRST WISH

381
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,671
I'm Kang Im-seon,
your newly appointed branch manager.

382
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,883
TO BECOME BRANCH MANAGER

383
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,470
I've worked
at this supermarket for 20 years,

384
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,222
since the year after it opened.

385
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,807
But that young brat

386
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,769
landed assistant manager
just by having a college degree.

387
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,355
I'm still just a temp.

388
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,318
Make me that bitch's superior officer.

389
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,028
The branch manager.

390
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,115
That is my first wish.

391
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,666
Oh boy. Good for you, Im-seon.

392
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,001
She worked so hard.

393
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,836
Congratulations.

394
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,590
Assistant Manager Lee?

395
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,426
You'll work the frozen goods
discount display today.

396
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,511
Me?

397
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,764
You never seem satisfied
with the employees' work.

398
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,350
And wear a lighter shade of lipstick.

399
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,894
Stop wafting your perfume
around the tasting stations.

400
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,231
Hello?

401
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,234
Answer me, please!

402
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,405
Yes, Branch Manager Kang.

403
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,160
All right, then. Let's open our doors.

404
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,870
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,499
What on earth is going on?

406
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,753
I know. How can a temp employee
become branch manager overnight?

407
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,380
How did that happen?

408
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,965
Who knows?

409
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,052
You're due for an oil change.

410
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,388
I am, aren't I?

411
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,765
Actually,

412
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,976
I'll be getting a new car.

413
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,477
An imported one.

414
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,479
Don't you worry about me anymore.

415
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,319
Are you seeing it now?

416
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,530
The true nature of humanity?

417
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,116
One thing I definitely didn't know.

418
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,993
That I'd lose a client.

419
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,913
But is it okay for you
to be seen with me like this?

420
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,959
The wishmakers know you're a genie.
Shouldn't you avoid being seen with me?

421
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,213
In their eyes, I'm a mere sand whirl.

422
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:21,009
But I tend to emit a golden light
to appear more mystical.

423
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,595
There's no real functional purpose.

424
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,184
Min-ji tends to wear a gown
to appear more like a dentist.

425
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,937
If one holds a syringe without a gown on…

426
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,152
You're really gonna cut it off there?

427
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,404
Wow. You're evil.

428
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,952
I've been itching to know for ages.
Who even is this Min-ji?

429
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,207
Would you move
your damn head, Choi Min-ji?

430
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,084
I can't see the psychopath's head
because of you.

431
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,799
So, do you really have the urge
to kill people and stuff?

432
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,301
In gruesome ways?

433
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,096
I did just now.

434
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,264
Just now?

435
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,226
Damn, I almost pissed myself.

436
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,811
Getting hit hurts.

437
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,230
She might not say it,
but it still physically hurts.

438
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,023
Did she fucking say "physically"?

439
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,902
That's why we hit her, dumbass.
So it hurts.

440
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,157
You do that even though you know?

441
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,701
You know the rules, yet you still hit her?

442
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,495
You don't hold back?

443
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,125
This is fucking boring.

444
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,837
Hey, let's finish this smoke and bounce.

445
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,016
What the fuck? I smell gasoline.

446
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,310
It fucking reeks of gasoline.

447
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,604
You fucking bitch.
What the hell are you doing?

448
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,022
Setting this place on fire.

449
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,483
The story will be
you started the fire while smoking.

450
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,819
Do we look like dipshits to you,
you psycho bitch?

451
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,279
There are so many witnesses--

452
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,114
-Fuck!
-Damn it!

453
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:07,949
So?

454
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,743
Shall I eliminate the witnesses, then?

455
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,914
Okay, we get it. Fine. We won't touch you.

456
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,543
Don't touch Choi Min-ji either.
This is our new rule.

457
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,420
Fine.

458
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,093
Be my friend.

459
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,178
We're the only ones
who don't have friends.

460
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,224
In South Korea, it's far more efficient
to be in a pair than alone.

461
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,102
What happens if I say I don't want to?

462
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,604
You don't have a choice.

463
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,148
That's why, starting today,
you and I are friends.

464
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,609
Also, your grades suck.

465
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,527
Memorize all of this.

466
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,112
If you don't, I'll kill you.

467
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,949
Solve these, or I'll kill you.

468
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,370
Pass the interview and oral exam.

469
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,122
If you don't, I'll kill you.

470
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,832
That's what I needed to hear.

471
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,918
You have no other choice.

472
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,128
Pass, Choi Min-ji!

473
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:05,006
ODD TEETH AND ODD PEOPLE WELCOME

474
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,550
That's so funny.
It says, "Odd people welcome."

475
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,636
-How ridiculous.
-Tell me about it.

476
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:13,431
In my experience,
it's the odd ones who change the world.

477
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,018
One of the wishmakers
from Ms. Ki Ka-young's first wish

478
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,811
has made their first wish.

479
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,481
Today's Cheongpung
is not the same as yesterday's.

480
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,733
Congratulations, Master.

481
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,612
If we steer Ms. Ki Ka-young's
last two wishes the right way,

482
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,907
you'll at last be able to do
what you've longed for.

483
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,200
Slit Iblis's throat.

484
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,410
So that's what they wanted my wing for.

485
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,370
To keep a record.

486
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,833
You know it took me 20 years
to study psychopaths, don't you?

487
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,420
I actually thought Ki Ka-young
wouldn't make any wishes.

488
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:48,716
For now, I'm happy that I've caught
a lucky break, but something feels off.

489
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,804
I tossed all my books, but maybe
I'm not done researching psychopaths.

490
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,723
Anyway, what's Iblis up to these days?

491
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,558
Canned beer and video game machines.

492
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,813
-Think he'll show up when he's broke?
-Yes.

493
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,065
He's using Sade's money right now.

494
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,902
Hate comments have been flooding
the foundation's website since yesterday.

495
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,947
Judging by the typos and content,
they're clearly written

496
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,949
by Iblis.

497
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,575
BEAUTIFUL RYU SU-HYEON. RESPECT!

498
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,952
ANON: WHY? ARE YOU STOOPID?

499
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,423
No!

500
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,633
Please, no!

501
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,722
Sang-hyeok found money when he did this.

502
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,608
Hey, human.

503
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,322
Who? Me?

504
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,286
What do you want?

505
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,079
Pick it up.

506
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,873
The Earth is hurting.

507
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,083
Even Ki Ka-young picks up after herself.

508
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,377
The Earth?

509
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:08,921
It's hurting?

510
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,091
I guess today's my lucky day.

511
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,351
I'm gonna toss this one too.
Infuriating, isn't it?

512
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,561
Then hit me.

513
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,854
Wow.

514
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,898
I almost swooned.

515
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,527
Any other day, you'd be exactly my type,

516
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,112
but not today.

517
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,572
Sade!

518
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:41,913
Yes, Master.

519
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:45,208
What the heck? Where'd you show up from?

520
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,709
Take care of him for me.

521
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,128
And hand over any spare change you have.

522
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,758
That was incredibly smooth.

523
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,595
Keep glaring at me. I dare you.

524
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,687
Come on, bring it. Just so you know,
touch me, and I'll demand a settlement.

525
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,647
Got it?

526
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,112
Don't come any closer!

527
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,617
Back off! Don't come any closer!

528
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,454
What are you going to do
about the 1,800 won I lost because of you?

529
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,458
Nice going.

530
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,501
Irem!

531
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,214
How long has it been? 100 years?

532
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,093
Excuse me. Have you seen a girl
who looks like this?

533
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,184
Irem!

534
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:50,606
So you've been here
the whole time since then?

535
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,653
Yes. Ejllael decided to settle here.
Death ran rampant back then.

536
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,490
They said it was black,
so keep an eye out.

537
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,410
-Okay.
-Shouldn't we search during the day?

538
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,124
Who goes there? Who are you?

539
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,002
Is that Director Ryu's assistant
and Mr. Seo I-deuk?

540
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,671
This isn't the time or place
for a rendezvous.

541
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:17,091
A panther or whatever was spotted
in town, and everyone's on edge.

542
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,677
Are you sure
it's a panther and not a jaguar--

543
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,262
A jaguar?

544
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,599
It's probably hiding in the mountains,
so let's head back down now.

545
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,392
-It's dangerous. Go on.
-Sure, thanks.

546
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,393
Hurry along.

547
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,061
Goodbye.

548
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:29,979
Go.

549
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,689
Hold on a second.

550
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,859
That tail…

551
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,487
and those ears.

552
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,076
We went to Everland today.

553
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,162
They're hot off the shelf.
Aren't they cute?

554
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,541
Is that right? I must say,
they're so realistic. Go on.

555
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,126
Hurry along.

556
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,715
Grr… Roar.

557
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,343
Shall we hear about
what happened overnight?

558
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:04,639
I would rather die an honorable death
than submit to my mortal enemy.

559
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,474
This is a bad look for jaguars.

560
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,684
I'll bite you.

561
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,647
Please. My elderly mother
is waiting for me at home.

562
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,564
Then

563
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,359
why are you out so late?

564
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,110
You're excused. Go.

565
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,283
Still want to die an honorable death?

566
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,874
I did some digging as you ordered me to.

567
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,419
The auto shop is her side hustle,
and she actually has another day job.

568
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,008
Elon Musk.

569
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,635
Should I just kill him?

570
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,315
She must have made a fortune.
She didn't even pick up the pen.

571
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,527
And now comes the really important intel.

572
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,028
Go on.

573
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,407
How come you close shop
every 4th, 14th, and 24th?

574
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,826
Any particular reason, boss?

575
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,912
Four. Death's number.

576
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,871
DEATH

577
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,875
-She wants Death's number?
-No, that's not it.

578
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:19,505
Anyway, rain or shine,
she has a routine that she sticks to.

579
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,508
Scuba diving on the 4th.
Hiking on the 14th.

580
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,010
The workshop on the 24th.

581
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,720
-And every Wednesday--
-Gamja-tang!

582
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,347
Wow.

583
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,351
So that's what that meant.

584
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,617
"As natural a death as possible."

585
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,246
"…like deep-sea equipment failure…

586
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,877
or a fall on a remote trail."

587
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,724
Ki Ka-young's entire routine

588
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,477
is her way of preparing for her death.

589
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,313
The fact that a human body is 70% water

590
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,774
means that blood
is the heaviest part of it.

591
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,736
So I thought about it, and if you start
by draining the blood, and then…

592
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,406
Here, here, here,

593
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,241
and here.

594
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,370
If you chop them up like so
and stack the pieces,

595
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,038
you'd only need a coffin…

596
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,666
about this small, no?

597
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,003
Ms. Ki Ka-young.
I'm moving overseas next week.

598
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,631
Is business here that slow?

599
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,809
So she just bought the place.

600
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:01,982
Wow.

601
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,318
Coffins and all?

602
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,822
She plans to die
as soon as Oh Pan-geum does.

603
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,115
What if she dies too soon?

604
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,325
You can't exactly
take revenge on the dead.

605
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,536
We'll just have to stop her
from dying too soon.

606
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,454
I have my ways.

607
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:17,915
Let's make sure

608
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,043
Oh Pan-geum sticks around.

609
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:28,092
Oh dear, my back. My goodness.

610
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,054
I'm so old. I should just die soon.

611
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,556
-No!
-Good heavens!

612
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,765
Where on your back?

613
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,393
Where does it hurt? Lie down.

614
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,229
Is it here? Or here? Or maybe here?

615
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,522
-What are you doing?
-Here?

616
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,649
How's that?
Think you'll live a little longer?

617
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,362
Good heavens, my shoulder.

618
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,324
What would be the use in cooking
a delicious stew with this garlic?

619
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,325
In my old age--

620
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,493
No!

621
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,744
What about the garlic?

622
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,414
Should I grind it? Hand it here.

623
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:05,921
If you followed her here
all the way from the Middle East,

624
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,007
you must have
some pretty serious feelings.

625
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,176
Well, I knew as soon as I saw her

626
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,803
that she was the one
I'd been waiting for all this time.

627
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,762
Goodness me.

628
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,432
At first sight? Right away?

629
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,643
Of course, Ki Ka-young
didn't believe me at first.

630
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,356
So I took her up a skyscraper.

631
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,360
One of those places where you can see
all the city lights and the night sky?

632
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,614
So what did you do up there?

633
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,367
That's a little intense for your ears.

634
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,745
But one thing's for sure.

635
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,873
Ki Ka-young is unlike
any other woman I've ever met.

636
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,167
She just drives me wild,
so I grabbed her neck--

637
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,669
Gracious me, stop that now!

638
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,840
In any case, you mean to say

639
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,636
you came all this way after falling
for each other at first sight?

640
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,054
Falling?

641
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,515
It wasn't a fall. More of a thud.

642
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,558
It was totally a thud.

643
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,019
Still brings tears to my eyes.

644
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,940
Say your four pillars.

645
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,858
"Four pillars"? What's that?

646
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,320
The day you were born.
It's best if you know the time too.

647
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:17,368
The day I was born, you say?
I was born on a Thursday.

648
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,996
Around 13.8 billion years

649
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:22,706
BC.

650
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,381
No need to call me "sir" though.

651
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,303
Let me see.

652
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,390
I really should get around
to tending to that field.

653
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,579
Oh Pan-geum might live forever,
but you might not last long.

654
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,290
Here. I brought you a snack.

655
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,084
There's something
I couldn't tell you last time.

656
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,921
My boss asked me
if she and I had also met before.

657
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,260
What do you mean by that?

658
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,013
Of course we have. We met just yesterday.

659
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,432
Not that. I mean, 983 years ago.

660
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,269
Do you recall that time now?

661
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,355
No. Your master said that he and I
knew each other from the past,

662
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,608
so I wondered if you and I
had also met before.

663
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,234
We did, actually.

664
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,153
But so what if we did?

665
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,447
I want to know what happened.

666
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,742
Back then…

667
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,078
how did I die?

668
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,373
So she doesn't remember.

669
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,792
She only cares about how she died.

670
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,295
I was locked up because of her.

671
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,633
I spent 983 years thinking only about her.

672
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,928
What were you thinking about?

673
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,768
Whether that lump of clay, near death,
regretted using her wishes on others.

674
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,606
Why am I asking myself that over and over
in this uncomfortable position?

675
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,775
And why do I only have
one piece of furniture?

676
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,154
Hundreds of years passed
as I pondered these three questions.

677
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,031
But the key thing is…

678
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:22,368
Whatever you say next
better be meaningful.

679
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,246
I still don't know the answers.

680
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,248
Damn it.

681
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,626
Not exactly smart.

682
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,002
Don't you dare tell her

683
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,713
that she made three righteous wishes
before dying, okay?

684
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,801
About her being righteous in every life
after that and… just everything.

685
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,512
Never, okay?
You can't tell the lump of clay.

686
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,514
I wouldn't dare tell her.

687
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,225
But do you know
that Master's master is just outside?

688
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,481
How much did you hear?

689
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,359
Not exactly observant either.

690
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:58,862
What the hell?

691
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,031
Why shut the door?

692
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:06,328
Why are you dressed pretty today?
Hey, Ki Ka-young. Where are you going?

693
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,163
Ki Ka-young!

694
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,166
PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC

695
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,420
Ms. Ki Ka-young, please come in.

696
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:38,444
Why do I have to carry all this?
I don't feel good. And I'm dizzy.

697
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,778
I'm wearing heels.

698
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,368
I'm going to need
a better reason than that.

699
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:49,997
What are we doing here?

700
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:54,877
Normal people come to places like this
to eat, take pictures, and such.

701
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,598
Right this way.

702
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:40,881
Your daily pills.

703
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,925
Do you get them from that place?

704
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,927
Do they make you better?

705
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,638
What do you think?
They're for Grandma's peace of mind.

706
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,141
A few are vitamins.

707
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,815
Why? Were you hoping
the pills would make me better?

708
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,442
Do you always feel like killing me?

709
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,821
Because you're Satan?

710
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,826
I never said that.

711
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:10,869
So, what?

712
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,165
You're not normal,
so where do you actually want to go?

713
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,777
Swear you won't push me this time.

714
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,258
You don't think we were caught
on any cameras, do you?

715
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,802
Who knows?

716
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,350
Maybe I will push you.

717
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,897
I don't understand
why you're angry right now.

718
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,523
Right now, you do know.

719
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,572
It's nice that you can
find comfort somewhere.

720
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,199
I guess this is one perk
of owning the lamp.

721
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:37,122
It's dark up here, so maybe it'd be harder
to see that I'm devoid of emotions.

722
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,292
In that sense, I like you.

723
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,840
Come on,

724
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,177
you can't just drop
something like that on me.

725
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,099
Why exactly

726
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,518
do you like me?

727
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,020
You

728
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,773
are like the cars I fix,

729
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:06,735
my adjustable wrench, the wheels I roll,
those sorts of things.

730
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,237
I don't need to read your emotions.

731
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,239
You're sturdy.

732
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,116
And sometimes, you shine.

733
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,328
Of all the things I've owned since birth,

734
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:20,457
Grandma, Min-ji, the auto shop, my car,

735
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,668
gamja-tang, frogs…

736
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,420
-Frogs?
-The sound of dental scaling…

737
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,839
If I'm this far down the list,
you must not like me.

738
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,675
You haven't even mentioned me yet.

739
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:32,928
Fine.

740
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,305
I shall try to improve my rank.

741
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,435
Dear Master. Today, I shall gift you
with the greatest darkness.

742
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,133
Now we can finally see the stars.

743
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:37,993
What?

744
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:39,953
Do it.

745
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,457
Do what?

746
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,710
When a man says something like
"Let's gaze at the stars,"

747
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,587
then it's 100% the moment to kiss.

748
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,088
It's the moment

749
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,673
for a kiss.

750
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,928
I've always wondered how it feels.

751
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,932
That's not what this is!
What do you take spirits for?

752
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,437
I won't kiss you.

753
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,230
That's not fair. Why not?

754
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,149
You mentioned the stars!

755
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,447
Fine. Then just stand still.

756
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,699
I'll do it.

757
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,248
What's this? Are they usually like this?

758
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,042
No, I--

759
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,877
Don't move. Let me try again.

760
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,349
It still feels exactly the same.

761
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,895
Why do people even like doing this?

762
00:51:59,074 --> 00:51:59,991
Wow.

763
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,205
I really didn't want to do this…

764
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:10,836
but you're wrong.

765
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,712
It's different when I do it.

766
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:36,142
