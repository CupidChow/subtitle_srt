1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,679
I am a spirit created by smokeless fire,

2
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:13,805
a genie.

3
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,017
We were created on Thursday,

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,269
the day after the angels.

5
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,614
If you hear what I am saying now
in your native language,

6
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,701
that's because I am a genie.

7
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,541
Genie, turn off the alarm.

8
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:47,422
With our supernatural strength
and mystical powers,

9
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,965
we genies grew more arrogant,

10
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,426
even aspiring to surpass him.

11
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,387
But I had no interest in any of that.

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,474
Becoming greater than him

13
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,310
would be such a hassle, no?

14
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:07,025
Despite this, he,
in his rage, sent his angels,

15
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,903
ordering them to decimate
the haughty genies.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,364
After 300 years,
the long battle came to an end.

17
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,662
So did the lives of all genies
except a few, including myself.

18
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,542
I took refuge in a lamp.

19
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,297
Once the world was purified,
on the very next day, a Friday,

20
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,966
he created another species to replace us.

21
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,428
Out of clay, he made you.

22
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,680
Humans.

23
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,103
And then he commanded all
to bow their heads

24
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,146
to the first human he created.

25
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,317
All angels and surviving genies
bowed their heads,

26
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,071
but I refused to do so.

27
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,373
APRIL 5TH
FLYING OUT

28
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,708
I, who was created from smokeless fire,

29
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,628
could not bow my head to a human

30
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,880
molded from mere clay.

31
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,801
Enraged, he threw me out of heaven.

32
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,221
Fallen to hell,

33
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,306
I made just one request.

34
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,853
I would agree to my fate on one condition.

35
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,564
That I be allowed to tempt humans

36
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,942
and drag them down to hell.

37
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,488
I vowed to prove to him

38
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,700
just how pathetic
his precious humans truly were.

39
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,077
He granted my request

40
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,746
but named a condition of his own.

41
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,001
Did you get that?

42
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,880
I shall grant your request.

43
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,923
But if you happen to meet

44
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,801
even one pure human soul,

45
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,137
you will be cast
to a depth greater than hell…

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,556
What's it rambling on about
all on its own?

47
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,849
Maybe it's broken.

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,769
That is the origin story

49
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,647
of the three wishes
that you humans know of.

50
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:15,445
After that, I left hell to inhabit vessels
such as lamps, rings, or jars…

51
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:23,494
granting three wishes
to any human who summoned me.

52
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,915
Humans are selfish and lazy.

53
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,835
They are insatiable
and quick to betray those closest to them.

54
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,464
They kept sinking deeper into corruption,
and I was vindicated.

55
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,090
I had been

56
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:37,926
right all along.

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,303
But you.

58
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,931
You, from a small land in the East.

59
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:47,977
Even while taking your final breath,
you used your three wishes for others.

60
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,188
It just could not be.

61
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,814
Little girl.

62
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,025
Little girl made of clay.

63
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,402
You frail, dying human.

64
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,239
I shall observe your death,

65
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,994
and I shall take a handful of dirt
that is, in part, your flesh and bones.

66
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,916
Because of you, my lamp might end up
buried deeper than darkness itself.

67
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,086
But even so,
I will not bow my head to you,

68
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,796
a lowly being made of mere clay.

69
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,757
I shall remember your gaze

70
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,635
and the smell of your clay.

71
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,430
And, if a new master appears
and summons me,

72
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,268
when I am able to be
a part of this world once more,

73
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,311
I will scour the world

74
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,730
and find you again.

75
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,275
I shall do whatever it takes
to corrupt you

76
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,986
and kill you.

77
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,071
Remember this.

78
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,991
I will seek you out, and my name…

79
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,329
is Iblis.

80
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,559
GENIE, MAKE A WISH

81
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,272
One Gogung set meal.

82
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,690
Right away, ma'am.

83
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,372
Stop it.

84
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,706
Stop coming.

85
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,458
I saw you every year.

86
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,793
I knew it was you.

87
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,630
The same table, the same day.
Every year, for ten years.

88
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,882
You've done enough.

89
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,384
Did you think I wouldn't know?

90
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,802
Of course you should know.

91
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:30,807
That's why Auntie's been leaving cash
and taking my photos for over ten years.

92
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,141
Right?

93
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,602
Mom.

94
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,735
She said not to worry about money.

95
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,196
-Just take care of Ka-young--
-Take care of her? How?

96
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,115
What does she expect me to do?

97
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,033
So she doesn't seek out her mom.

98
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,118
Goodness!

99
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,744
That wretched bitch!

100
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,205
Should I tell Ka-young her mom's dead?

101
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,124
And she calls herself a mother?

102
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,960
Goodness, she was just a little girl.

103
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,005
What mother abandons her child
for being difficult?

104
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,369
That's when Grandma
started growing chilies.

105
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,289
And so, every year,
the chili field grew, grew--

106
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,790
-I don't want to know.
-Grew…

107
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,625
I don't want to hear it.

108
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,211
-What is it you want to--
-Please don't cut me off.

109
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,340
After 20 years, you're finally hearing
your youngest daughter's voice.

110
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,394
It grew, grew, and grew.

111
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,354
It's much wider now.

112
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:01,939
The chili field.

113
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,234
How did you find out where we live?

114
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,528
Are you quizzing me?

115
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,072
Bet you're happy to have ID.

116
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,533
Yes, I'm stoked.

117
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,495
RESIDENT REGISTRATION
CERTIFIED COPIES, EXTRACTIONS

118
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,830
A copy of my residence record, please.

119
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,086
You must be Ka-young.

120
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,173
What brings you here?

121
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,758
I checked the register.

122
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,428
This building that you manage, Auntie,
appears to belong to my mom.

123
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,388
Where are they now?

124
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,934
My dead mom, dad,
eldest sister, and second sister?

125
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,571
One Gogung set meal.

126
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,866
One Gogung set meal.

127
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,368
One Gogung set meal.

128
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,912
One Gogung set meal.

129
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,086
What do you do for your hands to be…

130
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,757
You know better than I do
why I abandoned you.

131
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,342
I've sent you plenty of money.

132
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,011
This? I bought it
with my hard-earned money.

133
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,390
All the money you sent me
was donated long ago.

134
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,644
These hands?

135
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,274
So you didn't even ask your sister
what I do for a living.

136
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,696
It's work where I get scratched,
cut, and burned every day.

137
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,407
Don't I sound just like a murderous bitch?

138
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,747
Grandma told me
that people should always be kind.

139
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,376
I know that face too.

140
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,297
A face of fear.

141
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,885
You learned to be kind?

142
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,305
You say you know what fear is?

143
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,307
If so, would I have left you?

144
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,434
You never even tried to teach me!

145
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,274
The thing is, ma'am,

146
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,320
in Ka-young's case,
trying to teach her won't work.

147
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,821
How can that be?

148
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,157
Why say that without even trying?

149
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,952
Even if the whole world says
it's impossible, I won't give up on her.

150
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,705
Please just tell me about her classes.

151
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,708
What did my Ka-young do to the frog?

152
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,752
Did she not do the dissection correctly?

153
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,795
No. She actually did it perfectly.

154
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,592
Then why did you ask to see me?

155
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,178
That class was two months ago in spring.

156
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,306
But Ka-young was still
pleading with me today.

157
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,225
She's been begging to dissect frogs again.

158
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,520
She wants to do it all the time
and asks why we don't do it more.

159
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,773
She's asked every single day since.

160
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,038
That hurts.

161
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,456
You hurt me!

162
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,168
The frog's hurting too.
But the frog can't even tell you that!

163
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,629
Damn it!

164
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,803
I can't breathe!

165
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,055
Neither can I.

166
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,349
Let me go!

167
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,185
I'll kill you, Grandma!
I'm gonna kill you!

168
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,645
You let go first.

169
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,271
I'll let go if you let go.

170
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,997
That hurt! I'm going to kill you!

171
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,125
I'll kill you, Grandma!

172
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,170
When you hug someone,

173
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,172
I will also hug you.

174
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,010
If you cut someone with a knife,
I will also cut you with a knife.

175
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,555
And if you kill someone,

176
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,683
I will kill you too.

177
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,062
These are our rules. Do you understand?

178
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,814
Let go of me!

179
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,315
You're hurting me!

180
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,109
Learn through the pain.

181
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,153
Learn until you're out of breath.

182
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,822
If you can't seem to learn, memorize.

183
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:21,782
Ka-young.

184
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,994
Look closely at my face.

185
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,662
This is

186
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,330
despair.

187
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,710
If you see Grandma making this face again,

188
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,919
it means

189
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,047
that you and I will both die. Am I clear?

190
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,722
I missed it!

191
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,809
Do it again! Your face of despair!

192
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,305
I've already forgotten about the despair.

193
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,766
This is hope.

194
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,935
The face of hope.

195
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,399
So, after that,

196
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,861
I stopped doing those things
because those were our rules.

197
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,822
But living like that

198
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,741
means life is just no fun.

199
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,660
I'm so bored, Mom.

200
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,704
-What on earth are--
-I told you not to cut me off.

201
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,667
I was always curious.

202
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,711
On TV, people in this situation
cry their eyes out.

203
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,840
I wondered if I'd cry.
Whether you would cry.

204
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,509
I was just curious, you know.

205
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,887
But here we are, both dry-eyed.

206
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,765
Grandma sometimes cries in secret.

207
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,392
I assume

208
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,185
it's because of me.

209
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,312
But you know, Mom,

210
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,607
if Grandma ever cries
because of you again…

211
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,529
my hands will be wringing your neck.

212
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,658
Until you are no longer able
to make any face at all.

213
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,701
Until the very end.

214
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,916
I came to say this
in case you ever did talk to me.

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,918
Since you spoke to me this time…

216
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,462
I won't be back.

217
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,009
Bye, Mom.

218
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,222
THIS IS DUBI-DUBAI TOURS
PLEASE BRING AN EXTRA LAYER

219
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,445
My goodness, what a view!

220
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,863
"Dubai."

221
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,365
"Dubai."

222
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,993
"Dubai."

223
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,079
"Dubai."

224
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,414
Listen up, everyone.

225
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,292
Can you all see
that sand whirl over there?

226
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,505
In Arabic culture, they refer to
that phenomenon as a "waltzing genie."

227
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,633
No way, a genie?
You mean the lamp spirit we all know?

228
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,759
How incredible!

229
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:13,555
But it looks like a sandstorm is coming.
Are you all okay to continue the tour?

230
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,685
You underestimate Koreans.
You all have your masks, don't you?

231
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,103
-Let's go.
-Sure.

232
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,981
Okay, you've got an hour of free time.

233
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,066
-Feel free to keep taking photos.
-Okay.

234
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,695
The waltz is a partner dance,
but they're doing it solo? What a loser.

235
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,447
You're right. They're a total loser.

236
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,324
My gosh, you're right.

237
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,661
Goodness, dear. You're a hoot!

238
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,539
Wow, honestly, you're--

239
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,790
Where's your hotel?

240
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,168
Oh boy, look at the genie!

241
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,504
Mom, wait for me.

242
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,632
Waltz!

243
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,280
How's the desert tour?

244
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,367
CHOI MIN-JI

245
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,911
Vast, hot, and windy.

246
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,914
Perfect for burying a family of four.

247
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,167
Stop that! Ticktock, ticktock.

248
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,076
Why are you getting in my way?

249
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,954
Why do you keep interfering?

250
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,459
What the hell did I do
to put that damn look of fear on you?

251
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:09,129
You didn't even try to make an excuse.
And why is your skin so perfect?

252
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,130
You've had it

253
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,298
easy…

254
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,176
all along.

255
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,846
The Gogung set meal tastes like crap.

256
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,098
It's a damn rip-off!

257
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,368
I just threw it behind me…

258
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,373
Who was that?

259
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,542
Who's messing with me, damn it?

260
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,456
Wow! The genie is dancing the waltz!

261
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,293
Amazing. It looks incredible!

262
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,835
Move, and I'll stab you.

263
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,799
Your hair is…

264
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,678
Who are you? Why did you follow me?

265
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,230
I said I'd stab you.

266
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:34,858
So it is you.

267
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,818
The smell of that clay.

268
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,738
The same lump of clay

269
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:41,907
that imprisoned me.

270
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,162
It's been 983 years.

271
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,958
You almost got me.

272
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,011
What's with this almighty idiot?

273
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,847
WHAT'S WITH THIS ALMIGHTY IDIOT?
"What's with this almighty idiot?"

274
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,851
There is only one Almighty. I'm a spirit.

275
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,981
Listen carefully, little girl.

276
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,524
My name

277
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,734
is Iblis.

278
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,195
I was created from a smokeless fire…

279
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,073
Why'd you shake my lamp like that?

280
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,538
People know me as a Jinn

281
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,456
or Genie…

282
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,585
You shook it too hard.

283
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,048
Hey, stop there.

284
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,758
My lamp.

285
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,928
I told you to stop for a moment.
I know you're her!

286
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,597
I'm Genie.

287
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,269
I'm the one and only Genie,
spirit of the lamp!

288
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,618
It's actually this long, but I usually
wear it nice and short like earlier.

289
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,540
Damn.

290
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,337
I'll admit this is pretty impressive.

291
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,671
How did you get in here?

292
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,215
I'm pretty sure
I told you in a loud voice earlier.

293
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,134
I am the lamp spirit, Genie.

294
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,184
I can inhabit whatever I want,
"Kki Kka-young."

295
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,562
You have perfect pronunciation,
but butcher my name?

296
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,609
It appears that you don't quite grasp
the situation, so listen carefully.

297
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,612
I don't listen to what others say.
Only my grandma.

298
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,447
Consider these your grandma's words.

299
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,948
I'm here against her wishes.

300
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,075
Piss off!

301
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,993
You're contradicting yourself!

302
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,662
Do you seriously not remember me?

303
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,499
From 983 years ago.

304
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,250
Nothing rings a bell?

305
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,294
If you're talking about 983 years ago,

306
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,838
that'd be the Goryeo era.

307
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,007
Choi Soo-jong founded a country

308
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,594
and went on about something-jong
and this or that king, then Goryeo fell.

309
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,221
How would I remember that?

310
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,764
Is that how far back we go?

311
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:14,309
Yes, that's how far back we go!
Look at my hair, will you?

312
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,520
Come on, don't you see how long it is?

313
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,604
I see it.

314
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,066
So your hair grew that long
over 983 years,

315
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,901
but your beard hasn't grown an inch?

316
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,280
Of course,

317
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,825
that's a perfectly valid question.

318
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,412
But I don't really have an explanation,
and I'd rather move on,

319
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,830
so can you just cooperate?

320
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,834
Do you know what it took for me
to stay in that lamp for 983 years?

321
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,751
I'll bite.

322
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,212
What did it take?

323
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,298
The dignity I was born with.

324
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,803
Goryeo.

325
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,430
Where the hell is Goryeo?

326
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,141
I'm going to destroy it
as soon as I get out!

327
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,686
The thing is, Master,
the land called "Goryeo"

328
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:04,192
no longer exists as it was overthrown
by someone called "Yi Seong-gye."

329
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,487
They also believe
in the cycle of death and rebirth.

330
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,740
Something "carnage," was it?

331
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,909
Reincarnation.

332
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,080
So they are reincarnated.

333
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,251
Sade, head to that country this instant.

334
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,964
Go there and search every inch of it
with a fine-toothed comb.

335
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,968
Check if that lump of clay was reborn.

336
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,907
Hey, excuse me?

337
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,328
Right, look here. Can I…

338
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,501
Excuse me? Might you have

339
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,003
seen this girl?

340
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,257
I'm not sure. I don't think
I've seen her around these parts.

341
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,066
I upheld my dignity,
even up to the 600-year mark.

342
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,819
Though I guess
I did wear the lamp out a bit.

343
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,661
Just let me out already, will you?

344
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,665
Why do I only have one piece of furniture?
It's way too short for me!

345
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,876
I know you're listening.

346
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,753
Hello?

347
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,090
FUCK
F U

348
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,883
F U

349
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,218
Seriously?

350
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,099
Darn lump of clay.

351
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,769
I'm coming for you.
Just wait till I'm out!

352
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,023
Master, something called
an automobile has been invented!

353
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:11,486
These wheeled things
walk around on their own now!

354
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,115
I'm telling you so you don't freak out
or start gawking when you get out.

355
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,118
Sade came by now and then
to inform me of the changing world.

356
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:23,248
And when I visited the East, I acquired
the face of someone from that region.

357
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,585
I like it so much
that I've been wearing it ever since!

358
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,795
I'm not sure why,

359
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:32,340
but the lady of the house
keeps giving me heaps of rice…

360
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,137
That was around the 800-year mark,

361
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,306
and I was ready to blow a fuse.

362
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,390
Think about it.

363
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,685
I sent countless humans to hell.

364
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,730
Out of all those humans,
only one had a pure soul.

365
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,773
So why is it all on me?

366
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,109
Does no one else find this odd?

367
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,405
Going through all that
made me miss you so much. Truly!

368
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,907
I hoped you would be reborn

369
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,701
and that, even once,

370
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,371
you would find yourself dreaming
of meeting a spirit like me.

371
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,374
I hoped you'd have
a lot of friends and a lot of family

372
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,835
so I'd have
a ton of opportunities to ruin you.

373
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,836
And then,

374
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,923
when the 900th year rolled around,
I finally prayed.

375
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,844
"Please, I beg for just one more…"

376
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,515
Asleep, it seems.

377
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:27,062
Dozing off on a genie?
What did you hear before your dreams?

378
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,731
The 700-year part when I was midstream?

379
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,067
Would starting over be too extreme?

380
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,736
Darn it.

381
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,345
What the hell does it say?

382
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,264
It says you shouldn't shake it.

383
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,726
That an ill-tempered genie
might get angry.

384
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,189
Well, you made a great first impression.
Dare I say, affable?

385
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,774
Well, how kind of you.

386
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,734
So you were awake?

387
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,320
I just woke up
because it got so interesting.

388
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,950
Or I woke up, and it got interesting.

389
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,287
So what happened after you prayed?
Did you receive an answer?

390
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:28,957
I did.

391
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,050
Dear Iblis,

392
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,345
I will grant your request.

393
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:52,105
But if the day comes
when you bow before my creations again,

394
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,860
you shall be beheaded.

395
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,404
What did you pray for?

396
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,782
"Please, I beg for just one more…"
and then?

397
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,119
Chance.

398
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,539
Please, I beg for

399
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,041
just one more

400
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,918
chance.

401
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,756
If the new master who releases me

402
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,383
is another of your cherished creations,

403
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,636
if they are a truly righteous human,

404
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,347
then I will banish myself
to hell forevermore.

405
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,854
But if I do manage to corrupt them, then…

406
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,319
let me be a free genie!

407
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,407
Grant me the eternal freedom to move
between heaven and hell as I please.

408
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,495
Sure, you might wonder
how that's any different from now,

409
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,872
but the devil's in the details, you know?

410
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,874
Okay?

411
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,386
And at long last,

412
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,848
I realized that a new master had appeared.

413
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,312
But after all that, it's you again?

414
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,523
I figured it was a good thing.

415
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,691
But who knew you'd act like this?

416
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,859
How have I been acting?

417
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,278
Right now,
you don't respect or fear me at all.

418
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,239
You're a mere lump of clay.

419
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,990
So I'm gonna prove it for good.

420
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,159
What a failure his creations truly are.

421
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,371
The extent to which
humans can be corrupted.

422
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,793
You're saying this to my face?
Over breakfast?

423
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,507
So what is it that you want from me?

424
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,719
Have we not discussed that yet?

425
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,139
Oh, that's right.

426
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,184
What I want is three of your wishes.

427
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,520
Not one, not two, but three whole wishes.

428
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,063
The rules are simple.

429
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,482
No bringing back the dead.

430
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,860
No traveling to the future.

431
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,404
Anything besides that,

432
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,406
your wish

433
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,534
is my command.

434
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,875
A face of seduction.

435
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,293
Slick words.

436
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,836
That's right.

437
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,463
Come forth, into corruption.

438
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,965
You're an evil bastard.

439
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,259
Wait, what? You figured that out already?

440
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,596
Well, you're right, I guess.

441
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,764
Evil since the days of BC.

442
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,891
Piss off right now.

443
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,518
Or should my first wish be for you to die?

444
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,519
Easy now.

445
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,439
It's confusing
that you were born like this.

446
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,400
Was the version of you 983 years ago
just full of it?

447
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,111
Perhaps you weren't righteous,
just inarticulate.

448
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,741
I was righteous?

449
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,660
Me?

450
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,913
Master!

451
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,707
The girl was finally reincarnated!

452
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,460
But a war broke out,

453
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:04,589
and she died a hero,
fighting alongside a certain admiral!

454
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,507
Right.

455
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,635
His name was Yi Sun-sin!

456
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,304
I've found the girl again, Master,

457
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,723
but she's dead this time too.

458
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,893
Apparently, she was helping someone
this time too. Who was it again?

459
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:17,894
Of course!

460
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,729
I hear he was called An Jung-geun!

461
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,442
You were like that for three lives,
but I guess this one's different.

462
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,111
Pulling a knife at the drop of a hat?

463
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,781
Now that's a habit I can get behind.

464
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,408
Okay, let's properly corrupt you
in this lifetime.

465
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,785
At its core,

466
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,287
pleasure is needed for corruption.

467
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:40,375
Master, I shall bestow the world's
greatest pleasures upon you today.

468
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,377
Bring me a camel!

469
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,088
I've already called an Uber.

470
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,549
What's an "Uber"?

471
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,677
We don't ride camels anymore.
We ride Ubers.

472
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,429
Right. And what is this "Uber"?

473
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,266
Why should I tell you?

474
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,477
Why do we keep talking in circles?

475
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,981
No, wait.

476
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,109
It's great that you're so rude.

477
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,986
Uber? Sure.

478
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,572
983 years is a long time,
and in that time,

479
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,491
the world must have changed a lot.

480
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,076
No wonder I'm out of the loop.

481
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,786
I just need to remain calm.

482
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,251
Sade the brat!

483
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,379
Why didn't he tell me
about those two-wheeled things?

484
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,755
It almost got me!

485
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,383
It did get you.

486
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,150
What is that?

487
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,861
Why is it making that sound?

488
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,117
Yes, Grandma?

489
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,495
Right now? I'm going to go sightseeing.

490
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,955
All right, good.

491
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,666
You're keeping up with your meds, right?

492
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,877
All right, attagirl.

493
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,588
Don't eat too many cold foods,

494
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,050
and steer clear of any boys
who try to chat you up.

495
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,260
Don't look twice,
even if he calls you pretty.

496
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,097
And if a guy says he'll do things for you,
put him on the phone right away.

497
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,015
You got that?

498
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,434
-She wants me to put you on.
-Put what on?

499
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,812
No way. This face is set to be attractive
to anyone in the world…

500
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,355
What's she saying?

501
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,566
I swear I heard a man's voice.

502
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,443
Hello?

503
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:31,778
Ka-young?

504
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,820
Hello…

505
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,198
Hello?

506
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,116
The only reason I didn't kill

507
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,452
is because of my grandma's rules.

508
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:43,164
I got it out of my system in other ways.
They say nothing beats fatigue.

509
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,791
Beat?

510
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:49,587
Oh, right. Beats fatigue… Fatigue, right.

511
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,674
Yes. Every day from the age of eight
until I went to college,

512
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,345
I would plant sesame with my grandma
and then harvest it. Same with chilies.

513
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,721
A FAMILY-ORIENTED PSYCHOPATH

514
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,225
My entire body would ache,

515
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,937
but I had to memorize poems
and stay at the top of my class.

516
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,023
Every day, I was so exploited for labor

517
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,984
that even if I thought,
"I want to kill something,"

518
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,612
it would soon be morning.

519
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,323
HIGH-FUNCTIONING PSYCHOPATH
SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE

520
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,493
I see. Man, I'm getting chills.

521
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,953
You're so funny, ma'am.

522
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:22,870
NO, IT'S NOT FUNNY

523
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,955
You're older than me.

524
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:24,872
Sorry?

525
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,250
You started farming two months ago?

526
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,167
Yes.

527
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,044
Do you have a car?

528
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:30,962
Yes.

529
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,298
Come by if you have an accident.
First service gets 10% off.

530
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,969
Ma'am-- I mean, Ka-young?

531
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,305
Whatever. You're totally scary
yet super funny.

532
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,600
By the way, I'm just so curious.

533
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,020
Do psychopaths really not feel love?

534
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,065
You know, being ready
to give your life for someone else.

535
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,358
I would be willing

536
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,861
to kill for someone else.

537
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,238
Doesn't that count as love?

538
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,998
VIDEO UPLOADING

539
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,837
Wow, how beautiful!

540
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,840
Mom, I want to buy everything here!

541
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:16,883
Right?

542
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,426
Wow, how beautiful.

543
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,512
Tour guide, I want to buy everything here.

544
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,307
Sorry, why are you telling me that?

545
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,269
Make your three wishes.
Do it now. Right here. This instant.

546
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,104
Get lost. Find yourself a barber.

547
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,898
Is that a wish?

548
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,025
Do you want to get slashed for real?

549
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,531
Hey, why would you say such a thing?
What do you mean…

550
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,916
My gosh. Look at these lamps.

551
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,045
My gosh. Look…

552
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:01,844
You know it's rude to come back
from overseas empty-handed, right?

553
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,597
What is Dubai's most popular souvenir?

554
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,807
Chanel, of course.

555
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,310
Right. Thank you.

556
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,979
Where's the department store?

557
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,858
I was only joking.

558
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,403
I was joking too.

559
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,659
Right, you were joking, weren't you?

560
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,953
That was too funny.

561
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,331
They're all right here. Magic lamps.

562
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,709
Goodness. Do you think
a genie will appear if I rub this?

563
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,378
Make your three wishes.

564
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,256
Do it now. Right here. This instant.

565
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,715
I told you to piss off.

566
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,884
You've picked the wrong person.

567
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,221
I have rules and routines.
Those two things keep my life going.

568
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,557
So I don't have any wishes to begin with.

569
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,143
May I ask

570
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,146
who you're talking to?

571
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,986
Genie. This bastard has been
talking to me nonstop since yesterday.

572
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,288
-Sheesh, she's so strange.
-Don't make eye contact.

573
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,084
Right, only you can see me.

574
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,086
One of my magical powers.

575
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,630
You piece of shit.

576
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,842
You beardless son of a bitch
with your stupid long hair.

577
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,344
You just won't shut up! For fuck's sake!

578
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,637
I told you to piss off!

579
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,307
Why am I the only one to see you?
I look like a lunatic!

580
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,435
You're already corrupt.

581
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,395
Very corrupt.

582
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,939
All right, let's step it up a notch!

583
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,251
Hey, you're back.

584
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,753
So damn salty!

585
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,418
This is driving me nuts.

586
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,170
Try and get rid of me again.

587
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,840
I can't leave your side. You're my master.

588
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,513
I'm considering other options.

589
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,057
Are you the only genie?

590
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,310
No. I'm the most famous genie.

591
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:57,978
Why do you ask?

592
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:20,835
Damn it.

593
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,972
What the hell?
Do all genies look the same?

594
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,893
Do you know a genie with long hair?

595
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,856
I do. And I suppose you're looking
for that genie's weakness,

596
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,775
or his flaws,
or perhaps a way to eliminate him.

597
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,777
So you intend
to fight a genie with a genie?

598
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,989
It's a new angle. I'll give you that.

599
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,198
But, unfortunately,

600
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,493
he is the only genie
among us brothers who grants wishes.

601
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,872
If you've seen him, you'll know.

602
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,792
He can inhabit any space in the world
and is perfect from head to toe.

603
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,336
The walking definition of dignity.
Weaknesses?

604
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,380
None. Flaws? I'd love to give him one.

605
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,215
But eliminating him is quite simple.

606
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,260
I'm sure you've figured it out.
If you make your three wishes…

607
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:12,887
Hey, on your left.

608
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,391
You dare deceive me?

609
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,896
That actually hurts. And what,
have you been all righteous and dignified?

610
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,939
You've rubbed every lamp you could find.

611
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,358
He knows The Art of War?
That's not in my favor.

612
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,156
If things aren't going your way,
start by changing the subject.

613
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,618
You put your hair up. How pretty.

614
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:40,706
It's a pain to lug around.
And it's so obvious that you're lying.

615
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,919
If the conversation gets awkward,
just lean into it.

616
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,006
Never mind the beard business.
How are we communicating?

617
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,132
How do you know Korean?

618
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,012
I don't speak Korean.

619
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,806
I'm speaking Arabic right now.

620
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,225
But wherever I go,

621
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,269
I sound fluent
because I'm the lamp spirit, Genie.

622
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,604
Make it sound like Arabic.

623
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,563
What did you say?

624
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,941
You're Korean, aren't you?
You don't know Arabic.

625
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,735
I'm not Korean or a person.

626
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,905
How much is this? Where is the toilet?

627
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,282
No cilantro, please.

628
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,034
-Happy?
-Sounds like basic Arabic.

629
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,202
I'm a native speaker.

630
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,371
Even your basic Arabic sounds rough.

631
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,290
It's all in your head.
Have you always been so violent?

632
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,292
If so, I'll get my hopes up.

633
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,879
Is your grandma well? Why no wishes?
Do you really not remember me?

634
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,215
And he knows how to deflect.

635
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:32,841
Enough of that.

636
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,176
Do you know how to fly?

637
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,470
When you watch shows with vampires,

638
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,806
they just fly off, all the way to…

639
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,815
Move out of the way, crazy!
Are you trying to get killed?

640
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,109
He's singing my praises.

641
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,559
"Can I fly?"

642
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,730
Did that answer your question?
Who'd you say earlier? Vam… who?

643
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,358
Wow.

644
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,610
Wow.

645
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,738
Wow.

646
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,408
So you really are a genie.

647
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,912
I'm now going to scream with happiness.

648
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,915
I know how this goes.

649
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,875
Go ahead!

650
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,360
Wait, why are you smiling like that?

651
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,114
You smile differently from other humans.

652
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,491
This is real joy.

653
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,618
Joy?

654
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,913
So you finally have a wish?

655
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:08,831
No.

656
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,042
I finally have an opportunity.

657
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,211
The perfect location.

658
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,214
The perfect adversary.

659
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,969
From this height,
would his skull crack first?

660
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,432
No telling my grandma.

661
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:42,322
Who exactly is your grandmother?

662
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,493
That was way too quick.

663
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,837
Man, you startled me.
Your timing was completely unexpected.

664
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,422
"Man, you startled me"?

665
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:03,093
Most people panic while pushing someone,
but you're only just startled?

666
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,223
I should have been slower to get mad.

667
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,394
Your arm broke first? Not your skull?

668
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,523
Depends on how many times you spin

669
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,777
and whether it's a clean drop
or if you hit a building.

670
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,989
I hit a building,
so I came up a little sooner.

671
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,743
I smashed my head and back
but pieced myself together on the way up.

672
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,536
I see.

673
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,541
But I know that face.

674
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:37,961
Real

675
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:40,798
rage.

676
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,176
If you knew, why do it?

677
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,970
Don't you agree, Master?

678
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,070
I accept

679
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,155
whatever punishment.

680
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,824
So please,

681
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,410
make sure we are punished.

682
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,871
You and I both.

683
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,084
I hoped you'd be different,

684
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,002
but not this different.

685
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,548
What exactly are you?

686
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,008
Beg.

687
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,177
Beg for your life.

688
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,764
Tell me it's your first wish.

689
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:32,808
Wish it.

690
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,352
Seeing this,

691
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,773
I can tell those wishes
won't do me any good.

692
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,110
How smart of you.

693
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,489
You're right. Once you've made
all three wishes, and I'm no longer bound,

694
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,700
I'm going to kill you.

695
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,414
If that's your plan,

696
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,416
why not just scrap the wishes

697
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,918
and throw me off right now?

698
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,380
I'm having

699
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,675
an absolute blast right now!

700
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:54,820
