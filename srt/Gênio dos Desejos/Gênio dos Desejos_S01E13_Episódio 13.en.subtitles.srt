1
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,982
GENIE, MAKE A WISH

2
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,322
KI KA-YOUNG
I STILL CAN'T REACH YOU

3
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,948
CAN YOU CALL ME? IT'S URGENT

4
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,077
JULY 19
I'M GETTING TRANSFERS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT

5
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,120
SEPTEMBER 15
ARE YOU TRYING TO FUCK ME OVER?

6
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,581
NOTICE OF DISMISSAL

7
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,666
PLEASE RETURN YOUR ID
AND YOUR LOCKER AND BUILDING KEYS

8
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,798
I'm here to take your meter readings.

9
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,383
Is anyone home?

10
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,471
This is driving me crazy.

11
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,056
For fuck's sake.

12
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,767
Where did all that money come from?

13
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,478
Why is it here?

14
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,208
I'm not out of breath.
Not even close to exhausted.

15
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,123
STOP TAKING THE SLEEPING PILLS

16
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,959
JUST TAKE 1 VITAMIN
AND GET LOTS OF SUNSHINE

17
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,719
Even if you're feeling lazy,
try to cook your meals.

18
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,138
The pipes freeze when it gets cold out,

19
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,349
so make sure to wrap them
with old clothes.

20
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,936
My darling Ka-young,
you're beautiful today as always.

21
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,815
My dear bundle of joy, be well.

22
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,661
I know you're in a bad place right now,
but please help me.

23
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,417
There's a bag full of cash in my house.

24
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,503
I don't know how it ended up in my hands,

25
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,422
but I saw you with it
on Choi Min-ji's Instagram.

26
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,345
It's yours, isn't it?

27
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,139
Did I, by chance,

28
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,184
steal your money?

29
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,939
It's just that I really can't remember.

30
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,442
But knowing me, I could have.

31
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,404
I envied you
and hoped you would be ruined.

32
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,951
If I really did do that…

33
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,246
I'm truly sorry.

34
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,875
That money is yours.

35
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,713
You sold me something invaluable.

36
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,340
You helped someone.

37
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,884
But I wasn't able to save them.

38
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,887
So use it however you want.

39
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,933
No, the last few days
have been absolute hell for me.

40
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,810
I was scared someone would come for it,

41
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,187
but reporting it to the cops
seemed like a waste.

42
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,315
Not that I could bring myself to use it.

43
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,736
So please, just take it all back.

44
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,864
But about me being fired,

45
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,283
could you help clear things up?

46
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,744
All I want…

47
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,206
is to live as I was before.

48
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,585
The genie was right.

49
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,923
I corrupted you.

50
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,917
Grandma said that?

51
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,294
Yes.

52
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,757
She wanted me to tell you

53
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,717
she was happy to raise you.

54
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,804
I should have told you at the funeral.

55
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,391
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,476
For what I said then.

57
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,270
At the time…

58
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,028
-You'll forgive me, won't you?
-Yes.

59
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,744
-Did you say you've done it all?
-Of course.

60
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,247
I accomplished everything.

61
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,625
First, university.
Then, I became a dentist.

62
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,128
But why do you ask?

63
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,423
Grandma was happy while raising me.

64
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,217
You've accomplished everything.

65
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,720
I also

66
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,056
want to do it all.

67
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,894
What do you want to do?

68
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,776
What could you possibly want to do?

69
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,723
Ka-young!

70
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,102
Ka-young, no! Don't go, Ka-young!

71
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,691
Hey, don't leave me behind!

72
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,987
Ka-young!

73
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,489
No.

74
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,891
Come on out, Iblis!

75
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,310
Show yourself!

76
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,107
You said you could never leave me!

77
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,566
Come out!

78
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,194
I said show yourself!

79
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,905
Come out, Iblis!

80
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,573
Show yourself!

81
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,243
Where are you?

82
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,080
Why have you disappeared? Why?

83
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,307
Iblis.

84
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,435
I said show yourself.

85
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,827
Iblis!

86
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,565
What took you so long?
Do you know how long I searched for you?

87
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,734
Why didn't you answer me?

88
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,194
You should've come when I called.

89
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,659
You're a genie.

90
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,705
You still need to grant my final wish.

91
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,919
-I will…
-Don't do it.

92
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,339
I'll make an incredibly selfish wish.
Just for me.

93
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,178
Ki Ka-young, please.

94
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,474
I want to understand my grandma's pain,
raising a stone as if it were a jewel.

95
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:52,521
I want to know the fear my neighbors felt
raising me, even as they judged me.

96
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,609
I want to understand
Min-ji's selfless friendship.

97
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,155
I want to know the depth of the words
you wrote all over your lamp.

98
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,368
Allow me to have humanity.

99
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,622
For a day.

100
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,832
For just one day,

101
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,463
give me what they call feelings
in their normal, purest form.

102
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,468
When that day passes,
I'll go back to being a negative one.

103
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,387
Someone who is condemned by all.

104
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,890
A bothersome stone.

105
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,351
That's how I'll die.

106
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:34,814
This…

107
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,109
is my final wish.

108
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,037
You…

109
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,708
So you believe I'm capable of killing you.

110
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,710
So this…

111
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,464
This is the method of death you've chosen.

112
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,759
I know. That included.

113
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,928
I am very…

114
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,014
very selfish.

115
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,103
So I hope you complete your revenge…

116
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,065
and gain freedom.

117
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,198
To the very end,
you make wishes for others' benefit.

118
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,254
At long last, I finally see.

119
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,048
You were right.

120
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,887
Your noble creation.

121
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,807
I bow my head before this pure human.

122
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,262
I will no longer be in your memories.

123
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,559
You, the one I love.

124
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,940
The only human I've ever respected.

125
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,905
My master.

126
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,873
Farewell.

127
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,893
It has been fulfilled.

128
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,631
This is "gi-yeok."

129
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,508
"Ni-eun."

130
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,557
Thanks! And congratulations.

131
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,850
-Congratulations.
-Oh boy.

132
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,024
I still love you either way.

133
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,990
Oh boy, my dear Ka-young is warm.

134
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,410
My dear crybaby is so warm.

135
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,871
My stubborn darling is warm.

136
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,919
Grandma.

137
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,803
I'm going to kill you!

138
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,930
I'll kill you, Grandma!

139
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,855
Grandma!

140
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,571
Grandma hopes that my darling Ka-young,

141
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,282
that you, my dear bundle of joy,

142
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,659
will cry your heart out with longing.

143
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,161
Try to hold it in for a minute.

144
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,288
That you will burst out laughing with joy.

145
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,749
That's what I want for you.

146
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,756
I grew up in Grandma's love.

147
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:20,974
I thrived as she withered away.

148
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,356
No, this can't be.

149
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,861
I was not Grandma's strength.

150
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,782
So that was Grandma's truth.

151
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,161
I was Grandma's burden.

152
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,582
This is hope.

153
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,709
The face of hope.

154
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,677
Grandma.

155
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,306
Grandma! Oh no!

156
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:07,229
I'm so sorry, Grandma!

157
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,900
Please, no…

158
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,070
Grandma!

159
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,589
How? Why is it you're…

160
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,756
How come you lost?

161
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,385
Ki Ka-young said
she'd make a selfish wish,

162
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,137
so you should have taken revenge.

163
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,139
That was the bet you two made.

164
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,142
Ki Ka-young's lifespan was until tomorrow.

165
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,686
What did you say?

166
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,606
Shaytan!

167
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,859
Keep your promise to him.

168
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,822
"The day that Iblis bows his head
before a human,

169
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,866
you, Ejllael, shall slit his throat."

170
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,328
Please ask him for grace just this once.

171
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,581
Tell him that she has done nothing wrong.

172
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,167
Please, I beg of you, Brother.

173
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,128
Everything is as he intended.

174
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,716
I shall now execute the order
I've waited 1,000 years for.

175
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,885
I am one who has seen all of your lives.

176
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,222
I will now return to white smoke.

177
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,599
This is my apology…

178
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,270
as well as another of my sins.

179
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,982
You have forgotten
something very precious.

180
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,692
I intend to return

181
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,069
those memories to you.

182
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,203
I will remember you, no matter what.

183
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,916
My love.

184
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,614
Iblis.

185
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,577
I had forgotten you.

186
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,873
You could not…

187
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,336
bring yourself to kill me.

188
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,841
Because you love me.

189
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,179
You…

190
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,599
Because of me, you…

191
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,273
Your throat must have been slit.

192
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,491
I hoped you would be free.

193
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,285
I hoped for you to live.

194
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,414
That's why I did what I did.

195
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,251
How can this be?

196
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:52,180
No, this can't be.

197
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,267
This can't be!

198
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,055
This is the Korean Consulate General
in Dubai.

199
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,225
We regret to inform you
of the death of Ms. Ki Ka-young.

200
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,370
So a psychopath

201
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,373
died while crying?

202
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,543
Some say that extreme sorrow

203
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,962
can be fatal.

204
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,755
Even so, a psychopath

205
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,341
could have just gone on living.

206
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,803
Goodness.

207
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,972
My thoughts exactly.

208
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:01,059
Let's get all the funeral arrangements
in place before Dr. Choi gets back.

209
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,062
We're wearing
our funeral clothes too often.

210
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,283
The body is ready to be returned.

211
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,329
These are the only personal items
we were able to retrieve.

212
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,304
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2024

213
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,055
KI KA-YOUNG
CREMATION UNDERWAY

214
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,861
Thursday, October 31.

215
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,450
We will now proceed
to send her off in peace.

216
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,667
Fire!

217
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,088
It's hot, so hurry out!

218
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,759
Fire!

219
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,636
It's a fire!

220
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,930
Fire!

221
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,725
Get out of there, Ka-young!

222
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,769
I'm sorry, Ka-young!

223
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,314
It's too hot in there, so please…

224
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:34,486
I am a spirit created by smokeless fire,

225
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,612
a genie.

226
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:42,577
We were created on Thursday,
the day after the angels were made.

227
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,964
GOBLIN STATIONERY

228
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,260
CLOSED TEMPORARILY
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

229
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,558
CHEONGPUNG HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE

230
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:27,497
THE LATE KI KA-YOUNG

231
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,141
Tell me your wishes.

232
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,352
O master of mine.

233
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,314
Ka-young!

234
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,867
So you're saying

235
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,370
that after a 1,000-year love,
you also become a jinniya?

236
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,207
Then where did that person…

237
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,378
I mean, where did that genie go?

238
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,089
To eternal solitude.

239
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,344
Didn't you bring those for me?

240
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,722
I have to give you something
in exchange for wishes?

241
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,769
Right. You gave Lee Beul-li
a thousand big ones, right?

242
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,730
Just a moment.
Are you going to make your wish now?

243
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,190
Can't I?

244
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,277
No. Those are the rules, so fine.

245
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,952
No bringing back the dead.

246
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,288
No traveling to the future.

247
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,625
Anything besides that,

248
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,627
your wish

249
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,297
is my command.

250
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,133
Your speech sucks.

251
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:05,970
Fine.

252
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,390
For starters, as my first wish,
eat seafood stew with me every Wednesday.

253
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,815
It's been fulfilled.

254
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,191
As my second wish,

255
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,194
send any neighborhood children in need
to my dental clinic.

256
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,738
They don't go to the dentist
because of the cost.

257
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,865
And my final wish is…

258
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,950
Right now? You can't!

259
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,619
Why would you use them all at once?

260
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,789
Of course I won't. I'll save it.

261
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:33,832
Phew.

262
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,167
Just these two to start.
They're my wishes.

263
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,296
They will be fulfilled, Choi Min-ji.

264
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,048
Call me "Master."

265
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,802
KING ARCADE

266
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,890
SMILE DENTAL CLINIC

267
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,892
ODD TEETH AND ODD PEOPLE WELCOME

268
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,066
Isn't this an arcade?

269
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,734
Yes, it is an arcade.

270
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,654
Shall we go have fun
fighting off cavity bacteria together?

271
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,241
By the way, I heard your grades are awful.

272
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,367
Excuse me?

273
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,786
Solve all of these problems
while you wait.

274
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,875
If you don't,
I'll treat you without anesthesia.

275
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,630
I'm guessing you're hearing
what I'm saying now in Korean.

276
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,136
That's because I'm a jinniya
who can't speak any foreign languages.

277
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:33,600
From now on, you will have to tune in
to K-pop and binge-watch K-dramas.

278
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,693
Because there's a new jinniya in town,
and she doesn't speak Arabic.

279
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:49,407
This year, we're back at
the Cheongpungho Cherry Blossom Festival!

280
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,160
Our village's pride and joy,
Puffed Five Grains.

281
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,747
-Now to the next booth.
-Okay.

282
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,958
Here, we have For Daughter Strawberry!

283
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,209
Strawberry!

284
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,218
Hello, we are from Cheongpungho Bank.

285
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,179
Please drop by for a consultation.

286
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,100
Ki Ka-young.

287
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,560
You're here.

288
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,106
Every time I see you like this,
my heart drops.

289
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,691
Folks really won't recognize you?

290
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,820
They all see me with a different face,

291
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,281
which is quite unfortunate.

292
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,576
I'm so pretty.

293
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,957
And yet,
I still believe in science after all this.

294
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,378
Come take a look.

295
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,055
If you thought you'd be safe this year,
you thought wrong.

296
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,985
AS SEXY
FUCK YOU

297
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,202
KI KA-YOUNG
YOU'RE IN MY HEART

298
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,787
I dropped some cash.

299
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:45,273
I've always imagined
what I would do if you died,

300
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,734
but I was completely unprepared

301
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,862
for what to do if you cried.

302
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,531
So I thought about it for a few days.

303
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,867
And?

304
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,494
And

305
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,748
whether you're a jinniya or a spirit,

306
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:06,586
I just want you to always be happy
in this newfound life of yours.

307
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,469
Don't cry and don't die.

308
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,098
Reunite with the one you miss most.

309
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,812
This is my third wish.

310
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,690
No, Choi Min-ji, you can't.
You'll end up forgetting me!

311
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,864
My body isn't glowing.

312
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,407
What is this?

313
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,119
Does that mean this wish
has already been fulfilled?

314
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,581
That's right. I met you again.

315
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,416
That scared me.

316
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,376
The truth is

317
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,629
once you make your final wish…

318
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,963
I'll be back soon.

319
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,673
Take care.

320
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,926
Goodbye, Ki Ka-young.

321
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,022
I'm sorry.

322
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,711
Grandma?

323
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,843
Have you come to see me?

324
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,558
Grandma!

325
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,570
Come back to see me again.

326
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,323
Come next spring too!

327
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,451
Be sure to come every spring!

328
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:38,923
This painting belonged to my ancestors
six generations ago.

329
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,591
The style is quite unique.

330
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,637
I want to authenticate it to determine
if it's a genuine Joseon dynasty artifact.

331
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,764
We call paintings like these miindo.

332
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,393
These portraits of beautiful women
typically have an East Asian flair,

333
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:54,063
whereas this one looks like
an Egyptian painting.

334
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:59,402
So many things have happened,
but I'm still assistant branch manager.

335
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,322
I want to be poached by a rival company.

336
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,408
This is my final wish.

337
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,369
Tell me one crucial trade secret
of this supermarket.

338
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,579
That's easy.

339
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,381
It has been fulfilled.

340
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,011
I shall tell you a crucial trade secret.

341
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,729
They recommend displaying
Jin instant noodles at the front.

342
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,913
Things must have been
really lonely for you.

343
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,042
Everyone would forget you.

344
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,545
And you alone would remember.

345
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,257
It's raining

346
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,426
flower petals.

347
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,221
This

348
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,349
is the perfect moment.

349
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,585
It's been a while, lump of clay.

350
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,214
I've missed you.

351
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,342
How did you come back?

352
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,344
Min-ji's wish

353
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,930
glowed with the flower petals.

354
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,184
I don't know how I came back either.

355
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,647
Come on, just move on already!

356
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,733
Why are you messing with the system
in a foreign land?

357
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:48,946
You little brat!
How dare you raise your voice!

358
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:53,784
I now have nothing to fear,
even if you were to tell me I'd die again.

359
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,287
And I'm not scared of hell either.

360
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,247
I don't need anything else.

361
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,751
All you need to do is take me
to meet that boss of yours.

362
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,464
You crazy human! Do you think
he is someone you can just meet at will?

363
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,048
Come on.

364
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,844
You're guaranteed a spot in heaven.
Why refuse heaven to stay here doing this?

365
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,429
Heaven?

366
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,973
I don't need heaven.

367
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,810
My Ka-young died and became Satan,
so what use is heaven now?

368
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,853
And you…

369
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,315
you told me the day I'd die,
so didn't you reveal divine secrets?

370
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,444
And you told me in a roundabout way,
so I almost didn't catch on.

371
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,738
Lucky I'm as sharp as a tack.

372
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,366
So this is something
you absolutely must do for me.

373
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,743
You said you were an angel.

374
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,330
After all the havoc you've wreaked,
you should at least do me a favor.

375
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,461
What the hell is it that you want?

376
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,632
Yes, I know that it's been loud.

377
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,052
Pardon? But I…

378
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:55,930
Despite that…

379
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,140
Even so!

380
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,144
Yes, I understand.

381
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,272
So,

382
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,859
toward Goryeo, with all my might?

383
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,335
Once again, you don't know the full story?

384
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,921
Come on, we've just reunited.

385
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,714
Whatever.

386
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,676
Now I'll be claiming the title
of the world's most famous genie.

387
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,719
What kind of conclusion is that? No way!

388
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,472
I'd rather die than give that up.

389
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,266
Why not? Let me have it!

390
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,978
I can even do this.

391
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,205
You haven't changed a bit.

392
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,751
Just as alarming

393
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,462
as it is charming.

394
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:27,646
Just hurry up already!
We need to get seats at the front.

395
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,941
Why are we here at the crack of dawn?

396
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,861
Harvesting cabbage is great.
The pay's good, and they feed you.

397
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,573
These jobs are hard to come by
in the current job market.

398
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:41,118
Look, there are already three people.
Hey, Mr. Kim. You're here.

399
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,080
Hurry and take a seat.
I hope they need at least four people.

400
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,749
-Have you eaten?
-Of course.

401
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,418
Oh dear, a young man like you.

402
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,588
You must be having a very hard time,
mumbling to yourself like that.

403
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,675
Only I can see you right now?

404
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,179
That is really difficult to do.

405
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:03,557
It took me 11,000 years
to master that skill.

406
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,226
Takes around 110 centuries
to learn things.

407
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,812
Damn it.

408
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,689
This won't do.

409
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,150
You should wear something too.
Pray they pick us.

410
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,151
Why should I?

411
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:18,072
We need to buy you something to wear,
but you're a jinniya now, so you're broke.

412
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,949
Broke? I have money.

413
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,286
What? How would you have money?

414
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,211
See that?

415
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,465
Wow!

416
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,554
-Can I have just 10,000 won?
-10,000 won?

417
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,266
So now you're adjusting for inflation?

418
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,978
Don't think about doing anything silly,
and go and get a haircut.

419
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,855
You could pass as Moon Dong-eun.

420
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,732
I have my reasons.

421
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,318
I'm going to try to make Sade again.

422
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,154
This time I'm using luxury hair masks

423
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,950
and taking extra care,
so he may be born in a different form.

424
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,827
Right, Sade told me.

425
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,329
Fine, I understand the hair.

426
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,040
But why did you add a teardrop?

427
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:14,128
The first Sade actually died
protecting me in the 300-year war.

428
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,799
So after the war ended, I added
a drop of my sadness and remade him.

429
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,218
That's who you saw, the second iteration.

430
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,221
I should have known. He was quite misty.

431
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,350
So that's why I intend to keep things dry
this time around.

432
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,063
Hey, I have a wish-maker.

433
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,668
Oh my, you scared me!

434
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,463
Who are you?

435
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,340
What's with the hair?

436
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,969
There is a reason for my hair.
Sorry for scaring you.

437
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,471
I'm here to share good news.

438
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,392
I am Genie, the lamp spirit.
I shall grant you three wishes.

439
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,188
Right, so you're a fucking genie? Okay.

440
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,191
Is this a new scam?
How much of this was a setup?

441
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,986
This is a common response.
That's why I've prepared a manual.

442
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:24,114
The first page has possible wishes.
The last, impossible ones.

443
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,619
WISH-MAKER'S MANUAL

444
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,662
Be meticulous with any special terms.

445
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,540
Immortality? You'd regret it.
Just watch three vampire movies.

446
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,875
Changing the past?

447
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,169
Butterfly effects happen,
so if you're not smart…

448
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,797
Just give up on it.

449
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,759
If you happen to have the means,
could you buy me a beverage?

450
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,474
-Aren't you a genie?
-Yes.

451
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,226
You said you'd grant my wishes.

452
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,978
Then why the fuck
are you asking me for wishes?

453
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,318
Didn't you once have a lot of faith in him

454
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,821
and, you know, have a very pure soul?

455
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,573
Wait, do you also believe
in ancestral deities?

456
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,203
This will bring out my soft side.

457
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,374
There's a higher power in this realm too.
They're called diamonds.

458
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,834
Practically deities.

459
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,795
"Germanium jade mats"?
Right, what is this?

460
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:23,382
To put it simply, it's a magic carpet
that generates heat by itself.

461
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,342
Like a genie's magic ride.

462
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,554
You'd start with ten mats.

463
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,390
Once you sell ten,
the next one's free of charge.

464
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:34,226
Free? This carpet here is free?

465
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,647
Yes. That's why there's no need
for an upfront payment.

466
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,275
This really is
a rare opportunity, you know.

467
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,902
-There's no upfront payment?
-Yes.

468
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,197
Then maybe I shouldn't be going
to the cabbage patches.

469
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,492
Wait, but if I work
the cabbage patches and do this…

470
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,163
Mr. Kim, Mr. Park, Mr. Choi.

471
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,832
Sang-hyeok, when he grows up.

472
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:57,833
Ejllael

473
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,043
wouldn't buy one from me.

474
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,587
Hey, could you sign here?

475
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,215
Min-ji! Has forgotten who I am.

476
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,175
Oh Pan-geum!

477
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,428
Has, oh…

478
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,388
She's not around.

479
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,766
This is such a great product,
but I can't sell it.

480
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,519
I just can't think of ten people.

481
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,271
Irem isn't here, nor is Sade.

482
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,690
I miss Oh Pan-geum.

483
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,819
Are you well?

484
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,031
You're keeping an eye on us, right?

485
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,366
I'm doing well.

486
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,036
I see you're lacking in many areas.

487
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,539
Let's just forget this altogether.

488
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,501
Where are you going?

489
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,046
Make a wish before you go!
I actually am a genie!

490
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:45,672
Make your wish.

491
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,509
No bringing back the dead.
No traveling to the future.

492
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,845
Anything besides that,

493
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,430
your wish

494
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,016
is my command.

495
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,938
That way leads to a road!
Why do you always go that way?

496
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,201
Hey.

497
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,246
Did you use an entire bottle
of my favorite shampoo?

498
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,792
Well, I only did that
so I could make Sade.

499
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,379
I'm going to kill you!

500
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,925
-Come here.
-You come.

501
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:30,926
Get over here!

502
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,345
-Come here.
-I don't want to.

503
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,262
I said come here.

504
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,681
I said I don't want to.

505
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,391
Don't talk back to me!

506
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,850
Don't ask me questions!

507
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,979
Come here. I said get over here.

508
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:42,938
No.

509
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:43,855
No way!

510
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,607
That little guy's back.

511
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,112
No way. He's back too.

512
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:56,493
You used an entire bottle of shampoo,
and he looks exactly the same?

513
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,163
I felt bad because I thought
it was the state of my hair.

514
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,624
But I feel less guilty now.

515
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:04,835
Master.

516
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:06,461
Boss.

517
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,469
I missed you guys.

518
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:20,976
Come on!

519
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,604
Seriously, just let go of me!

520
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,650
Hey, do you want to be obliterated again?
I'm busy enough trying to grow new wings.

521
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,319
Ejllael, you're evil!

522
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,780
Create Irem again!

523
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,242
Oh, come on. Please!

524
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,619
Seriously!

525
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,760
Been a while, Brother.

526
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,889
I see your neck's reattached.

527
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,974
Yeah, thanks for the congratulations.

528
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,893
And thanks for delivering my lamp too.

529
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,728
But why are you still on Goryeo land?

530
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,688
I've invested in several buildings here.

531
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,690
Land is a long-term investment.

532
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,778
And did you know? Ki Ka-young
hasn't bowed before a human either.

533
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,864
Nonsense. Ki Ka-young bows
at Oh Pan-geum's grave every day.

534
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,824
Dead humans don't count!

535
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,037
Just thinking about those threats
from Oh Pan-geum…

536
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,371
Threats?

537
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,958
I am so sick of humans.
They're always beyond imagination.

538
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:31,338
She refused heaven and reincarnation.
She just yelled at him to revive you!

539
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,715
Do you understand the bind I was in?

540
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,224
So I came back thanks to Oh Pan-geum.

541
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,141
Anyway,

542
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,478
Oh Pan-geum asked me to relay this
to you and Ki Ka-young.

543
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,438
Relay what?

544
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,734
Sade!

545
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,111
Jinniya!

546
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,946
Iblis!

547
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,782
Mr. Village Chief!

548
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,618
GERMANIUM JADE MAT

549
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,460
What is that?

550
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,380
This?

551
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,801
Well, I bought these a long time ago.

552
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,387
It's a magic carpet
that generates heat on its own.

553
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,348
If I sell ten, I get another one for free.

554
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,434
Right, I also give you one free smack
after you get ten.

555
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,645
-Get over here.
-Just hear me out!

556
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,356
Now that Sade and Irem are back,
I have nine people.

557
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,150
I just need one more person. Hey!

558
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,359
Time for a coffee break.

559
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,613
By the way, Mr. Kim from the cabbage patch
passed away yesterday.

560
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,283
What?

561
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,451
Where did you get these?

562
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,370
Did you join a pyramid scheme too?

563
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,249
-Hey, where did you…
-They look vintage, don't they?

564
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,668
I found them
shoved in the corner of the lamp.

565
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,758
But I can smell Jinniya's scent on these.

566
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,552
Sade, you bastard!

567
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,640
It was an early wedding gift.
A wedding gift for you and me.

568
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,517
You said you couldn't go to the future.

569
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,687
So you didn't see the bloody future
ahead of you?

570
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,731
Come here. Yes, come here.

571
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,859
Get over here!

572
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,944
That's hot, damn.

573
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,418
The sword is back?

574
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,928
Do you see that sand whirl over there?

575
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,765
In Arabic culture, that phenomenon
is called the "waltzing genie."

576
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,266
Wow, a genie?

577
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,645
The spirit of the lamp we've all heard of?
How awesome!

578
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,648
Wow, that's so impressive!

579
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,401
Dr. Choi, you're back.

580
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,695
Yes.

581
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,157
I just can't get enough of this place.

582
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,689
We've been dancing the waltz for decades,

583
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,607
yet you still step on my toes?

584
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,278
I did it on purpose
so we don't forget where we started.

585
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,322
And I have something to tell you.

586
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,449
-Ha--
-Don't!

587
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,703
The timing is, you know?

588
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:56,251
Everyone is on the edge of their seats,
thinking we might end with "habibti."

589
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,800
I thought I could sense
some fierce gazes upon us.

590
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:08,179
But I was actually
going to say "halmeoni."

591
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,309
That's a relief.

592
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,729
Halmeoni? You mean my grandma?

593
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:20,066
Yes. It was thanks
to Oh Pan-geum that I came back.

594
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:21,985
And

595
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,322
she wanted to pass on that message.

596
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,620
I SHALL NOW LEAVE YOU EACH
WITH ONE SATAN AND ONE PSYCHOPATH

597
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,290
MAY YOU BOTH LOVE AND LONG FOR EACH OTHER

598
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,511
It's a wish-maker.

599
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,514
Give it your best, psychopath.

600
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,267
Don't worry about me.

601
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,644
See you later, Satan.

602
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:44,080
