1
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,982
GENIE, MAKE A WISH

2
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,461
PLEASE RETURN YOUR ID
AND YOUR LOCKER AND BUILDING KEYS

3
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,297
Gu Bo-gyeong, I'm holding you
responsible for this. You're fired!

4
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,800
What will you do
about our branch's average balance?

5
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,014
Fuck!

6
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,391
A genie?

7
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,060
That's nonsense.

8
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,604
Our channel went viral
because you found that corpse.

9
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:48,274
Yeah, and the genie is the one
who helped me find the corpse.

10
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,484
I'm being serious!

11
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,196
Otherwise, how could I possibly
have found that corpse?

12
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,698
You have to believe me.

13
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,577
We only have two chances left, Da-jin.

14
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,745
We're both SKY grads.

15
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,458
We need to rack our brains and figure out
how to turn our lives around, okay?

16
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,804
If it's a wish, could we wish
to inherit a conglomerate fortune?

17
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:21,182
Why inherit it? We could
just become the conglomerates.

18
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,520
Hold up. How much
is the richest person in Korea worth?

19
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,523
Do we really need that much?
It's not like we're building an empire.

20
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,108
Say we have two kids.

21
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,069
If we fund their studies abroad
and a home for when they marry,

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,280
that's billions already.
What about retirement?

23
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,782
You're right. You can never have too much.

24
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,285
But are you sure there are no conditions?

25
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,121
In any fables with spirits,

26
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,915
the moral is always
"what goes around comes around."

27
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,919
"Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered."
What if there's a price?

28
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,299
-It would be nice if we could ask.
-Hey!

29
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,177
What if the genie answers
and counts it as a wish?

30
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,637
You're right.

31
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,851
Then how about
we think about it separately

32
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,978
and each get to use one wish?

33
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,021
What?

34
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,982
But… why would I do that?

35
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,611
I wouldn't have told you
if we were going to do that.

36
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,031
We're a married couple,
so isn't it a given?

37
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,825
We can make money,
but some things money can't buy.

38
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,536
What are you thinking about?

39
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,623
Wishing for Dad to be cancer-free.

40
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,043
Come on, we have modern medicine.

41
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,296
Why would you wish
for something like that?

42
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,797
Money would solve everything.

43
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,383
My dad has terminal liver cancer.

44
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,344
Terminal means there's no hope.

45
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,222
Come on, it's not like
he's on his deathbed or anything.

46
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,890
Check out our views.

47
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,727
We'll be generating income in no time,
so let's just wait three months.

48
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,812
We'll just save the wish for now, okay?

49
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,105
Hey, Ko Yeong-hyeon.

50
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,358
Fuck you!

51
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,684
Khalid!

52
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,394
Khalid!

53
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,941
I saw Iblis!
I saw him bringing humans to ruin.

54
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,528
It was truly a sight to behold, Father.

55
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,446
Tell me what you did.

56
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,572
Did you hurt the girl?

57
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:46,286
I feel no pain in this body,
nor do I feel out of breath.

58
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,664
But I do not have power like Iblis.

59
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,416
I have lost my ability to weave,

60
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,920
so what am I to do now
with this immortal body?

61
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,520
The end is nigh!

62
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,189
You foolish humans!

63
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,277
Judgment day is approaching!

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,281
Angels from the sky alert us!
Heed me when I say…

65
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,326
I'll let it slide today.
I have a lot on my mind.

66
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,413
Then you shall all be saved.

67
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,638
You said I stole a feather of yours
before I was locked up.

68
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,267
Again with your damn feather talk.
I don't know about it.

69
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,644
Well, I do. I know what I did with it.

70
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,064
I wrote some things.

71
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,733
On the floors and columns,
all over my lamp.

72
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,780
You figured that out?

73
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,366
Yes, but I'm not sure
when I could have done it.

74
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,242
Nor do I remember.

75
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,372
So please

76
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,624
make sure we are punished.

77
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,709
You and I both.

78
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,295
That final wish Ki Ka-young made

79
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,506
was fulfilled.

80
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,007
Right?

81
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,011
He brought Ki Ka-young back to life
to carry out that final wish,

82
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,932
and I was reunited
with the reincarnated Ki Ka-young.

83
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:31,849
Am I wrong?

84
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,686
If my fury was enough to level a city…

85
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:42,151
HABIBTI

86
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,986
…it must mean I had lost a loved one.

87
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,613
I'd lost Ki Ka-young.

88
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,450
I must have loved her.

89
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,911
-Isn't that right?
-So what?

90
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,539
Are we playing bingo? What's your point?

91
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,998
About Ki Ka-young's lifespan.

92
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,167
You must be mad.

93
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,585
How much is left?

94
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,837
I beg you.

95
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,714
Tell me so I can prepare.

96
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,091
All because of a lowly human!

97
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,886
Have you learned nothing
from Shadi's fate?

98
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,096
Of course not.

99
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,351
Why else would I be doing everything I can
not to kill the immortal one?

100
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,105
Shadi loves that boy enough
to die for him,

101
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,732
and because he loves him,

102
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,819
the pain cuts deep.

103
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,991
You arrogant shaytan.

104
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,995
If you're so curious, pluck out my eyes
to see for yourself. Go ahead.

105
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,665
I wonder why he keeps
forgiving a bastard like you.

106
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,136
Who shall stand in the day of judgment?

107
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,306
Who will walk the path to salvation?

108
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,871
I was gathering intel on the immortal one.

109
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,583
I sensed that your intentions
were aligned with the immortal one.

110
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,837
The half-spirit is clawing his way up,
not knowing his place,

111
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,466
while Iblis and Ki Ka-young are edging
closer to the truth of their past lives.

112
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,303
And now, even my mythical beast
is totally missing the mark?

113
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,096
What now, Irem?

114
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,850
If you could just…
point me in the right direction--

115
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,560
What do you think I'm doing now?

116
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:42,939
Listen carefully.

117
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,650
No, wait. You can't hear, can you?

118
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,237
Watch carefully.

119
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,618
The half-spirit will use Shadi
and plunge the world into sleep once more.

120
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,038
When that day comes,
there is something you must do.

121
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,207
That's all you need to do.

122
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,668
Am I understood?

123
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,090
Yes, Master.

124
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,682
These brats.

125
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,685
ELDEST

126
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,899
Hey, I've brought over some side dishes,
but your door won't seem to open.

127
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,402
I must be entering the wrong code.

128
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,114
I told you not to come.
You know my wife's gone on a cruise.

129
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,908
That's why I cooked you food.
I'll just pop it inside--

130
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,493
Just leave it at the door.

131
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,204
My wife doesn't want anyone
who's not family in the house.

132
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,415
You rotten bastard!
Aren't I family to you?

133
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,834
Am I a stranger? Am I?

134
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,210
You little…

135
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,172
Stop eating and get peeling.

136
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,596
You're back early
from visiting your son, the judge.

137
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,888
Yes.

138
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,559
He kept asking me to stay over,
saying he'd send me on a cruise,

139
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,145
but I couldn't be bothered,
so I just came back.

140
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,023
How lucky you are.

141
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,611
What is this?

142
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,697
OH PAN-GEUM

143
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,200
I think I'll be going farther away
than Hawaii.

144
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,328
Please take good care of my Ka-young.

145
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,579
Where's she off to now?

146
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,373
Her daughter must be
treating her incredibly well.

147
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,293
If it's farther away than Hawaii,
how nice must it be?

148
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,130
What's so great about being flown around
at a ripe old age? What a bother!

149
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,967
Hawaii? That old place?
I could go tomorrow if I wanted to.

150
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:40,264
My eldest son is a judge, and my youngest
is an executive at a major conglomerate.

151
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,808
And my grandchildren are all geniuses.

152
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,060
Just look at Ok-nam.

153
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,481
She abandoned her entire life
and ran away because of her child.

154
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,276
If anyone thinks they did a better job
at raising their kids than me,

155
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,611
come on out, I say!

156
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,572
Of course. Right you are!

157
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,742
We all know. We all do.

158
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,453
AN BOK-JA

159
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,251
Don't worry about Ka-young,
and send us some photos of the nice place.

160
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,463
I wonder where Ok-nam has gotten to.

161
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,008
She even changed her number.

162
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,431
-What is that smell? Is it chicken soup?
-Yes.

163
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,309
Tell that tall fellow to come too.

164
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,566
I hope you'll continue to get along
with my dear Ka-young.

165
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,736
Don't fight, and you mustn't leave her.

166
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,948
If she acts all prickly,
just be gentle with her.

167
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,956
-The drumsticks are always mine.
-Goodness me.

168
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,792
Just play nice and share.

169
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,503
What's yours is his, even a bean.

170
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,882
For better or worse,
until death do you part.

171
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,176
Then give him beans.
The drumsticks are mine.

172
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,428
You brat!

173
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,472
Just let him have one today!
I'm doing all of this for a reason.

174
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,891
What reason?
The drumsticks are mine, so why?

175
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,102
Don't you dare touch my…

176
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,315
Come here.

177
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,487
You come here.

178
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,031
-I said to come here.
-I said no.

179
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,034
Do you want to die?

180
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,747
-I'd rather not.
-Don't talk back!

181
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,123
Don't ask questions!

182
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,209
-I said not to talk back.
-I said not to ask questions!

183
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,377
Stop copying me!

184
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,672
This level of chemistry
is good enough for me.

185
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,923
Get over here!

186
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,775
Seeing as this word comes up the most,

187
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,319
is this habibti? "My love"?

188
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,155
What? Right, yes. It is.

189
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,699
You don't even remember, but this is me?

190
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,495
There's a 50-50 chance it's me or Jinniya.

191
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,458
Shouldn't you have cleared up
those doubts before we kissed?

192
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,170
If this happens to be Jinniya,

193
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,007
you will die for exploiting my hard labor.

194
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,510
So hurry and find your memories.

195
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,054
I've found one.

196
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,684
It says, "Every night you make a garment
to wear when you return to Goryeo."

197
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,354
A garment?

198
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,358
I guess I must have liked
needles back then too.

199
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,195
Where is Khalid's name?

200
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,906
Here and here.

201
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,741
Why?

202
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,036
Because, in Korea,
it's unlucky to write names in red.

203
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:50,871
This brat.

204
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,043
If this is when he started preparing,
then we're losing on all fronts.

205
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,965
We're completely winning at one thing.

206
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,261
No matter how much information Khalid has,
you'll be the one making the wish.

207
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,931
Let's get out of here.

208
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,767
From now on,
you and the lamp are inseparable.

209
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,646
You want me to carry it around?

210
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,148
Like a portable

211
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,650
curry pot.

212
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,569
That's believable, right?

213
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,362
That's why…

214
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,323
Here.

215
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,160
I saw people carrying these things around.

216
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,580
Not bad at adapting.

217
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,461
I wonder how much time we have left.

218
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,719
On that note,
listen carefully to what I say now.

219
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,181
I'm sure Khalid will use Shadi again
to try to tie me up.

220
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,561
If that moment comes, and I am tied up,

221
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,940
you must use your final wish
to save yourself.

222
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,028
You must make a righteous wish. Got it?

223
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,575
It seems you've decided where you'll go.

224
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,289
Well, I'll never let you go.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,460
I knew that wouldn't work.

226
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,889
By the way,
do psychopaths really not feel love?

227
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,559
You know, being ready
to give your life for someone else.

228
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,061
I would be willing

229
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,396
to kill for someone else.

230
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,066
Doesn't that count as love?

231
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,985
Hey, Choi Da-jin. Look at this!

232
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,113
That old interview we did
with the psychopath is blowing up again!

233
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,407
It's trending at number nine!

234
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,160
There's even a meme in the comments…

235
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:58,207
"I worked late instead of my manager.
Doesn't that count as love?"

236
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,627
"I binged on food instead of my boyfriend.
Doesn't that count as love?"

237
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,421
"I only ate the tails
of the fish-shaped pastry for you."

238
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,298
Only the tails? That's mental.

239
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,593
This is fucking hilarious.

240
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,178
So what will we do

241
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,056
about the wishes?

242
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,518
You're talking about that again?

243
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,020
I'm so sick of this.

244
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,398
Let's just enjoy the moment for a while!

245
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,486
No.

246
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,740
Let's just get a divorce.

247
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,158
What?

248
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,162
You said you had two wishes left, right?
Give me one of them as alimony.

249
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,497
A divorce?

250
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,542
Have you gone insane?

251
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:42,876
Hey.

252
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,588
Frankly speaking, they're my wishes.
Who do you think you are?

253
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,342
Right. This is how
you really feel, isn't it?

254
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,344
Son of a bitch.

255
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,682
What? Hey, what did you
just call me? Son of a bitch?

256
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,103
This person really is Oh Pan-geum?

257
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,815
That's right, Oh Pan-geum. The third
daughter of the lady from Bukcheon.

258
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,236
She was the prettiest thing in Hadong
and moved to Seoul when she got married.

259
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,196
That smile is her, all right.

260
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,116
Her husband was from Chungcheong-do.

261
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,494
Last I heard,
both their daughters got married.

262
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,121
Let me take a look.

263
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,168
My word! This was when
she was a young thing.

264
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,378
But why are you looking for her anyway?

265
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,756
What is it? Did Pan-geum here die?

266
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,718
No, she's very healthy.

267
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,636
That's good to hear.

268
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,644
I'm not quite sure
what he does for a living.

269
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,730
He mostly tells me to make a wish.

270
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,107
Holy smokes, my teeth
must have gotten younger too.

271
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,860
Don't ask me anything about those two.

272
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:50,903
My deal?

273
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,822
One thing I know for certain
is that he isn't human.

274
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,408
If I can't ask anything…

275
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,578
and he isn't human

276
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,289
and asks people to make wishes…

277
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,965
I'm so stunned, all I can do is laugh.

278
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,720
Why? Just wear them out.

279
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,764
I just want to buy you something.

280
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,351
Wear these and go wherever you want to go.

281
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,603
Wherever that may be,

282
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,397
I'm sure it'll be the right path.

283
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,316
Okay?

284
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,033
If Mi-ju…

285
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,121
is actually Grandma…

286
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,670
Ka-young. This is the soybean paste jar.

287
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,673
Once every month, open the lid

288
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:38,886
to check for mold growing on the surface
beneath the top salt layer

289
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,763
and for signs of bugs.

290
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,189
When the weather is nice,
leave the lid open so it gets some sun.

291
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,357
This is the soy sauce jar.

292
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,403
If you happen to see
any white patches of mold,

293
00:19:56,486 --> 00:20:00,699
scoop them away,
give it a good boil, and pour it back in.

294
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,351
That means I'll be fine

295
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,561
until next spring.

296
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,855
That's good enough.

297
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,944
People die of accidents or illness.

298
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,906
It wouldn't be all that strange
to die at this age anyway.

299
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,536
Oh my. You're up already?

300
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,872
You should sleep in on your day off.

301
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,874
I need to go to the workshop.

302
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,003
But, Grandma, why do you keep
looking at that tree?

303
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,654
What are you doing?

304
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,031
Thinking about whether to fix it.

305
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,950
But from here,

306
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,954
I have the point of view
of a corpse buried in a hole.

307
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,498
You sure have a way with words.

308
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,298
Would this mean we're buried together?

309
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,883
You're going to make things
this easy for me?

310
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,018
Should we go for a carpet ride tomorrow?

311
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,602
You can.

312
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,982
I'm going to Seoul with Grandma tomorrow.

313
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,151
You ride your carpet

314
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,236
and fix the roof.

315
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,238
Why Seoul?

316
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,327
Because I want Grandma to have
some ordinary memories of me.

317
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,415
All right.

318
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,631
I have one of those to make too.

319
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,685
Sweet! A KO win!

320
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,770
You little…

321
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,774
I need to go home now.

322
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,777
Hey, that's not fair.
I haven't won a single game yet.

323
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,113
You should go home soon too, mister.
There's no place like home.

324
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,950
That sure doesn't sound like you.

325
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,871
-Did you buy a house, by any chance?
-That's not funny.

326
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,957
You can't tell anyone this,

327
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,378
but an angel granted my wish.

328
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,506
Mom's boyfriend disappeared.

329
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,386
It's time I cut back on arcade games
so my mom doesn't worry.

330
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,391
I didn't expect this kind of fallout.

331
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,769
Kim Sang-hyeok!

332
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,106
It's been really fun.

333
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,025
And you're my bro.

334
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,529
Never forget that.

335
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,406
What's with you?

336
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,826
I said I'd cut back.
I didn't say I'd quit entirely.

337
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,702
See you tomorrow.

338
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,431
You're not going?

339
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:53,849
Why not?

340
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,310
It's the department store.
The new winter collection's out.

341
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,521
I have a lot of clothes.

342
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,399
I have plenty to last me
until next February.

343
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,860
Instead…

344
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,988
let's go somewhere else.

345
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,699
Where exactly?

346
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,578
You wanted to come here?

347
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,205
Why?

348
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,250
Because I want to be pretty
in your memories.

349
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:25,255
Don't I look pretty? Don't I look cute?
Aren't I just to die for?

350
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,884
In my memories?

351
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,513
Why does it seem like
she has the same idea as me?

352
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,767
Smile.

353
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,522
Like this.

354
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,691
Hurry and do this!

355
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,068
Like this? Maybe?

356
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,321
All right.

357
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,784
Oh boy!

358
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,745
How pretty.

359
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,290
Why do people even do this?

360
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,459
Why not? It's so much fun.

361
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,171
Let's have coffee and enjoy ourselves
just a little longer.

362
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,508
Go and buy me something sweet, all right?

363
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,218
-Fine.
-Great.

364
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,222
Goodness me.

365
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,320
Half the lights on your sign are out.

366
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,656
Trying to tell the world you're single?

367
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,576
I saw that too.

368
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,246
I smell gamja-tang.

369
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,415
It must be Wednesday.

370
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,209
I got it to go, though,
from a different place.

371
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,128
Let's eat.

372
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,299
I thought you'd get mad at me.

373
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,217
This is your routine.

374
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,226
CHEONGPUNG VILLAGE HALL

375
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,650
Grandma? How is Hawaii?

376
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,069
Ka-young is well.

377
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,822
Have you tried the coconut shrimp yet?

378
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,991
That sounds delicious.

379
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,035
Bullshit.

380
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,705
She's not somewhere nicer.
She's still in Hawaii.

381
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,702
I'm going to stop holding
the ancestral rites now.

382
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,664
This is the last time.

383
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,333
Why?

384
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,252
We've already done enough.

385
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,880
When I die,

386
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,965
don't bother with any rites.

387
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,759
Don't do a thing.

388
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,262
Cremate me and scatter my ashes somewhere.

389
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,726
Leave it and go now.
It's a 12 o'clock flight, right?

390
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,478
It's at 11:45.

391
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,190
I've told Mr. Park to come,
so stay close to him.

392
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,025
I'll be back soon, okay?

393
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,319
All right. Go on.

394
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,745
I'm not sure what I wished for,

395
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,499
but I think it led to a very grim end.

396
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,251
So I'm scared.

397
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,359
Excuse me, ma'am.

398
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,280
You've been rubbing this lamp
for three hours now.

399
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,990
It's only right that you buy it.

400
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,200
It's yours for 1,000 dirhams.

401
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,288
How about a discount?

402
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,752
Status update. Keeping a close watch.

403
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,420
Nothing to worry about here.

404
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,504
Thank you.

405
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,635
What?

406
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,929
What do you want? What?

407
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,687
TISAH

408
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,344
CONSULATE EMERGENCY HOTLINE

409
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,074
Would you go easy on the rubbing?

410
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,121
So you were avoiding me.

411
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,790
So what if I was?

412
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,709
When will you drop the attitude?
You'll be lucky to hit 100.

413
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,005
You recognized me the moment you saw me.
You called me the "bitch from back then."

414
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,342
Back when, in what time, was I that bitch?

415
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,594
Tell me everything you know.

416
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,513
This is my first wish.

417
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,224
Silly girl, what the hell are you saying?

418
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,143
I cannot grant things like wishes.

419
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,355
Only Iblis can do that.

420
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,111
Then I'll ask you very nicely.

421
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,408
What's with your smile?

422
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:14,330
The thing with Iblis is,
his mere presence makes us feel pathetic.

423
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,125
He stood at the front lines in the war…

424
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,923
and he saved us from the angels.

425
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,176
All of us bowed our heads to you humans,

426
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,305
but he adamantly refused
and wound up in hell.

427
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,267
So to think the death of a mere human
made him level an entire city…

428
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,352
I couldn't wrap my head around it.

429
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,605
And that was me?

430
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,484
Yes, it was you.

431
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,572
You swept an entire city away
with gold rain. The bitch from back then.

432
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,409
Gold rain?

433
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,037
It was a dazzling and beautiful hell.

434
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,080
It was the rage of Iblis.

435
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,583
Why is his rage gold?

436
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,210
I don't know.

437
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,463
You don't know?

438
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,590
I don't want to know.

439
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,469
Why do you think Iblis has no memories?

440
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,640
Right, I'm sorry.

441
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,683
If you're sorry, never come back here.

442
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,978
This cancels out the time I danced for joy
when Muttalib killed you.

443
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,146
Go.

444
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,107
So the jerk who killed me…

445
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:26,903
Thank you.

446
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,534
By any chance,
has Iblis ever called you habibti?

447
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,207
Has anyone ever thrown water on you?

448
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,001
So it was me.

449
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,514
Irem!

450
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,151
Why did you ask to see me?
I just rolled out of bed.

451
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,028
Take a seat.

452
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:10,863
Sure.

453
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,536
I don't know the details,

454
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,122
but I have a feeling
there's more going on than we know.

455
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,624
When that day comes,
there is something you must do.

456
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,378
No cotton candy,
and you're already talking like that.

457
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,629
What could be going on?

458
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,091
You and I are both our masters' servants.

459
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,012
So if there comes a time
when you need to make a choice,

460
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,472
do so as your master's mythical beast.

461
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,017
I'll decide as I should too. Got it?

462
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,354
I came all dressed up.
What an odd way for you to dump me.

463
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,859
Didn't you just roll out of bed?
Your ears are showing.

464
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,027
I sleep like this.

465
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,903
-What are those?
-How cute.

466
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,573
-Buy me some.
-Sure, let's get them.

467
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,704
MY CHANNEL

468
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,789
SKY FARM LIFE

469
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,551
NEW PASSWORD: 1 GENIE WISH IS MINE!

470
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,640
PASSWORD CHANGED

471
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,940
YOUR CHANNEL HAS BEEN DELETED

472
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,111
Hey, Choi Da-jin!

473
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,364
Hey, what's wrong with our channel?
Can you access it?

474
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:40,453
Damn it, the channel got deleted!
What the hell is going on?

475
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:46,167
Do you think someone reported us?
This will be the death of me, damn it.

476
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,251
No.

477
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,337
I just deleted it.

478
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,340
What? Are you insane?

479
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,009
Do you know what I did
to get all those subscribers?

480
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,385
Have you gone insane?

481
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,512
Hey!

482
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,807
You said to separate
what's yours and mine.

483
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,226
I made this account under my name.

484
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,939
If the wishes are yours,
this YouTube channel was always mine!

485
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,234
Wow, you're completely insane!

486
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:15,696
Hey, cut the bullshit.
I built it up when I found the corpse!

487
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,033
Whatever.
Get the genie here in front of me.

488
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,537
If we don't act in two weeks,
it's gone forever.

489
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,582
Consider it carefully.
Only I can restore the account.

490
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,087
Seriously, what you just did right now.

491
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,756
You better not fucking regret it later.

492
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,677
This is my second wish.

493
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,639
Make it so that Da-jin doesn't remember
a thing I told her about the wishes.

494
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,224
Make her forget

495
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,643
every single detail.

496
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,938
Right now, damn it.

497
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,440
Hey. For starters, it's been fulfilled.

498
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,026
I was halfway across the Gobi Desert
when you called me.

499
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,362
This is just text,
but you can hear me, can't you?

500
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,446
A deep, velvety voice?

501
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,534
Did you think of a final wish
to make now too? Even if so, think more!

502
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,369
Be grateful I'm giving you the chance,

503
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,539
and don't use words
like "right now" or "hurry." Understand?

504
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,223
I told you to carry the lamp.

505
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,976
I was in a hurry,
so I left it at the hotel.

506
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,022
I thought I might recall something,
but no luck.

507
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,065
Man.

508
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,862
You scared me.

509
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,035
Hug me tighter.
It might help me recall something.

510
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,412
What is it you want to recall?

511
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,582
Muttalib from the sign over there.
Or the recurring villain, Khalid.

512
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,920
Or the joy or sorrow
that you and I felt in our past lives?

513
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,632
This seems strategic.

514
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,009
You're mistaken. Hug me tighter!

515
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:30,957
You…

516
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,418
You're dressed strangely today.

517
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,712
Your hair is shorter too.

518
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,966
Are we ready to leave?

519
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,717
We're leaving?

520
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,476
You're here, so why would I?

521
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,105
Did I have a new master?

522
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,525
You seem a little odd today.

523
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,527
Muttalib is your master.

524
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,322
He must finally be ready
to make his final wish.

525
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:09,912
That means we really are
leaving tonight, right?

526
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,206
For Goryeo.

527
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,792
Muttalib was my new master?

528
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:33,978
What's wrong?

529
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,152
Hey.

530
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,738
Snap out of it.

531
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,119
There is a chance that…

532
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,081
I never managed to get you to Goryeo.

533
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,587
I think that's the reason my sword

534
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,715
is stuck over there.

535
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,010
What are you saying?

536
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,348
Oh?

537
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,516
You recalled something?

538
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,479
It actually worked?

539
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,356
Come here. Let's trade places.

540
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:38,250
I feel just the same,
so when exactly did I get so old?

541
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,677
Oh my, it's you!

542
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,889
You came back without a word?
When did you get here?

543
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,017
Hello.

544
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,814
Good heavens,
I was so sure it was Pan-geum.

545
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,982
I must have been mistaken.

546
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,026
Never you mind.

547
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,574
Why the hell is she weeding a field
that isn't even hers?

548
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,501
Wait a moment.

549
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,177
OH PAN-GEUM

550
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,180
The person you've called
is currently unavailable.

551
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,558
Please leave a message after the beep.

552
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,646
The more I think about it,
the stranger it all gets.

553
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,816
She sends texts
and talks with Min-ji on the phone,

554
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,610
so why did she only cut us off?

555
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,321
Yesterday was the anniversary
of her old man's passing.

556
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,615
So who did the ancestral rites?

557
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:04,086
That tramp was getting groceries
for the ancestral rites table!

558
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,213
Goodness me.

559
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,844
I thought you'd say the observation deck.

560
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,097
I don't want to stand
on the edge of anything anymore.

561
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,309
So why did you express
your rage with gold?

562
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,187
It was a dazzling and beautiful hell.

563
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,731
It was the rage of Iblis.

564
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,901
Do rage and gold even go together?

565
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,986
Gold? What do you mean by that?

566
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,155
Pointless if you don't remember.
Let's move on.

567
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,704
Either way, we knew each other
during those lost 20 years.

568
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,500
A 28-year-old you
definitely existed by my side.

569
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,504
-But Muttalib means "foreigner."
-We just knew each other?

570
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,632
But I was your one and only habibti.

571
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,801
Our relationship
was definitely incredibly serious.

572
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,887
You said it was 50-50 with Jinniya.

573
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,182
Don't tell me…

574
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,190
Do you have an umbrella?

575
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,150
An umbrella?

576
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,614
Wow, this woman sure is thorough.

577
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,575
It's raining. Kiss.

578
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,369
Hey, we're in Arabia.

579
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,795
But it's not raining here!

580
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,588
We broke that rule a long time ago.

581
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,382
You didn't buy it.

582
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,343
Man, I'm hungry.
Don't you have anything to eat?

583
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,179
I almost used my third wish.

584
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,057
Do it.

585
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,268
Yeah, right. Give me food!

586
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,145
You let me go hungry all the time.

587
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,107
Dry up while I set the table.

588
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,680
This was here?

589
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:23,392
Wait. Hey, get rid of this right now.
No, burn it quickly. Let it rot!

590
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,436
Come on, this is…

591
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,313
Do I look similar to my past life?

592
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,024
What?

593
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,209
Yes.

594
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,712
You look similar.

595
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,672
Right?

596
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:58,469
I also think I look
exactly as I did in the hourglass.

597
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,930
So who's prettier? Me or her?

598
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:03,891
No, don't tell me.

599
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,226
No. Tell me.

600
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,604
-Oh, well--
-Never mind. It's me.

601
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,232
And what is that?

602
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,777
What?

603
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,865
What is?

604
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,332
Move over.

605
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,458
It's ramyeon.

606
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,964
Man, I told them to prepare
a proper Korean meal.

607
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,099
Bring the fruit over.

608
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,642
What? Sure.

609
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,073
So do you really waltz by yourself?
Without a partner?

610
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,158
Waltz?

611
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,328
I've never waltzed.

612
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,664
I don't know how.

613
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,419
Then why do they call the sand whirls
in the desert "a waltzing genie"?

614
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,882
Moving on.

615
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,889
Fine, then.

616
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,976
Let's turn the legend into an actual fact.

617
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,776
Follow me. For old time's sake,

618
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,820
let's tear it up.

619
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,573
Right.

620
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,849
There is a round ball
between the two of us right now.

621
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,392
That ball is a small universe.

622
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,645
The waltz is all about
maintaining that distance

623
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:17,399
while dancing around
an even larger universe.

624
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,152
-Do you understand?
-What? Yes.

625
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:23,322
Just let yourself fall under my spell.
Follow me in a trance.

626
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,658
Now left foot forward.

627
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,704
One, two, three, back.

628
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,041
-Back.
-One, two, three, forward.

629
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,214
Are you going to keep stepping on my feet?

630
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,216
This is a battle, not a dance.

631
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,135
How is it that whatever we do,
it becomes a duel?

632
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,973
And when exactly
did you fall under my spell?

633
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,058
Back.

634
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,646
The second time I saw you?

635
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,606
But that was at the hotel.

636
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,483
Really?

637
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,027
That early on?

638
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,739
Yes. I knew the moment I saw you.

639
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,202
You come after the cars I fix.

640
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,287
The adjustable wrenches I grip.

641
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:13,914
Let's stop.

642
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,377
The wheels I roll.

643
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,713
-The hammers I use.
-I said stop.

644
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,593
The crowbars I use.

645
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,263
The sound of dental scaling I like.

646
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:34,560
My auto shop, gamja-tang, Grandma,

647
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,521
Min-ji.

648
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,191
Sea louse…

649
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,076
Pan-geum definitely made this.

650
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,955
Pan-geum, that bitch. She's here.

651
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,126
Gosh, why is this tooth
bothering me so much?

652
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,503
Gosh.

653
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,261
What are you doing here, ma'am?

654
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:55,807
You'd better come clean.
Where is Pan-geum?

655
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,768
She's in Hawaii…

656
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,603
Don't give me that crap.

657
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,440
This tastes exactly like Pan-geum's work.
She's here, isn't she?

658
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,443
How dare you hide her away
while you con us!

659
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,071
Lead the way! I need to see her now!

660
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,074
Please let go of me.
Why are you doing this?

661
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,326
Tramp. Where do you think
you're going? Come here.

662
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,413
That mole.

663
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,291
Pan-geum has that mole there too.

664
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,293
What the hell is this?

665
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,337
Are you Pan-geum?

666
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,757
-Is that you, Pan-geum?
-No, I'm not!

667
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,386
-Oh dearie!
-Dearie!

668
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,056
You are! You are Pan-geum!

669
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,101
It's Pan-geum!

670
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,479
Heung-rye!

671
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,899
Good heavens! How on earth
could something like this happen?

672
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,817
Heung-rye!

673
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,112
Heung-rye.
Please just hear me out. Please?

674
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,364
Let go, you wretched witch!

675
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,658
My Lord!

676
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,245
I was wondering where you hid her,
but you were Pan-geum all along?

677
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:02,666
What the hell did you do?
How the hell did you become so young?

678
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:07,879
I'll tell you everything.
So please don't tell anyone else!

679
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,465
You disgust me. Let go, you bitch!

680
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,342
Dear Lord!

681
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,469
Gosh, Heung-rye. Please!

682
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,565
What? That bitch is Oh Pan-geum?

683
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,485
So that's how she kept her grandma hidden.

684
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,489
I see. That's how she used her wish.

685
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,908
Let's start by
getting rid of that old bitch

686
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,660
before she runs her mouth more.

687
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,203
Ishrun.

688
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,664
You know what to do, right?

689
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,843
Let's go home now.

690
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,804
I'll go and get changed.

691
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,514
Are my clothes dry?

692
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,516
Of course.

693
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,325
