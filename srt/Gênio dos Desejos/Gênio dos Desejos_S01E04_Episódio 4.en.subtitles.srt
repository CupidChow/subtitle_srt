1
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,982
GENIE, MAKE A WISH

2
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,694
-Someone's hacking the security system.
-What do they want?

3
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,738
Who is it? Russia? Or North Korea?

4
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,407
They're finding out now.
We should rush over.

5
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,096
SHOCK

6
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,931
SEDUCTION

7
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,952
Sleep well?

8
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:01,996
Let's kiss.

9
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,874
I need to plant onions.

10
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,094
Goodness me.

11
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,972
Done with the onions? Let's kiss.

12
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,642
Hold up. I left that thing back there.
Silly me.

13
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,768
You came back for this coffin?

14
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,063
-You've found it now, so let's kiss--
-Wait up. Stop.

15
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,400
This isn't something you can
just do whenever, you know?

16
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,861
You like rules, don't you?

17
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,155
These things have rules too.

18
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,741
-What are those rules?
-Well, those rules are…

19
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,244
First, the weather.

20
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,205
Rain. It must be raining.

21
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,664
Not yesterday.

22
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,626
It was the first time yesterday.

23
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,212
First kisses tend to be

24
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,923
more spontaneous,
less restricted by the rules.

25
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,508
But it must be raining for the second one.

26
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,802
And there must be alcohol.

27
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,013
Just after a drink. Right then.

28
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,600
It's that complex?

29
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,894
It's even more complex. I simplified it.

30
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,771
Now close this back up.

31
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,150
You're really mixing identities like this?

32
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,249
The first digit has changed again.

33
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,668
That fucking psycho bitch.

34
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,879
KI KA-YOUNG
BALANCE: 20,688,348,652 WON

35
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,383
And what's all this?

36
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,218
ESTIMATED ASSETS
4,300,431,074 WON

37
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,844
MONTHLY BILL
34,074,250 WON

38
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,894
CHEONGPUNGHO BANK

39
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,980
LUNCH BREAK
12 P.M. TO 1 P.M.

40
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,777
Ms. Gu, weren't you classmates
with Ki Ka-young and Choi Min-ji?

41
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,113
-Yes.
-Did you see their bags?

42
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,364
They're both Hermès.

43
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,742
She's just letting it sit on the floor.

44
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,662
Hey, could we get two iced Americanos?

45
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,625
He always does that
when we're headed to lunch.

46
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,752
You go ahead.
I'll take a soybean paste stew.

47
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,214
You really should open
a retirement savings fund account.

48
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,800
The earlier you plan for retirement,
the better.

49
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,136
I'm good. I don't need retirement.

50
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,764
What do you mean
you don't need retirement?

51
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,601
It's just Ms. Ki prefers
aggressive investments over low-risk ones.

52
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,729
Of course, I understand.

53
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,399
We should give you our new towel sets.
Ms. Gu? Where are they?

54
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:18,609
Did you forget?

55
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,405
Come on, Ms. Gu.
You should take more initiative.

56
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,699
I'll bring them right over.

57
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,118
Back to the topic of retirement, well…

58
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,246
How should I explain this?
The profitability…

59
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:44,052
As of today, construction is complete.
I just need a move-in date.

60
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,304
Do you like it?

61
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,805
Yes, Dad.

62
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,024
Daddy!

63
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,068
Goodness, you're blinding me!

64
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,153
My darling princess,
did you study hard today?

65
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,156
Like my life depended on it.
I'm tired as hell.

66
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,201
I was paired up
with the transfer student today.

67
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,869
-And?
-He's really cute.

68
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,122
He is? Did he become
the apple of your eye, Princess?

69
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,916
He seems really classy.

70
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,085
-So I asked where he lived.
-And?

71
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,754
-He lives in the mansion we talked about.
-Over there?

72
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,464
-Yeah.
-They moved in?

73
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,925
If they've moved in,
they should at least say hi.

74
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,761
Guess we'll have to make a house call.

75
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,012
Open up!

76
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,606
Wait, those rules

77
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,525
were this accurate?

78
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,031
Genie, tell me about tomorrow's weather.

79
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,241
Why would you ask me?

80
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,535
Weather is a touchy subject
for me right now!

81
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,371
Why are you making such a fuss
when I asked Genie?

82
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,457
Genie, so what's the weather
like tomorrow?

83
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,585
It's set to be a clear and sunny day
in Cheongpung tomorrow.

84
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,503
Hear that?

85
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,257
You should try asking it something.
It's so accurate.

86
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,556
Hey. Other Genie.

87
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,101
What does Ki Ka-young ask about the most?

88
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,688
Here is a list of Ms. Ki Ka-young's
recent search history.

89
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,900
Rainmaking ritual, artificial rain,
alcohol content of different beers,

90
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,361
cool-toned lip tint,
lightning-fast delivery,

91
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,781
rainmaking ritual…

92
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,325
What the hell have you done, you idiot?

93
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,540
Find out when it will rain this week.

94
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,835
I just checked since the cherry blossom
festival starts tomorrow.

95
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,795
Luckily, this entire week will be clear.

96
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,088
Damn it, why?

97
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,133
What about next week?

98
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,721
The spring rain hits next week,
so Monday may be the only dry day.

99
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,056
-Monday will be dry?
-Would you like it not to be?

100
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,600
You can do that?

101
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,062
-Since you're a mythical beast?
-I couldn't do it myself.

102
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,481
But I can try praying.

103
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,819
Not exactly useful.

104
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,114
What is this about?
Please put the wrench down.

105
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,659
Is something there?

106
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,244
I'm pretty today.

107
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,292
Pretty.

108
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,838
Pretty.

109
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,011
It's like the town is broke or something.

110
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,055
Why couldn't they get IU
for the festival--

111
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,097
What are you doing?

112
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,058
Put that down!

113
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,729
I'm pretty.

114
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,941
Even prettier than before.

115
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,609
Goodness, young lady.

116
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,779
There are mirrors all over this house!

117
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,497
It's not your fault, Master.

118
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,544
Psychopaths tend to be
pretty narcissistic.

119
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,587
Is that true?

120
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,214
Thank goodness.

121
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,883
I thought I must have
made her pretty somehow.

122
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,052
I was pretty awesome in the moment.

123
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,805
Why did I pick that moment
to get all competitive?

124
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,765
What are you talking about?

125
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,351
Now is the prime moment
to get competitive.

126
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,395
That kiss was the gateway to corruption.

127
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,605
Right. It should be, but…

128
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,275
After 1,000 years,

129
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,944
it was practically my first kiss.

130
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,738
I almost died from nerves.

131
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,033
I just feel bad for Ejllael.

132
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,495
I hear he hits the gym nonstop
because he wants to slit your throat.

133
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,748
Had he known a kiss would floor you,
he could've avoided all that effort.

134
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,335
By the way,
if it was your first in 1,000 years…

135
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,212
Yeah, what?

136
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,590
Shouldn't you have gotten
a dental scaling first?

137
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,507
Total jerk move.

138
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,886
Dental scaling?

139
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,598
What is that?

140
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,525
Raise your hand if you feel discomfort…

141
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,569
We haven't started yet.

142
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,070
Say, "Ah."

143
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,533
Bear with me for a moment.

144
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,086
You don't have any money?

145
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,588
And no ID?

146
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,049
You treated him with no intake info?

147
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,885
He said that he's a friend
of the auto shop owner, so…

148
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,845
Ka-young? But I'm her only friend…

149
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,306
Wait, are you the guy from the…

150
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,600
-Middle East?
-Min-ji? I'm so happy to see you!

151
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,397
I saw you eating gamja-tang together
at the gamja-tang place!

152
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:53,653
Does seeing us eat gamja-tang together
excuse you from paying?

153
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,822
A tab?

154
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,075
Ridiculous, isn't it?

155
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,077
It's outrageous, isn't it?

156
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,204
Apparently, he doesn't have ID.

157
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,914
And his name is none other than…

158
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,334
Lee Beul-li.

159
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,044
Lee Beul-li.

160
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,714
That immediately killed my curiosity,
so I stopped asking questions.

161
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,342
Do you even know anything
about this person?

162
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,888
One thing I know for certain
is that he isn't human.

163
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,391
No, of course he isn't.

164
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,519
No decent human racks up a tab
with someone they just met.

165
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,771
I'm feeling immense discomfort,

166
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,065
so here are my hands.

167
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,608
Seriously? I could just…

168
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,028
Dr. Choi, we need to get
to the festival to volunteer.

169
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,238
Okay. I'm coming.

170
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,908
At this rate,
you'll wind up in big trouble.

171
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,912
Snap out of it, Ms. Ki.

172
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,083
Okay, so he has a decent face,
and he's pretty tall.

173
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,043
And yeah, he has a velvety voice.

174
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,462
Other than that,
what's he got going for him?

175
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,513
It was essential given the rainy season.

176
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,058
I'll pay you back
once I become a pro gamer…

177
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,727
A pro gamer?

178
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,397
You've lost every game
to the neighborhood kid.

179
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,940
Pro gamer, you say?

180
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,401
Come here.

181
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,785
I dodged her pretty well today.

182
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,788
I was only hit on one side.

183
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,349
What the heck?

184
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,393
Ms. Ki.

185
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,062
Check the tire pressure for me, would you?

186
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,022
Sure.

187
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,406
You're drinking.

188
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,325
Yes, that I am.

189
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,620
And you're at the wheel
with the engine on.

190
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,205
Yes, I'm at the wheel.

191
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,915
Engine?

192
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,583
What's that?

193
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,793
All right, sir.

194
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,503
Blow into this for us.

195
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,380
And what's this? Is it a pipe?

196
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,340
Go on.

197
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,677
-Okay, more.
-More.

198
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:28,057
-Harder.
-Harder!

199
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,145
Hello, Homies!
It's Da-jin of Sky Farm Life.

200
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,982
I'm coming to you today from
the Cheongpungho Cherry Blossom Festival.

201
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,528
Let's start off by raiding
the For Daughter Strawberry stand.

202
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,323
Guys, what do you call a strawberry
that was fired from its job?

203
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,533
What?

204
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,450
Berry upset!

205
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,205
Right. "Berry upset!"

206
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,582
You're hilarious!

207
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,211
See that? Nothing flops for no reason.

208
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,254
That was great.

209
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,964
-Cherry blossoms!
-Indeed.

210
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,799
Open wide. That's it.

211
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,677
Can we try opening up a little wider?

212
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,970
Even wider!

213
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,097
Hello. We're from Cheongpungho Bank.

214
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,558
We have a savings event,
so visit for a consultation.

215
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,102
Hello.

216
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,983
Where is the bathroom?

217
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,860
Is the subway station close by?

218
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,279
Without cilantro, please.

219
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,572
What are you saying?

220
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,865
Are you an Arab?

221
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,534
You spoke Korean just fine earlier.

222
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,245
He doesn't want any cilantro.

223
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,204
What?

224
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,125
Arabic was big back in school,
so I took it as my second language.

225
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,710
I'll try speaking to him.

226
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,754
My name is Oh Gyeong-yeol,

227
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,798
a police officer
from the Republic of Korea.

228
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,801
Sir, you have violated the traffic laws--

229
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,263
Get over here.

230
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,181
You said speaking Arabic would work.

231
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,643
About that. It worked for me
toward the end of the Joseon dynasty…

232
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,646
Just go. I'll handle things here.

233
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:58,981
I could just…

234
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,155
Oh Pan-geum!

235
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,365
Buy that to eat. That one.

236
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,411
Why are you walking around
eating raw tofu?

237
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,955
I hear this is post-police food.

238
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,875
Oh Pan-geum, you should drink
some black goat extract.

239
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,084
To live a long life.

240
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,630
I don't have that kind of money!
Why don't you buy me one, then?

241
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,467
I can't buy things for you.
I only make recommendations.

242
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,347
Honestly, I can't tell
if you're a bastard or just pitiful.

243
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,723
Goodness me.

244
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,600
-What?
-Hey, would you look at that?

245
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,103
Goodness, that puppy
is bouncing around on its own.

246
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,605
How incredible, no?

247
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,191
-Wow. What is this?
-Come and have a look.

248
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,692
-How adorable!
-It's walking!

249
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,652
It's so cool.

250
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,906
Hey, it's walking
but still stays in the same spot.

251
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,949
How is that?

252
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,080
At least her joints seem strong.

253
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,751
My apologies.

254
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:04,880
What is it?

255
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:11,553
There's this thing called fireworks today.
Do you know when and where?

256
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,184
The fireworks?
They'll be set off after the sun sets.

257
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,688
You'd get the best view from there.

258
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,605
Enjoy.

259
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,025
The best view is that way?

260
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,997
Ta-da.

261
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,544
Damn, that fucker
looked like he was loaded.

262
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,421
But he was broke, damn it.

263
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,049
Well, well. Look at these motherfuckers
with no common decency.

264
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,385
What do you think
you're doing on our turf?

265
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,929
We thought we'd visit
the cherry blossom festival.

266
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,472
The spring breeze is a-blowing.

267
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,766
The cherry blossom festival is our turf.

268
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,645
We didn't go against the current to invade
your cherry salmon festival, did we?

269
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,814
You could always come to next year's.

270
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,774
What, should we send you an invite?

271
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,486
Great, you should all get prosthetics
while you're here.

272
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,907
You know the health services
in Cheongpung are first-class.

273
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,995
-What the…
-What the heck?

274
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,461
What a relief! I almost got beat up
by the lump of clay again.

275
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,337
And who's this prick?

276
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,839
Hey, which gang are you from?

277
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,550
-What?
-Why isn't he answering me?

278
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,052
Just fucking wipe them all out!

279
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,809
Darn it. I'm in the mood for flowers.

280
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,316
-Damn you!
-Hey, you bastard!

281
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,294
Wow.

282
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,587
Goodness me.

283
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,963
Oh boy.

284
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,966
How stunning.

285
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,554
AS SEXY
FUCK YOU

286
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,056
What the…

287
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,851
Goodness me, is that…

288
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,521
Is that my Ka-young's name up there?

289
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,108
"As, sexy, fuck, you"?

290
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,068
Wait, what does that mean?

291
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,028
So that prick does have money.

292
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,030
KI KA-YOUNG
YOU'RE IN MY HEART

293
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,407
So women really love those words?

294
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,369
Yes, I told you.
Just trust me with these things.

295
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,538
They go absolutely wild.

296
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,498
She'll be corrupted in no time.

297
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,708
Perfect.

298
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,346
KI KA-YOUNG
FUCK YOU

299
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,057
That son of a gun.

300
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,394
That's what I always think
when I see Iblis too.

301
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,313
I'm glad you relate, Ms. Ki Ka-young.

302
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,069
What brings you here? You don't even
have a car since you can fly.

303
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,656
Everyone in the village
is at the festival.

304
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,700
I came as things are quiet.

305
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,952
Do you have something to say to me?

306
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,163
I won't return your feather.

307
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,748
It's yours.

308
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,211
What species are you, anyway?

309
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,047
Just as there are Yorkshire terriers
and Chihuahuas,

310
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,968
there are humans, angels, devils,
and genies. So which are you?

311
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,180
I'm obviously his servant.
You saw my wings. I'm an angel.

312
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,348
Right, an angel?

313
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,060
I thought I'd double-check
since your wings were black.

314
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,855
You do volunteer lunch runs, right?

315
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,816
For a while, I've been thinking it's odd

316
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,236
how every time you deliver lunch,
the elderly person

317
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,322
ends up dead.

318
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:02,743
I guess one could see it that way,
but try switching the order of events.

319
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,039
I visit dying elders to bring them peace.

320
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,795
I see.

321
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,048
One more thing.

322
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:21,136
Several of your buildings are within
a one-kilometer radius of my auto shop,

323
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,223
and you never hid your identity from me.

324
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,100
Are you spying on me?

325
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,646
I am. To be more precise,
I'm working on his orders.

326
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,523
What are they? His orders?

327
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,278
"If there comes a moment that Iblis
bows his head before a human, you shall

328
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,781
slit your brother's throat."

329
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,868
Isn't that thrilling?

330
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,415
That's why I'm going to do my best
to make sure Iblis doesn't win you over.

331
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,925
It's too late.

332
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,761
Pardon?

333
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,013
Get lost so I can close shop.

334
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,182
Right.

335
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,976
Is that the time?

336
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,064
But why are you being so rude?

337
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,359
Who knows? Maybe because psychopaths
can't hide their displeasure?

338
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,487
Or because you're trying to kill him
when I'm his master?

339
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,405
Or maybe because

340
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,574
he's already won me over.

341
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,078
Which of these do you think it is?

342
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,963
I knew I was right about her.

343
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,012
A STUDY OF PSYCHOPATHS

344
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,847
Did something happen?

345
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,683
-I brought the books--
-Throw them out again.

346
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,686
Psychopath? I'm absolutely certain!

347
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,273
I should've known it was too lucky.

348
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,694
At this rate, there's no telling
about her last two wishes.

349
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,447
Should I have taken my scythe with me?

350
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,491
She had the audacity
to tell me to "get lost."

351
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,826
Like she was dismissing me!

352
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,078
-To you, Master?
-Yes.

353
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,331
You do look a little young for your age.

354
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,795
Did you see the fireworks?
Weren't they cool?

355
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,088
I did that, you know.

356
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,299
Why did you choose that…

357
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,926
Please, no!

358
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,471
Hey, no using cheats like that!

359
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,514
So you were behind the fireworks?

360
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,141
Yes.

361
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,186
I wondered
which crazy fool was behind them.

362
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,687
Crazy what?

363
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,401
Hey, where do you live?
Lead the way, punk.

364
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,819
And where do you live?

365
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,821
Lead the way.

366
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,408
Pardon?

367
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,120
The typical psychopath

368
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,540
will harm others

369
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,709
to get what they want.

370
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,588
But my dear Ka-young
is a little different.

371
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,926
Her grandma and the entire neighborhood
rallied to raise her with hope,

372
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,178
so even though she may not feel guilt,

373
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,473
she knows to stay
within her learned boundaries.

374
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,727
All right. So what?

375
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,480
So I'm saying I don't like you, you jerk.

376
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,317
Ka-young will stay within those boundaries
no matter what,

377
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,737
and I will protect Ka-young
as she does so.

378
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,448
Whether it be psychologically…

379
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,703
or physically.

380
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,083
I'm her knight in shining armor, you see.

381
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,793
You are, aren't you?

382
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,005
All this time,
I thought you were a girl! Wow!

383
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,091
This is on the house.

384
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,158
Why are you laughing?

385
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,201
Funniest thing I've heard in 983 years.

386
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,704
Nine hundred and eighty…

387
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,331
What the hell are you talking about?

388
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,628
Now that we have a man in the mix,
you come to a seafood stew joint?

389
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,088
I can't believe you.

390
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,882
I didn't come. I just stopped by.

391
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,801
I'll drop Min-ji off,
so I'll see you at home.

392
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,428
Can't I take her home?

393
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,889
We've actually bonded. Honestly. Master?

394
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,391
Just call me "ma'am."

395
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,685
Do you need anything else?

396
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,689
Benevolence?

397
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,986
Min-ji didn't pay before she left,
but I'm…

398
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,739
I'm completely broke.

399
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,249
I know about that. Allow me.

400
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,839
I've reached 112, right?

401
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,133
I'm turning myself in.

402
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,685
Eating without paying? Seriously?

403
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,689
This is unfair. I didn't even eat.
I just did the "not paying" part.

404
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,732
Shut it.

405
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,901
Why did you call me to bail you out?

406
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,153
What about the one who's like you?
That angel!

407
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,823
You're mistaken about that.

408
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,746
Not only are Ejllael and I
different species, we're on bad terms.

409
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,040
You and I are also on bad terms.

410
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,920
What's with you lowering your voice?

411
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,422
I may be Satan,
but this is no laughing matter.

412
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,052
Ejllael and I fought a long battle.

413
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,430
The war was devastating for me too.

414
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,516
Why did you go to war?

415
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,818
He created angels from light

416
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,530
and genies from smokeless fire.

417
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,579
The genies created from fire
grew increasingly arrogant,

418
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,665
even aspiring to surpass Him.

419
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:31,006
In his rage, he sent the angels
and ordered them to decimate us.

420
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,532
The angels came down
and began slaughtering all the genies,

421
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,786
and Ejllael led the charge.

422
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,128
The war lasted 300 years,

423
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,714
and I lost most of my brothers
as a result.

424
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,053
So your quarrels turn into
full-blown wars of the gods?

425
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,555
I've rarely seen my brothers since then.

426
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,560
Partly because I defied his orders
and ended up in hell.

427
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,523
And once released, I ended up trapped
for almost 1,000 years, so there's that.

428
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,612
Where are your surviving brothers now?

429
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,032
I'm not sure.

430
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,160
They're probably inhabiting rings or lamps

431
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,163
or living out their days in a pot.

432
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,875
They may be controlling sleep…

433
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,510
or tending to the flowers of souls.

434
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,270
Or perhaps controlling the rain.

435
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,274
One controls the rain?

436
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,739
-What?
-Can't you find him? Find him and--

437
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,408
Can't. No longer with us.

438
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,120
I think Sade is looking for me.

439
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,544
I'm pretty sure
Sade isn't looking for you.

440
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,117
Wow.

441
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,048
Miss, does the owner of this car
live in this neighborhood?

442
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:19,966
Yes.

443
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,593
Must be a crypto bro.

444
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,678
I used to drive one of these.

445
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,555
That's the 2024 model.

446
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,975
Hey, come on!

447
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,686
I said to patch the puncture,
not take the tire off!

448
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,646
It needs to be changed.

449
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,401
Did you even report all these?
Every one of these modifications?

450
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,321
What are you, a civil servant?
Why would I report anything?

451
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,614
Hey, put it back on.

452
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,202
Where do you live?

453
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,454
Why do you ask?

454
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,748
Like what you see?

455
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,542
Just concerned
you'll croak on your way home.

456
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,628
Did you do these wheels yourself?

457
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,339
You shoved them on
when they don't even fit.

458
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,549
A simple patch-up wouldn't last an hour.

459
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,136
I've explained everything,
so call a tow truck and take it away.

460
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,638
I won't fix it.

461
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,683
Is this how you treat your customers?
Hey, get over here.

462
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,487
Is everything good?

463
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,406
You drank that?

464
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,826
There were so many bottles.
Weren't they for staff?

465
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,745
No wonder they kept going missing.

466
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,082
Wait, what were you saying?

467
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,585
I was just asking
for the tow truck number.

468
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,755
Zero, one, zero,

469
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,258
six, three, four…

470
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,968
-Wait, I didn't catch that.
-Two…

471
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,638
Did you hit him?

472
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,104
Six, three, four…

473
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,109
What are you going to do
about this random, dreamy vibe?

474
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,903
I'm sorry. I'll report everything.

475
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,363
-I swear.
-Where are you going?

476
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,824
-Damn it.
-Don't go.

477
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,158
Hello, ma'am.

478
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,373
-Hello.
-Thank you. Feel free to browse.

479
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,834
Who's in charge of this display?

480
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,003
Who's responsible for this station?

481
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,297
Hey, you're back!

482
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,424
I'm sorry, Im-seon.

483
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,385
I had to step out for a moment.
My bowels were acting up again.

484
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,848
Don't you think it's wrong
to call your branch manager by name?

485
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,310
At our age, we're all a little unwell.

486
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,520
Is it too much to ask you to do your job?

487
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,901
I can't take any more of this crap.

488
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,570
Ms. Jung Yeong-sun. What did you just say?

489
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,533
I said I can't stand it anymore.
This is so ridiculous that I quit.

490
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,201
Im-seon, this is just wrong.

491
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,370
Has the late promotion gone to your head?

492
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,622
Ms. Jung Yeong-sun!

493
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,707
I don't know how you were even promoted,

494
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,001
but is this how you treat your coworkers?

495
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,962
We've all heard the rumors
about you taking bribes from vendors.

496
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,589
Do we look like fools?

497
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,215
Yeong-sun, please!

498
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,594
How could I be so stupid?

499
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,056
I shouldn't have asked to be
a branch manager at this age.

500
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,767
People look down on me,
and I keep making mistakes.

501
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,774
I guess I could get to it a bit quicker.

502
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,485
Excuse me?

503
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,904
Here's my second wish.

504
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,239
Take me back 20 years

505
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,450
and make me branch manager then.

506
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,956
If I'd made branch manager back then,
just imagine all the money.

507
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,217
Shall we go, then?
Twenty years into the past?

508
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,489
BRANCH MANAGER
KANG IM-SEON

509
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,161
Go through that door,
and it will be 20 years in the past,

510
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,123
and you will still be the branch manager.

511
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,425
Talk to me.

512
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,204
Why are you alone?
Where's Dad? He said he'd pick you up.

513
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,498
Dad has work to do.

514
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,462
Long time no see.

515
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,256
Do you still like hot chamomile tea?

516
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,509
Yes. I'm still a psychopath,
so caffeine isn't good for me.

517
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,931
You haven't changed a bit.

518
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,601
I thought you'd at least ask,
"What brings you here?"

519
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,145
I moved here with my wife and son.

520
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,523
Take good care of us. I found out
about this place thanks to you.

521
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:33,196
I don't recall ever telling you
exactly where I live.

522
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,657
Not many University of Science grads
run auto shops.

523
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,701
I guess.

524
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,038
Either way, it's good to see you again.
You look great.

525
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,831
How's business?

526
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,462
True joy.

527
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,897
I guess the house looked
pretty much the same 20 years ago.

528
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,318
Except for you.

529
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:40,054
You grow up to be super pretty
20 years from now.

530
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,890
So careful with this.
You wouldn't want to hurt…

531
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,771
What is it?

532
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,315
Someone just entered my memory.

533
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,073
Grandma told me not to speak to strangers.

534
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,118
Leave!

535
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,661
Wait, no!

536
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,954
Hey, you startled me.

537
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,457
So you're clearly as odd as ever.

538
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,172
"So you're clearly as odd as ever."

539
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,217
He was sleazy as hell.

540
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,845
So how did you hurt your head again?

541
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,223
Who else would it be?

542
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,310
She was even worse 20 years ago.

543
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,437
Did you visit the past for a wish?

544
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,189
Yeah.

545
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,168
That'll be 18,000 won.

546
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,216
I need to see your ID for the alcohol…

547
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,611
Ms. Ki!

548
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,780
What's wrong? Is something up?

549
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,366
Just that it's raining.

550
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,244
Keep up the good work.

551
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,671
Where the hell is he?

552
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,386
Wait, what?

553
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,595
Why is it stopping?

554
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,723
But it's the rainy season!

555
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,446
Where the hell were you? It rained!

556
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,449
Do you know how long
I looked everywhere for you?

557
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,784
Seriously?

558
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,244
Hey, you're the one

559
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,997
who took a rock this big, you know.

560
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,000
You do all that,
then I hear about you acting all "odd."

561
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,210
You're deflecting because you're cornered.

562
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,005
I'm in a corner? Who was the jerk
who came by the auto shop?

563
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,549
I heard you were giggling with each other.

564
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,302
Kiss me or crack my skull,
but just do one.

565
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,595
You can't do both, you serial kisser!

566
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,513
I can't?

567
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,058
Then I choose to crack your skull.
Come here.

568
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,394
Hey, come on. You're my master.

569
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,481
Shush. We're talking right now.

570
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,900
Come on. Treat me with care.

571
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,277
Take care of me.

572
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:42,903
I said shush!

573
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,574
Why does every damn dog around here
bark like mad whenever they see you?

574
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,826
They're just scared I'll take them in.

575
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,580
They need to read human expressions,
but I don't have any.

576
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,583
Hey, I don't plan on taking you in either!

577
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:09,972
Sade!

578
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,733
I am Genie, the lamp spirit.
…shall grant you three wishes…

579
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,234
…no traveling to the future.

580
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,486
Anything besides that,

581
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,196
your wish… is my command.

582
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,407
But before that,

583
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,078
tell all the dogs in the area
to stop barking at Ki Ka-young.

584
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,538
If they bark one more time,

585
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,166
I'll change every last one of you
into cats.

586
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,085
Tell him.

587
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,048
Ki Ka-young.

588
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:52,264
MUTT, AGE 7
MADE FIRST WISH ON MAY 16, 2024

589
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,433
TO BECOME A PERSON, WITH SPECIFICS

590
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,395
CHARMING MIDDLE-AGED MAN IN HIS 40S
WHO RESEMBLES DANIEL HENNEY

591
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,022
Now that's not a face
you see in these parts.

592
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,191
Is there a film shoot?

593
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,527
Remember I was depressed
about losing my eyesight with age?

594
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,363
-Yeah?
-I think I just fully recovered.

595
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,448
-Let's go, Yeong-sun.
-Sure.

596
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:10,866
Wow.

597
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,637
I'm hungry.

598
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,013
Chicken and beer?

599
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,141
Sounds good. Let's do it.

600
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,063
Suit and slicked back hair.
Wow, he's doggone handsome.

601
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,523
He's coming this way.

602
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,525
Hand me some blotting paper and lip tint.

603
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,086
-What's he doing?
-He must be crazy!

604
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,838
My gosh!

605
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,674
They say handsome men
are either gay or dogs.

606
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,218
His actions clearly show

607
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,345
he's a total mutt.

608
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,941
You've run out of water.

609
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,700
Don't skip breakfast tomorrow.

610
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,165
Pardon?

611
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,504
The food doesn't taste good.

612
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,255
It's too bland.

613
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,884
It's too bland for you?

614
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,221
I should have been
more generous with the salt.

615
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,016
I was only joking.

616
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,105
What will happen to me now?

617
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,192
A question I'm tired of getting.

618
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,905
One thing's for certain.

619
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,699
I'll be saving on the cost of salt.

620
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,352
Yes, Grandma?

621
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,980
Ka-young, you're not seeing
things again, are you?

622
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,108
You're taking your meds, right?
Every dose without missing any?

623
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,735
Yes, you see me take them every day. Why?

624
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,906
If you have any wishes, just tell me.
I'll make them all come true.

625
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,825
Wishes?

626
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,827
What is this in the notebook in your room?

627
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,788
Did you like Daniel Henney?

628
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,542
You can see that?

629
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,295
She can see that?

630
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:14,049
Wait, was it always visible
to everyone else's eyes?

631
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,676
You're seriously asking me that?

632
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,596
This damn magic has way too many holes.

633
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,140
This won't do.

634
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,018
We need a safe space
to hide the notebook and pen.

635
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:24,935
Your lamp.

636
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,105
Are you sure
only you and Sade can get in?

637
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,151
If they really wanted to,
Ejllael or Irem probably could.

638
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,485
But even you couldn't.

639
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,987
So it must be safe.

640
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,408
What does it look like inside the lamp?
Is it cozy?

641
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:42,995
It's dismal.

642
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,559
Do you see this?

643
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,772
Do you get a sense of how lonely
I must have been for 983 years?

644
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,815
Sorry, but I don't know
what loneliness is.

645
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,652
But you do know to be sorry?

646
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,779
Of course I don't.

647
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,407
But Min-ji told me that leading with that
makes me seem considerate.

648
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,328
And you know what considerate is?

649
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,788
Yes. That one's quite easy.

650
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:29,667
I just need to be honest.
For instance, it's something like this.

651
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,169
I heard it all from that brother of yours.

652
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:35,756
That you'll get your throat slit
if you bow your head to a righteous human.

653
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,633
Ejllael, that prick!

654
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,636
That was considerate? Not a threat?

655
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,513
Are you seriously not

656
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,682
scared of me?

657
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,767
To be honest, I don't know what fear is.

658
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,436
But Grandma did say
that apathy is the scariest.

659
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,899
My grandma is an incredibly fragile
safety feature to my apathy.

660
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,776
If that safety feature…

661
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,779
were to disappear,

662
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,573
there's a chance
my violence would take over,

663
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,075
so I'm making preparations.

664
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,910
But you'd know all that from spying on me.

665
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,080
"As natural a death as possible."

666
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,165
I do know, yes.

667
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:14,420
Like deep-sea equipment failure
or a fall on a remote trail.

668
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,800
But why do all that when you don't have
emotions or any affection for humans?

669
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,886
I am a stone in a shoe
to the people of the world.

670
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,723
I make people uncomfortable.

671
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,100
So I'm removing that stone for them.

672
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,728
For my grandma.

673
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,650
So if you're going to kill me, hurry.
And don't go getting your throat slit.

674
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,073
Ejllael?

675
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,744
The more I see that angel,
the less I like him.

676
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,956
-Whatever you do, don't lose to him.
-Wait, you're actually taking my side?

677
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,710
-Shouldn't I?
-You shouldn't. If you do, then…

678
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,211
You know?

679
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,588
I'm going to wring

680
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,340
your neck.

681
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,468
That would make things strange.

682
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,011
We're already strange.

683
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,014
You and I are both antisocial,

684
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,058
so why am I under scrutiny
while you're admired?

685
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,940
What exactly was his purpose
in making you and me meet?

686
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,153
That's it.

687
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,533
I should have been pondering that.

688
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,368
Not totally clueless.

689
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,040
Okay, we need furniture.

690
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,960
Bring over the table and chairs
I made in the workshop.

691
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,766
No matter which way I look at it,

692
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,726
I don't think you made these.

693
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,771
They seem to be made
by a giant corporation.

694
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:59,399
Don't talk back!
You now have two pieces of furniture.

695
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,071
It'd be nice to have another rug,
wouldn't it?

696
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,711
This way. Here.

697
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,009
Starting the cleaning cycle.

698
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,642
Why the hell is this…

699
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:37,604
Is this used to fix things
or to destroy them?

700
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,731
That all depends on you.

701
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,527
Hey!

702
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,782
Go that way, and you won't come back.
It'd take over 1,000 years.

703
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,242
That thing.

704
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,542
It's coming together.

705
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,794
Now I feel somewhat reassured.

706
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,049
About Ms. Im-seon.

707
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,554
She could have done whatever she wanted
beyond the supermarket,

708
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,974
so I wonder why
she didn't just leave the supermarket.

709
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,059
That's how humans are.

710
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:20,188
They dream of being king
but fear leaving their domain.

711
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,568
They've seen how kings rule by force,
and so they wish for the same.

712
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,654
That's the cowardly nature of humans

713
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,324
and the reason why I hate them.

714
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,503
He may not be clueless,
but he's also not big on enlightenment.

715
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,381
Humans hate you too.

716
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,676
So that's another use for that.

717
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:55,474
If I killed you on behalf of all humans,
would I go to heaven?

718
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,185
You think it would end at that?

719
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,729
He'd give you heaven if you asked.

720
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,689
Come here. Get over here.

721
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,735
Come here.

722
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:09,780
Get over here.

723
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,616
-I said come.
-I don't want to.

724
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,159
I LAUGH IN MY DREAMS, JOYFULLY

725
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,662
-Let's keep it humane and…
-But you're not human.

726
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,707
Where is that mumbling coming from?

727
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:27,339
I can hear sound coming from this.
Is it a radio?

728
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,175
Pan-geum!

729
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,469
Pan-geum, are you home?

730
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,887
Yes, I'm here!

731
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,100
Goodness, you came all this way
in the pouring rain?

732
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,192
I think she said…

733
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,654
it's raining.

734
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,867
It seems that way, doesn't it?

735
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,328
Do you have any alcohol here?

736
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,124
Should I buy some?

737
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,545
Wouldn't it be faster…

738
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,381
to go together?

739
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,011
Don't forget we need money to buy alcohol.

740
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,430
-This is all I need.
-You'll use that as collateral?

741
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:22,185
-My goodness. What shall we do?
-Grandma?

742
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,563
Grandma, why are you crying?

743
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,023
-Good heavens.
-What is it?

744
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,150
Why is she crying?

745
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,403
We just heard
that the craftsman, Mr. Kim, died.

746
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:34,573
You know, the man
who taught you how to carve wood.

747
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,325
Then why is my grandma crying?

748
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,786
She's crying because she's sad.

749
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,830
She's sad that her friend died.

750
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,665
This is exactly why, you know.

751
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,542
Why people call you a psycho.

752
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,460
Heung-rye!

753
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,377
What?

754
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:51,256
Goodness me!

755
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:57,262
Death makes life seem so futile.

756
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:02,642
It brings me to tears.

757
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,994
My goodness.

758
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,705
It's so tragic. I can't bear it.

759
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:27,000
How can you
cast the world aside like this?

760
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:32,172
Even so, they say he passed peacefully
as if drifting off to sleep.

761
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,965
Consider that a good death.

762
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,301
There's no such thing as a good death.

763
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,640
I guess you kids would have no idea,
with your entire lives ahead of you.

764
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:46,311
I'm not afraid of dying,

765
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,690
but if I think of my darling Ka-young…

766
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,446
What if my heart suddenly stops

767
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,574
or I have a stroke and collapse?

768
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:03,578
What if I get cancer and diabetes
and end up with dementia too?

769
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:08,458
Good heavens,
how would she ever take care of me?

770
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,419
Why would you think such silly thoughts?

771
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:16,466
At that moment, I realized that Grandma
must have read the same articles as me.

772
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,177
"An aging society is coming fast."

773
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,471
"Prepare yourself
for age-related illness."

774
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,807
"Medical Tomorrow."

775
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,518
I was going to die if Grandma died,

776
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,936
but Grandma actually wants

777
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,564
to live a long and healthy life.

778
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,233
So your point is?

779
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,571
I'll make my second wish.

780
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,244
Make my grandma young.

781
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:45,871
The same age as me.

782
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,667
This is my second wish.

783
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:27,050
