How dare you try to harm

Under your protection?

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,920
Zhang Xiyin is my wife.

When is she under your protection?

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,350
I'm here to investigate
Marquis Ding'an's marriage scam.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,840
Lady Yuewan and you should come with me.

Marriage scam?

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,630
We did not deceive anyone.

13
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,510
Whether it's a scam,

14
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,400
the Office will find out.

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,790

- Let go.

I'm a Feather Guard.

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,780
Are you going to resort to lynch?

That depends

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,310
on if you tell the truth.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,540
I want to know

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,650
why you set up a marriage scam.

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,960
I did not.

30
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,980
I didn't do that.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,640
I married her

32
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,450
because of the Empress's arrangement.

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,000
If you don't like Zhang Xiyin,

34
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,470
why would the Empress
grant this marriage?

35
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,760
Were you after something
from the Zhangs?

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680
Well.

37
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,360
You want to use torture for answers?

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
That's right.

39
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,080
What a tough Feather Guard.

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,130
You refuse to talk, huh?

41
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,000

the Zhous schemed

To repay heavy debts,

85
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,270
they sought marriage with the Zhangs

86
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,770
and deceived the Empress
to act as a matchmaker.

87
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,010
Therefore,

88
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,990

The divorce is now official.

90

The Zhous are ordered

91
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,860
to repay all expenses

92
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,800
advanced by the Zhangs within ten days.

In addition, Zhou Yihong and Li Yuewan
have shown poor conduct,

94

lacking in virtue and loyalty.

95
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,190
Thus, Zhou Yihong is removed
from his post as a Feather Guard,

96
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,250
his heir title is revoked,

97
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,960

In the past,

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,310
the wind in the capital only felt

111
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,800
like painful chains to me.

112
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,010
But now, take a breath.

113
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,360
(Jinglong Gate)
The wind carries flowers and rice,

114
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,670
and within it,

115
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,300
endless possibilities await.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,840
Indeed.

117
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
So,

118
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
what do you plan to do next?

119
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,050
I'll fulfill my duty
as an imperial merchant

120
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,560
and keep my family safe.

121
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,900
I'm asking

122
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,080
about your future marriage.

123

Your Highness,

124
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,740
so many things in this world

125
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,820
are beyond my control.

126
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,860
The Empress watches closely,

127
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,740
so right now isn't the time

128
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,020
to think about that.

129
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,500
Thank you

130
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,180
for your help lately.

131
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,460
Zhang Xiyin,

132
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,780
when it comes to you,

133
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,270
it's not help at all.

134
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Look at that.

135
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,640
That's a real man.

136
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,020
When his subordinate suffers,

137
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,660
the Prince senses it at once.

138
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,700
Xiyin, you've got a good superior.

139
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,850
But not every superior does this.

140
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,010
You need to return to the Palace.

141
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,750
Perhaps we should

142
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,190
visit you another day.

143
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,560
Stay for a meal before you go.

144
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,620
Well.

145
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,140
I will take my leave.

146
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,060
Wait a moment.

147
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,360
This Huohuan Cloth was sewn by me.

148
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,860
It's best for cleaning your sword.

149
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,600
Please accept it.

150
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,860
This is not all I desire.

151
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,260
Your Highness,

152
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,460
actually, I...

153
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,980
What is it?

154
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,920
Is there more you wish to say?

155
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,280
Once the Zhous fall,

156
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,920
the Empress will surely retaliate.

157
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,060
I wish to visit Tanping Town

158
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,160
to look into Li Yuewan's background.

159
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,140
By doing this,

160
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,500
you're forcing the Empress to act.

161
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,700
But waiting brings its own risks.

162
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,220
I'd like to take the initiative.

163
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,170
My Lord, My Lady.

164
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,500
They're heading to Tanping Town.

165
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,060
Did you see

166
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,700
Zhang Xiyin go to Tanping Town?

167
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,980
Yes, I saw them cross the river

168
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,180
and go toward Tanping Town.

169
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,140
Understood.

170
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,260
You may go.

171
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,620
Yes.

172
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,240
What should we do now?

173
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,320
Could it be Zhang Xiyin

174
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,680
has found something out?

175
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,580
That's impossible.

176
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,380
After we switched them that day,

177
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,180
I sent Yuewan

178
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,340
to Widow Li, a relative of mine.

179
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,460
We told everyone
she was her late husband's niece.

180
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,900
Hardly anyone knows about it.

181
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,260
Why panic?

182
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,940
Those who had to die back then are gone.

183
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,900
They've been gone for 18 years.

184
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,420
Even if they dig up their bones now,

185
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,840
what difference would it make?

186
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,900
It's punishable by death after all.

187
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,060
If anything gets uncovered,

188
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,140
Zhang Xiyin cannot be spared.

189
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,260
Tanping Town is full of refugees.

190
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,620
It's already unsettled.

191
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
If something happens...

192
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,380
Exactly.

193
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,940
She insists on going there.

194
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,650
If something unexpected

195
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,820
happens by chance,

196
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,440
it'll only be her fault.

197
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,380
(Tanping Town)

198
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,530
My Lady.

199
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
Why did we come here?

200
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,640
Because the secret

201
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,140
of Li Yuewan's origin is hidden here.

202
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,060
Weren't Zhou Yihong

203
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,080
and she childhood friends?

204
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,780
How could she live here then?

205
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,880
Mother,

206
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,780
I found something odd in the accounts.

207
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,440
What did you notice?

208
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,610
I noticed we send money

209
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,490
to Widow Li in Tanping Town every year.

210
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,500
Who exactly is Widow Li?

211
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,260
She's our distant relative.

212
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,620
Her husband passed away early.

213
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,860
I felt sympathy for her,

214
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,220
so we've been helping her.

215
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,220
But I noticed

216
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,460
no more money was sent

217
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,060
starting this year.

218
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,500
Why did that change?

219
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,260
She passed away,

220
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,820
so there's no need anymore.

221
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,740
When I managed the household affairs,

222
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,820
the mansion's accounts were messy,

223
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,820
but every sum could be traced back,

224
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,020
except for Widow Li's accounts.

225
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,820
Those were truly suspicious.

226
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,780
That makes sense.

227
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,180
The Zhous aren't like kind benefactors.

228
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,360
Comparing Li Yuewan's age

229
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,990
with the accounts,

230
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,700
I found the money to Widow Li

231
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,100
started from that very year.

232
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,740
My Lady, do you mean

233
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,060
Widow Li took in Li Yuewan?

234
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,180
Exactly.

235
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,140
If we uncover Li Yuewan's past,

236
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,820
we'll have proof
the Empress switched her child.

237
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,900
