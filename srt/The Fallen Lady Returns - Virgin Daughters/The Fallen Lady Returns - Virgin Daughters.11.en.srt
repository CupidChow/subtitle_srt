=The Fallen Lady Returns=

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,500
(Tanping Town)

4
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,790
Is anyone there?

5
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,870
Yuewan, is that you?

6
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,640
Are you friends of Yuewan?

7
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,200
Yes, we're close friends of hers.

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,920
She's busy and couldn't come,

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,150
so she asked us to visit you

10
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,430
with some food.

11
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,120
Yuewan says she's doing well lately,

12
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,000
so you needn't worry about her.

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,350
Alright.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,680
Why don't you both stay here tonight?

15
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,840
Come in then.

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,560
Follow me.

17
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,480
Please, have a seat.

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,040
I'll pour you some water.

19
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,640
My Lady.

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
Widow Li is truly pitiable.

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,790
Just now, I went to her kitchen.

22
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,310
There wasn't a single grain left.

23
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,480
The food on the stove

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,560
was just dirt mixed with twigs.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,310
Is this how the Zhous treat her?

26
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,710
The Zhous have shown mercy
keeping her alive.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,680
Should we still ask her for help?

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,120
Even if we don't seek her out,

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,470
the Zhous will come for her
sooner or later.

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,310
Send someone to write a family letter

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,960
and arrange for someone
to care for her properly.

32
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,920
Alright.

33
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,560
My Lady! My Lady!

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,310
My Lady, what's wrong?

35
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,150
My Lady!

36
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,910
My Lady, hold on!

37
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,120
My Lady!

38
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,567
Help!

39
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:46,231
Help!

40
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,840
Zhang Xiyin is finally dead.

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,710
All of her property

42
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,120
belongs to us now.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
We're finally rich.

44
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,360
This lady is truly wealthy.

45
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,710
Even the dowry she brought along

46
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,310
is full of rare treasures.

47
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,560
Xiyin.

48
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,850
(Spirit Tablet of Lady Zhang, Late Wife)
How unlucky.

49
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,190
What a surprise

50
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,150
that we killed

51
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,960
Zhang Xiyin so soon.

52
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,080
Yihong.

53
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,470
You played a big part in this.

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,360
You taught me well.

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,560
Decisive and bold.

56
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,430
That's the spirit of Zhou men.

57
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,980
(Spirit Tablet of Lady Zhang, Late Wife)

58
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,240
My Lord.

59
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,400
Zhang Xiyin.

60
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,080
Why are you here?

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,680
This is my home.

62
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,560
I'm just coming home.

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,080
Don't you welcome me?

64
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,170
Or are you disappointed

65
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,130
that I survived

66
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,050
your scheme?

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,480
Who said I wanted you dead?

68
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,360
Aren't you standing here?

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,710
Don't accuse me without proof.

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,000
This arrow

71
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,360
is the proof.

72
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,960
Xiyin, what are you saying?

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
Just one arrow

74
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,750
is not enough for evidence.

75
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,560
This arrow

76
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,830
was part of my dowry back then.

77
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,160
It was never sharpened.

78
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,750
What do you mean?

79
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,190
I went to Tanping Town today

80
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,680
to test you.

81
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,560
As expected, you acted out of fear
that the truth would be revealed.

82
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,630
Impossible.

83
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,310
I saw you fall with my own eyes.

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,750
How could this be?

85
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,040
Instead of asking me,

86
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,120
why not ask yourselves

87
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,720
how things ended up like this?

88
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,920
Is this all

89
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,070
part of your plan?

90
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
Xiyin,

91
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
I made a momentary lapse.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I was wrong.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,070
Let's start over,

94
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,910
okay?

95
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll dismiss Li Yuewan right now.

96
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,240
Let's begin anew, shall we?

97
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,390
What did you just say?

98
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,240
Shut up.

99
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,120
Let's start over,

100
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,230
okay?

101
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,000
I won't take your life.

102
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,920
I knew you wouldn't.

103
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
I knew it.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,360
I'll make sure

105
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,920
you suffer worse than death.

106
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,350
Yihong.

107
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,480
The Zhous are accused
of trying to kill Zhang Xiyin,

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,360
a countess.

109
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,840
Their crime warrants death.

110
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,850
For the sake of your ancestors' feats,

111
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,290
all of you shall be arrested

112
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,720
for a disgraceful parade

113
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,160
and then imprisoned.

114
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,560
You vicious woman.

115
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,190
Look what you've done to our family.

116
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,360
You'll never find peace.

117
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,380
(Prisoner)

118
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,390
Everyone,

119
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,310
I came to see you off
to the Imperial Prison.

120
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,630
Zhang Xiyin.

121
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,930
Have you made enough trouble yet?

122
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,480
I even prepared a gift for you all.

123
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,920
The Zhous brought this upon themselves

124
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,680
by coveting Lady Xiyin's wealth.

125
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,310
Great.

126
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,510
Zhang Xiyin.

127
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,480
Look what you've done to us.

128
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,190
What more do you want?

129
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,240
Li Yuewan.

130
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,040
I bought the mansion from you

131
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,750
for 200,000 guan.

132
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,080
Now I've sold it

133
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,430
for 600,000 guan.

134
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,270
I want one, too.

135
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,430
This one's mine.

136
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,000
It's mine.

137
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,390
There are so many.

138
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,040
Don't try to snatch it from me.

139
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,750
I don't care for everything

140
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,120
you schemed so hard to get.

141
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,270
Zhang Xiyin,

142
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,120
since you don't care for it,

143
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,120
why force us to repay?

144
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,510
The Zhangs' wealth

145
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,360
comes from the people

146
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,470
and is used for the people.

147
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
That's our family's foundation.

148
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,560
I ask you to return the money

149
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,630
for the sake of justice.

150
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,630
This is only right.

151
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,430
How dare you bring it up?

152
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
You...

153
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,270
Everyone,

154
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,630
please join me

155
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,480
and send them to the Imperial Prison.

156
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,740
To the Imperial Prison!

157
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,200
Lock them in the Imperial Prison!

158
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,020
This is their retribution.

159
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,390
To the Imperial Prison!

160
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,860
- Get lost!
- Leave now!

161
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,830
Get out of here.

162
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,230
Hurry to the Imperial Prison.

163
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,210
This is your retribution.

164
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,300
You deserve this.

165
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,090
- Vicious!
- Get out!

166
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,120
- Out!
- Leave!

167
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,200
How is it?

168
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,790
Your Majesty.

169
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,000
All the Zhous are imprisoned

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,270
under Prince Ji's watch.

171
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,950
Duan Jianli and Zhang Xiyin
are heading to the mansion.

172
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,300
(Sealed)

173
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,960
(I found nothing solid
at Widow Li's place.)

174
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,080
(I can only)

175
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,720
(search the mansion for clues.)

176
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,720
We've searched the whole mansion.

177
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,840
This is the last room.

178
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,550
Chen lived here.

179
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,870
Let's search carefully again.

180
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,600
Maybe we'll find something.

181
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,040
Don't move.

182
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,200
Put down the knife.

183
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,220
The Empress sent you, right?

184
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,670
Where are you taking her?

185
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Xiliang.

186
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,150
Take me with you.

187
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,390
Your Majesty.

188
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,960
The assassination failed.

189
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,550
His Majesty just sent word.

190
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,120
He requests you in the Imperial Study.

191
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,500
(Jinglong Gate)

192
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,350
Jianli,

193
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,910
why did you gather

194
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,080
everyone here?

195
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,240
Brother,

196
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,870
I must tell you that the Empress

197
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,200
schemed for power,

198
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,060
switched your child,

199
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,790
and committed adultery.

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,910
What?

201
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,480
Nineteen years ago,

202
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,840
the Empress
didn't give birth to a Prince

203
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,390
but to a Princess instead.

204
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,150
This girl

205
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,550
is Li Yuewan.

206
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,670
Absurd.

207
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,520
How could my child be her?

208
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,720
Uncle,

209
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,360
do you have any proof

210
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,670
for that?

211
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,640
Marquis Ding'an left this

212
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,270
