00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:42,020
=The Fallen Lady Returns=

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,800
Your Highness,

4
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
among the candidates,

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,640
half are loyal to the First Prince.

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,500
It might be hard for Ms. Zhang to win.

7
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,150
She won't lose.

8
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,850
The imperial merchant selection of Dayu

9
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,440
officially begins.

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,560
This selection has three stages.

11
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,840
Only those who pass each round

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,640
can proceed to the next stage.

13
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,710
In the end, one imperial merchant

14
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,000
will be in charge of all purchases
for the Department.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,860
(Zhang Xiyin)

16
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,040
The first challenge

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,150
tests everyone's knowledge of money.

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,590
You may judge
how much money the item weighs

19
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,560
by its weight

20
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,840
and then place the item and money
on the scales.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,710
If the balance tips,

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,020
that means you've failed.

23
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,490
Impressive.

24
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,400
Truly impressive.

25
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,980
(Guo Dongsheng)

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,240
Well done.

27
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,700
That's impressive.

28
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,310
Xiyin, well done.

29
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,630
Have someone check
the items for Round Two.

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,360
We can't let anyone know the tests
ahead of time.

31
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,680
Your Highness, don't worry.

32
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,080
His Majesty has ordered me

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,190
to swap out all the items
for Round Two today.

34
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,890
What?

35
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,630
These were prepared last minute.

36
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,150
No one will know.

37
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,520
Father truly foresees everything,

38
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,240
even details like this.

39
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,870
Now, Round Two

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,250
will test everyone's knowledge

41
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,840
of all goods for sale.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,910
You just need to estimate the value

43
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,120
and write your price on the paper.

44
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,190
The closest price
moves on to the next round.

45
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,150
Everything is ready.

46
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,190
Show your answers.

47
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,220
(400 guan)

48
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,420
(400 guan)

49
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,590
The lady did so well.

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,780
It was spot on.

51
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,240
Please write the price per chi

52
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,560
of this cloth.

53
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,150
Show your answers.

54
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,540
(400 guan)

55
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,260
(Qi Lu)

56
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,720
What is this thing?

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,240
I've traded for decades,

58
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,800
yet I've never seen such a thing.

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,040
It's even split in two.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,120
Xiyin should know this.

61
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,920
It looks like the Lugong Lock.

62
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,270
The Lugong Lock?

63
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,430
How could the value

64
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,920
of such a simple thing be evaluated?

65
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,430
Show your answer.

66
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,140
(7 qian)

67
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,000
Show the price.

68
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,100
(7 qian)

69
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,390
It's exactly the same.

70
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,120
How does she know it all?

71
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,800
She recognizes things unseen.

72
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,160
She truly is remarkable.

73
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,630
This is the Lugong Lock.

74
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
It's a toy for common folks.

75
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,070
Isn't this
the imperial merchant selection?

76
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Why are there common goods here?

77
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,920
There's no true ranking of things.

78
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,510
The value lies in how they're used.

79
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,830
This assessment

80
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,830
is not just about knowing prices

81
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,240
but also about understanding the goods.

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,800
Yes, well said.

83
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,070
Many believe all things

84
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,390
used by the imperial family
are priceless.

85
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,510
Yet, the more valuable an item,

86
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,920
the easier it is to lose it.

87
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,800
The Lugong Lock

88
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,360
was once used in the former dynasty
to hide the Imperial Seal.

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Later, after some changes,

90
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,720
it was used all around the Palace.

91
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,510
Now comes the final test.

92
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,720
Each year, the imperial merchant
delivers goods to the Palace,

93
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,390
so this round is about transport.

94
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,870
Right now, outside the Palace gates,

95
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,510
we've prepared three batches of goods.

96
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,560
You may assign your teams as you wish.

97
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,600
Whoever delivers these goods here

98
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,040
within two incense sticks of time

99
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,070
wins.

100
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,800
There isn't enough time.

101
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,660
(Jinglong Gate)

102
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,070
These are the goods you must deliver.

103
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,830
Thank you.

104
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
Try your best.

105
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,310
My Lady, isn't this test easy?

106
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,920
We just need to drive fast.

107
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,430
We aren't far from the finish.

108
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,900
We'll make it right on time.

109
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,780
When things look easy,

110
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,080
they're often the hardest.

111
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,980
Seems this delivery won't be simple.

112
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,940
Let me see the map of the capital.

113
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,180
Here it is.

114
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,020
There are four ways to the capital.

115
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,260
Tianshui Lane is the shortest route,

116
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,100
but it's crowded,

117
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,300
and accidents may happen.

118
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,780
The eastern road is under repair.

119
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,900
It's hard to get through.

120
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,700
The west side shelters many drifters,

121
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,100
and many trade caravans pass by.

122
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,440
Most have been robbed on the way.

123
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,940
But the southern road is the farthest.

124
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,100
It's remote and desolate.

125
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,200
Hardly anyone travels there.

126
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,020
It'd mean circling farther.

127
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,460
We'd be too late to make it.

128
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,740
The other two shopkeepers

129
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,700
will likely choose Tianshui Lane.

130
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,860
What about us?

131
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,780
We're taking

132
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,580
Tianshui Lane.

133
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,780
Make sure everything's packed.

134
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,900
Is this how you deliver my goods?

135
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,180
It was all robbed.

136
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,540
Look at the mess you've made.

137
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,660
This one here.

138
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,820
Hurry up!

139
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,980
Put it away properly.

140
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,540
And this too.

141
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,740
Hurry up; move faster.

142
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,540
Your efficiency makes me so anxious.

143
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,220
You always delay things.

144
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,780
Do you know how much this affects me?

145
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,980
Hurry up.

146
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,260
I'm so mad.

147
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,540
Hurry up.

148
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,660
I have to do it myself.

149
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,340
What are you trying to do?

150
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,580
You can't take it.

151
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,470
My Lady.

152
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,500
You can't take it.

153
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
- Put it down.
- Stop.

154
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,340
What are you doing?

155
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,900
Put that down.

156
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,980
You can't take it.

157
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,540
- Don't take it.
- Stop it.

158
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Come back here.

159
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,980
Give the things back.

160
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,820
My Lady, all the goods were taken.

161
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,660
What should we do?

162
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,480
No need to worry.
The task isn't done yet.

163
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,820
Place the chest back.

164
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,060
Let's keep moving.

165
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,500
Alright.

166
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,580
Come on.

167
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,660
Wow.

168
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,100
What a surprise.

169
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,820
Truly unexpected.

170
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,900
That's impressive.

171
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,220
There were two chests in total.

172
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,940
Now only one and a half remain.

173
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,340
Please rest for a while.

174
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,780
Once everyone arrives,

175
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,780
I'll announce the result.

176
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,140
I heard the other shopkeeper's carriage
overturned.

177
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,640
They probably can't make it.

178
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,220
How did the carriage overturn
for no reason?

179
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,820
It's the imperial merchant selection.

180
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,260
Do you really think it's so simple?

181
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,260
There are countless obstacles
on the road.

182
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,940
Zhang Xiyin still hasn't arrived.

183
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,940
She must have lost.

184
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,140
Tch. That's bad luck.

185
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,940
My sister would never lose.

186
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,320
Right?

187
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,780
If she's that capable, she'd be here.

188
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,700
If she lost the goods to drifters, fine.

189
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,940
Let's hope she's still alive.

190
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,980
Another one's coming.

191
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,740
Here they are.

192
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,500
No idea how they're doing.

193
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,820
There's nothing left.

194
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,300
Nothing left?

195
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,980
There are no goods?

196
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,500
Eunuch Fang.

197
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,860
Who said my goods are gone?

198
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,100
Eunuch.

199
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,340
My goods have arrived.

200
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,700
What's going on?

201
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,820
What's happening?

202
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,060
That's a lot.

203
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,220
Eunuch, all is here.

204
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,360
Not a single item is missing.

205
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,700
- Good.
- Impressive.

206
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,660
Well done.

207
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,700
Very good.

208
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,740
This...

209
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,100
What's happened?

210
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,020
Eunuch.

211
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,100
Earlier, I pretended
to take Tianshui Lane

212
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,020
and got ambushed.

213
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Your Highness,

214
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,020
please send the goods south
to the destination.

215
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,340
Chishu.

216
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,500
Good.

217
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,820
Brilliant.

218
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,540
You avoided being intercepted
on the road

219
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,260
and succeeded in delivering the goods

220
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,660
by hiding your true intentions.

221
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,140
Ms. Zhang, you are clever.

222
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,620
Thank you, Eunuch.

223
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,700
For Round Three,

224
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,420
Zhang Xiyin from the Zhang Clan

225
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,140
was the only one to deliver

226
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,900
all the goods with no mishap.

227
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,500
So, in this selection,

228
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,540
she stands as the sole winner.

229
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,460
We won.

230
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,820
We did it! We won!

231
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,980
Good.

232
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,060
That's wonderful.

233
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,210
- Good.
- Good.

234
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,540
- Good.
- Good.
