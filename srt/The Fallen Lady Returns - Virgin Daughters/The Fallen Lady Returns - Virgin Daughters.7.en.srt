00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:42,020
=The Fallen Lady Returns=

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,110
(Jinglong Gate)

4
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,240
His Majesty is here.

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,200
Today is the family banquet.

6
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,130
Everyone, there's no need for formality.

7
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,600
Please be seated.

8
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,000
Marquis Ding'an's heir is here as well.

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

10
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,870
Speaking of which,

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,480
I arranged

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,200
both of his marriages.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,350
However,

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,870
I've yet to meet your wives.

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,150
Are they both here today?

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,600
Your Majesty,

17
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,070
they are here.

18
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,710
Greetings, Your Majesties.

19
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,760
I am

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,840
Li Yuewan.

21
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,550
Good.

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
How graceful.

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,870
You deserve to be a wife.

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,510
Why are you here alone?

25
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,560
Where is Zhang?

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,480
Before Xiyin left home,

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,810
she received word from her family

28
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,870
and was called back for a business deal.

29
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,560
She likely won't make it.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,230
This is an imperial banquet.

31
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,280
If she doesn't attend,

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,680
isn't that offending His Majesty?

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,480
Your Majesty, please don't be upset.

34
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,310
Xiyin comes from a merchant family,

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,120
where wealth comes before all else.

36
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,840
We cannot persuade her otherwise.

37
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,190
Greetings,

38
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,430
Your Majesties.

39
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,470
I am Zhang Xiyin.

40
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,030
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,470
to prepare a gift for you,

42
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,520
I arrived late.

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,710
Please forgive me.

44
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,750
What gift have you brought me?

45
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,380
(The most divine emperor
who rules with benevolence)

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,520
You arrived so late

47
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,870
and brought such an unimpressive thing

48
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,000
to show His Majesty

49
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,240
and Her Majesty?

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,310
The calligraphy on this scroll
wobbles and leans.

51
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,150
(Benevolence)
It seems written by many hands.

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,280
Countess,

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,470
can you explain it?

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
The Princess is truly discerning.

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
These words of blessing on the scroll

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,520
were crafted by the commoners.

57
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,630
The people thank your kindness

58
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,680
and are grateful
for such a wise sovereign.

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,150
Only then can our people live in peace.

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,310
The people painted with care

61
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,960
and asked me to bring this to you.

62
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,710
The commoners understand your will,

63
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,520
and your heart rests at ease.

64
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,590
Brother,

65
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,120
this is the fortune of the nation

66
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
and the people.

67
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,670
Dayu stands secure.

68
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,840
His Majesty is wise and just.

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,310
Long live His Majesty.

70
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,430
Long live His Majesty.

71
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,270
Very good.

72
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,500
(Jinglong Gate)

73
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,000
Countess,

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,520
the Empress ordered you

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,310
to go to Qiankun Palace.

76
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,840
Please lead the way.

77
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,030
Xiyin,

78
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,920
you're here.

79
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,190
Greetings, Your Majesty.

80
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,030
Rise.

81
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,190
I vouched for your marriage.

82
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,870
Yet I've never asked you

83
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,280
how have you been after you got married.

84
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Your Majesty,

85
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,870
marriage cannot be forced upon anyone.

86
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,070
The heir cares only for Lady Yuewan,

87
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,520
and I also must honor

88
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,410
the Zhangs' monogamy code.

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,830
Have you suffered a grievance,

90
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,680
or is there discontent?

91
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,390
Since you've asked me,

92
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,100
please allow me

93
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,920
to beg you

94
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,720
for a Letter of Divorce.

95
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,670
How dare you!

96
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,160
I vouched for your marriage.

97
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,830
If you insist on this,

98
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,680
you set yourself against me.

99
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,260
As the Empress,

100
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,460
you ought to understand

101
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,340
a forced marriage brings no joy.

102
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,180
You refused to grant my divorce.

103
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,860
Is it because of Lady Yuewan?

104
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,100
Or perhaps,

105
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,500
you have another intention?

106
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,540
I only act for your good.

107
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,220
This marriage

108
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,380
is good for both

109
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,820
of your families,

110
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,060
especially for the Zhangs.

111
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,380
Enough.

112
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,580
Leave now.

113
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,740
I'll take my leave.

114
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,690
My Lady.

115
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,360
My Lady.

116
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,380
Princess Jinyang wishes
to speak with you.

117
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,890
Please lead the way.

118
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,780
Yes.

119
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,060
The one seeking me
isn't Princess Jinyang.

120
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,220
Who asked you to bring me here?

121
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,940
Chase.

122
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,140
Take her alive.

123
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,340
Yes.

124
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,260
(Jinglong Gate)

125
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,100
What?

126
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,970
An assassin?

127
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,620
What exactly happened?

128
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,980
Your Majesty.

129
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,740
I had just left the Empress's chamber

130
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,660
when a maid

131
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,740
told me Princess Jinyang needed me.

132
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,580
I was then led

133
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,860
to a quiet, empty place.

134
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,540
Had Prince Ji not arrived in time,

135
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,580
I'm afraid I would have...

136
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,940
It's my first time to enter the Palace.

137
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,820
I do not know whom I've offended

138
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,100
to make them wish me dead.

139
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,900
Zhang Xiyin is not only
an imperial merchant

140
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,660
but a countess.

141
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,340
By doing this,

142
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,260
the culprit is ignoring

143
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,100
the law of Dayu.

144
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,540
Your Majesty,

145
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,460
I never summoned the Countess.

146
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,540
They used my name to stage an attack.

147
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,740
Surely, there's another motive.

148
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,100
Seal the gates at once.

149
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,500
No one is to enter or leave.

150
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,980
- Yes.
- Jianli.

151
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,020
Take your men and investigate.

152
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,860
Yes.

153
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,140
Your Majesty,

154
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,740
she has poisoned herself to death.

155
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,220
Countess, please look.

156
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,380
Is she the one?

157
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,380
Your Majesty,

158
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,740
it is indeed her.

159
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,260
Which palace did she serve?

160
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,100
We have just checked.

161
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,780
She's not on the registry.

162
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,540
If we wish to trace her origins,

163
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,580
I'm afraid it will be hard.

164
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,940
Find out

165
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,080
who's behind her.

166
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,960
Yes.

167
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,800
Your Majesty,

168
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,860
when she tried to harm me,

169
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,460
she dropped this.

170
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,160
I don't know if it will be useful.

171
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,260
Isn't this a hibiscus leaf?

172
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,220
The hibiscus is a tribute from Nanjiang.

173
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,340
Within the Palace,

174
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,020
only the Empress has it.

175
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,140
Jinyang.

176
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,900
Are you suggesting

177
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,100
I want to harm the Countess?

178
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,460
She carried leaves from your palace.

179
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,140
Even if you didn't do this,

180
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,020
it resulted from a lapse in your care.

181
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,220
I admit my mistake.

182
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,940
And the Feather Guards.

183
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,220
The Feather Guards failed their duty.

184
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,340
All on duty

185
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,900
shall each receive 20 strokes.

186
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,300
Your Majesty,

187
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,580
General Zhou handled affairs
outside the Palace,

188
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,420
but this maid served within.

189
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,140
General Zhou is truly blameless.

190
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,260
How dare you

191
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,700
interrupt His Majesty?

192
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,700
I nearly forgot

193
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,620
he is your husband.

194
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,620
Countess, are you pleading for him too?

195
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,580
No.

196
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,820
Both the nation

197
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,400
and the family should play by its rules.

198
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,180
If General Zhou has erred,

199
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,140
he must accept his punishment.

200
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,300
The Zhangs are known for kindness.

201
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,260
Families as wealthy and kind as this

202
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,900
draw the eyes

203
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,940
of many greedy folks.

204
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,820
I suppose

205
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,780
they'd need powerful support.

206
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,180
I wonder

207
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,500
if I can meet the requirements.

208
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,740
Is that something Prince Ji would say?

209
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,100
Didn't he always
steer clear of politics?

210
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,620
Maybe we misheard him.

211
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,300
Your Highness,

212
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,900
you...

213
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,700
They say merchants rank last.

214
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
Merchants,

215
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,620
compared to farmers and officials,

216
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,460
are often overlooked.

217
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,110
But in Dayu,

218
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,140
merchants

219
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,380
are just as vital.

220
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,780
I don't want

221
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,340
such loyal souls to be overlooked.

222
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,060
So,

223
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,700
I made this decision.

224
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,620
Countess,

225
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,420
would you be willing

226
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,540
to serve as my advisor?

227
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,020
This is a good opportunity.

228
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,140
Countess, what are you waiting for?

229
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,460
You'll surely benefit

230
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,380
from being Jianli's advisor.

231
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,780
Honored by your trust,

232
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,260
I'm willing to serve you

233
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,940
with everything I have.
