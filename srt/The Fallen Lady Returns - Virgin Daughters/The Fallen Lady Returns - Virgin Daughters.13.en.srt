=The Fallen Lady Returns=

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,440
My Lady.

4
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,670
Careful, My Lady.

5
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,950
What happened?

6
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,350
Your Highness.

7
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,240
The lady...

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,760
Your Highness.

9
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,070
I had a drink with friends today,

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,620
and it's too late to go home

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,070
because my family might fret.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
May I stay here for the night?

13
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,670
Chishu.

14
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,930
Go prepare some sobering soup.

15
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,790
Yes.

16
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,430
Didn't you just drink with friends?

17
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,310
How did you end up like this?

18
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,510
I can't handle much wine.

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,680
We had too much fun drinking.

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,520
I took a tumble.

21
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,900
Where were you hurt?

22
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,830
Does it hurt?

23
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,910
What's wrong?

24
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,710
It hurts.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,640
It's that stumbling block's fault.

26
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,000
What block tripped you?

27
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,280
I'll smash it tomorrow.

28
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,070
No need.

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,950
I'll move it myself.

30
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,150
I never want to see her again.

31
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,990
Alright.

32
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,400
We'll move it away.

33
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,430
Your Highness.

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,120
What are you doing so late?

35
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,910
This afternoon,

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,910
your wife had drinks with my advisor.

37
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
The courtesy should be returned.

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,150
Shouldn't I drink with you too?

39
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,390
What do you want?

40
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,030
Honey.

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,750
Please, no more. Stop now.

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,640
Please, no more.

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Stop now.

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
Your Highness.

45
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,750
Your Highness.

46
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,590
I was wrong.

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,430
Please, spare my husband.

48
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,400
I won't dare again.

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,560
I was wrong.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,590
Honey, honey.

51
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,150
Honey.

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,190
This is the first time.

53
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,630
- And the last time.
- Honey.

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,910
Let's go. Next house.

55
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,750
Yes.

56
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

57
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,310
I heard you like orchids,

58
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,710
so I made this dress for you.

59
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,800
It smells wonderful.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,560
The dress holds the orchid scent inside.

61
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,190
Once you wear this dress,

62
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,000
your scent will linger wherever you go.

63
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,630
Lady Zhang, how thoughtful of you.

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,400
I truly like this dress.

65
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,590
Glad you like it.

66
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,600
Has the matter

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
with the drinks

68
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,120
been settled?

69
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,790
Yeah.

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
Please rest assured.

71
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,950
We have a new wine supplier now.

72
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,230
Good.

73
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,390
Hold on.

74
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,750
This dress is quite nice.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,310
Though not as fine
as my custom-made ones,

76
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,480
it still suits me.

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
I will take this.

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,560
Ah!

79
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,390
Yongjia,

80
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,800
Lady Zhang has gifted it to me.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,840
So what?

82
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,390
Since I want it,

83
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,600
it'll be mine.

84
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't you have one already?

85
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,390
I just like this one now.

86
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,950
I'll let you have mine later.

87
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,830
No.

88
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,830
I want the one I have.

89
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,670
Your Highness,

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
I made this especially
for Princess Yongning.

91
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,870
If you like it,

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,950
I can make another one for you.

93
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,820
Silence.

94
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,390
It's not your place to speak here.

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,870
I've never failed

96
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,360
to get what I want.

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Let go.

98
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,760
No.

99
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,960
Give it to me.

100
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,110
Ah!

101
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,790
Oh, no.

102
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,880
The Princess has fallen.

103
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,910
Servants!

104
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,370
Help!

105
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you alright?

106
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,480
What happened here?

107
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,350
Father,

108
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,070
Yongjia wanted my dress.

109
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,510
I refused to give it to her,

110
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,160
so she pushed me down.

111
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,170
I did not.

112
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,320
She fell on her own.

113
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,450
If you hadn't pushed me,

114
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,720
how could I have fallen?

115
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,810
Outrageous!

116
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,000
How could you push

117
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,190
your sister over a dress?

118
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,800
Father,

119
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,790
it wasn't me.

120
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,780
It was her.

121
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
She did this.

122
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,190
What does this have to do with her?

123
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,750
Zhang Xiyin favored Yongning

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,510
and sent a better dress to her.

125
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,670
Your Highness.

126
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,040
Each dress I sent
to the imperial members

127
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,510
catered to their tastes.

128
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,270
I wasn't showing favoritism.

129
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,160
Yongjia.

130
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,440
I meant to wear this dress

131
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,140
for Father's longevity banquet.

132
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,270
Since we were little,

133
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,720
you always took my things.

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
I never made a fuss.

135
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,220
But

136
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,120
can't you let me have it this time?

137
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,000
Shut up.

138
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,480
How can you compete with me?

139
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,870
My mother is a Noble Consort.

140
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,160
You're the one who should shut up.

141
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,830
You are both my kids.

142
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,920
There's no difference in status.

143
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,710
How can you hurt your sister

144
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,680
over a dress?

145
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,040
Apologize to her.

146
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,580
Apologize?

147
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
What have I done wrong?

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
It's Zhang Xiyin's fault.

149
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,390
Father, you must stand up for me.

150
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,630
Why would she

151
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,600
want to harm you?

152
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,390
She just wants to get back at me.

153
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,200
Your Highness,

154
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,400
I don't know

155
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,190
why I'd want to get back at you.

156
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,800
You know perfectly well.

157
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,390
I don't know.

158
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,560
It's because I made you drink that day.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,720
What's that about?

160
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,360
I dare not

161
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,390
speak.

162
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,740
What are you afraid of?

163
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,160
I will stand by you.

164
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,590
Speak up.

165
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,310
That day, Lady Zhang brought wine here,

166
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,120
but Yongjia stopped her midway

167
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,230
and gave her a hard time.

168
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,510
She even forced someone

169
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,950
to make her drink the wine.

170
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,830
She made a mistake,

171
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,100
so she should be punished.

172
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
Outrageous!

173
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,920
She is the imperial merchant I chose.

174
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,560
Since when do you command
the Imperial Household Department?

175
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,430
I wouldn't dare.

176
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,750
You wouldn't dare?

177
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,510
I don't think so.

178
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,120
As a Princess,

179
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,560
you're narrow-minded.

180
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,710
You even harmed your sister.

181
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,560
I've spoiled you far too much.

182
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,240
That's why you've grown so unruly.

183
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,680
Guards.

184
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Yes.

185
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,460
Expel Princess Yongjia from the Palace.

186
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,760
Send her back to her fief.

187
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,390
She may not enter the capital

188
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,430
without a decree.

189
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
No, Father.

190
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,070
Please don't make me leave.

191
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,390
I don't want to return to my fief.

192
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,430
Sorry. Please don't send me away.

193
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,950
I know I was wrong, Father.

194
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,980
It was her.

195
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,480
It was Zhang Xiyin's fault.

196
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,510
Father, I truly repent.

197
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,310
Father.

198
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,430
My Lady, you were amazing today.

199
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,600
Princess Yongjia
has always been domineering.

200
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,660
I've heard many in the Palace
fear her temper.

201
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,510
Now, she has to go back to her fief.

202
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,800
That's a relief for everyone.

203
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,030
But, My Lady,

204
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,380
how did you know

205
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,440
she'd try to steal
Princess Yongning's dress?

206
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,750
Are you sure
this will send Yongjia away?

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,150
With your help,

208
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,390
it will work for sure.

209
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,550
Without her, you'll be the only Princess
in the Palace

210
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,630
and free from her bad temper.

211
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Alright.

212
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,510
I'll do as you say.

213
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,440
She brought it

214
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,320
upon herself.

215
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,960
That's true.

216
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,630
Your Highness.

217
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,480
I've asked for leave

218
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,000
from His Majesty for you.

219
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,630
Stay at my place these days.

220
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,360
Why didn't you tell me

221
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,550
about Yongjia?

222
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,920
It's just a small matter.

223
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,320
I can handle it myself.

224
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,200
Nothing about you is small to me.

225
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,200
Why did you come

226
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,080
and find me today?

227
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,860
With this token,

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,340
you can summon my Shadow Guards.

229
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,750
It stands for me

230
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,870
to everyone.

231
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,750
In the entire Dayu,

232
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,560
you needn't fear anyone.

233
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,080
Your Highness,

234
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,470
you're so kind to your subordinates.

235
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,580
Do you think

236
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,160
that's the only reason
that I treat you well?

237
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,270
Of course not.

238
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I'm not made of stone.

239
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,080
Your feelings for me are true.

240
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,480
How could I not know that?

241
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,510
Then let me ask you, Xiyin.

242
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,630
When will you answer my feelings?

243
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,000
When all troubles are settled,

244
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
the wicked are punished,

245
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,000
and everything returns to order.

246
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,540
Alright.

247
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,240
I'll wait.

248
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,670
Seize Zhang Xiyin.

249
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,720
Duan Xuanming.

250
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,500
How dare you break into my mansion?

251
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,510
Uncle.

252
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,960
As the imperial merchant,

253
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,270
Zhang Xiyin failed
to inspect goods for the Palace.

254
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,540
Last night, Concubine Su

255
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,150
coughed blood and fainted

256
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,360
because of her Poria Cake.

257
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,750
Luckily, the imperial physician
arrived in time

258
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,960
and managed to save her life.

259
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,610
I'm here by imperial order to take her.

260
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,000
Uncle,

261
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,850
please don't stand in my way.

262
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,270
Every palace has Poria Cake.

263
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,960
Why did only Concubine Su fall ill?

264
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,550
The imperial physician has checked.

265
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,440
Concubine Su became ill

266
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,510
because she ate her Poria Cake.

267
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,000
I only delivered the Poria Cake
to the Department.

268
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,670
Many hands passed it on to each palace.

269
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,240
Yet you insist

270
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,550
that I plotted to harm her.

271
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,320
This feels like a setup.

272
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,360
How dare you!

273
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,150
I am the First Prince.

274
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,480
Why would I frame
a mere merchant like you?

275
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,670
If that's the case,

276
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,440
she just needs to help
with the inquiry at most.

277
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,600
But the way you act

278
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,390
is as if you want to kill her.

279
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,750
Your Highness,

280
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,390
I am willing to cooperate
with the inquiry.
