=The Fallen Lady Returns=

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,190
Living apart?

4
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,030
My engagement to the heir

5
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,400
was granted by the Empress.

6
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,880
On our wedding night,
he was sent to the borderlands.

7
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,800
There was never any true bond
between us.

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
I understand

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,280
feelings can't be forced.

10
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,420
Still,

11
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,920
thinking of Father
and Mother's constant care,

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,280
I'm truly grateful.

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,640
But I can't defy
my family's ancestral code.

14
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,230
So, I came up

15
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,590
with this compromise.

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,760
It's a good idea.

17
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,990
Xiangye.

18
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,000
(Affidavit)
I always insist on documentation.

19
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,430
If there are no objections,

20
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,900
let's sign the affidavit now.

21
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,060
(Signed by: Zhou Yihong)

22
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,780
My Lord. My Lady.

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,620
Young Master.

24
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,910
Eunuch Fang brings the decree.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,610
Hurry, let's go greet him.

26
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,970
It must be my son's reward.

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,940
Hurry.

28
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,690
Oh, my.

29
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,670
My Lady,

30
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,900
the heir went too far.

31
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,610
How could you agree to that?

32
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,050
I heard the heir earned merit
at the borderlands.

33
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,580
He's sure to be promoted.

34
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,330
After you married him,

35
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,930
you served their whole family

36
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,420
and even used your dowry to help.

37
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,050
Now, you two live apart,

38
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,770
and all the benefits
will go to Li Yuewan.

39
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,490
Who said that's the heir's reward?

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,490
Is the primary wife of the heir here?

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,960
Yes.

42
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,960
You are Li Yuewan, the secondary wife?

43
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,630
A secondary wife is like a concubine.

44
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,870
I'm asking for the primary wife.

45
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,080
How dare you answer to that?

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,500
(Erudite and Resolute)

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,630
Zhang Xiyin, the primary wife
of the heir, receive the decree.

48
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,400
Yes.

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,710
He is calling for me.

50
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,840
Would you please step aside?

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,800
By the Mandate of Heaven,

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,960
the Emperor decrees:

53
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,560
Zhang Xiyin,

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,960
the heir's wife is generous,

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,360
pure, and kind.

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
She excels in her household duties,

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,840
serving as a model
for ladies of the capital.

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,120
She is hereby named Countess
of Grace and Virtue of Rank II,

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,470
with a bestowal of ten qing of land

60
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,630
and one country estate,

61
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,150
ten thousand qian,

62
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,470
ten bolts of fine silk,

63
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,080
twenty jin of fragrance,

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
and 3,000 guan of an annual stipend.

65
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,190
Thus decreed.

66
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,310
Thank you.

67
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,710
Xiyin.

68
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,910
After all, we are family, aren't we?

69
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,150
As the primary wife of the heir,

70
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,430
such an honor is truly rare.

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,470
We're all glad for you, aren't we?

72
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,240
Come, everyone.

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,590
Take all of this back.

74
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,120
- Wait.
- Hurry up.

75
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
Mother.

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,870
These imperial gifts
were bestowed on me.

77
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,360
I've just signed the affidavit
with the heir.

78
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
Naturally, I should bring these gifts

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,150
back to my maiden home.

80
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,760
- Xiangye.
- Xiyin.

81
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,360
When you act,

82
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,560
you must consider both families.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,560
The heir and I
were married only in name.

84
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,590
There's nothing to consider.

85
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,470
Servants,

86
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,840
take these things away.

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
Well...

88
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,730
Tsk.

89
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,580
(Change of Fortune)

90
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,520
My Lady,

91
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,830
how did you know that the reward

92
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,900
was not meant for the heir?

93
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,790
We must steer our own fate.

94
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,740
Only then will blessings come.

95
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,290
I can concede
regarding the secondary wife,

96
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,040
but Brother, you must find Censor Fang.

97
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,340
My father-in-law?

98
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,940
Censor Fang oversees the officials.

99
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,530
He will surely act against injustice.

100
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,000
Please ask him to inform His Majesty

101
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,560
that Zhou Yihong ignored his betrothal

102
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,930
and his rewards should be revoked.

103
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,100
Yet I am still willing

104
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,160
to let Li Yuewan become
his secondary wife

105
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,020
to repay her for my husband.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,970
By doing so,

107
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,070
your virtue will be known,

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,630
and you might even be awarded.

109
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,700
(Change of Fortune)

110
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,380
Honey.

111
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,510
Father, Mother.

112
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,630
His Majesty wouldn't reward her
for no reason.

113
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,020
She must have done something.

114
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,460
Her brother's father-in-law
is Censor Fang.

115
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,780
Yuewan,

116
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,370
the ins and outs of this matter

117
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,250
must be verified with the Empress.

118
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,420
Be sure not to forget my son's rewards.

119
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,370
At the very least,

120
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,340
he must keep his post
as a Feather Guard.

121
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,300
Sure, Father, rest assured.

122
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,930
I will go at dawn tomorrow.

123
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,050
I thought Zhang Xiyin was sensible

124
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,860
to let you be the secondary wife.

125
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,420
However,

126
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,980
she brought the imperial gifts
back to her maiden home.

127
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,490
Clearly, she does not wish to serve us.

128
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,240
Everything of the Zhangs

129
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,720
belongs to us.

130
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,270
Not a single coin should leave here.

131
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,470
Xicui.

132
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,880
Xicui.

133
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,800
Choose a few quick hands

134
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,410
from our servants,

135
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,070
intercept those imperial gifts,

136
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,830
and return at once.

137
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,190
Yes, My Lady.

138
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,550
I'll see to it right away.

139
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
Beware of fire when it's dry.

140
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,480
You can't go this way.

141
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,600
Leave your things here.

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
What are you waiting for?

143
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,430
If you know what's good for you,
hand it over.

144
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,070
Sir,

145
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,460
we're just bringing home supplies.

146
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,580
Could you please

147
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,460
let us through?

148
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,220
You can go,

149
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,340
but the goods stay.

150
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,830
Help!

151
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,840
We're being robbed!

152
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,930
Keep your mouth shut.

153
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,620
Help!

154
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,630
Please help!

155
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,580
I told you to shut up!
Didn't you hear me?

156
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,800
My eyes!

157
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,300
Stop! Please stop!

158
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,140
Please stop!

159
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,100
It's an ambush!

160
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,200
Your Highness.

161
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,140
So, you already know

162
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,340
who I am.

163
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,100
Your Highness, your presence shines

164
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
and is known to all.

165
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,340
My imperial gifts were stolen.

166
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,220
I beg you to seek justice for me.

167
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,060
What a coincidence

168
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,220
that it happened right under my nose.

169
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,340
You prepared means of self-defense

170
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,460
and even smeared phosphorus powder
on the carriage.

171
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,540
My Lady,

172
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,660
why should we put phosphorus powder
on the carriage?

173
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,300
To lure the culprit,

174
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,380
there must be bait.

175
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,460
The phosphorus powder glows
in darkness.

176
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,980
It sticks to clothes and skin
and is hard to wash off.

177
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,540
If someone tries to steal
our imperial gifts,

178
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,340
we'll catch them right away.

179
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,900
But we're just women.

180
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,020
How could we catch them?

181
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,020
Everything is ready.

182
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,460
After the curfew tonight,

183
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,940
we'll take Tianshui Lane

184
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,340
and return home.

185
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,180
Alright.

186
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,260
(I remember in my past life,)

187
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,140
(Prince Ji hadn't yet returned
to the capital.)

188
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,380
(He must have his reasons
for coming back early.)

189
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,780
(This is perhaps a chance)

190
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,260
(to discuss an alliance with him.)

191
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,620
It's no coincidence.

192
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,740
Someone at home wants to harm me.

193
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,140
I prepared something for my safety

194
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,820
and came to seek your protection.

195
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,430
Sorry, I cannot help you.

196
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,060
The view here is limited

197
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,940
but perfect for watching
the Marquis Mansion.

198
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,360
What are you implying?

199
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,300
If I'm not mistaken,

200
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,620
the person you seek to capture

201
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,980
is at the Marquis Mansion.

202
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,980
What wild guesses are you making?

203
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,460
I'm trying to help you.

204
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,100
You just want to use me.

205
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,900
You can use me too.

206
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,740
(All Xiliang spies were caught)

207
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,740
(except for one.)

208
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,500
(I've searched everywhere around here)

209
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,470
(except Marquis Ding'an's Mansion.)

210
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,300
Listen up, everyone.

211
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,540
Today, His Majesty's imperial gifts
were robbed.

212
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,880
Intruders broke into the mansion.

213
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,940
The safety of all here is at risk.

214
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,010
The Imperial Office was called
to investigate.

215
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,220
Anyone refuses to cooperate...

216
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,510
They shall be beheaded.

217
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,500
Why are you causing trouble again?

218
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,460
Honey.

219
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,100
I just ran into some bandits.

220
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,620
They took all the imperial gifts.

221
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,540
I followed their tracks

222
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,480
all the way here.

223
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,940
I suspect there's a traitor inside.

224
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,620
So I came with officials to investigate.

225
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,060
If it's really an inside job,

226
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
we will handle it.

227
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,900
There's no need

228
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,180
to involve outsiders.

229
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,500
This thief is truly bold

230
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,860
to covet His Majesty's grace.

231
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,540
He shows no respect for the law.

232
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,460
I advise you two

233
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,540
to hand him to the Imperial Office

234
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,580
to avoid suspicion of sheltering him.

235
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,220
If you refuse to cooperate,

236
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,300
don't blame me for following the law.

237
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,780
My Lord,

238
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,580
I wouldn't dare.

239
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
However,

240
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,020
you barged in to search my mansion

241
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,460
on only Xiyin's words.

242
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,780
You're showing

243
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,180
little respect for us.

244
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,060
If you find something, all is well,

245
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,540
but if you find nothing,

246
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,140
it will ruin our good name.

247
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,180
How will you

248
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,340
answer for it?

249
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,460
Father, please rest assured.

250
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,900
I have already taken precautions.

251
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,060
I applied phosphorus powder
to the imperial gifts.

252
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,140
If fire draws near,
the marks will appear.

253
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,180
If the thief hides among the servants,

254
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,500
there will be nowhere to escape.

255
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,380
You want to search the mansion

256
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,860
on your words alone?

257
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,100
What if nothing is found?

258
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,900
If the thief isn't caught today,

259
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,340
then I will bear

260
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,620
all the losses.
