=Episode 16=

3
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,470
Is everything tidied up?

4
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,240
Staying here with me,

5
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,560
do you feel uneasy at all?

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,360
No.

7
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,640
You are helping me.

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,350
Besides, I've never cared

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,000
about rumors from others.

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,600
Good.

11
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,000
Duan Xuanming has lost in the selection.

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,680
To get the Trade Route Map,

13
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,430
he'll surely make another move.

14
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,230
Do you have a plan?

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,770
I have news from my shops

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,840
that in Qingfeng Town
under Duan Xuanming's watch,

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,590
someone raised the price of rice.

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,150
Grain is the state's foundation.

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,760
I plan to use this chance

20
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,200
to bring him down for good.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Alright.

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,600
But this time,

23
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,840
I will do it with you.

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Duan Xuanming has eyes everywhere.

25
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,920
We must be extremely careful.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,880
Let's go.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
Mother.

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,760
- I'm hungry.
- Hold on.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,190
Mother, I'm hungry.

30
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm starving.

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,000
Steamed bun.

32
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,120
Have pity on me.

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,080
Please, give me the steamed bun.

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
It's mine.

35
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,790
I never expected

36
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,910
our people would starve like this.

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,000
The First Prince leads the Revenue.

38
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,870
Yet he ignores all this misery.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,400
Seems we must try another way

40
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,560
to seek well-being for the people.

41
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,960
What? Polished rice costs five guan?

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,480
(Ruifeng Rice)
Why not just rob us?

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,360
Exactly.

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,630
Five guan for a bag of rice.

45
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,510
It's barely enough for a family
for two days.

46
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,890
How are people supposed to live?

47
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,470
Profiteer.

48
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,190
There was a natural disaster this year.

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,430
The harvest was poor,

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,000
so the rice price went up.

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,310
That's normal.

52
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,240
- What?
- Normal?

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
The court has decreed

54
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,100
a bag of rice can't cost
over three guan.

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,470
Aren't you afraid
of being punished for this?

56
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,840
It's all because of the disaster.

57
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,150
If the officials come,

58
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,520
they'll get the same price.

59
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,360
The First Prince oversees the Revenue.

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,500
- He's always...
- Hey.

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,190
The price now

62
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,470
was set by the First Prince.

63
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,800
The First Prince...

64
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,770
The First Prince is heartless.

65
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,630
He raises rice prices
and ignores the people.

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,840
He cares nothing for justice.

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,880
Bring back the old price.

68
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,560
Bring back the old price!

69
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,030
Such unruly folks.

70
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,840
How dare you cause trouble here!

71
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,030
Teach them a lesson.

72
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,690
How dare you fight back?

73
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,560
Guards, seize him.

74
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,040
My Lord.

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,840
These people made trouble
at the rice shop.

76
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,430
We only want food.

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,590
Why arrest us?

78
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,240
Yes, let us out.

79
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,150
Let us out.

80
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,380
- How dare you!
- Let us out!

81
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,800
It's because you're poor.

82
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,220
You caused trouble over food.

83
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,950
What's the point of living like this?

84
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,190
Death would set you free from this pain.

85
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,920
Do it.

86
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,000
My Lord, such authority you wield.

87
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,250
Prince Ji.

88
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,480
Open the door.

89
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,600
Your Highness.

90
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,830
I'm sorry

91
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,630
for arresting you.

92
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,160
I'll let you out right away.

93
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,480
But I'm the one you want.

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,750
I'm the one causing trouble.

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,320
Your Highness.

96
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,070
We failed to recognize you.

97
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,870
Please forgive us.

98
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,830
You were only following orders.

99
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,120
There's no guilt in that.

100
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,270
Your Highness, you must be joking.

101
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,870
This is a misunderstanding.

102
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,160
A misunderstanding.

103
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,080
Perhaps

104
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
you should step out first.

105
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,000
(I must inform His Highness at once.)

106
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
What?

107
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,950
Uncle is in the dungeon.

108
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,950
Yes.

109
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,430
Why did he go to Qingfeng Town?

110
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,920
He led the unrest there.

111
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,680
Well, well.

112
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,270
He wants to use the grain prices
to bring me down.

113
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,480
Kill them

114
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,800
in secret.

115
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,960
Yes.

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,980
Your Majesty.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,190
Please, save Prince Ji.

118
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,530
What's wrong with Jianli?

119
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,920
In the First Prince's domain,

120
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,830
there's been grain price manipulation.

121
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,040
The people are starving.

122
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,160
They can't go on much longer.

123
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,000
Some tried to resist

124
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,720
but were met with force.

125
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,390
Prince Ji stepped in to help

126
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,270
yet was thrown into prison as a rebel.

127
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,630
If you stay silent,

128
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,630
the Prince may be in grave danger.

129
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,470
Is this true?

130
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,800
This concerns the people's lives.

131
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,050
I dare not lie.

132
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,760
Your Majesty,

133
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,320
these are the people's testimonies

134
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,250
and the proof
of the First Prince's manipulation

135
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,160
that Prince Ji and I gathered.

136
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,980
(The First Prince raised prices
and blamed it on the natural disaster.)

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,040
This is outrageous.

138
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,160
Utterly outrageous.

139
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,680
How could he dare do such a thing?

140
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,960
Prepare the horses.

141
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,630
Let me see

142
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,720
just how capable

143
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,800
my good son is.

144
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,120
Oh, my dear nephew
is here to silence me.

145
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,760
Uncle,

146
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,310
there's no need to pretend.

147
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,840
You're waiting for me here,

148
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,120
aren't you?

149
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,750
His Majesty has arrived.

150
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,950
You rascal.

151
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,070
Stop right there.

152
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,040
Your Highness.

153
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,910
Are you alright?

154
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,190
I'm fine.

155
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,120
Sorry for being late.

156
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,830
You came just in time.

157
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,830
Foolish.

158
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,480
How many times have I told you?

159
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,750
All you need do is kill Zhang Xiyin.

160
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,070
Do not touch Prince Ji.

161
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,660
But you just wouldn't listen.

162
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,270
Father has been to the dungeon.

163
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,680
He knows everything now.

164
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,950
He won't let me off this time.

165
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,070
Mother.

166
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,590
What should I do?

167
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,630
What should you do?

168
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,830
If only it had been anyone else.

169
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,390
Why harm Duan Jianli?

170
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,240
You know well that His Majesty

171
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,950
cares deeply for his brother.

172
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,240
I know

173
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,870
you've always been a dutiful child.

174
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,120
As things have come to this,

175
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,870
I won't hide it from you.

176
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,270
You are the child
of the King of Xiliang.

177
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,560
If you wish to survive,

178
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,310
you must give up everything here.

179
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,830
Mother, what do you mean?

180
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,510
Return to where you truly belong.

181
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,800
Your Highness.

182
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,510
It was her.

183
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,350
She helped Duan Xuanming leave the city.

184
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,800
Speak.

185
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,790
What is your connection to the Empress?

186
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,200
Don't...

187
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,200
Don't kill me.

188
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,550
I'm only the Empress's wet nurse.

189
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,960
I was sent out of the Palace years ago.

190
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,840
What's Li Yuewan's link to the Empress?

191
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,320
Well...

192
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,750
I...

193
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,230
I'll tell you.

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,240
Twenty years ago,

195
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
Xiliang lost the war.

196
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,270
Their Prince was sent here as a hostage.

197
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,200
The Empress and the hostage
once fell in love.

198
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,150
That hostage is now the King of Xiliang.

199
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,670
But her father

200
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,840
tore them apart.

201
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,790
Afterward,

202
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,870
the King of Xiliang left,

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,200
and the Empress

204
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,030
entered the Palace.

205
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,510
What is Duan Xuanming
to the King of Xiliang?

206
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,320
He is the King's son.

207
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,150
Before the Empress gave birth,

208
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,840
she brought the King's son

209
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,200
into the Palace.

210
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,000
He was swapped

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,320
with her own daughter, Li Yuewan.

212
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,750
Later, the King's child

213
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,670
was raised as her own

214
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,270
to help him claim the throne...

215
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,720
To aid Xiliang

216
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,790
in controlling Dayu.

217
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,240
Your Highness.

218
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,320
I was only following orders.

219
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
Please spare me.

220
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
Please show mercy.

221
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,320
Imprison her.

222
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,990
Your Highness.

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,240
Please show mercy.

224
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,370
Your Highness.

225
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,390
Please show mercy.

226
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,240
Your Highness.

227
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,280
His Majesty wants us
to find the First Prince soon.

228
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,360
It's been seven days.

229
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,270
We may not make it.

230
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,440
There's still time.

231
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,910
Your Highness.

232
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,320
If we follow the Trade Route Map,

233
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,910
we'll reach Xiliang sooner.

234
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,300
