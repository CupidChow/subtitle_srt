3
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,850
Your Highness,
didn't you wish to question me?

4
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,860
(Zhang Xiyin confesses her plot
against Concubine Su)

5
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,790
Your Highness, as a Prince,

6
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,680
how could you make false accusations?

7
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,350
Anyone who stands against me

8
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,790
will die.

9
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,640
Xiyin.

10
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,040
- Brother.
- Xiyin.

11
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,760
Your Highness, what do you want?

12
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,000
A Zhang made a mistake,

13
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,350
so all the Zhangs must be questioned.

14
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,840
As an imperial merchant,

15
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,300
I alone bear responsibility.

16
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,740
It has nothing to do with my brother.

17
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,430
Please let him go.

18
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,230
Sign your name here,

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,950
and I will let him go.

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,120
Tch.

21
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,150
She won't sign it.

22
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,310
My sister is innocent.

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,510
You can't frame her.

24
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,430
You can plead your case,

25
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,120
but I have many ways

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,510
to make you stay silent.

27
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,910
Brother.

28
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,810
(Order)
Prince Ji's token is here.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,920
Let my brother go.

30
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,180
(Order)

31
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,120
The token can save only one.

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,150
Choose between your brother

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,280
and yourself.

34
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,230
His Majesty is here.

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,470
What's wrong?

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,640
I was ordered

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,800
to investigate Concubine Su's poisoning

38
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,590
and am questioning Zhang.

39
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,750
Your Majesty,

40
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,870
this item

41
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,310
can prove my innocence.

42
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,520
I was told
that you coughed blood and fainted

43
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,750
after eating my Poria Cake.

44
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,870
That's true.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,960
Please take a look

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,630
and see if there's any difference
between the cakes.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,080
Both of them

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,980
are Chinese Yam Cake
I sent to the Department.

49
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,240
They look similar to Poria Cake,

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,480
so they might've got mixed up.

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,560
But with just one bite,

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,080
you'll know the difference.

53
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,560
This is indeed Chinese Yam Cake.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,680
In that case,

55
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,680
Concubine Su never ate my cake,

56
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,030
yet she blamed me for poisoning her.

57
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,520
With all these details,

58
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,310
you're trying to frame me.

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,840
- In that case,
- In that case...

60
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,910
come back with me

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,560
to clear everything up.

62
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,870
Concubine Su.

63
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,340
You'd best confess the truth.

64
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,180
If you utter a single false word,

65
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,120
you're deceiving the throne.

66
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,710
I simply disliked Lady Zhang,

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
so I schemed to frame her.

68
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,400
I admit my fault.

69
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,710
Good for you.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,960
You even fooled me.

71
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,680
For selfish gain, Concubine Su

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,560
plotted against a Countess.

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,750
She is vile and malicious.

74
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,240
Her title is to be stripped.

75
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,710
Send her to the Cold Palace.

76
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,670
Father,

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,160
Concubine Su lied to me,

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,460
which led to my actions.

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,870
Please punish me.

80
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,350
Forget it.

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,030
Since Zhang has proven her innocence,

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,000
release her family at once,

83
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,070
and offer her a proper apology.

84
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,110
Yes.

85
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,160
Why didn't you tell me

86
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,680

180
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,200
All 300 shops were smashed.

181
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,440
The loss is at least 100,000 guan.

If we include the goods,

183

No.

with damaged shops,

192
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,750
and you won't be eligible then.

193
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,160
Starting tomorrow,

194
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll have men guard the Zhangs' shops

195
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,750
to uncover who's behind this.

196
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,860
(Wealth grows in bustling streets)

197
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,540
(Silk and tea travel far and wide)

198
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,390
Let's see this.

199
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,270
- Who will be chosen?
- No idea.

200
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,120
Yeah.

201
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,840
This is of great importance.

202
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,340
(Selection List)
A great fortune is up to this.

203
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,180
(Zhang Trading House)

204
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,920
Eunuch Fang.

205
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,200
Didn't the Zhang Clan suspend business?

206
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,200
Why are they joining the selection?

207
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,440
This was decreed by His Majesty.

208
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,390
Not just any shopkeeper
can be an imperial merchant.

209
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,200
I think His Majesty
let her join for amusement.

210
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,120
Mind your words.

211
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Your Highness, among the candidates,

212
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,840
half are loyal to the First Prince.

213
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,370
It might be hard for Ms. Zhang to win.

214
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,450
She won't lose.
