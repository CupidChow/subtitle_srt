00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:52,340
(Divorce)

4
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,900
Zhang Xiyin, what do you mean?

5
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,380
Lady Yuewan, what's wrong with you?

6
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,700
Or didn't you

7
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,420
have enough fun

8
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,820
at the Assembly?

9
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,020
How dare you bring that up?

10
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,140
You raised the price
to shame me on purpose.

11
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,780
You tricked me into paying 200,000 guan.

12
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,500
200,000 guan?

13
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,660
200,000 guan
for a pot of chrysanthemums?

14
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,340
If not for Xiyin seeking attention,

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,580
why would I buy those flowers
for the Empress?

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,540
Zhang Xiyin.

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,760
This started because of you.

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,740
You should handle it.

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,940
Young Master, are you deaf?

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,760
Lady Yuewan bought those flowers.

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,140
What does this have to do with me?

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,620
You're my principle wife.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,300
Your money belongs to my family.

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,300
That's right, Xiyin.

25
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,340
Why trouble yourself over this?

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,700
In the end, you'll still pay for it.

27
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,980
Who says I'll pay?

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,380
Your family is wealthy.

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,940
As the heir's wife,

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,940
shouldn't you do something
for the family?

31
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,700
Besides, you have so many shops.

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,460
Just pawn a few and it's settled.

33
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,820
Have you run out of money
and lost your mind?

34
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,500
What do my shops

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,220
have to do with the Zhous?

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,540
Without the Zhous' support,

37
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,140
where would you get all those shops?

38
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,140
How ridiculous.

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,180
The Zhangs have over a hundred shops.

40
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,300
Why would we need your support?

41
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,640
Anyway, the Tricolor Chrysanthemum
is in the Palace.

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,320
In a few days, Princess Jinyang
will send someone for the money.

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,380
If you can't pay by then,

44
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,300
won't you be the one embarrassed?

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,420
Lady Yuewan, I don't follow you.

46
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,180
Everyone saw that day

47
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,940
you bought the flower,

48
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,820
and you drew all the attention.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,890
The embarrassment

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,900
should fall on you as well.

51
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,700
I warned you not to overreach yourself,

52
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,140
but you wouldn't listen.

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,860
Now you have no choice

54
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,540
but to hand over the money.

55
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,820
Are you really pretending not to know?

56
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,980
We just had our grand wedding,

57
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,420
and we've spent more than half.

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,260
There's less than 500 guan left.

59
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,700
Where would I find 200,000?

60
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,540
Humph.

61
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,680
It's okay you have no money.

62
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,980
In my view,

63
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,700
your ancestral residence

64
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,140
sits on the finest land in the capital.

65
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,180
If you pawn it,

66
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,180
you should get 200,000 guan.

67
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,020
Nonsense.

68
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,140
This is my family's legacy.

69
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,200
How can I just pawn it off?

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,180
If you have a better idea,
that's perfect.

71
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,100
Or maybe,

72
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,980
you could simply disgrace yourself.

73
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,940
The imperial family is wealthy.

74
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,050
Surely,
they won't put you in a tough spot

75
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,140
over such a small sum.

76
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,260
In that case,

77
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,140
you could even save the 200,000 guan.

78
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,300
You...

79
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,500
Yihong,

80
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,980
we don't have enough money left.

81
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,140
If worst comes to worst,

82
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,060
let's just pawn the mansion.

83
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,000
You're talking nonsense.

84
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,180
You caused this mess,

85
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,280
so handle it yourself.

86
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,100
Zhang Xiyin refuses to give a coin.

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,620
Even Yihong doesn't understand me.

88
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,660
He just keeps blaming me.

89
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,940
Please don't be angry.

90
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,580
Why not ask the Empress for help

91
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,260
and see if she can lend you the money?

92
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,230
That's not an option.

93
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,800
Then what should we do?

94
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,220
We truly can't afford it.

95
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,580
She has to pay

96
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,180
the 200,000 guan.

97
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,980
Xiyin,

98
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,280
we're all family.

99
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,620
You can't just stand by and watch.

100
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,540
Even brothers keep clear accounts.

101
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,660
I can lend you 200,000.

102
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,940
But

103
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,420
what will you use as collateral?

104
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,860
I have nothing to offer.

105
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,380
Can I just pay interest instead?

106
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,940
The Zhangs
only accept items as collateral.

107
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,540
If you don't have anything,

108
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,780
I'm afraid I can't help you.

109
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,420
Wait, Xiyin.

110
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,340
I'll use the deed to the mansion
as collateral

111
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,500
to borrow your money.

112
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,620
Is that enough?

113
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,820
Very well.

114
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,940
Let's draw up the IOU now.

115
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,300
But as far as I know,

116
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,260
the deed isn't with you, is it?

117
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,220
It is. I have it.

118
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,260
Then please go and fetch it.

119
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,260
Alright.

120
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,520
(Marquis Ding'an's Mansion)
Our deal is done.

121
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,940
I have other matters to attend to.

122
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,100
I won't visit the Princess with you.

123
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,020
Hey.

124
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,660
Isn't this Ms. Li?

125
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,220
It really is Ms. Li.

126
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,180
It's been quite a while.

127
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,020
Ms. Li,

128
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,620
do you still remember us?

129
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,580
Who are you?

130
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,700
I don't know you.

131
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,300
Who are you?

132
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,580
How dare you bother Lady Yuewan

133
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,850
from Marquis Ding'an's family?

134
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,900
Ah?

135
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,040
Lady Yuewan
from Marquis Ding'an's family?

136
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,180
Ms. Li,

137
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,190
so your fiance at the borderlands

138
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,470
is actually the heir of Marquis Ding'an.

139
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,940
What fiance?

140
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,220
I do not know you.

141
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Mind your words.

142
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,060
- Hey.
- Hey.

143
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,380
Li Yuewan.

144
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,900
You fled the borderlands overnight

145
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,980
and didn't even settle
the cleaning fees.

146
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,580
Now you pretend not to know us.

147
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,900
You can't leave

148
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,840
before things are clear.

149
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
Xicui, drive them away.

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Yes.

151
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,020
Oh, dear.

152
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,420
There's no justice here.

153
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,700
She owes us and won't pay.

154
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,820
And now she's hitting us.

155
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,660
She's trying to kill us.

156
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,050
She's trying to kill us!

157
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,910
Please judge for us.

158
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,170
Come and see.

159
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,700
You still want to run?

160
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,900
Prince Ji is here.

161
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,760
Who is causing a disturbance here?

162
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,020
My Lord,

163
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,700
you must help us seek justice.

164
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,980
The Zhous want to kill us.

165
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,100
That's right.

166
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,140
But you're still alive, aren't you?

167
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,620
Thankfully, you arrived in time.

168
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,740
- Yeah.
- Or they would've acted.

169
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

170
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,100
Is there some trouble here?

171
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,660
Lady Yuewan and I just stepped out
and met these two.

172
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,560
They claim they worked for Lady Yuewan

173
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,860
and haven't received their wages.

174
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,450
Perhaps it's a misunderstanding.

175
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,100
What misunderstanding could there be?

176
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,100
She lived there for half a year.

177
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,210
- Your Highness.
- Yes.

178
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,740
This concerns Lady Yuewan
and the Zhous' reputation.

179
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,260
Your Highness,

180
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,460
please judge fairly.

181
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,700
No need for that.

182
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,940
It's nothing serious.

183
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,420
No need to trouble you.

184
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,700
Lady Yuewan, please rest assured.

185
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,300
I'll get to the bottom of this

186
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,620
and give you justice.

187
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,540
- Chishu.
- Yes.

188
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,940
Take them to the Office.

189
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,780
Understood.

190
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,220
Take them away.

191
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,140
How could you be so careless?

192
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,260
I hurried back for you.

193
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,500
I just owed those two maids
half a month's pay.

194
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,660
I often gave them gifts before.

195
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,340
How could I know they'd come after me?

196
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,350
Even if they did,

197
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,820
they shouldn't have known about us.

198
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,860
I'm just a woman.

199
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,860
Meeting a man late at night

200
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,060
would start disgraceful rumors,

201
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,380
so I said you were my fiance.

202
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,120
Enough.

203
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,100
If those two reveal the truth,

204
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,540
then our marriage scam

205
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,620
will be exposed.

206
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,620
Yihong,

207
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,340
go and comfort Xiyin later.

208
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,930
Maybe this matter will blow over.

209
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,420
Understood.

210
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,100
Xiyin.

211
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,780
Why am I so nervous?

212
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,020
She's my wife.

213
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,700
There's no need to hide.

214
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,380
What a rogue.

215
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,980
How dare you enter here!

216
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,820
- Nonsense! I'm the heir!
- Heir?

217
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,700
The heir should be
in Lady Yuewan's room now.

218
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,450
What are you doing?

219
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,220
Stop.

220
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,740
Xiangye, throw this rogue out!

221
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,020
Let him cool off.

222
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,860
Take him away.

223
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,100
Let me go.

224
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,140
Let go of me.

225
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,540
(Erudite and Resolute)

226
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,660
- What happened?
- What's going on?

227
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,060
Why is he sitting here?

228
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,940
What's wrong?

229
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,780
No idea.

230
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,540
Oh, dear.

231
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,580
Yihong.

232
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,620
Yihong.

233
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,440
Yihong, why are you here?

234
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,460
What are you waiting for?

235
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,420
Hurry and untie me.

236
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,420
- Hurry.
- Sure.

237
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,990
What are you looking at?

238
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,140
Get lost.

239
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,660
Hey.

240
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,960
Zhang Xiyin.

241
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,480
How dare you toy with me like this?

242
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,940
You beat me into this sorry state,

243
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,500
then tied me up, and left me outside,

244
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,700
forcing me to sleep
on cold stone all night.

245
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,820
You went too far.

246
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,700
Yihong,

247
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,740
why did you go to see her
so late last night?

248
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,860
Why do you think?

249
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,300
It was because of you.

250
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,260
You should understand me the best.

251
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,300
There's only one of me.

252
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,810
I can't split myself between you two.

253
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,630
What can I do?

254
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,480
Come on.

255
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,380
Oh, my.

256
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,860
So,

257
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,420
it really was you last night.

258
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,020
I stated who I was before I entered,

259
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,340
yet your maid

260
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,340
beat me without asking what happened.

261
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,220
Zhang Xiyin,

262
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,740
if you can't manage your servants,

263
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,300
then let me handle it for you.

264
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,500
Guards,

265
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,130
drag Xiangye out

266
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,120
and flog her.

267
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,020
Xiangye is my dowry maid.

268
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,340
It's not your place

269
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,440
to discipline her.

270
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,340
She's here,

271
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,310
so she's my maid as well.

272
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,610
Bring me the disciplinary plank.

273
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,540
How dare you try to harm

274
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,620
