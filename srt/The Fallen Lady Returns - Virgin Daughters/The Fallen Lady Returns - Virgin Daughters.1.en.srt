00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,530
(On the 8th day of 12th month,)

4
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,270
(in the winter)

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,950
(of the 23rd year of Dayu,)

6
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,600
(the entire Zhang Clan perished.)

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,520
(My husband Zhou Yihong)

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
(and his secondary wife Li Yuewan)

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,350
(strangled me
before my parents' spirit tablets.)

10
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,190
Why?

11
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,350
If you do not die,

12
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,640
how can I take over
all your family's shops?

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,640
My dear wife.

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,790
You need not have died in such agony.

15
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,560
The Spring Pill I gave you

16
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,880
was never a cure
for your incurable malady

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,040
but poison to send you
on the road to Hades.

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,560
So, you killed

19
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,760
my father,

20
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,790
my mother, and the hundreds of lives

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,560
in my family?

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,680
It was my scheme.

23
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,070
I also asked Mother to sentence

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
your entire family to death.

25
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,790
Mother?

26
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,560
(Li Yuewan.)

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,430
(Zhou Yihong.)

28
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,950
(I was wrong to trust you two.)

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,680
(If there's another life,)

30
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,040

The heir and the new lady
have been long waiting for you.

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,980
They're asking for your answer.

56
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,400
What do you think

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,570
about the secondary wife?

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,280
Secondary wife?

(Isn't this what happened)

60
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,880
(the second year
after Zhou Yihong and I wed?)

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,470
(Have I)

62
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,880
(been reborn?)

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,840
Dear.

64
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,000
Dear.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,840
You're awake.

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,280
Dear.

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,470
This lady here

68
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,720
is Yuewan.

69
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,260
I was attacked by refugees
in the borderlands,

70
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,160
and Yuewan risked her life to save me.

71
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,560
Out of duty and gratitude,
I cannot let her down.

72
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,810
So,

73
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,380
I wish to take her as my secondary wife.

74
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,680
Do you have any objections?

75
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,310
Greetings, Xiyin.

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,360
I've heard you struggle
with an incurable malady,

77
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,160
so I brought the Spring Pill

78
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,280
from the borderlands.

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,560
It's said to work wonders for coughs.

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,720
The Spring Pill I gave you

81
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,900
was never a cure
for your incurable malady

82
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,000
but poison to send you
on the road to Hades.

83
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,390
It must be amazing then, right?

84
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,360
You are truly generous

85
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,270
to share such a rare remedy

86
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,950
with me.

87
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
- What are you doing?
- Yuewan.

88
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,240
Fetch the physician.

89
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,200
Yes.

90
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,510
It seems Xiyin

91
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,520
dislikes me.

92
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,100
Zhang Xiyin,

93
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,060
let me make this clear.

94
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,050
Whether you agree or not,

95
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,800
Yuewan will be my secondary wife.

96
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,750
Let's go.

97
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,990
If you insist on marrying her,

98
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,930
then divorce me.

99
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Our marriage was granted by the Empress.

100
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,830
You have no right to dissolve it.

101
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,120
It was my scheme.

102
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,800
I also asked Mother to sentence

103
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,710
your entire family to death.

104
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,360
(Mother?)

105
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,190
(Could Li Yuewan be
the Empress's daughter?)

106
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,390
(Seems the Empress's marriage decree
hides more.)

107
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Since I can't get a divorce,

108
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,480
I'll just wait and see

109
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,920
what you intend to do next.

110
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,000
Living again in this life,

111
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,990
I will take back

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,750
everything that belongs to me this time.

113
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,010
These fermented glutinous rice balls
smell lovely.

114
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,080
Eating glutinous rice balls

115
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,580
is best with family.

116
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,220
If only Xiyin were here.

117
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,100
Yes.

118
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,780
She loves this dish the most.

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,340
Shall we send some to her another day?

120
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,180
That sounds good.

121
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,100
- (Father.)
- You two.

122
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,420
- (Mother.)
- Eat a bit more.

123
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,620
(Brother.)

124
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,380
You all should try it.

125
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,520
(Living again)

126
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,620
(and seeing you all)

127
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,100
(is truly wonderful.)

128
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,460
Father.

129
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,220
Mother.

130
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,460
Brother.

131
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,060
- Xiyin.
- Xiyin.

132
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,580
Why are you here so late?

133
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,020
Is something wrong?

134
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,300
Did something upset you?

135
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,220
Mother.

136
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,580
I missed you all.

137
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,860
Silly child.

138
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,420
If you need anything, just tell Xiangye,

139
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,620
and I will go see you.

140
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,000
That's right.

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,660
Why did you come yourself?

142
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,900
It's so late for a visit.

143
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,460
Have you eaten anything yet?

144
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,540
Father.

145
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,420
Mother.

146
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,820
Brother.

147
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,100
Today,

148
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,050
I've come to discuss
something important.

149
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,460
This is simply outrageous.

150
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,260
Back then, the Zhous pleaded for you.

151
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,620
Now they treat you with such disrespect.

152
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,600
Before the wedding,
Marquis Ding'an promised

153
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,560
to honor our monogamy rule.

154
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,980
But now, he's broken his word.

155
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,620
I believe

156
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,140
this is nothing but marriage deception.

157
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,740
Who is this secondary wife?

158
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,300
Zhou Yihong said

159
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,720
he met refugees causing trouble
at the borderlands,

160
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,860
and Li Yuewan gave up her chastity
to save him.

161
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,040
So, he promised her
the secondary wife's title

162
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,220
to thank her.

163
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,380
How could a gentle lady like her

164
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,020
have saved the heir
from rioting refugees?

165
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,540
Father.

166
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,580
Mother.

167
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,620
Brother.

168
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,700
The power behind this woman

169
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,460
could crush our family

170
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,820
like ants.

171
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,380
Xiyin, tell us the truth.

172
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,060
Are you hiding something from us?

173
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,740
I...

174
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,300
(The more they know,
the greater the danger.)

175
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,060
(Li Yuewan's ties to the Empress)

176
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,820
(must remain secret.)

177
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,300
I overheard it by accident.

178
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,020
The Zhous

179
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,020
plan to seize our family business,

180
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,140
so they're using the silk deal
as a cover

181
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,060
to frame us.

182
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,020
Xiyin might truly have a point.

183
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,820
Our status as imperial merchants
draws envy.

184
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,680
Tomorrow, Father and I

185
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,620
will go to sign the silk deal contract.

186
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,010
Father,

187
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,900
we must never agree to the silk deal.

188
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,380
If what you said is true,

189
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,060
the Zhous surely have further plans.

190
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,280
We can't just sit and wait for disaster.

191
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,100
But the Zhous hold great power.

192
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,820
We are but humble imperial merchants.

193
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,100
It's hard to stand against them.

194
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,860
Brother, do not worry.

195
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,580
If he seeks to ruin our family,

196
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,820
I will make sure

197
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,940
he loses everything he holds dear.

198
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,740
(Without the silk deal,)

199
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,740
(the Zhous won't let this go.)

200
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,380
(Now, our family stands all alone.)

201
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,980
(I must find a way)

202
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,980
(to find support soon.)

203
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,900
Stop right there.

204
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,140
Stop running.

205
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,100
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

206
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,380
Don't come closer.

207
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,780
Or I'll kill her.

208
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,620
Let's see if your saber

209
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,860
is swifter than my arrow.

210
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,020
(It's him.)

211
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,860
It's the dead of night.

212
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,660
Why are you here?

213
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,500
I'm Zhang Xiyin, the wife of the heir

214
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,620
of Marquis Ding'an.

215
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,520
I just returned from my maiden home.

216
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,160
The Imperial Office is on a case.

217
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,460
Leave at once.

218
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,700
I will take my leave now.

219
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,890
Wait.

220
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,460
Your foot is injured.

221
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,740
It's hard for you to walk.

222
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,900
You should ride back.

223
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,060
Thank you, My Lord.
