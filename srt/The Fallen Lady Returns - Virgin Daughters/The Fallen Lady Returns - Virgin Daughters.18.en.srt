=Episode 18=

3
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,640
This should be the room
the Prince mentioned.

4
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,140
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,040
Delivering Gastrodia Elata.

6
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,510
It wasn't for this place.

7
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,790
Perhaps I went to the wrong room.

8
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,870
It's all right.

9
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,250
Have some tea before you go.

10
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,420
No need.

11
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,950
I still need to make other deliveries.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,950
I'll take my leave now.

13
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,920
I knew it was you.

14
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,840
Long time no see.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,950
Dear.

16
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,230
Zhou Yihong.

17
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,920
At last, we meet again.

18
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,400
Dear.

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,080
You knew it was me all along.

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,590
I knew since you came to Xiliang.

21
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,590
Every time the spies report back,

22
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,750
telling me how close you are
to Duan Jianli,

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,030
I just want to tear him apart.

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,310
You are my wife.

25
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,240
If not for fear of Li Yuewan
finding out,

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,190
I would've kept you with me that day.

27
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,470
Did you bring me here for revenge?

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,190
Revenge?

29
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,840
I did want it.

30
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,710
But when I see your face,

31
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,730
I find myself unable to let you go.

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
What exactly do you want?

33
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,750
Xiyin,

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,870
let us start anew.

35
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,800
Your face is scarred.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,910
Have you lost your mind too?

37
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,150
I am perfectly clear-headed.

38
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,120
I am your husband,

39
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,750
and I love you.

40
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,020
But I am also the future marquis.

41
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,960
I wanted my family to reach new heights.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,750
I had no choice in many things.

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
Now,

44
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,150
I am the Grand Preceptor of Xiliang,

45
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,430
second only to one.

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,590
I can give you whatever you want.

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,960
I can even make Li Yuewan vanish.

48
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,030
Xiyin,

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,630
let's start over.

50
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,560
Get lost.

51
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,080
If you come any closer,

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,280
I can't promise

53
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,080
you won't meet death again.

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,750
Who could kill me?

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,800
Duan Jianli?

56
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,750
What a pity.

57
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,590
He won't get that chance.

58
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,960
What did you do to him?

59
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,190
You care for him that much?

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,960
Of course, it's a surprise.

61
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,920
Despicable.

62
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,150
Grand Preceptor, Prince Ji is here.

63
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
Just stay here

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,430
and wait for a show.

65
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
Dear.

66
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,560
Zhou Yihong.

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,080
Zhou Yihong, let me go.

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,040
Zhou Yihong.

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,600
Let me go.

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,160
Long time no see.

71
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,270
Your Highness.

72
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,270
Let Xiyin go.

73
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,720
How can you be so shameless?

74
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,680
Xiyin is my wife.

75
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,850
Where do you want me to let her go?

76
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,630
Tell me your terms.

77
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,610
Terms?

78
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,310
Humph.

79
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,000
I want you.

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,310
Let her go.

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
Your Highness.

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,160
Where are you going, dear?

83
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,160
It's time to sleep now.

84
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,270
Zhou Yihong.

85
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,720
You promised to let her go.

86
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,480
When did I promise that?

87
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,920
Shameless.

88
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,270
Shameless?

89
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Why can't you see

90
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,600
she

91
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,240
is my wife?

92
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,800
You two are divorced.

93
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,460
I didn't write the Letter of Divorce.

94
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,950
Nor have I dismissed her.

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,510
Xiyin belongs to me.

96
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,310
Forget about her.

97
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,360
You despicable man.

98
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,440
You used me to hurt the Prince.

99
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,320
Don't blame me.

100
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,280
He chose to surrender.

101
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,310
You...

102
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,160
Dear, mind your own matters.

103
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,420
Especially don't meddle with other men.

104
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,270
If you behave yourself,

105
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,540
he'll suffer less in prison.

106
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,470
How dare you.

107
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
Dear, don't provoke me.

108
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,750
Or I'll have Duan Jianli killed.

109
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,430
Don't you dare.

110
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,950
Hide from me again,

111
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,920
and Duan Jianli's body
will be brought up.

112
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,360
Come and eat.

113
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,630
Does it not suit your taste?

114
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,570
I'm not hungry.

115
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,470
Have some soup.

116
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,390
I can drink it myself.

117
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,750
Look at yourself.

118
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,780
You're spilling it everywhere.

119
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,260
I've had the soup.

120
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,500
I've eaten as well.

121
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,500
You may leave now.

122
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,260
You truly don't wish to see me?

123
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,420
It's all right.

124
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,500
We still have plenty of time.

125
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,220
Stop.

126
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,220
Sirs, it's a bit stuffy here.

127
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,540
I'd like to step out for some air.

128
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,660
The Grand Preceptor told us

129
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,900
not to let you leave this room.

130
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,540
(Order)

131
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,620
As you wish.

132
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,100
Leave us.

133
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,140
Yes.

134
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,440
Xiyin.

135
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,420

I let them catch me on purpose

154
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,980
to draw in Duan Xuanming.

155
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,820
Only here

156
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,900
can we kill him.

157
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,900

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,020

I've waited since noon just for a meal.
