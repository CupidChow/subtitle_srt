=The Fallen Lady Returns=

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,520
Marquis Ding'an left this

4
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,070
from the child swap.

5
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,040
Don't move.

6
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,840
There's something on the beam.

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,590
A swaddling cloth.

8
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,590
A star.

9
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,400
This is the Empress's mark.

10
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,480
Go.

11
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,560
Bring the Zhous here.

12
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,750
Your Majesty.

13
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,150
There was a fire in the dungeon.

14
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,560
All the Zhous

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,680
died in the fire.

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,760
What?

17
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
Your Majesty.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,150
I'm not afraid to confront them.

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,350
But the Zhous are gone.

20
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,510
I wonder if Prince Ji

21
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,310
has other evidence.

22
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,760
Even if there were,
the Empress must've erased it.

23
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,920
You can't make baseless accusations.

24
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,590
You can't convict Mother

25
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,870
because of a cloth.

26
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,380
As you claimed she swapped her child,

27
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,710
you'd best have proof.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,190
Your Majesty,

29
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,470
I do have proof.

30
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,120
When the Princess was born,

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,960
the Zhous entrusted the child
to this woman.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,360
Your Majesty, please trust me.

33
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,430
This belonged to the Princess at birth.

34
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,710
I have kept it safe all these years.

35
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,960
Present it to me.

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,240
It's the golden lock

37
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,630
I had someone make
for your unborn child.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,560
Didn't you say it was lost?

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,600
The Empress ignored the law

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,650
and deceived His Majesty.

41
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,970
She swapped a daughter for a son.

42
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,470
Such a deed cannot be forgiven.

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,980
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

44
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,870
Xuanming...

45
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,750
Xuanming truly is your child.

46
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,310
However,

47
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,680
Li Yuewan is also your daughter.

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,400
Your Majesty,

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,590
the Empress gave birth to a pigeon pair.

50
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,800
If anyone were to find out,

51
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,560
the Princess would be in great danger.

52
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,000
Ignoring Her Majesty's objections,

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,050
I asked the Zhous to take care of her.

54
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,440
If that was the case,

55
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,670
why kill all the involved back then?

56
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,600
Shut up.

57
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,150
I did nothing of the sort.

58
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,360
Do not slander me.

59
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,400
Your Majesty,

60
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
if you did not do this,

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,190
why did you keep pushing me
to the brink?

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,720
Someone set fire to Huaguang Temple,

63
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
trying to burn Zhang Xiyin

64
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,430
and my sister alive.

65
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,140
These arrowheads here

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,310
were taken from the flaming arrows then.

67
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,000
During the imperial banquet,

68
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,630
Zhang Xiyin was attacked again.

69
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,710
This blade was pulled from the assassin.

70
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,030
Tonight,

71
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,430
the Zhous died.

72
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
These arrowheads
came from the assassin too.

73
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,360
Coincidentally,

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,750
they all bear the same pattern.

75
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,920
What can these arrowheads

76
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,830
prove?

77
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,290
They can be forged anywhere.

78
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,480
The pattern of the star

79
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,430
is the emblem of the Empress of Dayu.

80
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,360
Who would dare to forge them?

81
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,870
Father, this...

82
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,710
Enough.

83
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,870
Now, all the evidence is here.

84
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,390
What more can you say?

85
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Yes.

86
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,160
I did want to kill Zhang Xiyin.

87
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,870
Li Yuewan is my daughter.

88
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,480
It's my duty to protect her.

89
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,480
What's wrong with that?

90
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,000
Zhang Xiyin keeps provoking me.

91
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,240
Does she not deserve to die?

92
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,080
You...

93
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,800
Li Xinwan.

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,430
You have truly let me down.

95
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,680
From this day on,

96
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,800
you are stripped of your title

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,560
and confined to Qiankun Palace.

98
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,070
Without my command,

99
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,880
you may not leave the palace.

100
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
As for you,

101
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,120
since you know nothing of this,

102
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,950
then treat your Mother

103
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,160
as if she has passed away.

104
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,270
Humph.

105
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,430
Father, Father!

106
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,040
Please take back your order.

107
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,390
Withdraw your command.

108
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,240
Father!

109
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,750
Please withdraw it!

110
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,560
Step aside.

111
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,150
Leave.

112
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,590
Xuanming.

113
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,950
Mother.

114
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,160
It was I who killed them.

115
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,000
You need not cover for me.

116
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,170
I'll go

117
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,310
and explain it to Father now.

118
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,150
Xuanming.

119
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,920
Li Yuewan's task has failed.

120
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,170
I've arranged for someone

121
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,820
to take her somewhere safe.

122
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,830
You have more pressing matters.

123
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,360
You must get the complete
Trade Route Map

124
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,950
from the Zhangs.

125
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,120
The Trade Route Map?

126
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,510
Only

127
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,870
the imperial merchants
can hold this map.

128
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,000
I must have it.

129
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,240
From here on,

130
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,950
everything depends on you.

131
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,240
Mother,

132
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,720
once I ascend the throne,

133
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,720
the whole realm will be yours.

134
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,870
Why do you want that map?

135
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,630
It's for our future

136
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,830
and the greater cause.

137
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,120
Xiyin.

138
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,870
Why are you suddenly here?

139
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,070
Father, you still won't tell me
the truth even now?

140
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,560
Why is the Empress targeting us?

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,120
Xiyin...

142
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,040
I've thought about the reason

143
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,560
why she keeps targeting us.

144
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,000
Maybe it's for the Trade Route Map.

145
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,240
In that case,

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,630
we are in greater danger.

147
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,000
Fine.

148
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,390
As things have come to this point,

149
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,240
I won't hide it from you anymore.

150
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,830
What's this?

151
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,390
This is the key to the Map.

152
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,950
But why is it incomplete?

153
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,950
The key is split into three parts.

154
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,270
The most crucial piece

155
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,750
is the one you hold now.

156
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,070
The other two are with me and Shou'an.

157
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Shou'an knew you'd come,

158
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,510
so

159
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,920
he gave me

160
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,600
his piece.

161
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,800
The Map was granted by His Majesty.

162
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,720
Only imperial merchants possess it.

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,630
It's a hidden route
for transporting goods

164
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,870
that stretches across Dayu and Xiliang.

165
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Can it also serve military uses?

166
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes.

167
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,630
Aside from His Majesty and us,

168
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,950
no one knows its exact location.

169
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,800
So,

170
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,750
we must guard our post
as the imperial merchant

171
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,270
for generations.

172
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,270
Then why does the Empress
want it so badly?

173
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,360
Could it be...

174
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,450
Useless fools.

175
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,500
You can't even secure a few shops.

176
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,350
Yes, yes.

177
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,270
Xuanming,

178
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,830
why are you so upset?

179
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,830
Go away.

180
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm just furious at Zhang Xiyin.

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,980
She opposes the Ministry of Revenue
at every turn

182
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,040
as the imperial merchant.

183
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,360
She's just a lowborn woman.

184
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,000
Dealing with her is no trouble at all.

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Xuanming, no need to be upset.

186
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,430
I manage the Ministry of Revenue,

187
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,510
yet it's hard for me
to allocate money to palaces.

188
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,360
Xuanming,

189
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,560
no need to worry.

190
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,800
As an imperial merchant,

191
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,920
she handles every aspect
of the Palace's needs.

192
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,390
One slightest mistake

193
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,630
can easily crush her.

194
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,750
In that case,

195
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,830
I'll leave it to you.

196
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,200
My Lady, this wine smells delightful.

197
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,040
It was worth your time
choosing it yourself.

198
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,910
Only the finest wine is fit
for His Majesty's longevity banquet.

199
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,600
Your taste never fails.

200
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,600
Stop.

201
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,870
Who are you?

202
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,910
How dare you not curtsy
to Princess Yongjia?

203
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,360
Greetings, Your Highness.
I'm Zhang Xiyin.

204
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,200
Oh.

205
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,120
Your family is the one
clinging to the imperial merchant title.

206
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,910
We earned that title through capability.

207
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,890
We're not clinging to it.

208
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,790
How insolent!

209
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,910
How dare you defy me?

210
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,170
What are these things?

211
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,150
This is the wine
for His Majesty's longevity banquet.

212
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,230
Open them.

213
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,940
(Wine)

214
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,550
How bold of you.

215
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,870
How dare you offer
such poor wine to Father?

216
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,270
The chosen imperial merchant
lacks taste indeed.

217
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,680
You can't even pick the proper wine.

218
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,490
I almost mistook it for swill.

219
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,870
Guards.

220
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,120
Zhang delivered poor wine to the Palace

221
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,270
and harbored ill intentions.

222
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,000
Smash all this swill for me.

223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,910
Your Highness,

224
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,270
this wine is of the finest quality

225
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,910
from its ingredients to its craft.

226
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,030
Why not try it yourself?

227
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,240
How dare you offer such wine
to the Princess?

228
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,270
Do the Zhangs wish to lose their heads?

229
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,630
If the wine is truly so fine,

230
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,000
why don't you

231
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,030
taste it for me first?

232
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,960
I am a Rank II Countess
by His Majesty's edict.

233
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,800
If I err,

234
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,630
His Majesty will punish me.

235
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,120
Your Highness,

236
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,790
are you overstepping your bounds?

237
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,360
Since when do I need
a commoner to instruct me?

238
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,240
I'll do it myself.

239
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,720
Enough.

240
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,510
Even you can't drink this wine.

241
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,360
How dare you present it to Father?

242
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Open your eyes and see

243
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,630
what you should fight for

244
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,150
and what you cannot afford to offend.

245
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,800
Let's go.

246
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,040
My Lady.

247
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,200
