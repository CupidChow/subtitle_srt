00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:42,020
=The Fallen Lady Returns=

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,260
Your Highness,

4
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,620
everything has been checked.

5
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,220
This maid is truly from Xiliang.

6
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,020
Seems someone in the Palace
is covering for them.

7
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,660
You've pushed Xiliang

8
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,100
beyond the borderlands.

9
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,770
What could they be after now?

10
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,400
We must find out

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,700
who brought them into the Palace.

12
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,340
Only then will we know their aim.

13
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,500
I'm on it.

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,620
The maid who tried to kill you
was from Xiliang.

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,780
Why would someone
from Xiliang target you?

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,100
By all reason,

17
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,260
you've had no ties
with the Palace at all.

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,860
Yet you were attacked
right after leaving Qiankun Palace.

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,860
Could it really be the Empress's doing?

20
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,820
I don't think so.

21
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,300
What makes you say that?

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,220
I admit my mistake.

23
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,020
Your Highness.

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,700
You must've noticed it too.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,820
The Empress confessed so easily

26
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,140
as if she was shielding someone.

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,820
Only the primary wives
can attend imperial banquets.

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,940
Li Yuewan is just a secondary wife

29
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,300
but was invited by the Empress.

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,780
Could it be because of her?

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,540
Why would she want to kill you?

32
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,900
I suspect

33
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,300
it's because she is
the Empress's daughter.

34
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,220
What?

35
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,300
Surely, you know

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,540
Li Yuewan saved Zhou Yihong
at the borderlands

37
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,660
so the Empress arranged the match,

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,500
making her Zhou Yihong's secondary wife.

39
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,100
The Empress rarely leaves the Palace.

40
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,660
Why would she care so much
for a woman from the borderlands?

41
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,180
She even prepared her dowry.

42
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,300
Don't you think

43
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,620
there's something odd?

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,380
From what I've seen,

45
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,780
the Zhous treat her

46
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,380
with utmost caution.

47
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,580
The whole family cherishes her dearly

48
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,700
as if afraid to offend her.

49
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,660
If Li Yuewan is truly
the Empress's daughter,

50
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,300
then the First Prince's status

51
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,620
may not be as legitimate as it seems.

52
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,820
Even if what you say is true,

53
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,600
it's surely not enough

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,840
for her to try to kill you

55
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,860
in the well-guarded Palace

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,260
to fight for Li Yuewan's place.

57
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,500
So, there may be
an even deeper plot behind this.

58
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,580
Since they've made their move,

59
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,620
I'll have to play along.

60
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,020
My Lady.

61
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,420
Just now, more nobles

62
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,740
sent these invitations and gifts,

63
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,980
asking for your visit.

64
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,140
My Lady, I don't quite understand.

65
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,660
With Prince Ji backing us,

66
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,300
why not let him handle

67
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,500
the Empress and the Zhous?

68
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,860
My problems

69
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,540
should be dealt with by myself.

70
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,940
But wouldn't that be hard for you?

71
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,540
Silly girl.

72
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,900
The Empress holds great power.

73
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,460
Prince Ji's footing
in the capital is shaky.

74
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,460
Bringing down the Empress won't be easy.

75
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,540
So,

76
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,700
(Chrysanthemum Assembly)
we need more leverage.

77
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,140
I tended

78
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,740
all these chrysanthemums.

79
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,800
They're lovely.

80
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,950
Who is this lady
with the Grand Princess?

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,360
Why have I never seen her before?

82
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,780
It's Zhang Xiyin.

83
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,860
The Countess of Grace and Virtue

84
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,210
whom Prince Ji calls his advisor.

85
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,940
Oh, it's her.

86
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,300
Greetings, Your Highness.

87
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

88
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,540
You may all rise.

89
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,770
Jinyang,

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,450
the chrysanthemums in your garden

91
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,600
are truly splendid this year.

92
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,220
What brings you here today?

93
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,620
Please sit.

94
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,450
So beautiful.

95
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,060
How lovely.

96
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,480
I've never seen such flowers before.

97
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,170
The Tricolor Chrysanthemum

98
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,930
truly lives up to its reputation.

99
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,140
As expected of someone
who loves chrysanthemums.

100
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,060
To nurture such beauty is no small feat.

101
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,580
Even someone as ordinary as I am

102
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,340
wants to take it home for myself.

103
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,390
However,

104
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,940
with the Countess here,

105
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,180
she'll surely win

106
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,260
the Tricolor Chrysanthemum.

107
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,940
Are you suggesting

108
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,180
that I withdraw from the bidding?

109
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,180
I...

110
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,340
Is it that you wish to win it
for the Empress

111
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,820
but are short on money

112
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,220
and fear I might outbid you?

113
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,620
It seems everyone favors
the Tricolor Chrysanthemum.

114
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,940
Let us begin the sale at once.

115
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,220
The Assembly opens for bidding,

116
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,300
with part of the proceeds for the state

117
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,420
and part to help settle the refugees.

118
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,780
The starting bid is 500 guan
for this flower.

119
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,980
The highest offer claims it.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,850
Six hundred.

121
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,770
Seven hundred.

122
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,620
Eight hundred.

123
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,820
- One thousand.
- Twelve hundred.

124
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,380
Five thousand.

125
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,060
I offer 5,000 guan

126
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,500
for this flower

127
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,940
to present it to the Empress.

128
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,060
May Your Majesty be blessed with health.

129
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,240
May all your wishes come true.

130
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,820
Jinyang,

131
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,300
what do you think?

132
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,900
If Lady Yuewan says so,

133
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,340
who would dare bid higher now?

134
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,580
It'd be like competing with Her Majesty.

135
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,980
Your Majesty,

136
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,380
only a treasure like this suits you.

137
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,580
However,

138
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,340
5,000 truly feels too little.

139
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,960
I shall offer

140
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,940
100,000 guan

141
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,380
to present it to the Empress.

142
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,380
What?

143
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,390
100,000 guan?

144
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,620
Compared to that,

145
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,180
Lady Yuewan's offer just now

146
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,580
seems rather modest.

147
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,380
110,000.

148
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
150,000.

149
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,350
160,000.

150
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,300
180,000.

151
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,260
Stop.

152
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,420
We don't have that much.

153
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,340
Lady Yuewan, if you lack the money,

154
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,580
you should stop.

155
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,660
Pretending to be wealthy

156
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,100
is more embarrassing

157
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,860
than having no money.

158
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,660
200,000.

159
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,900
In that case,

160
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,260
I'll let you have it.

161
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,740
After all, we're family.

162
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,780
Your gesture

163
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,340
is my gesture.

164
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,940
Xiyin,

165
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,100
you set me up.

166
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,540
Why would you say that?

167
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,980
You set the price yourself.

168
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,900
It has nothing to do with me.

169
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,140
Congratulations.

170
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,060
Your Highness, I followed the clues

171
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,740
and looked
into Li Yuewan saving the heir.

172
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,840
I found two people who saw

173
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,620
Li Yuewan and Zhou Yihong
at the borderlands.

174
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,040
Now I've brought them both back.

175
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,420
Your Highness, we've done nothing wrong.

176
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,460
Please be fair.

177
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,320
My Lady, a letter from Prince Ji.

178
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,260
You two once served Li Yuewan

179
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,700
at the borderlands?

180
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,700
This is the Countess.

181
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,980
Tell her everything you know.

182
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,260
Alright.

183
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,100
My name is Danhong.

184
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,610
This is my sister, Yuegui.

185
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,420
When Ms. Li was at the borderlands,

186
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,890
she rented our house

187
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,340
and hired us to serve her.

188
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,980
But later on,

189
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,180
she moved out overnight

190
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,900
somehow.

191
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,860
Yes.

192
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,300
She didn't even pay us our wages.

193
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,460
Do you have any proof?

194
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,580
Yes.

195
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,180
These are our identity papers.

196
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,340
And here's the deed Ms. Li signed.

197
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,580
(Signed by: Yuegui, Danhong)

198
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,860
So you knew she was
from the capital all along?

199
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,520
Yes, by her accent,

200
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,080
it was clear she was from the capital.

201
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,420
She even bragged to us,

202
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,980
saying everything she wore and used

203
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,340
came straight from the capital.

204
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,620
What she said most often

205
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,500
was

206
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,740
about her remarkable fiance

207
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,700
who doted on her.

208
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,140
At first, we didn't believe her.

209
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,170
We thought

210
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,980
she was just some nobleman's mistress

211
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,420
kept outside the capital.

212
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,020
It wasn't until Prince Ji

213
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,180
found us

214
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,340
that we learned

215
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,900
her fiance was

216
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,640
Marquis Ding'an's heir.

217
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,140
Zhou Yihong, Marquis Ding'an's heir,

218
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,980
escaped a disaster

219
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,020
when handling refugees
at the borderlands

220
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,580
because Lady Yuewan risked her chastity

221
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,820
and sheltered him in her room.

222
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,740
Do you two

223
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,860
know about that?

224
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,060
How could that be possible?

225
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,380
Our house is

226
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,980
right near Prince Ji's tent.

227
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,260
No refugees would be so bold.

228
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,820
Could there be a mistake?

229
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,700
Ms. Li

230
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,020
was kept there by her fiance.

231
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,300
From time to time,

232
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,940
we even saw her fiance

233
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,970
come to visit her.

234
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,050
Is this truly so?

235
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,250
Of course.

236
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,280
My Lady,

237
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
we would never dare to lie.

238
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,140
Li Yuewan and Zhou Yihong
clearly conspired

239
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,540
and hooked up early on,

240
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,060
yet they still tricked you
into that marriage.

241
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,420
Can you do me a favor?

242
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,540
Of course.

243
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,740
I need you both
to help me put on an act.

244
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Once it's done,

245
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,860
I'll let you work
at a shop of the Zhangs

246
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,180
and live an affluent life.

247
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,380
That's wonderful!

248
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,740
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

249
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
Thank you.
