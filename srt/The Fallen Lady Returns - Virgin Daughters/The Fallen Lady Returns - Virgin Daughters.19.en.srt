00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Zhang Xiyin.

4
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,340
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,110
You should ask Zhou Yihong.

6
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,840
So you're the one
Zhou Yihong brought back.

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,840
Now that he's the Grand Preceptor,

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,850
you come running after him again?

9
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,870
Why not say Zhou Yihong
locked me here

10
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,680
and wants to start anew with me?

11
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,770
Impossible.

12
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,150
Zhou Yihong said
he felt nothing for you

13
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,640
and only pretended
for the deposed Empress's sake.

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,480
You can't even keep a man by your side.

15
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,150
How pitiable.

16
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,400
I will kill you right now.

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,150
Take me to see Duan Xuanming.

18
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,540
Don't even think about it.

19
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,640
I'll say it once more.

20
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,840
Take me to see Duan Xuanming.

21
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,320
Zhang Xiyin.

22
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,790
Let Yuewan go.

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,380
You said she meant nothing to you.

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,760
So why keep her around?

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,480
Zhou Yihong.

26
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,920
She destroyed your family.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Why keep her by your side?

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
Shut up. Stop making things worse.

29
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,550
Zhang Xiyin.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Let Yuewan go.

31
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,270
Zhou Yihong.

32
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,950
I've given up so much for you.

33
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,460
How could you turn your back on me?

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
Zhou Yihong.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,000
Didn't you swear to love only me?

36
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,870
Prove it to me.

37
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,470
Kill her,

38
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,150
and I'll be with you.

39
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,270
Zhou Yihong.

40
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,000
I've given up so much for you.

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,960
Yet you'd kill me for this woman?

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,120
Xiyin.

43
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,750
Let's start over.

44
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,800
I want you dead.

45
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,750
If I can't survive,

46
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,400
neither can you.

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,200
Xiyin.

48
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,870
Let's begin anew.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,840
Oh?

50
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,800
Isn't this Uncle?

51
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,190
How did you end up like this?

52
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,520
Duan Xuanming.

53
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,430
I knew you'd lose patience.

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,000
As expected, you came here to die.

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,800
Uncle.

56
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,070
Seeing you now

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,120
reminds me of your mother.

58
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,390
She willingly drank the poison
Mother prepared

59
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,560
just to save you and your sister.

60
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,510
Truly remarkable.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,900
Duan Xuanming.

62
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,980
You beast, shut your mouth.

63
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,680
What did you say?

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,950
Why?

65
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,180
Did I say something wrong?

66
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,680
Back in Dayu, you were a Prince,

67
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,930
but even then, your uncle outshone you.

68
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,360
Even His Majesty punished you
for Prince Ji's sake.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,500
Shut up.

70
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,190
Now in Xiliang,

71
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,110
you think your identity
can make you a King here,

72
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,810
yet the King of Xiliang
still won't take you in.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,190
He lets you stay in this tiny mansion.

74
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,840
Seems to me

75
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,510
that even Xiliang refuses
to accept who you are.

76
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,170
Zhang Xiyin, you're seeking death.

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,440
You...

78
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,000
Xiyin.

79
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,920
I've avenged Mother.

80
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,030
How is it?

81
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,800
The spy has reported back.

82
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,070
The First Prince and the Princess

83
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,120
are both gone.

84
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,070
Your Majesty.

85
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,390
My condolences.

86
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,120
I have let him down.

87
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,630
I failed to protect his son.

88
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,400
Your Majesty.

89
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,510
Now is not the time for tears.

90
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,560
The King of Xiliang won't blame you.

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,640
Right now,

92
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,950
what to do about Duan Jianli
and Zhang Xiyin?

93
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,750
They'll surely return
from the Zhangs' trade route.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,750
Send word to our people:

95
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,070
Make sure they

96
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,040
don't make it back alive.

97
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
Understood.

98
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,360
Your Highness, hold on a little longer.

99
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,720
We're almost at the capital.

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,260
They outnumber us.
We can't fight head-on.

101
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,830
Once I break through the enemies,

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,050
you must ride away at once.

103
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,120
No. If we die, we die together.

104
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
I won't die.

105
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,510
Trust me.

106
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,030
Jianli!

107
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,800
Don't cry.

108
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,560
Sometimes,

109
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,440
I wonder

110
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,200
whether you would've been

111
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,000
a little happier

112
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,480
and wouldn't have been so sad

113
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,200
if we'd met a bit earlier.

114
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,430
Don't say such foolish things.

115
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,770
You promised to marry me

116
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,630
and care for me all my life.

117
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,480
You can't break your word.

118
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,680
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,510
I might not

120
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,440
be able to keep that promise.

121
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,040
Jianli.

122
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,200
Your Highness.

123
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,920
Help her onto the horse.

124
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,230
- Your Highness.
- Take her away.

125
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,820
Hurry up.

126
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,690
Your Highness.

127
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,810
Your Highness!

128
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,020
Your Highness.

129
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Your Highness!

130
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,460
Your Highness.

131
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,620
Your Highness!

132
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,980
Your Majesty.

133
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,180
Prince Ji and I have found the truth.

134
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,460
Duan Xuanming is the son
of the King of Xiliang.

135
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,740
Years ago, Li Xinwan
conspired with the King of Xiliang.

136
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,180
They swapped a daughter for a son
to seek the throne

137
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,940
in order to control Dayu.

138
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,600
(Duan Xuanming is the son
of the King of Xiliang)

139
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,780
(He was sent to the Palace)

140
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,740
Li Xinwan

141
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,540
is so bold.

142
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,300
Lady Zhang.

143
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,940
Why are you alone?

144
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,460
Where is Jianli?

145
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,900
He is dead.

146
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,480
What?

147
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,700
The deposed Empress's assassins

148
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,940
killed him.

149
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,300
Impossible.

150
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,620
Jianli is the God of War of Dayu.

151
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,540
Even thousands of enemies
couldn't slay him.

152
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,100
How could he die so easily?

153
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,840
That cannot be.

154
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,700
Your Majesty.

155
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,100
This is all my fault.

156
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,420
He was shunned in the Palace as a child,

157
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,740
and I could not stop it.

158
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,580
Now he has been killed.

159
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,820
I failed to keep him safe.

160
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,140
I have let him down.

161
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,580
Go.

162
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,940
Bring Li Xinwan to me.

163
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,020
That won't be necessary.

164
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,460
Your Majesty, you need not summon me.

165
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,180
I have come on my own accord.
