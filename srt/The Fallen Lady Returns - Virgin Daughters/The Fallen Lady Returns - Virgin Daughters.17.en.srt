2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,920
The Map really helped us
reach Xiliang faster.

4
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,760
Your Highness.

5
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,520
What did you just call me?

6
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,100
I'm not sure.

7
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,580
What should I call you?

8
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,420
You already know.

9
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,820
Let me think.

10
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,860
Jianli.

11
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,060
Is that what you mean?

12
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,540
Think again.

13
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't know.

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,660
Is my address to you

15
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,740
really that important?

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,580
Of course.

17
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,860
Honey.

18
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,180
Yeah.

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,420
Dear.

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,180
We were in a hurry.

21
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,060
Only this empty room is left.

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,200
The room

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,100
is a bit small,

24
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,260
so you'll have to bear with it.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,380
I find it quite cozy.

26
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,740
Feels a bit like home.

27
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,420
Glad you like it.

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,430
Well.

29
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,310
You

30
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,350
should get some rest early.

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,440
Your Highness.

32
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,920
What are you looking for?

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,620
I was careless.

34
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,100
I didn't expect
there to be just one brazier.

35
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,720
It's all right.

36
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,260
You rest first.

37
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,980
Wait a moment.

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,060
That won't do.

39
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,460
It's so cold tonight.

40
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,140
Could you bear

41
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,060
with me tonight?

42
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,620
Let's squeeze in together tonight.

43
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,060
Dear.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,800
Honey, why call me so late?

45
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,700
You're awake too.

46
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,220
I'm not used to this bed.

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,020
You'll have a rough night then.

48
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,740
Does sharing a bed with you mean
it'll be a tough night?

49
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,560
Well then.

50
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,350
If you don't mind,

51
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,020
as we're here sharing a bed,

52
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,740
dear,

53
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,340
shouldn't you take the responsibility?

54
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,380
What do you mean?

55
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,620
Shouldn't you
take the responsibility instead?

56
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,060
Sure, I'd love that.

57
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,020
What are you trying to do?

58
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,980
Honey, please stop.

59
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,420
The walls here are quite thin.

60
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,060
It's a bit noisy.

61
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,900
Someone might hear us.

62
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,260
I'll be gentler.

63
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,700
Is this better for you?

64
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,700
Miss.

65
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,540
Go ahead and open it.

66
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,480
Which one do you want?

67
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,940
Wait, look at this one.

68
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,740
How about this one?

69
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,540
Yes, of course. Take care.

70
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,860
Pick as you please. Come inside.

71
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,500
This one is quite cute.

72
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,460
This one's nice too.

73
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,460
Come and take a look.

74
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,300
I'll wrap this up for you.

75
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,580
Sure.

76
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,420
This one.

77
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,140
That's really amusing.

78
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,260
Come over and take a look.

79
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,980
How beautiful.

80
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,340
It's new. How nice.

81
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,490
Do you like it?

82
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,060
Yes.

83
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,140
Thank you.

84
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,980
Alright, got it.

85
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,870
Most husbands gift flowers or hairpins,

86
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,660
but mine truly stands out.

87
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,620
If you want those, I can buy them too.

88
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,930
No need, I just want this one.

89
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,580
This is from you,

90
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,980
and it can protect me.

91
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,380
Still, gifts go both ways,

92
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,580
so I have something for you.

93
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,190
The qilin means good fortune.

94
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,400
With this by your side,

95
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,300
when you're on the battlefield,

96
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,160
you'll be safe and sound.

97
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,900
Well.

98
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,900
Thank you, dear.

99
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,580
Hey.

100
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,140
If you wish to stay, pay your rent.

101
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,080
I support my family
by selling Gastrodia Elata.

102
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,660
My business has just got started lately.

103
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,060
How could I afford rent?

104
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,100
You don't have the money?

105
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,940
Then get out of here.

106
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,140
Get lost.

107
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,810
You just wait and see.

108
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,700
Thank you for your help.

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,930
Thank you so much.

110
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,270
There are so many merchants here.

111
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,780
Why do they only bully you?

112
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm just a Gastrodia Elata seller.

113
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,970
But oddly, it hasn't sold at all here.

114
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,290
Recently, the Grand Preceptor's family

115
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,900
suddenly placed a large order with me.

116
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,220
I just made a little money,

117
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,100
but those thugs noticed it.

118
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,000
They come every few days
for a protection fee.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,140
The Grand Preceptor's family?

120
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,540
They've almost bought out all our stock.

121
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,400
Duan Xuanming has had an ear problem
since childhood.

122
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,340
So, there's always Gastrodia Elata
in the Palace.

123
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,500
It seems his symptoms
have been acting up lately.

124
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
I suppose

125
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,840
he must be
at the Grand Preceptor's Mansion now.

126
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,400
Then we should find a chance to visit.

127
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,330
Yes.

128
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,920
All the Gastrodia Elata
is packed up here.

129
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,200
Are they about to be delivered?

130
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,010
Yes, this batch just arrived.

131
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,240
It needs to be sent
to the Grand Preceptor's Mansion.

132
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,510
You should look after the shop.

133
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,650
Let us deliver it for you.

134
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,740
Ah, alright.

135
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,580
Thank you.

136
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,860
(Li Yuewan.)

137
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,900
(She's alive.)

138
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,060
What's wrong now?

139
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,620
Do you really think
you're the Grand Preceptor?

140
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,860
How dare you address me like that?

141
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,900
If not for me,

142
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,100
would you be where you are now?

143
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,200
Your mother has given you up
for Duan Xuanming,

144
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,780
yet you still dream of being a Princess.

145
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,740
- You...
- Get out.

146
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,920
What are you doing here?

147
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,140
Delivering Gastrodia Elata.

148
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,500
How many times must I say it?

149
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,080
I don't want to see Duan Xuanming again.

150
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,790
Tell him to leave.

151
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,020
- Or else...
- Enough.

152
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,220
Let's speak inside.

153
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,780
The medicine is here.

154
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,040
Yes.

155
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,220
Just as I guessed,

156
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,720
Duan Xuanming is indeed
at the Grand Preceptor's Mansion.

157
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,340
But his room is heavily guarded,

158
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,710
so

159
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,060
I didn't rush in recklessly.

160
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,980
Today, at the Grand Preceptor's Mansion,

161
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,900
I saw Zhou Yihong and Li Yuewan.

162
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,780
Zhou Yihong?

163
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,140
Wasn't he supposed to be dead?

164
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,840
This must be another plot
of the Empress.

165
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,220
Now, the Grand Preceptor of Xiliang

166
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,060
is Zhou Yihong.

167
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,540
Forget about them for now.

168
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,020
Our goal is to kill Duan Xuanming.

169
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,820
But his room is heavily guarded.

170
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,180
It's not easy to get close to him.

171
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,330
We need to find a way to lure him out.

172
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
I have an idea.

173
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,580
Zhou Yihong.

174
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,300
Let's start with him.

175
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,460
I destroyed his family.

176
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,020
He must hate me to the core.

177
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,170
- If I...
- No.

178
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,620
It's far too risky.

179
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,600
My mission

180
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,460
can't be completed
at the cost of your safety.

181
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,840
Your Highness.

182
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,020
Duan Xuanming is also...

183
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,140
I said no, and that's final.

184
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,980
Your Highness, what are you doing?

185
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,820
Don't think you can use yourself as bait

186
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,260
while I'm gone.

187
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,020
I don't want you to take this risk.

188
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,060
I'm not afraid.

189
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,420
