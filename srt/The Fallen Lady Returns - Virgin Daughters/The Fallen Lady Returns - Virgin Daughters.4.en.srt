=Episode 4=

3
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,710
Your Highness.

4
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,150
My Lady.

5
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,790
My Lady, My Lady.

6
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,510
My Lady.

7
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,920
My Lady.

8
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,280
My Lady.

9
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,070
My Lady.

10
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,180
(Meditation Room)

11
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,590
(Lion's Roar)
Greetings, I'm Zhang Xiyin.

12
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,990
Please, have a seat.

13
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,960
Is your foot alright?

14
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,070
It's nothing.

15
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,430
Thank you for your concern.

16
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,400
Thank you for last night.

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,260
Once I return,

18
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,590
I'll report it to His Majesty.

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,430
You are too kind.

20
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,190
This is my duty as your subject.

21
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,420
You were the one

22
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,470
requesting my audience
during the day, right?

23
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,870
Yes.

24
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,680
Rest assured.

25
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,520
You saved my life.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,280
I will never forget this favor.

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Thank you.

28
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,910
I do need

29
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,080
a favor from you.

30
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,450
Yihong.

31
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,730
You came for me in such haste.

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Is something wrong?

33
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,000
Prince Ji captured the ones
we sent to set fire

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,520
to Huaguang Temple last night.

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
It's all right.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,520
They are all loyal servants of Mother.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,840
However,

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,470
Princess Jinyang was also
at the temple last night.

39
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,360
She was saved by Zhang Xiyin.

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
Yuewan,

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,150
hurry to the barracks now,

42
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,210
tell them

43
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,400
that Zhang Xiyin brought her servants
into the temple,

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,840
trying to harm Princess Jinyang,

45
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,200
and that I've found the evidence,

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,560
and ask them to help at once.

47
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,470
Yihong,

48
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,310
this plan is brilliant.

49
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,270
Go ahead.

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
Stop right there.

51
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,280
You assassins.

52
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,410
How dare you set fires
and attack the Princess!

53
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,310
Zhou Yihong!

54
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,470
What nonsense are you saying?

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,410
Master Yihong,

56
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,400
my lady and this official
just saved the Princess.

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
The Xiliang spies
have entered the capital.

58
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,230
Zhang Xiyin, you brought
your servants here without reason.

59
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,240
And it just so happens the Princess
was here too?

60
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,450
There was even a sudden fire.

61
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,120
All these strange clues make clear

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,870
that you've conspired with Xiliang.

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
I was there at the scene.

64
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,960
I can vouch that Zhang Xiyin
has no ties with Xiliang.

65
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,660
You want to vouch for her?

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,310
Who do you think you are?

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,520
I am

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Duan Jianli.

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,370
How dare you

70
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,590
pretend to be Prince Ji?

71
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,190
You must be seeking death.

72
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,310
Arrest them.

73
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,220
Don't you dare lay a hand on Prince Ji.

74
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,510
(Order)
Look at this.

75
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,680
Greetings, Your Highness.

76
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,310
Greetings, Your Highness.

77
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,680
How dare you not kneel

78
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,360
before me?

79
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,680
Greetings, Your Highness.

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
Sorry for offending you.

81
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,040
I beg you for forgiveness.

82
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,510
Just now, you said

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,680
the Xiliang spies
have entered the capital.

84
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,730
How did you come to know this?

85
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,120
I only overheard it...

86
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,630
You leaked military secrets

87
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,610
and shall be executed.

88
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,570
Please calm your anger.

89
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,240
I was misled by rumors.

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,120
I came here out of fear that Zhang Xiyin
might collude with Xiliang.

91
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,160
Everything I did

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,160
was for the sake of Dayu.

93
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,830
For Marquis Ding'an's sake,

94
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,370
I'll spare your life this time.

95
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,160
Let there not be a next time.

96
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,880
Yes.

97
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,000
Lady Xiyin.

98
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,320
There's still no verdict
on the fire at Huaguang Temple.

99
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,680
You must assist in the investigation
at my mansion.

100
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,270
Your Highness.

101
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,040
She is my wife.

102
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,920
Staying with you may spark rumors.

103
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,310
Are you threatening me?

104
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,880
Xiyin,

105
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,390
don't forget.

106
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,000
You're still my primary wife.

107
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,950
My choice today
has nothing to do with you.

108
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,190
The fire at Huaguang Temple
is no small matter.

109
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,390
As the lineal daughter
of the Zhang Clan,

110
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm willing to assist Prince Ji
in his inquiry.

111
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,160
Wait outside for me for a moment.

112
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,270
What are you doing?

113
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,710
What are you doing?

114
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,190
You saved me last night.

115
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,830
Naturally, I must tend to your wounds.

116
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,390
Your Highness,

117
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,800
do you suspect me as well?

118
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,040
Ordinary ladies bring

119
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,600
only a few servants at most
when praying.

120
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,440
But yesterday,

121
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,870
you brought many servants.

122
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,630
Have you forgotten

123
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,000
someone wants to harm me?

124
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,770
It seems you already know

125
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,240
who set the fire.

126
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
So what if I know?

127
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,770
The Zhangs are a family
of imperial merchants.

128
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,560
Yet the Zhous dare act so boldly

129
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,360
as to try to burn Princess Jinyang.

130
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Don't you find this odd?

131
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,590
This...

132
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,560
So,

133
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,660
what's your conclusion?

134
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,750
Across the capital,

135
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,270
only someone from the imperial family

136
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,920
could allow them to act so brazenly.

137
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,630
(The Xiliang spy knew about the fire.)

138
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,600
(The Zhous set the fire.)

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
(Could the Zhous
truly be linked to Xiliang?)

140
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,700
(Perhaps I can use this
to investigate further)

141
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,310
(about who is behind them.)

142
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,240
You saved my sister.

143
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,870
I must repay you.

144
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,640
Tell me what you want.

145
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,040
I want you

146
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,800
to look into a matter for me.

147
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,080
I'm listening.

148
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,630
I wish to know what happened

149
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,120
to Li Yuewan and Zhou Yihong

150
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,000
at the borderlands.

151
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,750
You may speak plainly.

152
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,930
What exactly do you want to know?

153
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,600
What I wish to uncover is

154
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,510
Li Yuewan's true identity.

155
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,960
I wonder what Prince Ji sees in her.

156
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,400
The Zhangs are a family
of imperial merchants.

157
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,720
I heard Prince Ji
has long lacked supplies

158
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,550
at the borderlands.

159
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,070
Perhaps,

160
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,390
he has long set his sights
on the Zhangs' fortune.

161
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
If you ask me,

162
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,840
you two should wed as soon as possible

163
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,720
so the Empress will be at ease.

164
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,960
Only then can we secure
all the business of the Zhangs.

165
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,710
Mother,

166
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,460
why not take advantage of the wedding

167
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,470
and have Xiyin hand over
household stewardship?

168
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:24,540
(Marquis Ding'an's Mansion)

169
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,940
(Erudite and Resolute)

170
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,230
My Lady,

171
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,520
under the pretext of preparing
for Li Yuewan's wedding,

172
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,760
the Marchioness has been granted leave
to return home.

173
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,000
Marquis Ding'an

174
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,210
wouldn't have let her be detained
for long anyway.

175
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,540
The Empress wouldn't ignore this either.

176
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,410
My Lady,

177
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,610
if you ask me,
let's not return to the Marquis Mansion.

178
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,100
They're preparing for the wedding
and must be short on funds.

179
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,910
Now that you're in charge
of the household,

180
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,360
they'll surely ask you for money.

181
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,630
Strategists step into the game.

182
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,080
Now that the game has begun,

183
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,790
there's no reason to retreat.

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,960
(In my past life,)

185
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,370
(Li Yuewan seized household stewardship
to prepare the wedding)

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,790
(and used the phoenix hairpin
to frame me for offending the Empress,)

187
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,960
