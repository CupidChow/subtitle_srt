3
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,000
Unexpectedly,

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,280
we've grown so distant over time.

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,390
Since your return,

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,390
I haven't really asked you:

7
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,790
These past years,

8
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,030
how have you been?

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,240
I've been alright.

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,960
I think of you quite often.

11
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,790
Back then,

12
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,870
I was too young

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,950
and blamed you for Mother's death.

14
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,150
If not for that,

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,840
you wouldn't have left for so long.

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,680
Everything

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,590
is my fault.

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,310
I'm so sorry.

19
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,150
Jinyang,

20
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,760
actually,

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,350
all these years,

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,590
I never blamed you.

23
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,950
Then why did you avoid me?

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,920
I feared I'd bring you trouble.

25
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,200
- Someone poisoned you again?
- Jinyang.

26
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,150
These people are truly heartless.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,510
Even after Mother is gone,

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,200
they still refuse to let you go.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,790
You're accused of being born
under a curse

30
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,560
based on a reckless claim
by the Astronomical Bureau.

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,230
It's truly outrageous.

32
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,680
This is the Black Mandrake.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,510
It's proud and hard to tend

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,350
with petals shaped like sickles,

35
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,760
and the whole plant is poisonous.

36
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,240
So, most people avoid raising it.

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,400
Yet,

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,840
it can save your life.

39
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,910
Jinyang, won't you eat?

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,280
I've eaten.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
I'm not hungry.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,640
Jinyang.

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,310
I've grown up now.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,030
From this day forward,

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,240
I can protect those I wish to guard.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,890
You've been gone for a long while.

47
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,000
Seems I've been played again.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,710
Mind your words.

49
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,870
You're siding with outsiders now.

50
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,710
Well,

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,630
what if we became one family?

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,680
Alright, I've troubled you long enough.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,970
I'll take my leave now.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,840
This time,

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,840
thank you for everything.

56
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,590
No need for thanks between us.

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,470
Seeing you make peace with the Princess

58
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,560
brings me great joy as well.

59
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,840
The war begins soon.

60
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,380
Wait for my return.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The third month comes
after the second one.

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,800
As age grows,
how many springs do we have left?

63
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,480
Don't dwell on endless troubles.

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,160
For now,

65
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,830
let's savor the wine we have.

66
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,520
My Lady.

67
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,360
- My Lady.
- Xiangye.

68
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,680
Didn't I ask you to deliver goods
to the Department?

69
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,100
I did, and it's been delivered.

70
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm here to deliver a message.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,360
You said before

72
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,270
I should tell you news

73
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,410
from the borderlands at once.

74
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,710
There's news?

75
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,430
Prince Ji led a night assault
on the Xiliang Palace,

76
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,560
killed the King of Xiliang,

77
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,580
and reclaimed the throne.

78
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,290
Decades of war between Dayu and Xiliang

79
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,430
have finally come to an end.

80
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,270
Xiliang has perished.

81
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,150
That's wonderful.

82
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,680
What about the Prince?

83
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,830
When will he return?

84
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,240
It should be any day now.

85
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,560
News travels slowly these days.

86
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,480
The war in the news

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,070
happened three days ago.

88
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
My Lady.

89
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,750
Chishu.

90
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,120
Why are you here?

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,180
What about the Prince?

92
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,480
The Prince invites you
to the city gate tower.

93
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,630
This way, please.

94
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,070
Go on.

95
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,270
Sure.

96
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,750
Your Highness.

97
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,240
You're here.

98
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,070
I thought

99
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,430
you'd only return in days.

100
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,000
But I couldn't rest
with worries on my mind.

101
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,870
How could I not hurry back?

102
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,240
The battle is over now.

103
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,600
What else are you worried about?

104
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,710
Well.

105
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
It's about your future

106
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,680
and happiness.

107
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,200
Chishu.

108
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,110
Understood.

109
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,590
Your Highness.

110
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,640
What are these?

111
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,360
Your betrothal gifts.

112
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,630
Xiyin.

113
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,830
My feelings for you run deep.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,630
Today, I wish to make you my wife.

115
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,020
I entrust you with household affairs.

116
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,720
My love for you

117
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,750
will last a lifetime.

118
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
The heaven and earth

119
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,700
can bear witness to my sincerity.

120
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,680
Today,

121
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,720
before everyone here

122
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,190
and

123
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,750
my mother's soul,

124
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,600
I swear I will only love you

125
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,360
in this life.

126
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,200
I will never take a concubine.

127
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,680
I will never let you down.

128
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,750
Lady Zhang,

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,430
why not accept him?

130
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,390
My younger brother,

131
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,000
versed in literature,

132
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,040
and skilled in defending our land,

133
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,600
is truly talented in every respect.

134
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,120
In the entire Dayu,

135
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,560
you won't find a better man

136
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,600
than him.

137
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,680
Xiyin,

138
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,560
the Prince is truly outstanding.

139
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,800
If you marry him,

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,870
I can rest easy.

141
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,190
My dear girl,

142
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,480
just say yes to him.

143
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,480
If you marry him,

144
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,800
your mother and I can be at peace.

145
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,600
Marry him. Marry him.

146
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,520
- Marry him.
- Yes.

147
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,270
I said yes.

148
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,390
What did you say?

149
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,920
I said yes.
