=The Fallen Lady Returns=

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

4
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,370
My son's wife, Zhang Xiyin,
is acting out

5
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,430
and disturbing the wedding.

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,350
Your Highness...

7
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,560
The Imperial Office...

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,470
Marquis Ding'an.

9
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,480
Marchioness.

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
Long time no see.

11
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,200
You are

12
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,430
Prince Ji?

13
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,710
Greetings, Your Highness.

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,340
Lady Xiyin,
there's no need for formality.

15
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,950
You saved my sister.

16
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,620
I heard you're having a wedding here,

17
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,860
so I came to offer my congrats.

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,180
However,

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,680
the Marchioness just said

20
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,310
you were causing unrest.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,930
Is this true?

22
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,830
Well.

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,310
Then I'll tell you everything.

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,310
Your Highness.

25
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,350
I'm too old

26
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,200
to think things through now.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,350
Just now, the bride caused a scene
out of jealousy.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,560
Thankfully, Xiyin was there

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,310
to protect our family's honor.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,150
That's why there was

31
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,310
a disagreement.

32
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,200
Is that right, Xiyin?

33
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,430
Is that what happened?

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,270
Xiyin is always so considerate.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,580
Yuewan can be a bit slow-witted.

36
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,400
Mother, you should comfort Yuewan

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,230
and make sure
she doesn't cause trouble again.

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,240
Alright.

39
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,920
I'll go right away.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,870
I'm going now.

41
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,660
Xiyin,

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,680
if you have trouble, just tell me.

43
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,440
I'll always stand up for you.

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,240
If you'd been shielding her,

45
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,560
why would there be so much idle gossip?

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,850
But you can rest assured.

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,190
I will make sure

48
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,030
she's free from harm.

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
I may have been remiss tonight.

50
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,560
I hope you will pardon me.

51
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,960
There's no slight at all.

52
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,520
Just share a drink

53
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,910
with me.

54
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,280
As for tonight,

55
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,710
I must thank you.

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,400
No need to thank me.

57
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,120
I've found some clues
about what you asked me

58
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,710
to investigate.

59
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,030
Your Highness, look.

60
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,150
Is she telling Prince Ji my origin?

61
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,710
We're finished.

62
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,280
She's a merchant-born commoner.

63
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,430
What could she possibly know?

64
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,330
Your Highness, don't scare yourself.

65
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,750
Go.

66
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,430
Go send a flask of wine to Prince Ji
as an apology.

67
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,630
Yes.

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,520
(Zhang Xiyin,)

69
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,560
(I'll see your name ruined.)

70
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,470
Your Highness.

71
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,470
My Lady.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,870
This is Yuyingchun Wine from us

73
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
as an apology.

74
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,190
Please forgive us

75
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,280
for the poor welcome.

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,400
Leave it here.

77
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,360
Let me pour it for you.

78
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,470
Please.

79
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,260
(Far-Sighted Vision)

80
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,380
Xiyin is having an affair
with Prince Ji inside.

81
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,190
This is no trivial matter.

82
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,230
Are you certain?

83
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,100
Yes.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,940
What are you doing here?

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,400
What happened?

86
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,310
Prince Ji is our guest.

87
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,190
I was telling him about Father's deeds.

88
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,720
Is there anything amiss?

89
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,910
Hold on.

90
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,220
Something's wrong with this wine.

91
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,280
This wine

92
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,720
can bring utter delirium

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,040
and prove the case of adultery.

94
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,030
If so,

95
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,040
then let it be.

96
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,230
Impossible.

97
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,000
I saw you together with my eyes.

98
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,240
Yuewan.

99
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,870
This is Prince Ji.

100
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,560
How can you accuse him of that?

101
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Do you want...

102
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,280
To be executed?

103
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,760
Your Highness,

104
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,240
there may be some misunderstanding.

105
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,360
Well.

106
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,830
It's truly noisy here.

107
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,110
Lady Xiyin,

108
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,190
if you need anything from me,

109
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,750
you may visit me for a talk.

110
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,470
Yihong,

111
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,800
they were very close.

112
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,640
Enough.

113
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,940
Let's not speak of it anymore.

114
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,000
If Prince Ji asks about the wedding,

115
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,920
we'll all lose our heads.

116
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,440
Your Highness.

117
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
Your Highness.

118
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,390
I'm truly grateful to you,

119
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,680
and it is not for myself alone

120
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,480
but for the entire Zhang Clan.

121
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
Your Highness.

122
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,560
I truly wish to be your advisor.

123
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,000
There's no need to reply in haste.

124
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,700
I can wait as long as needed.

125
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
Hyah.

126
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
Hyah.

127
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,980
(Prisoner)

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
The Zhous conspired with the Empress,

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,630
disrespected the imperial family,

130
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,120
and deceived His Majesty.

131
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,320
They

132
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,560
are

133
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,790
to be beheaded

134
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,120
at once.

135
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
Impossible.

136
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,510
Beheaded at once?

137
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,110
I wish to see Mother.

138
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,830
She will surely save me.

139
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,310
Why go to the Palace

140
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,560
to see the Empress?

141
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,630
It's her mother and her fault.

142
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,600
Please spare us.

143
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,630
Please let us go.

144
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
It's all their fault.

145
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,730
I'll give you anything you want.

146
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,870
Show us mercy.

147
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
Please have mercy.

148
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,320
You'll be killed.

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,840
Don't kill me.

150
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,150
What is it, Yuewan?

151
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,470
What's wrong?

152
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,190
Bring Mother here.

153
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,920
Zhang Xiyin wants us dead.

154
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,190
She'll use high treason to kill us.

155
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
Yuewan.

156
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,630
You're scared by what happened today.

157
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,590
It's all right.

158
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,720
Bring Mother here now.

159
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,480
Mother.

160
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,480
Zhang Xiyin must've known something.

161
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,720
Only the Empress

162
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
and we know

163
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,430
about the swap back then.

164
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,720
Yuewan, don't overthink.

165
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,190
When I was taken from the Palace,

166
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,700
was there really no one who saw?

167
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,070
Could Father have missed something?

168
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,560
Father has always been careful.

169
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
How could you doubt him?

170
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,270
Yihong,

171
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,870
if my true origin is revealed,

172
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,150
the entire family and my mother

173
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,240
will be doomed.

174
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,870
We'll all die for that.

175
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,230
Yihong,

176
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,720
perhaps you should dismiss her.

177
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,590
No.

178
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,840
You can't do that before we gain

179
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,400
all the business of the Zhangs.

180
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,850
Yuewan, there's no rush.

181
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,020
We'll decide once the Empress's matter

182
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,670
is settled, okay?

183
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,630
No.

184
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,120
The guests at yesterday's wedding

185
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,080
seem to have known
about my true identity.

186
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,550
I must enter the Palace.

187
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,440
I need to see Mother.

188
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,870
I want to kill Zhang Xiyin.

189
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
Don't worry.

190
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,080
The business of the Zhangs

191
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
will soon belong to us.

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,480
You rushed to the Palace
over such a trifle?

193
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,750
Mother.

194
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,080
Your Majesty,

195
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,120
this concerns life and death.

196
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,790
Zhang Xiyin

197
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
is full of cunning plans.

198
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,320
My sweet daughter.

199
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,800
Be good.

200
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,060
Leave the Palace for now.

201
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,030
When the Mid-Autumn Festival arrives,

202
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,200
I shall invite the Zhous to the banquet.

203
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,910
By then,

204
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,390
the Zhangs

205
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,120
and Zhang Xiyin

206
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,720
will all become prisoners.

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,440
Thank you, Mother.

208
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,030
They

209
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,960
can overhear our talk?

210
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,200
Yes,

211
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,000
but they cannot spread the word.

212
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,840
My Lady,
a letter arrived from court today.

213
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,510
The Zhous may attend

214
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,130
the imperial
Mid-Autumn Festival banquet.

215
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,470
But this banquet

216
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,030
was always for imperial members
and the noble only.

217
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,910
They say the Empress
extended the invitation

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,240
in honor of the heir's merit.

219
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,270
You and the heir are still wed,

220
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,390
so I fear you must attend this banquet.

221
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
Then I shall go.

222
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,720
But this is our first time
to enter the Palace.

223
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,150
The Empress
will surely make things hard.

224
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,750
If I don't go this time,

225
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,000
she'll find

226
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
a hundred new ways to trouble me.

227
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,630
My Lady,

228
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,320
why are you shaking?

229
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,840
Silly girl.

230
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,080
I'm just excited.

231
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
(At last, we'll meet.)

232
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,630
