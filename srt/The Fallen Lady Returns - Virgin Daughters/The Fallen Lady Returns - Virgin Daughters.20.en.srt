00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:42,020
=The Fallen Lady Returns=

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,270
Go.

4
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,920
Bring Li Xinwan to me.

5
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,870
That won't be necessary.

6
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,480
Your Majesty, you need not summon me.

7
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,230
I have come on my own accord.

8
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,870
Li Xinwan.

9
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,620
Are you planning a revolt?

10
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,920
It's been 20 years.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,790
Haven't you had enough of the throne?

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,400
What do you want?

13
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,790
I want you to step down

14
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,200
from what was never yours.

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,040
How dare you!

16
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,920
Do you know all your nine clans
will be executed for this?

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,800
To my family,

18
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,000
I am nothing but a pawn.

19
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,120
They've never treated me as a person.

20
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,590
Why should I care if they live or die?

21
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,230
Duan Jianli is dead.

22
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,680
No one in Dayu can stand
against the Xiliang Army.

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,000
Today, I'll kill you first

24
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,350
and take over the Palace.

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,170
I'd like to see who dares to speak up.

26
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,220
You...

27
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,430
Zhang Xiyin.

28
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,360
What are you trying to do?

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,560
Don't tell me you expect someone
to save you.

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,840
Don't waste your strength.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,870
My men have surrounded this place.

32
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,360
Duan Jianli is already dead.

33
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,630
Even if you beat the drum to pieces,

34
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,310
no one will come to help you now.

35
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,750
Jianli.

36
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,800
Forgive me for arriving late.

37
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,240
I'm so glad you're still alive.

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,910
Why are you still alive?

39
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,400
How could I die

40
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,150
before you?

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,470
Our journey back won't be smooth.

42
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,560
The deposed Empress
will surely send killers.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,840
Exactly.

44
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,560
So we must be ready ahead of time.

45
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,030
You've got an idea?

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,000
Since she wants us gone,

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,430
then we should

48
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,800
put on a little show

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,280
and then catch her off guard.

50
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,730
You read my mind.

51
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,520
I've already sent letters

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,470
to Chishu and Mr. Feng.

53
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,150
They'll meet us on the trade route.

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,590
Good. I've prepared iron armor as well.

55
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,000
We'll all wear it then.

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
Sure.

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,800
So what?

58
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,710
Even if you survive by chance,

59
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,240
what can you do?

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,360
We've got you surrounded.

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,870
Even if I die today,

62
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,120
do you think you can face

63
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,380
the Xiliang Army
with just the likes of you?

64
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,630
Don't even think about it.

65
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,190
(Order)
Those useless men outside are gone.

66
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,500
(Order)

67
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,630
Impossible.

68
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,200
They are all valiant generals
I have trained myself.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,750
Seize the deposed Empress

70
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,150
and all the rebels.

71
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,400
Your Highness,

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,730
there's another army outside.

73
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,930
Kill them.

74
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,840
Yes.

75
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,710
Wait.

76
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,560
Are those Xiliang troops outside?

77
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,430
Of course.

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,830
I've prepared for this day

79
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,560
for over ten years.

80
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,320
Your Highness.

81
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,600
Do you still remember

82
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,430
what we saw in Xiliang?

83
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
Just like those in the capital,

84
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,470
people there also have families
waiting at home.

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
They shouldn't be sacrificed

86
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,430
because of the rulers' greed.

87
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,870
You've fought for years
on the battlefield

88
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,360
for the sake of peace, right?

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,390
If we wipe them out like this,

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
wouldn't all those efforts be wasted?

91
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,150
Xiyin,

92
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,190
if you want me to spare them,

93
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,190
there's only one way:

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
Have every one of them

95
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,060
yield to Dayu.

96
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,270
Let me give it a try.

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Soldiers,

98
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,390
as you can see,

99
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,410
in a situation like this,

100
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,870
resisting now is pointless.

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,480
If we don't resist,

102
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,980
it'll still be a dead end for us all.

103
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,120
Why not fight our way out instead?

104
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,010
- Yes, let's fight!
- Let's fight!

105
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,000
Who said it'd be a dead end?

106
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,250
If you're willing to lay down your arms

107
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,960
and surrender,

108
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,630
His Majesty is merciful

109
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,210
and will let you leave.

110
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,390
We're all from Xiliang.

111
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,000
We have no place here at all.

112
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,360
No need to worry about that.

113
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,100
On behalf of the Zhang Trading House,

114
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,580
I offer you work at our shops.

115
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,390
A decent position awaits you.

116
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,390
You all have family back home.

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,830
Will you stay together in peace

118
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,360
or see your family destroyed?

119
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,040
I believe in your hearts,

120
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,720
you've already made your choice.

121
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,430
If I could leave for decent work,

122
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,830
we wouldn't have to fight every day.

123
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,160
- True.
- Right.

124
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,800
No more living in fear

125
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,560
of dying on the battlefield.

126
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,040
We are willing to follow His Majesty.

127
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,920
Long live the Emperor!

128
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,950
My Lady, now that the Empress is gone,

129
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,460
the King of Xiliang is making moves.

130
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,710
Prince Ji is about to lead the troops
to restore order.

131
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,800
Once he returns victorious,

132
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,640
our days ahead

133
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,430
will no longer be filled with fear.

134
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,520
Chishu.

135
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,790
I've heard the Prince
has been gathering supplies lately.

136
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,920
Let me know what you need.

137
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,610
Clothing and medicine
are in greatest need.

138
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,050
The borderlands are remote and cold.

139
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,190
With the coming war,

140
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,470
supplies are quickly depleted.

141
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,270
Even with funds from the court,

142
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
it's often long delayed

143
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,630
when they reach the soldiers.

144
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,920
So, how did you manage before?

145
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,190
The Prince often sold his belongings.

146
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,340
Otherwise,

147
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,000
it was common for soldiers to freeze.

148
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,980
No wonder

149
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,630
there's not much to do at his mansion.

150
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,400
Xiangye,

151
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,070
go invite the two shopkeepers

152
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,600
from our trading house.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,840
Yes.

154
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
My Lady.

155
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,070
What do you mean by this?

156
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,600
Courtesy should be repaid in kind.

157
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,120
I called you two here today

158
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,630
because war is on the horizon.

159
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,430
I'd like to gather supplies
for Prince Ji

160
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,820
to donate to the soldiers.

161
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,070
How much do you want?

162
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,360
One million guan.

163
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,350
That's quite a lot.

164
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,270
Enough to last three to five years.

165
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm sure you know

166
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,430
what happened to me recently.

167
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,920
If not for Prince Ji,

168
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,120
I wouldn't be standing here now.

169
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,310
This debt must be repaid.

170
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,270
Experienced soldiers
wear out their armor.

171
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,510
The border soldiers
left their lives behind

172
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,470
just to guard our land.

173
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,270
That's why we can do business in peace.

174
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,320
So,

175
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,680
helping them means helping ourselves.

176
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,580
Don't worry.

177
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,920
We will do our utmost.

178
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,270
Baoji Business has plenty of herbs,

179
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
but transporting them isn't easy.

180
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,240
If we can make them into pills,

181
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,820
the transport will be easier

182
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,250
without compromising their efficacy.

183
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,750
But it will take some time.

184
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,920
I'll give you seven days to prepare.

185
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,390
How you do it is up to you.

186
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,710
I only care about the outcome.

187
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,830
Rest assured.

188
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
My Lady.

189
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,870
(Follow the Path of Virtue)

190
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,060
My Lady, this is
from Princess Jinyang's Mansion.

191
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,330
Did they leave any messages?

192
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,080
The Princess heard

193
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,230
that you are preparing supplies
for the borderlands.

194
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,730
She said

195
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,790
if you needed help,

196
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,680
you could visit her.

197
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,180
(Princess Jinyang's Mansion)

198
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,030
Xiyin, you're here. Please sit.

199
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,510
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Sit.

200
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,180
I heard you often lend a hand

201
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,750
to the poor

202
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,620
and care about the borderlands' affairs.

203
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,870
How kind of you.

204
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,690
As an imperial merchant of Dayu,

205
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,890
I should aid the nation.

206
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,220
You've done much better than me.

207
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,240
I know I was right about you.

208
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,910
If there's anything else you need,

209
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,390
just tell me.

210
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,910
I'll send the supplies
to Prince Ji's Mansion soon.

211
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,590
I'm sure once the Prince receives them,

212
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,980
he'll be most pleased.

213
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,550
There's no need to tell him this.

214
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm worried...

215
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,070
Xiyin,

216
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
do you know

217
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,150
Jianli hasn't returned to the capital

218
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,270
since he left for the borderlands?

219
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,470
I've vaguely heard of it.

220
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,870
Actually, it's my fault.

221
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,910
Back then, we were just children.

222
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,320
The Empress turned me against him

223
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,150
and let me foolishly blame
Mother's death

224
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,120
entirely on him.

225
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,110
Mother.

226
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,500
The Consort Dowager died
because of Prince Ji.

227
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,800
She was always in good health

228
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,860
but started falling ill
after giving birth to him.

229
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,960
Shush.

230
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,440
That year, he was just six

231
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,200
and followed the Grand General
to the borderlands.

232
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,280
In those years,

233
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,840
I went to the borderlands to find him,

234
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,550
but he refused to see me

235
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,820
or accept anything from me.

236
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
If not for Brother's decree,

237
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,440
he most likely wouldn't have come back.

238
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,910
I still owe him an apology.

239
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,670
There must be a reason

240
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,120
for refusing to see you.

241
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,030
With an advisor like you by his side,

242
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,240
I feel at ease.

243
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,320
Your Highness,

244
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,240
there's something I need your help with.

245
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,790
What is it?

246
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,720
I recently bought some flowers,

247
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,670
but none of the arrangements feel right.

248
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,790
I hope you can visit and advise me.

249
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,310
I'd love to.

250
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,960
You're up so early today.

251
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,200
I've prepared some gifts for you.

252
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,430
Would you like to take a look?

253
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,630
Is that all?

254
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,630
There's more.

255
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,510
Your Highness,

256
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,000
guess what's inside this chest.

257
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,080
Cotton?

258
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,720
Your Highness, why not open it?

259
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,480
It's wool.

260
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,870
Lightweight and warm.

261
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,080
Plus, it absorbs moisture well.

262
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,720
This way, the borderland soldiers

263
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,150
won't have to suffer the harsh cold.

264
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,340
And these shoes and socks.

265
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,030
All have extra wool and goose feathers.

266
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,730
Though the scent is a bit strong,

267
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,390
it keeps people warm.

268
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,300
The soldiers...

269
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,760
When were these prepared?

270
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,160
Seven days ago.

271
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,630
So much was readied in just seven days?

272
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,310
It wasn't just my doing, of course.

273
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,630
You're perceptive.

274
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,000
Seeing all these chrysanthemums,

275
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,080
haven't you guessed who helped?

276
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
My sister.

277
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,250
Princess Jinyang
has always cared for you.

278
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,740
She knew I was gathering supplies,

279
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,950
so she gave me a great hand.

280
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,720
Since both of you care about each other,

281
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,870
why not take this day

282
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,030
to confess to each other?

283
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,510
I still need to prepare some dessert,

284
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,450
so I'll take my leave.

285
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,510
Jinyang.
