00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:42,020
=The Fallen Lady Returns=

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,180
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,960
My Lord,

4
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,710
I found phosphorus powder on him.

5
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,810
Come with me to have a look.

6
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,270
Zhang Xiyin,

7
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,710
what are you doing?

8
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,320
Of course,

9
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,990
I'm catching the thief.

10
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,440
My Lord,

11
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,960
the missing imperial gifts are found.

12
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,430
Whose storeroom is this?

13
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,840
The Marchioness's.

14
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,110
Zhang Xiyin,

15
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,630
how could you be so cruel

16
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,630
to hide the imperial gifts
in Mother's storeroom

17
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,600
to frame her?

18
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,480
You truly are a merchant's child.

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,960
So cunning and sly.

20
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,960
Guards, take her away.

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,800
Don't you dare move.

22
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,300
Loot is needed to convict a thief.

23
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,020
We've caught
both the thief and the loot,

24
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,600
yet you still try to frame me.

25
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,230
My dear daughter-in-law.

26
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,630
Your imperial gifts are our honor.

27
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,130
These imperial gifts

28
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,100
just made a round trip

29
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,500
and returned to our mansion.

30
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,660
If you truly desire them,

31
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,940
just take them all home.

32
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,810
They're all yours.

33
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,570
These are always my imperial gifts.

34
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,970
How can a few words

35
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,570
turn them into your charity?

36
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,730
You are the wife of the heir.

37
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,730
You must keep our mansion's honor
in mind.

38
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,480
If reputation matters to you,

39
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,980
you wouldn't resort to such acts.

40
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,880
You...

41
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,760
We are all family here.

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,900
Let us settle this as kin.

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,080
Why not tell the official

44
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,430
that this is all a misunderstanding

45
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,280
and ask him to return?

46
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,710
Mother, you don't think
that could erase

47
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,290
what happened today, do you?

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,940
Dear,

49
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,820
how dare you do such disgraceful deeds
behind my back?

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,030
Honey, I'm sorry.

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,410
I should not have acted on my own.

52
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,100
Honey, please forgive me.

53
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,020
Honey, honey.

54
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,010
She's failed His Majesty.

55
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,970
Take her away.

56
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,130
Zhang Xiyin.

57
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,840
Zhang Xiyin, you scheming woman.

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,750
I will have Yihong abandon you.

59
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,340
Just wait.

60
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,970
Zhang Xiyin.

61
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,540
(Marquis Ding'an's Mansion)

62
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,900
It seems the entire mansion

63
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,810
lacks the person I'm seeking.

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,290
I'll remember

65
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,680
your kindness.

66
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,260
In the future, come fire or flood,

67
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,410
please command as you wish.

68
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,400
That won't be necessary.

69
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,740
Since this place

70
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,940
does not have what I want,

71
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,320
let's end our cooperation here.

72
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,260
May I ask who you're looking for?

73
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,890
That doesn't concern you.

74
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,220
I guess

75
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,780
the person you seek

76
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,620
is related to Xiliang.

77
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,340
Zhang Xiyin.

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,900
It's impossible

79
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,540
to use me again.

80
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,420
Your Highness, will you reconsider?

81
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
(In the entire Dayu,)

82
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,780
(only he can rival the Empress.)

83
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,740
(Since he refused me,)

84
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,860
(I must find another way.)

85
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,960
Zhang Xiyin,

86
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,530
how dare you frame my mother?

87
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,050
I'll kill you!

88
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,980
Are you seeking death?

89
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,110
Have you come to your senses?

90
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,540
Mother's robbery is now known citywide.

91
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,700
Do you want your women's scandal

92
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,200
to become gossip across the city?

93
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,500
Do not forget

94
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,340
it was Mother

95
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,240
who tried to set me up first today.

96
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,250
If you wish to stand up for her

97
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,290
and want me dead,

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,940
go ahead.

99
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,640
All this began
with His Majesty's imperial gifts.

100
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,010
If you kill your wife here,

101
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,690
what about your position as the heir?

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,700
You and Li Yuewan's wedding draws near.

103
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,180
Whether it'll be a celebration
or a mourning

104
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,940
is up to you.

105
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,260
You've done all this

106
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,020
just to keep me from marrying Yuewan?

107
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,260
The moment you signed that affidavit,

108
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,530
you were already dead to me.

109
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,220
Very well.

110
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,080
Let me ask you this.

111
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,720
You've stayed in the mansion for years.

112
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
When did you have contact
with the Imperial Office?

113
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,340
Yihong.

114
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,340
Yihong, please do not be upset.

115
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,940
Return to the room with me.

116
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,480
Xiyin, you should rest well.

117
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,340
Yihong.

118
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,860
Yihong.

119
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,260
Don't worry.

120
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,220
I've written to Mother.

121
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,700
Mother will return soon.

122
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,120
For now, we must endure this.

123
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,220
Do not jeopardize the plan.

124
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,540
That vile woman

125
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
conspired with outsiders against us.

126
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
Rest assured.

127
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,180
Once Mother secures the Zhangs' things,

128
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,900
I will ensure her clan falls.

129
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,180
My Lady.

130
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,260
My Lady, are you okay?

131
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,300
Zhou Yihong won't let this go.

132
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,540
We must win Prince Ji's favor fast.

133
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,940
But His Highness declined you last time.

134
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,820
We must find another way.

135
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,980
At this point,

136
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,740
we can only seek help from others.

137
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,940
(Princess Jinyang)

138
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,060
(Princess Jinyang
is Prince Ji's eldest sister.)

139
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,780
(Perhaps she could be my go-between)

140
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,860
(Meditation Room)

141
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,540
(to resume my partnership
with Prince Ji.)

142
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,740
My Lady, Princess Jinyang is here.

143
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,220
I'll begin my meditation now.

144
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,580
No one is to disturb me.

145
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,860
Understood.

146
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,300
Wait for me here.

147
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,260
Yes.

148
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm Zhang, an imperial merchant,

149
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,740
seeking an audience with Her Highness.

150
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,480
The Princess is meditating. No visitors.

151
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,160
Please leave.

152
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,140
But I have urgent matters to discuss.

153
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,140
Please leave.

154
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,530
My Lady.

155
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,580
The Princess won't see you.

156
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,520
What should we do now?

157
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,800
It's still early.

158
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,360
Once the Princess finishes meditating,

159
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,740
we'll request an audience again.

160
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,420
Alright.

161
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,780
Your Highness, that's him.

162
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,900
Do you have any proof?

163
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,940
We found this

164
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,780
on him.

165
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,700
Xiliang has lost for years,

166
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,660
yet you still haven't learned.

167
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,500
Do you really think

168
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,220
sneaking into Dayu

169
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,980
and stealing a few battlefield maps

170
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,170
would guarantee your victory?

171
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,220
My Lord, I'm innocent.

172
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,540
Speak! What is your true aim?

173
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,790
I'll talk; I'll talk.

174
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,220
I'll tell you everything.

175
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,620
Set fire to Huaguang Temple.

176
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,390
This is the latest news.

177
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,130
That's all I know.

178
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,650
Please spare me.

179
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,180
Huaguang Temple?

180
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,000
Isn't that where Princess Jinyang stays?

181
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,620
My sister...

182
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,720
My Lady, something's wrong.

183
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,840
The Great Hall is on fire.

184
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,540
Hurry!

185
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,960
Go alert the visitors in the temple.

186
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,180
Tell everyone to run at once.

187
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,620
Find more servants for help.

188
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,490
- Yes.
- Sure.

189
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,940
Hurry and move!

190
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,220
