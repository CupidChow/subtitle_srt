=Episode 5=

3
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,630
Xiyin.

4
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,030
Sorry

5
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,110
about those rewards.

6
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,670
I'm here to apologize today.

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,150
As your daughter-in-law,
I dare not accept.

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,460
Xiyin, look.

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,320
Mother made this soup for you

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,070
with the finest ingredients.

11
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,470
Even after all you've done,

12
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,740
Mother still treats you kindly.

13
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,070
You should accept her goodwill.

14
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,790
The soup is too hot now.

15
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,310
I'll let it cool before drinking.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,600
Here, Xiyin.

17
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,760
Have a cake to cleanse your palate.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,430
Thank you.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,070
If you have something to say,

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,400
please don't hold back.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,920
I don't know

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,590
how to ask you.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,510
Then think it through before you speak.

24
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,910
I'm done eating.

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,990
Xiyin.

26
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,020
As mistress of the mansion,

27
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,430
you hold the household stewardship.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,790
But you need to rest now,

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,230
and with my wedding coming,

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,230
I feel bad troubling you.

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,430
So?

32
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,350
So, Xiyin,

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,870
why not let me handle the household?

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,740
Don't worry.

35
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,070
I'll just manage it temporarily.

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,120
Once you're well,

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,230
I'll return it to you.

38
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,510
Then I'll trouble you with this.

39
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,710
You'd really let me do it?

40
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,310
If you don't wish to,

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,790
I can keep managing things too.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,960
I want to.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
Zhang Xiyin is so shameless.

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,630
Why are all these trunks empty?

45
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,590
Well.

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,710
Yuewan, stop looking.

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,430
Did she hide
the family's money somewhere?

48
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,000
Yuewan,

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
I...

50
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,870
I'll go ask her for the ledger now.

51
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,960
If she really hid any money,

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
you must write her a dismissal letter

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
and let her leave.

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,120
No, that's not it.

55
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,710
Li Yuewan is here.

56
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,470
Xiyin, I was just wondering

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,910
why you gave up the stewardship
so quickly.

58
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,260
As it turns out,
you've long gotten the money.

59
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,960
Why not check the accounts carefully

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,870
and see what the money was spent on?

61
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,170
So you were falsifying
the accounts all along

62
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,120
to ruin Yihong and my wedding.

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,960
Is that it?

64
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,310
Young Master,

65
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,120
should I explain it,

66
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,800
or will you confess to her?

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Enough.

68
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,630
Don't try to sow discord.

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,160
Yuewan, let's go.

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,120
I'm not leaving.

71
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,120
I won't leave

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,060
until things are clear.

73
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,030
Look at you now.

74
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,000
You must be unaware

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,190
of the fact

76
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,030
that there's no money left.

77
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,870
That can't be.

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,030
Our family is vast and wealthy.

79
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,590
How could there be no money?

80
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,080
Ever since I married the heir,

81
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,520
they've long been drowning in debt.

82
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,590
It was my dowry
that paid off what they owed.

83
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,680
Then my family kept the mansion afloat.

84
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,000
Now that the heir and I live apart,

85
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,360
the accounts

86
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,070
must be kept separate too.

87
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,310
Is everything she said true?

88
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Securing an official post

89
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,610
ended up costing quite a bit.

90
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,830
Then what about our wedding?

91
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,950
That's a fair question.

92
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,000
A secondary wife is like a concubine.

93
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,070
Unless the whole city is stirred up,

94
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,160
I'm afraid

95
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,510
no one would know your true status.

96
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,020
I'll find a way for the wedding.

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,580
At worst, let Mother

98
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,750
ask some kin to help out.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,300
Paying for a wedding with debts?

100
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,430
If word gets out,

101
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,600
it'll be disgraceful.

102
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
No.

103
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,120
I can't borrow money for my wedding.

104
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,130
With my status,

105
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,530
how could my wedding seem so humble?

106
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
I understand.

107
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,560
Can we discuss this later?

108
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,990
Hurry.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,420
If we're late, the gates will close.

110
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
Yes.

111
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
My Lady,
Li Yuewan has entered the Palace.

112
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,310
Let's wait for her good news.

113
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,910
Xiyin,

114
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,680
on the 5th of next month,

115
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,390
it's an auspicious day.

116
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,290
That's when Yihong and I
will have our wedding.

117
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,750
Congratulations.

118
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,000
Tribute silk.

119
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,160
An imperial treasure.

120
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,000
(Erudite and Resolute)
How joyful.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
Congratulations to you.

122
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,870
Congrats.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,840
Please come in.

124
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,800
- Come in, please.
- Congrats.

125
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,390
You're here; please step in.

126
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,040
Congratulations.

127
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,630
A perfect match.

128
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,480
Indeed.

129
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,430
Such a fine couple.

130
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,430
A perfect match.

131
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,000
Why isn't Zhang Xiyin here yet?

132
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,430
Lady Xiyin is here.

133
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,270
This is Lady Xiyin?

134
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,360
Yes, indeed.

135
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,150
She carries herself so well.

136
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,430
Graceful and elegant.

137
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,120
She really is poised.

138
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,600
Her manners are impeccable.

139
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,360
Yes, that's right.

140
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,160
What an honor she brings.

141
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,000
That's right.

142
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,510
Xiyin, have some tea.

143
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,590
Xiyin.

144
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,220
I'm sorry; I didn't mean it.

145
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,800
It's all right.

146
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,310
Xiyin, your hairpin...

147
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,270
Oh, dear.

148
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,630
Your hairpin...

149
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,590
Oh, my.

150
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,800
That is a phoenix carved on it.

151
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,120
Only the Empress can wear a phoenix.

152
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,870
Lady Xiyin, you broke a serious rule.

153
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,390
This could cost you your life.

154
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,800
How improper this is.

155
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,760
Oh, no.

156
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,270
Xiyin, do you want

157
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,310
to doom the whole family
to steal my thunder?

158
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,320
Zhang Xiyin,

159
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,720
how could you be so cruel?

160
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,950
Take off her headpiece now.

161
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,920
Don't let her ruin my son's marriage.

162
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,270
Mind your manners.

163
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,150
Everyone,

164
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,920
the hairpin I wear is an oriole,

165
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,120
not a phoenix.

166
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,120
A phoenix has three tails,

167
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,630
but an oriole has only two.

168
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,600
My Lady,

169
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,870
Lady Yuewan heard
you've run out of gold,

170
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,800
so she asked me to bring you a coronet.

171
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,360
My Lady, why did Li Yuewan gift you

172
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,790
such a fine hairpin?

173
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,790
Look again, carefully.

174
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,390
It's a phoenix.

175
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,550
Only the Empress may wear this.

176
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,630
My Lady, that's punishable by death.

177
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,510
Take this design

178
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,790
and ask a craftsman outside
to make me a coronet.

179
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,670
It truly is an oriole.

180
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,030
Wait.

181
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,150
This bridal gown
is embroidered with a phoenix.

182
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,510
It really is a phoenix.

183
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,440
Yes, it certainly is.

184
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,790
The phoenix is
part of the imperial bridal regalia.

185
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,360
Does that mean you are a Princess?

186
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,670
Or are you daring enough

187
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,750
to pretend to be a Princess?

188
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,600
That's nonsense!

189
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,480
I bought all of this myself.

190
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,790
Do not slander me.

191
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,510
Everyone,

192
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,440
the Zhangs are imperial merchants.

193
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,840
When it comes to the attire

194
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,480
of the imperial family and the nobles,

195
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,730
one mistake

196
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,200
would bring harm to the Zhangs.

197
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,630
Would I risk the entire clan

198
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,150
just to accuse you unfairly?

199
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,920
Zhang Xiyin,

200
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,320
have you not caused enough trouble?

201
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,350
Enough.

202
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,830
Enter the bridal chamber
with Yuewan first.

203
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,040
Mother,

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,670
wearing imperial attire
to marry in secret

205
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,150
is defying His Majesty.

206
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,600
If word of this gets out,

207
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,750
we'll face public scorn.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,960
Even Father's honors

209
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,270
could be at risk.

210
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,630
Yuewan,

211
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,390
even your hairpin

212
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,150
and rouge are imperially used only.

213
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,790
Yeah. How dare she do this?

214
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,750
This cannot be allowed.

215
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,340
How reckless she is.

216
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,270
Could it be you brought them
from the borderlands?

217
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Yes, that's right.

218
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,550
Some daring merchants sold them to me.

219
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,390
Young Master,

220
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,510
since you brought Yuewan
back from the borderlands,

221
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,030
I've sensed something is off.

222
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
How could a weak woman like her

223
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,750
possibly save a Feather Guard like you?

224
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,410
- You...
- Your past is a mystery.

225
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,630
Your identity remains unclear.

226
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,850
You hesitate with your answers.

227
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,630
Could you be a Xiliang spy?

228
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,910
No.

229
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,080
I was born in the capital.

230
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,220
When exactly were you born?

231
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,550
Who was the midwife at your birth?

232
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,790
Was there an imperial member
born that day?

233
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,860
Zhang Xiyin,

234
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,810
have you lost your mind?

235
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
Prince Ji is here.
