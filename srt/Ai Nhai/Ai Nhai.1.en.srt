1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,760
I'm sorry ...

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,720
for my misbehaving. But I want you to love me even when I’m not so loveable. Can you?

3
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,360
Hub.. Umm…

4
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,880
Hub.. Hub..

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,960
Hah…

6
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,760
c

7
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,520
You're so irritating!

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,520
Oh… Dating a young one, you must be lonely when they have an exam.

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,840
You have the exam too. Don’t you know?

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,240
My motto is… Don’t stress out about exams.

11
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,520
Let it be the professors' job to stress out over our answers.

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,560
Yeah… Mr. cool guy.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,039
But this page says there’s a chance for Aries to fail the exam.

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,440
Shit! What do I do?

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,800
I think… We should make a move!

16
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,560
I mean a move to study.

17
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,960
Oh.

18
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,680
Hurry. Let’s go to library.

19
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,360
Alright.

20
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,400
Come on.

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,800
I’m not free this evening.

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,880
Aw… Where’re you going?

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,200
It also says that the lover of your zodiac might be changed.

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,880
Nonsense! That can’t be trust.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,280
You can. It always accurate.

26
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,160
It’s not!

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,079
It is!

28
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,720
It’s not! I’ll tell N’Chol that you spread fake news.

29
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,960
Chol won’t believe you because Chol loves me.

30
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,360
You give me sick!

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
Let’s go.

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,079
I’m so starving. What’s the time now?

33
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,920
Shit! We’ve been here for 3 hours!

34
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,440
Agh!! (Frustrated voice)

35
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,800
What’s next? Shall we go to eat?

36
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,560
How about Chol?

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,320
Chol’s reading.

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,400
I think I’ll wait for Ai.

39
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,360
When will he get back? You’d die of hunger.

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
Hello… Yes, I’m finish.

41
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,560
Okay. I’m going. The same place, right?

42
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Got it.

43
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,560
You see? My happiness is here. See you then.

44
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,839
Why don’t he come for you?

45
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,320
Does he stop picking up his beloved now?

46
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,520
Wait. This is strange.

47
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,200
There’s nothing strange. There’re a lot of cars today.

48
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,120
He might not find anywhere to park.

49
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,320
Really?

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,600
Um.

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,440
I guess so. He supposes to stock a lot of foods for you by now.

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,400
Wow!

53
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,800
I want more.

54
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,040
Those, too.

55
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,640
Nhai...

56
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,600
Nhai... Nhai!

57
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,560
Have you gone crazy?

58
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,159
At least he has time for me. Unlike yours.

59
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,360
So… See you later. Bye.

60
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,520
Bye.

61
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,960
He parks here.

62
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,120
Aw! Hey, why there’s no food?

63
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,480
Get in. Should we go?

64
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,600
Well, why your car is so empty.

65
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,800
I just went to wash my car. Is there anything?

66
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,520
Is that all your stuff? Didn’t you want to borrow books?

67
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,520
Jeez! Right!

68
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,000
You forgot again…

69
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280
Get in the car, I’ll bring them for you.

70
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,320
Hey! It’s here.

71
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,600
You can’t open it. Sorry.

72
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,560
I can’t open it…

73
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,280
Why?

74
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,320
Are you hungry? Let’s go. I’ll order something for you to eat. Come.

75
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,760
I think you are change.

76
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,520
Hmm..

77
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,080
how am I change?

78
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,320
You look so quiet lately.

79
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,640
You didn’t come to pick me up, as usual,

80
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,040
and you always remind me if I forget anything.

81
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,320
Well, I was thinking of picking you up, but…

82
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,120
Are you really madding at me?

83
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,640
How about we travel to Nan this weekend? There’s a new resort open.

84
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,160
No!

85
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,040
Why?

86
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,720
You don’t love me the same.

87
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,200
Are we at that point of a relationship?

88
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,960
What?

89
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,160
Is it because I didn’t pick you up?

90
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,280
It’s not just that.

91
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,640
I’ve been thinking for a while.

92
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,320
A while? How long is it?

93
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,640
Am I so wrong?

94
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,480
You’re not wrong, but you’ve changed.

95
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,880
You don’t love me anymore, right?

96
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,800
Good…

97
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,400
I don’t love you anymore, too!

98
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,440
Nhai!

99
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
When was I don’t love you?

100
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,800
And why did you say you don’t love me?

101
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
Hmm? Are you hangry?

102
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,120
Come on. Let’s get up. I’ll order food for you.

103
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,720
- I’ll order food for you.
- No!

104
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,080
I will stay with Ton tonight!

105
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,520
Nhai,

106
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,280
just think carefully.

107
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,840
You know I don’t like you to walk away during our fight.

108
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,560
Really?

109
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,560
But I like it!

110
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,120
What’s wrong with him?

111
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,200
Come appease me.

112
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,400
I can’t help it.

113
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,280
I’ll serve you right!

114
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,760
Aw! What’re you doing? Where’re you going?!

115
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,520
Aiyares!

116
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,520
You’ll pay for this!

117
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Are you angry at him or are you actually hangry?

118
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,640
Salad!

119
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,840
Fried Chicken!

120
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,000
Nhai… Are you all right?

121
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,760
I’m worried about you now.

122
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,520
Gosh! You jerk!

123
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,000
If he’s guilty, it’s because he didn’t bring food for you.

124
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,720
You’re always like this every time you’re hungry.

125
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,120
Right! It’s his fault!

126
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
He also doesn’t care to appease me.

127
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,960
It’s your fault, too.

128
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,160
He took his effort bringing you books.

129
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,400
Worried that you’d hungry.

130
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,200
It’s too late now.

131
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,560
So, you love him better than me now?

132
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
Wait. When did you think I love you?

133
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Ton!

134
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,320
Jeez!

135
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,320
Are you going to be mad about this shit?

136
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,920
But I really think he’s changing.

137
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Like…

138
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,160
He’s trying to hind me with something.

139
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,960
I think…

140
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,960
when it comes to the right time,

141
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,480
he’ll tell you once he’s ready.

142
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,600
Huhh…

143
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,440
I’m so full.

144
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,120
Well, you are happy now?

145
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,320
Do you think he’s still angry at me?

146
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,920
How should I know?

147
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,520
Why don’t you ask him yourself?

148
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,160
Text him.

149
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,200
Ton… He ignores me!

150
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,760
Whoa! Just call him!

151
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,800
Ton… Help me.

152
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,160
Help me, please,

153
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,800
please, please…

154
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,560
Alright!

155
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,200
Too close.

156
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,720
What’s up, Ai?

157
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,640
Are you fighting with Nhai?

158
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,680
Are you still angry at him?

159
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,440
No?

160
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,040
Oh… Not at all.

161
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,280
So,

162
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,520
you want him to stay with me tonight?

163
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,280
Okay.

164
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,480
Are you going to Nan?

165
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,200
I see.

166
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,720
You need time to think it over.

167
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,400
I get it.

168
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,800
That’s all right. I’ll tell him for you.

169
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,640
Okay. Drive safe.

170
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,240
(talking with Nhai) That’s it.

171
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,120
You see!

172
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
He loves me less!

173
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,160
Whoa! Do you think a man like him will love you less?

174
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
Think carefully. He always chases you.

175
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,120
He loves you first.

176
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,080
He’s the one who flirted with you

177
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,840
and always spoiled you.

178
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
If I were him,

179
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,800
I’d be stunned by your words, too.

180
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,920
How dare you say he doesn’t love you?

181
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,320
He even said that he'd never liked what you've done.

182
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,520
You may think there’s no big deal,

183
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:17,880
but… one day, It might change your life forever.

184
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,520
And maybe, today is the day

185
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,280
he runs out of patience with you.

186
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,200
Nhai…

187
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,560
Do you still love him?

188
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,200
What is love to you?

189
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,880
Just to win another?

190
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,120
No…

191
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,440
I never want to break up with him.

192
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,000
I can’t lose him.

193
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,720
You must help me, Ton.

194
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,520
Please! Help me…

195
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,680
Easy, there’s nothing to worry.

196
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Ton! Why did you fool me here?

197
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,400
Gosh! The sunlight,

198
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,200
it's going to burn me now.

199
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,160
Duck face!

200
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,040
Why are you standing there?

201
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,680
Whose car is this?

202
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,960
Did you steal it?

203
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,760
You jerk! I borrow it from someone I know.

204
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,680
Where is Ai?

205
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,200
I took you here. Ask him!

206
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,720
He hasn’t answered me yet.

207
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,240
You said you’ll me.

208
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,880
Help me, please. Please. Please. Please…

209
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,360
Hey, should we go to his house?

210
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
Alright, hold on.

211
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,120
Hello. Where are you?

212
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,960
Oh…

213
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,200
Okay.

214
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,440
He’s not home.

215
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,920
He’s too sad, so he goes somewhere to relax.

216
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,600
Aw!

217
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,800
How can we find him?

218
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,960
Get in the car. I’ll bring you to him.

219
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,560
Are you crazy?

220
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,480
Am I going to be arrested by the police?

221
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,880
You go yourself if you scare this much! I’m off!

222
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,960
Hey! Ton!

223
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,160
Ton!

224
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,240
I’m so sleepy. Let me grab a cup of coffee.

225
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,200
Do you want me to drive?

226
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,000
That’s all right. I want to survive to see my darling.

227
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,360
Hello, chol.

228
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,640
Have you arrived? Um…

229
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,000
Mr. Hub. I’m at Nan now.

230
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,640
How long do I have to chat with myself?

231
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,280
Hub… I’m sorry.

232
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,640
Ai…

233
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,160
You come to see me this far…

234
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,560
Are you tired?

235
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,840
I miss you.

236
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,520
I miss you more.

237
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,520
Not true.

238
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,040
I miss you the most.

239
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,600
I miss you more than the most.

240
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,960
I give up.

241
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,360
Haven’t seen you for just a little while. You've become so likable.

242
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,760
I'm likable?

243
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,120
So, do you like me?

244
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,680
Nhai!

245
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,640
Nhai!

246
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,560
What are you doing?

247
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,520
I left you here just a sec,

248
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,640
and you want to make love with that three?

249
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,680
You dipshit!

250
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,080
Let’s go. I’m ready.

251
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,560
Hurry!

252
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,840
Are you alright. Hmm?

253
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,480
What happens?

254
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,880
- What should I do if he wants to break up with me?
- Aw!

255
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,680
What makes you think that way.

256
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,920
Don’t be serious.

257
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,800
I have to. He’s my hubby!

258
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,800
What if I tell him I’m sorry and confess how much I love him,

259
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,200
Will he… forgive me?

260
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,160
I don’t know.

261
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,280
I’m not your Aiyares.

262
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,640
Mr. Duck’s face.

263
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,120
Well..

264
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,240
I’m just afraid that he won’t love me the same.

265
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,000
My confidence is zero.

266
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,280
I suddenly feel that our relationship is so fragile more than I think.

267
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,080
Keep in mind that your words can hurt your beloved ones.

268
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,440
Why do you have to misbehave if you love him?

269
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,920
You’re paying for what you’ve done.

270
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,720
He’s never given up on you.

271
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,720
But do you want to give up now?

272
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,720
Stop being muddled and think about how you will make up with him. Okay?

273
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,720
I want to see him.

274
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,680
You’ll see him soon

275
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,440
and you must put all of your effort appease him.

276
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,240
Come on.

277
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,480
Ton! I’m coming!

278
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,920
Okay.

279
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,440
Ai!

280
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,560
How can you be here?

281
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,600
This is my regular place.

282
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,840
It’s windy.

283
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,520
Where’s your sweater?

284
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,680
Why haven’t you answered me?

285
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
I want to talk to you.

286
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,960
Now you want to talk?

287
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Then why you walked away that day?

288
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,040
I’m sorry.

289
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,280
It was my fault…

290
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,280
Sorry…

291
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,880
I’m sorry.

292
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,080
You said you don’t love me anymore.

293
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,160
No…

294
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,080
I was just… hangry…

295
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,000
I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t love you.

296
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,400
Please… forgive me.

297
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,280
I promise I’ll be your good boy. Um.

298
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,000
I won’t buy it.

299
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,800
Aw, Ai!

300
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,240
Are you leaving?

301
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,000
Where’re you going?

302
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,280
I’ll go with you.

303
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,520
You should go back with the car you came.

304
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,480
But I want to go with you.

305
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,880
Think carefully, if we are separated

306
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,400
and someone makes me feel good.

307
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,040
What will you do?

308
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,040
Or if some aliens try to kidnap me to their UFO,

309
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,960
you won’t be able to help me in time!

310
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,680
Huhh... Get in the car.

311
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,520
Yes!

312
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,120
You ordered already.

313
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,560
Um. It’s noon and I don’t want someone hangry.

314
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,800
Look good?

315
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,080
A lot.

316
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,520
Thanks.

317
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,920
Don’t worry. I’ll do it.

318
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,600
Thanks.

319
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,000
You’ve been taking care a lot.

320
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,000
Let me return the favor.

321
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,360
This trip, let me be the one who look after you.

322
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,000
But, can I ask you a thing?

323
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,120
Hmm?

324
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,720
Please… don’t stop loving me.

325
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,600
Dad, I’m scare. I can’t tell him.

326
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,040
Have you thought it through fully?

327
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,960
I’ve been thinking for a long time.

328
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,800
I… I can’t stay with him like this anymore.

329
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,720
Listen to me, Ai.

330
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,680
It's normal that people's feelings can be changed.

331
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,480
But you can't rely on yours alone

332
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,600
and forget about his feelings.

333
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,880
Just open up and talk to each other.

334
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,720
Okay?

335
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,440
Okay. I'll talk to him.

336
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,520
But…

337
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,200
If we both think the same way…

338
00:32:53,320 --> 00:33:00,960
Jaonan and I are here to support you in whatever decisions you'll make,

339
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,160
You know right?

340
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,200
Yes.

341
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,080
Thank you so much, both of you.

342
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,440
I'll call you again.

343
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,040
Um.

344
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,120
Nhai.

345
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,560
Hmm?

346
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,520
Nothing…

347
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,160
Let's eat.

348
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,160
Come on.

349
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,320
What do you want? I'll get it for you.

350
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Um.

351
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,800
This one?

352
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,199
Anything else?

353
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,199
Don't worry. Continue your eat.

354
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,159
Fish? I'll remove the bones for you.

355
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,639
Um.

356
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,560
Hello, Mr. Ai. You have booked two rooms, right?

357
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,600
Thank you.

358
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,920
You take this room, Ton.

359
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,800
I'll share a room with my hub.

360
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,200
So, we can fasten our relationship.

361
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,640
Yeah. Whatever!

362
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,640
Let's go, hub.

363
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,720
Hey…

364
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,600
This way… Come.

365
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,480
Well, I'm just a little confuse.

366
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,400
That way!

367
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,720
Go to your room.

368
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,920
Wow!

369
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,400
It's so nice.

370
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,040
Are you going to take a shower?

371
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Um.

372
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,680
You drove a car a whole day.

373
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Tired?

374
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,240
Let me massage you.

375
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,960
Um.

376
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,920
What the hell!

377
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,240
Gosh!

378
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,280
Hub?

379
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,200
Do you have a charger? Can I have it?

380
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,880
Yes, hold on.

381
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,160
Um.

382
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,720
Where is Ai?

383
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,920
Don’t tell me…

384
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
- Get out!
- What?

385
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,240
Don't you love me anymore?

386
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,200
Is that you, Ton?

387
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,360
What do you want again?

388
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,760
Is it here?

389
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Does this belong to Ai?

390
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,800
Has someone tried to trick me here for kidnapping?!

391
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,320
Don't come close!

392
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,720
I'm a professional Taekwondo!

393
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,600
But it's his handwriting…

394
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,840
Why does he ask me out?

395
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,360
Will he go to break up with me here?

396
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,560
What is this?

397
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,880
Hey!

398
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,280
What is this?

399
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,120
Wow.

400
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,400
Ai.

401
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,160
Do you know what today is?

402
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,600
Friday.

403
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,760
It's past midnight. Saturday already.

404
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,240
Happy anniversary.

405
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,600
We've been together for a year now.

406
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,640
So you've never been madding at me?

407
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,040
Why did you tease me.

408
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,600
The car that Ton drove is your car, right?

409
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,160
Do you upset?

410
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,320
No. I'm not anymore.

411
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,000
Good.

412
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,920
We should stop fighting and walk away from each other.

413
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,440
Also…

414
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,640
Would you stop saying you don't love me anymore, please?

415
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,480
Ai.

416
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,720
Yes?

417
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,240
I'm sorry for my misbehaving.

418
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,960
But I want you to love me even days I’m not so loveable.

419
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,120
Can you?

420
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,440
There's no such a day

421
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,520
because you’re always lovable to me.

422
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,600
When did you take these pictures?

423
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,200
I like to take your pictures all the time.

424
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,960
I searched for where to print it right after I took your photo.

425
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,400
Do you like it?

426
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,680
Hey. Why are you making that face?

427
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,560
Don't you like it?

428
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,760
I'm just too happy

429
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:20,240
Ton said that people could change one day.

430
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,880
I think… You've changed.

431
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,840
It's true.

432
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,440
It's not only me

433
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,440
but we've both changed.

434
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,320
Will you marry me?

435
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,480
What are you doing Jao Nan?

436
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,600
I'm cleaning the ring.

437
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,760
This ring needs special care.

438
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,000
Is it because Sib gave it you?

439
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,440
This ring is not only my marriage ring,

440
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,960
but it is also the inheritance from my father.

441
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,440
Has Ai ever told you that I am my father's only son?

442
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,960
He's so protective of me,

443
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,040
and It wasn't easy for him to accept the relationship between Sib and me.

444
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,400
That's why it makes this ring even more precious.

445
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,160
Using it as a marriage ring

446
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:19,680
makes us feel that our love is accepted by our families.

447
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,520
Yes…

448
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,720
Of course, yes.

449
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,800
I'll stay beside and love you until I'm old.

450
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,920
Thank you.

451
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,720
Aham…

452
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,840
Hm.

453
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,280
Jao Nan… You're here too.

454
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,920
Of course, I can't miss this important day.

455
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,920
Do you stop worrying now, Ai?

456
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,360
Yes.

457
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,080
Has he been worried?

458
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,760
Yes, he was stressed out.

459
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,120
I kept calling his dad almost every hour.

460
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,280
He feared you wouldn't think the same way

461
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,440
and refused to marry him.

462
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,680
So… The mysterious calls recently were….

463
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,720
Yes. I needed to ask someone who has the experience.

464
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,680
Ai and Nhai, you are now a life partner.

465
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,240
I hope you'll take care of each other.

466
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,680
If one has a hot temper,

467
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,960
another must be calm.

468
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,440
Live together with love and understanding.

469
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,440
Your married life will last long.

470
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,880
This ring… I give both of you

471
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,360
as a symbol that

472
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,480
you are now part of our family.

473
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,000
As I promise…

474
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,680
I still insist on giving you the dowry

475
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,000
as much as you want.

476
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,840
Like I said,

477
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,360
the lover of Aries would change.

478
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,640
What do you mean by change?

479
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,360
Change from boyfriend to husband.

480
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,360
He's been my husband for so long.

481
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,080
You keep all of these pictures?

482
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,000
Yes,

483
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,960
my hub took my photo for a whole year.

484
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,200
I want to keep them all as memories

485
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,120
that how much creative you are.

486
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,400
Then, I'll take it more, do you like that?

487
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,720
Nope…

488
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,160
But I love it.

489
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,960
Loveeeeee you to shout out.

490
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,400
I love you as the same

491
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,920
Not fair.

492
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,240
Why does your voice so low?

493
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,120
Having you acting weird alone here is enough.

494
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,760
I guess… that mysterious thing in that bag was….

495
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,840
Yes, it's your photo.

496
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,200
I've kept it for a long time, and you happened to see it.

497
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,160
Such a naughty.

498
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,680
I was so stressed thinking about what secret you were hiding.

499
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,000
Sorry…

500
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,840
I promise... I won't do anything that lets you down again.

501
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,680
That's all right.

502
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,560
I know… you'll love me no matter what.

503
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,080
Yes

504
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,680
Umm.

505
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,560
Even on days I’m not so loveable,

506
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,720
you'll still love me, right?

507
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,720
Um... Let me think.

508
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,160
Of course, I'll still love you.

509
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,120
Well,

510
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,160
let's go back to continuing our thing.

511
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,040
What is it?

512
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,160
There won't be anyone interrupting us now.

513
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,440
Wait,

514
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,440
we're at the terrace!

515
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,880
So what?

516
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,120
will someone come and see us?

517
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,120
This is my dad's resort,

518
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,440
and I close a whole place just for you.

519
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,360
Have you ever seen any clients around here?

520
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,120
Today, this resort belongs to us.

521
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,000
Let's have fun together.

522
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,200
Are you cold?

523
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,360
It's time to wake up.

524
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,600
Wow… so beautiful.

525
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,600
If look from here, will you see Jao Nan's house?

526
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,920
His house is behind the hill.

527
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,240
And if they use the binocular?

528
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,560
Oh!

529
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,040
If they used it and saw what we did,

530
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,160
Nan would certainly punch me.

531
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,160
He won't.

532
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,720
You're my hub.

533
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,160
I'll take care of you

534
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,040
Let's grow old together.

535
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,480
Um.

536
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,200
Well…

537
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,160
Should we do another round in the morning?

538
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,360
You're crazy.

539
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,800
No!

540
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,600
But let's see tonight
