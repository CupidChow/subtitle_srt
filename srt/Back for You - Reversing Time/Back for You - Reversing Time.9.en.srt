1
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,520
Zhang Xun

2
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,200
Yu Xingchen

3
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,080
It's been over ten years.

4
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,640
You're not here just to see me, right?

5
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,360
Do you still remember Su Ruo?

6
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,400
I remember.

7
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,600
She's dead.

8
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,280
Class President said you were invited
to the memorial.

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,440
But you didn't go.

10
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,840
Why didn't you go?

11
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,880
Why should I go?

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,560
It's been over ten years.

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,160
I barely knew her.

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,360
If you barely knew her, why send a wreath?

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,960
Are you feeling guilty about something?

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,440
Yu Xingchen

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,760
What are you really trying to say?

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,280
Su Ruo mentioned in her diary

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,720
someone she really disliked.

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,480
This person liked her for fifteen years.

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,480
You liked her too.

22
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,960
She said that person got angry after drinking.

23
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,320
You drink too.

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,400
Most importantly,

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,280
you mentioned recently on social media

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,440
that you just met her.

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,120
So why did you just lie about it?

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,840
And also,

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,480
Tang Song mentioned a letter.

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,160
Did you give that to Su Ruo too?

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,160
What are you doing?

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,600
I want to twist your head off.

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
Don't do anything crazy.

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
Tang Song is coming soon.

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,120
Officer Tang

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
It's perfect, we haven't met in years.

37
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,120
He can join us too.

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,800
I've missed you guys too.

39
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,360
Zhang Xun

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,720
You...

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Are you running away?

42
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,440
You said all that just now,

43
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,600
just to accuse me of being involved
with Su Ruo's death?

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,760
Su Ruo's building has no elevator.

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,240
With your condition,

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,320
you couldn't catch up to a normal person.

47
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,760
Let alone chase someone to the top floor.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,920
Sorry, Zhang Xun.

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,600
I did meet Su Ruo recently.

50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,600
She was as beautiful as ever.

51
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,440
We had a few drinks together.

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,320
I got drunk and tried to hit on her.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
I wanted to pursue her.

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,000
She refused.

55
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,320
I chased her with my lame leg.

56
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,400
And I ended up pushing her down.

57
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,720
Is that what you wanted to hear?

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,920
Sorry.

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,680
Zhang Xun

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,560
I shouldn't have doubted you.

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,040
No, no, no. How could you misunderstand me?

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,840
I really did kill her.

63
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,880
Someone as messed up as me,

64
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,160
so annoying,

65
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,120
and loves to drink,

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,400
why would I hide meeting her?

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,760
I'm the real killer, aren't I?

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,600
No.

69
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
You hid it

70
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,640
because you didn't want everyone

71
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,760
to see she wasn't doing well.

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,600
Why didn't I go to the funeral?

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,360
Because I felt guilty.

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,920
No.

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,360
You didn't go to the funeral

76
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,880
because you didn't want everyone to see

77
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,120
how you are now.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,320
Sorry, Zhang Xun.

79
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,600
You used to be reckless, but...

80
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,440
Sorry, Zhang Xun.

81
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,400
I've been out of my mind lately.

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,960
I shouldn't have doubted you.

83
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,160
Send Officer Tang a message.

84
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,200
Don't call the police for a loser like me.

85
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,480
It's not worth it.

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,560
Tang Song

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Sorry about that.

88
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
Let's call it a night.

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,320
We'll get together next time.

90
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,360
Sorry.

91
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,240
Enough.

92
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Let them doubt if they want.

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,040
It's not a big deal.

94
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,280
Honestly,

95
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,400
Yu Xingchen

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,760
you'd go this far for Su Ruo,
who you haven't seen in over ten years.

97
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,840
Just to find out the truth.

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,840
Shows you're willing to risk it all.

99
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,280
If I really was the killer today,

100
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,080
you'd be dead.

101
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,240
I respect you for that.

102
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,160
You're loyal enough.

103
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,040
A few days before it happened,

104
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,400
I wanted to get a massage.

105
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,920
You saw my leg.

106
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,880
It hurts every few days.

107
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,520
I walked around outside the therapy shop.

108
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,160
Found out I couldn't afford it.

109
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
Just as I was about to leave,

110
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
she got off work.

111
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,000
She massaged my knee and calf.

112
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,960
For two whole hours.

113
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,520
Didn't charge me a cent.

114
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,360
I asked if I could post about it online.

115
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,680
She said sure.

116
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,360
But from her face, I knew

117
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
she didn't want more people

118
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,680
to know about her situation.

119
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
So I just wrote something random.

120
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,080
Said some inappropriate things.

121
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,800
That's true.

122
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,240
Stuff like "curvy and sexy."

123
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
Looks like a pervert wrote it.

124
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,400
Now that you mention it,

125
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
I really do seem like a pervert.

126
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,960
That's just how I am.

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,560
I can't control what I say.

128
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,680
Didn't expect you and the Class President
to misunderstand.

129
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,240
Speaking of your leg,

130
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,960
it never healed after that time.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,480
How does that saying go?

132
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,120
It's so sentimental.

133
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
Some wounds

134
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
never heal.

135
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,320
The year we were seniors in high school,

136
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,400
Zhang Xun was badly injured.

137
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,480
He never recovered, even by graduation.

138
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,600
After Teacher Jiang told Zhang Xun's parents,

139
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,760
they probably still thought

140
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,760
Zhang Xun was just being mischievous as usual.

141
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
So they showed up late.

142
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,000
Help me.

143
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,480
They didn't even take him to the hospital.

144
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,080
Not until three days later

145
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,720
did Zhang Xun return to school.

146
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,760
Three months passed.

147
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,040
The bandages came off.

148
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
But his foot was still

149
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,560
not healed yet.

150
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,680
Why heal so fast?

151
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,560
It's nice to have someone help you in class.

152
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,760
See that?

153
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,120
Did you see that?

154
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,400
A pretty girl helps him remove the bandage.

155
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,720
Why rush to get better?

156
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,440
Su Ruo, why are you picking up bad habits?

157
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,360
That summer after graduation,

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,880
his foot still hadn't healed.

159
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,040
But we didn't take it to heart.

160
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
We always thought things would get better.

161
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,840
Back then, about the world,

162
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,080
we felt the same way.

163
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,120
Eggplant.

164
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,440
I still remember the track team tryouts.

165
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,760
You said someone kicked you and you fell.

166
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,320
With such a serious injury,

167
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,120
didn't you want to find out who did it?

168
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,280
Find them?

169
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,480
Tell me how to find them.

170
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,960
Tell me how to find them.

171
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,200
Did you find the person in your diary?

172
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,920
It's been so long.

173
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
How could I find them?

174
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
You're a physics guy.

175
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,560
You tell me.

176
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,000
Unless time could go backward.

177
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,840
Back to our high school days.

178
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,280
Is that possible?

179
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,720
Impossible.

180
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,360
Sir, don't lock the door.

181
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
I want to go to the rooftop.

182
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,840
The leaders gave orders.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,160
There was an incident on this rooftop.

184
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,160
It's closed now.

185
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,120
I'll be honest with you.

186
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,640
The girl who had an accident here recently,

187
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,760
she was my high school classmate.

188
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,000
We were pretty close.

189
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,360
So I just wanted

190
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,760
to see her a couple more times.

191
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Don't stay too long.

192
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,040
Okay.

193
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,920
Thank you.

194
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,720
I'll stay until nine o'clock.

195
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,720
Deep down inside,

196
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,280
I already believed what Tang Song said.

197
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,200
Maybe I just couldn't accept it.

198
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,160
Ten.

199
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,200
Nine.

200
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,040
Eight.

201
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,000
Seven.

202
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,000
Six.

203
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,000
Five.

204
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,000
Four.

205
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,120
Three.

206
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,200
Two.

207
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,240
One.

208
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,680
What are you doing, Zhang Xun?

209
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,720
It's not time yet.

210
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
Come sit back down.

211
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,240
Su Ruo didn't come to school?

212
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,800
Are you still mad at me?

213
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,640
Are you that upset I turned you down?

214
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,280
Who's mad at you?

215
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,960
You're acting strange.

216
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,560
You like Su Ruo yourself,

217
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,560
but you didn't notice she's been absent for days.

218
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,040
You keep asking me

219
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,960
Su Ruo hasn't come to school for days.

220
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Did something happen?

221
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,440
How would I know?

222
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,280
Class is over, everyone.

223
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,680
Charge!

224
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,120
How does that saying go?

225
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,880
Some wounds never heal.

226
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,920
Zhang Xun, teacher said no running in class.

227
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,800
Unless time could go backward.

228
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,280
Back to our high school days.

229
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Is that possible?

230
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,040
Impossible.

231
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,560
Possible.

232
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,360
Where are you going? Didn't I say before?

233
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
During senior year,

234
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
no leaving campus, even at lunch break.

235
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,200
Teacher Jiang.

236
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,960
Su Ruo hasn't come to school for days.

237
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,240
I really have something urgent.

238
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,840
Su Ruo asked me for leave.

239
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
I've noticed

240
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
you've been a bit

241
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,120
too concerned about Su Ruo lately.

242
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,760
It's senior year.

243
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,840
If you have any funny ideas,

244
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,320
wait until after the college entrance exam.

245
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,960
Yu Xingchen, your mock exam results are out.

246
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,960
You're halfway out the door of a top university.

247
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,560
It's fine if you mess up your own future,

248
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,000
but don't drag Su Ruo down with you.

249
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,000
Teacher Jiang, I heard someone's been bullying her.

250
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
She's really in danger.

251
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,000
Let me go out.

252
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,320
Her biggest danger now

253
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
is falling into the pit of puppy love.

254
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,960
Go back.

255
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,320
Teacher Jiang.

256
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,000
This needs teamwork.

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Get down and lie flat.

258
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,120
I'll step on you to climb over.

259
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,560
Then you pull me up.

260
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,040
My hand's hurt, I have no strength today.

261
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,560
If you get out, what about me?

262
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,840
Teamwork always needs someone to sacrifice.

263
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,800
Why should I be the one to sacrifice?

264
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,120
I have something important outside.

265
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,160
Today is the Kobe vs. Wade Showdown.

266
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,240
I'm going to the shop next door to watch the live broadcast.

267
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,960
That's it?

268
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,320
What do you mean, "that's it"? It's the showdown of the century!

269
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,480
Hundreds of millions are watching.

270
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Darn it, it's the last few minutes.

271
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,200
The score is neck and neck.

272
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,440
I don't want to miss the end of this live game.

273
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,160
This game?

274
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
December fifth.

275
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,760
I know.

276
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,960
The Lakers won in the end.

277
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,880
Kobe made the game-winning shot.

278
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,280
You're making it up, that's nonsense.

279
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,560
Do you dare to bet with me?

280
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,240
If I'm right,

281
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,920
you squat and I'll step on you to get out.

282
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
If I'm wrong,

283
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,440
I'll be your stepping stone.

284
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,840
Wait until we know the result.

285
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,080
Isn't the game already over?

286
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,680
Then why would I go out?

287
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,840
Let's make a big bet.

288
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,560
I bet not only the Lakers win,

289
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Kobe makes the game-winner,

290
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,720
I even bet it's in the last five seconds.

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,560
Kobe banks it in over Wade for the win.

292
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,920
Final score is set at 108 to 107.

293
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,040
If I get even one word wrong,

294
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,200
I'll buy you meals for a month.

295
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,040
You buy me meals for a month.

296
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,400
But if I'm right,

297
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,160
you help me get out.

298
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,360
Deal.

299
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,600
I choose what we eat.

300
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,720
Deal.

301
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,120
Kobe wins it at the buzzer.

302
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,520
Kobe catches the ball at a forty-five degree angle.

303
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,920
Shoots over Wade's head.

304
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,680
Ball goes up, buzzer sounds, banks it in for the win.

305
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,560
Final score is 108 to 107.

306
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,360
How do you know that?

307
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,320
I've seen it.

308
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,560
NBA games aren't live.

309
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,800
Is it a replay then?

310
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,360
Alright, come over here.

311
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,200
Squat down.

312
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,440
Thanks.

313
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,920
Yu Xingchen, where did you watch the replay?

314
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,000
It's great to be alive.

315
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,560
Did you get it right, Su Ruo?

316
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,720
Wow, game-winner!

317
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,360
Amazing, that's incredible.

318
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,480
This game is so exciting.
