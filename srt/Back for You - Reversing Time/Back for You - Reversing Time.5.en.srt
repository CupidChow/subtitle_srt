1
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,600
Stop right there!

2
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,000
Why are you running?

3
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,840
Running under the sunset like this

4
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,760
feels like our lost youth.

5
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,240
I used to be too slow to catch you.

6
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,760
Now I finally manage to catch up.

7
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,000
Tell me, why are you running?

8
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm so foolish too.

9
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,960
How could he know, fifteen years later,

10
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,800
why he needed to run?

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,160
Darn it.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,920
I forgot.

13
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,080
I'm fifteen years younger.

14
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,160
He's fifteen years younger too.

15
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,240
I should look for Su Ruo now.

16
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,880
Where would Su Ruo be now?

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,480
My condolences.

18
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,200
Yu Xingchen, why are you here?

19
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,080
Go on inside.

20
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,200
Everyone is waiting for you.

21
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,840
I don't want to go in.

22
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,720
I feel like once I go in,

23
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,760
I'll truly have to say goodbye.

24
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,280
I don't know what to do

25
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
once I'm inside.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,920
After you go in,

27
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,880
they play mourning music for three minutes.

28
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,920
Then the family gives a speech.

29
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,920
Are you giving the speech?

30
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,760
No.

31
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
It's my uncle.

32
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,080
Next, three bows.

33
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,840
Then we circle the body to say goodbye.

34
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,600
If you want to cry,

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,520
do it at that moment.

36
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,400
But I don't want to cry.

37
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,760
Then don't cry.

38
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,680
After that, the body is taken for cremation.

39
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,640
You're a direct relative,

40
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,360
so you have to sign.

41
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,400
Just follow the procedure.

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,120
It's not complicated.

43
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,560
Yu Xingchen, can you go in with me?

44
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,600
It's not really appropriate for me to go in.

45
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,280
I know.

46
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,600
I shouldn't ask for this.

47
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,960
Sorry.

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,760
But I'll wait for you here.

49
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,200
Go on.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,160
Your parents brought you into this world.

51
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,200
They'd want you to see them off.

52
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,920
Don't worry.

53
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,760
I'm not going anywhere.

54
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,480
I'll wait for you right here.

55
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,880
Next,

56
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,120
let us express

57
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,280
our deep condolences for Ms. Su Ruo.

58
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,560
We will play mourning music for three minutes.

59
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,760
Decided to attend the memorial.

60
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,840
Don't go.

61
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
Fell from a great height.

62
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,720
She looked a bit tragic.

63
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,600
Even with makeup, she couldn't be seen.

64
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,880
Better to keep a good memory.

65
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Just said goodbye to you,

66
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,240
and now I see you again.

67
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
That's nice.

68
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
It's over.

69
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,800
The urn will be kept here for now.

70
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,440
The cemetery is crowded.

71
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,440
It'll be a few days before burial.

72
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,000
Yu Xingchen.

73
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,040
How do you know the process so well?

74
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,640
Because not long ago,

75
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,200
I just said goodbye to

76
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,320
someone very important to me.

77
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,480
Yu Xingchen.

78
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,800
I didn't cry.

79
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,720
I want my parents to see me strong.

80
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,600
They'll surely be proud of you.

81
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
You said you don't want to say goodbye.

82
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,240
But growing up means slowly

83
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,240
saying goodbye to what you once had.

84
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Like some things, some people,

85
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,880
you thought you'd never lose.

86
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,920
So often,

87
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,080
we have to learn to face it alone.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,280
I've heard so many comforting words lately.

89
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,920
But what you said is different.

90
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Yu Xingchen.

91
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,640
Thank you.

92
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,520
Mr. Yu.

93
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,080
Where's your son?

94
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,280
Isn't he coming to see his mother off?

95
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,720
He's hiding outside.

96
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
No matter how we call, he won't come in.

97
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,600
Alright.

98
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,640
Don't be mad.

99
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,000
That rascal.

100
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,000
Son.

101
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,960
Are you under too much stress lately?

102
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,240
If you feel bothered,

103
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
I'll step out first.

104
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,240
Remember to eat the fruit.

105
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,520
This...

106
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,640
Mom.

107
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
Mom.

108
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,920
Xiao Ai Tongxue.

109
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,960
Turn off the alarm.

110
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,080
Yu Xingchen, stop lazing in bed.

111
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,200
Time for school.

112
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,800
Dad, why are you here again?

113
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
It's Saturday, no work today.

114
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,640
You...

115
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,800
Does senior year have Saturdays off?

116
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,320
Still dreaming of weekends off.

117
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,680
Are you out of it?

118
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,840
Get up.

119
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,280
Based on last time, I should've gone back already.

120
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,840
I get it now.

121
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,920
According to the quantum fluctuation effect,

122
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,320
each universe has different space-time curvature.

123
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,040
Like rivers with different flow speeds.

124
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,000
So the timing is random each time.

125
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,000
Can't find the person in the footage.

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,680
Can't catch him at his house either.

127
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,360
No, I can't waste this chance.

128
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,360
I must get to the bottom of this.

129
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,800
Find out who that person in the footage is.

130
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,560
What are you muttering about?

131
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,720
Standing at the school gate, not going in.

132
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,080
Yu Xingchen.

133
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,200
Cheer up, it's senior year.

134
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,600
Morning! You look lively today.

135
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,800
Did you do your homework last night?

136
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,960
I worked on mine until midnight.

137
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,120
Homework...

138
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,440
How did I forget about that?

139
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,400
What's going on?

140
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,880
Each lap is slower than the last.

141
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,960
Didn't you eat enough?

142
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,920
I didn't eat at all.

143
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,840
Back then, Dad was just one step

144
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,840
away from the national team.

145
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,960
Dad summed it up—

146
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
the reason he didn't succeed all these years

147
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,960
was missing someone

148
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,920
who could always push you forward.

149
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,840
But lucky for you,

150
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,360
you have a father like me now.

151
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,960
Can I take a break?

152
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,840
You can.

153
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,960
But

154
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,240
on the track,

155
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,240
your rivals won't let you rest.

156
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,200
I'm heading to the broadcast station.

157
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,280
Listen to what Dad says—

158
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,440
right now,

159
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,480
put all your youthful energy

160
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,520
into running on the track.

161
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,800
Youth means always moving forward,

162
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,720
never stopping.

163
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,680
Good morning, everyone.

164
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,160
I'm your host, Su Ruo.

165
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,640
It's time for this episode of Vibrant Campus.

166
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,160
After some relaxing music,

167
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,240
let's see

168
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,280
the first blessing for today.

169
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,520
It's from a rather shy student.

170
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,840
He wants to dedicate a song to Lu Xiaoxiao
from Class 8, Grade 11.

171
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,480
Wishing her great results in the city essay contest.

172
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,160
Zhang Xun.

173
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,720
You really need to be careful
with that move next time.

174
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,120
It's easy to get a concussion.

175
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,000
You know that, right?

176
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,840
Got any extra bread to share?

177
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,680
I've got extra test papers—want some?

178
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,880
I promise you'll lose your appetite
after seeing them.

179
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,760
I didn't eat anything this morning.

180
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,360
Ran three thousand meters with speed changes.

181
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,840
Our path is even narrower than the college entrance exam.

182
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,080
So many go to college every year,

183
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,960
but how many actually make it to the podium?

184
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,000
I really don't know if I can get results.

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,840
Yu Xingchen.

186
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,600
Tell me, can I make the provincial team

187
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,280
and stand on the podium?

188
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,240
In the future, it seems

189
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
I don't recall you ever winning glory for the country.

190
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,160
What do you mean?

191
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,280
I don't have homework for you to copy.

192
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,360
Even if I did, I wouldn't copy yours.

193
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
You're still young and growing.

194
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,000
You can't skip breakfast.

195
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,880
You're younger than me.

196
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,200
Are you eating or not?

197
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,560
I'm off to copy homework.

198
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,720
Hui Ge, do you have a moment?

199
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,800
I do.

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,320
But my time is pretty valuable.

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,680
According to Newton's Third Law,

202
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,480
the net force on the block from the wedge
is vertically downward.

203
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,920
So the wedge's effect

204
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,760
doesn't make it move along the ground.

205
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,120
It doesn't get friction from the ground.

206
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,880
Choose A.

207
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,640
Thanks.

208
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,320
I really don't get physics.

209
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,440
For classical physics, just master those formulas

210
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
and you'll handle almost anything.

211
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,280
Most people

212
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,440
won't run into

213
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,720
situations where classical physics fails.

214
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,680
Fails.

215
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,200
I really don't understand.

216
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,120
For example,

217
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,600
at extremely large or tiny scales,

218
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,960
classical physics doesn't apply.

219
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,160
Just like time—

220
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,520
it can even stop or go backward.
