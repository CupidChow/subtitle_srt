1
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,120
This matter finally has a resolution.

2
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,000
We can give Su Ruo an explanation now.

3
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,840
If Ren Nan hadn't been with Su Ruo,

4
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,960
maybe things wouldn't have turned out
like this.

5
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,400
Su Ruo didn't get into college.

6
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
She doesn't have any family.

7
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,840
She's been struggling alone
all these years.

8
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,640
She met Ren Nan at that time.

9
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,400
Actually, back in school,

10
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,520
Ren Nan was always good to Su Ruo.

11
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,720
So many years have passed.

12
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,520
It's normal for her to be moved.

13
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,200
Back in high school,

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,880
no one would have thought

15
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,520
Ren Nan would become like this.

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,240
Yeah.

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,960
Who could've guessed?

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
Ren Nan would actually two-time.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,840
Su Ruo has always taken relationships
seriously.

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,680
Once she chooses someone,

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,000
she'll stick with them wholeheartedly.

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,200
But if she finds out she's been lied to,

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
she'll leave without hesitation.

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
In this matter,

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,720
Su Ruo didn't do anything wrong.

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,080
She didn't interfere in anyone else's
relationship.

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,560
She's still the girl we know.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,160
I suggest you let it go too.

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
After all, it's already happened.

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,120
There's nothing we can do

31
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,320
to change what's done.

32
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,600
What if it could be changed?

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,760
The food's pretty good.

34
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Dad said

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,440
you could cook back in high school.

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,960
Bro,

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,800
what are you thinking about?

38
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,800
Let me ask you something.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,080
If you were hurt by a scumbag,

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,680
and now you had a chance

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,200
to go back fifteen years,

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,000
is there any way

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
to tell yourself

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,400
not to get involved with that scumbag?

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,080
Probably not.

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,880
I was really stubborn in middle school.

47
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,520
The more you told me not to,
the more I wanted to do it.

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,680
Seems like I'm the same.

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,040
Is there any way

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
to stop them from ending up together
fifteen years later?

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
Class President,

52
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,960
is there a better solution
to this problem?

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,080
For this problem,

54
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,280
it's not about having a best solution.

55
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,240
You just did it wrong.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,280
What's up with you lately?

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,040
You're so distracted.

58
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,560
I'll go back and check it carefully.

59
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,880
Su Ruo,

60
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,360
come take a walk with me.

61
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,560
Sure.

62
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Twenty-nine days.

63
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,160
Another month has passed.

64
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Only one month left until the exam.

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,960
I think whatever happens,

66
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,200
just put it aside for now.

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
Deal with everything after the exam.

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,760
Mm-hmm.

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,160
I know, I'm fine.

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,160
You've been really unfocused lately.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
If something's on your mind,

72
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,080
say it now.

73
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,000
For example,

74
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
Yu Xingchen,

75
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,960
Yang Yue...

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,760
You're gossiping now too?

77
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,200
I'm not gossiping.

78
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
As Class President,

79
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,760
I should care about everyone's
pre-exam mindset.

80
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,440
It's my duty to pay attention.

81
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Isn't it?

82
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,160
There are things I don't know
how to say.

83
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,160
If you can't say it to me,

84
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,080
what about to him?

85
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,720
You two talk first.

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
I'll head back to class.

87
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,560
Long time no see.

88
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,200
You were gone for a long time
this time.

89
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,240
Was it serious?

90
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,880
Didn't seem that long.

91
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,160
Last time, it was from

92
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,880
December last year to April.

93
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
That's a four-month gap.

94
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,000
This time, it's less than a month.

95
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,320
Really?

96
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,720
It felt like a long time to me.

97
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,720
By the way,

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
while you were gone,

99
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,800
the other you was really focused too.

100
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,800
Grades improved a lot.

101
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,880
Gaokao is coming soon.

102
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,320
Now that you're back, study hard too.

103
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,320
Sorry.

104
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,720
I'm the only one talking.

105
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,760
Do you have something to say to me?

106
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,120
Yes.

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,200
I'll be direct then.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,600
Don't you think besides studying hard,

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,000
it's important to see people clearly too?

110
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,280
I don't think you're being that direct.

111
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,160
What are you trying to tell me?

112
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,400
For example,

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
if a guy really likes you in the future,

114
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,320
but you don't like him,

115
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,120
he treats you well,

116
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,960
would you

117
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,160
accept him?

118
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,040
No.

119
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,160
I don't like him.

120
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,360
Why would I accept him?

121
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,720
Then suppose

122
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
you're having a tough time then,

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
but he's always helping you,

124
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,800
would you be moved by him?

125
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,880
I'd remember all his kindness.

126
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,760
Then find a chance to repay him.

127
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,800
But not to the point of giving myself
to him.

128
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,280
Anyway,

129
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,960
if this guy shows up in the future,

130
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,520
you

131
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,560
don't accept him.

132
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,560
Didn't I say from the start,

133
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,080
I won't get together with someone

134
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,560
just because I'm moved.

135
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,480
What about dating?

136
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,640
It's just one month.

137
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,760
Hang in there.

138
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,000
Look, my leg's like this and I still
come to class.

139
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,720
Model student.

140
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,560
Zhang Xun, will you ever stop?

141
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,360
You have one month left.

142
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
You're here to review.

143
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,000
Go home and get ready for Gaokao retake.

144
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,360
I know that better than you all.

145
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,320
I'm just here to mess with your studying.

146
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
I'm leaving now.

147
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,880
Bye.

148
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,920
Did I really disturb you guys?

149
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,600
You know it too.

150
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,720
I thought you were actually dumb.

151
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,760
If you weren't moved by emotion

152
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,040
when you got together with Ren Nan,

153
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,800
then you must truly love him in the future.

154
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,720
But I can't just tell you directly

155
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,440
that Ren Nan in the future

156
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,080
is someone who two-times.

157
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,280
Thank you, Ren Nan.

158
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,200
It was supposed to be Zhang Xun's turn

159
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
but he's not available right now.

160
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
It's fine.

161
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,640
Zhang Xun.

162
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,600
This favor isn't for free, you know.

163
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,920
You owe me bubble tea, got it?

164
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,840
Besides, Ren Nan now

165
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,000
is such a good kid.

166
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,400
There's a guy who really likes you,

167
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,600
treats you well,

168
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,760
helps you in all sorts of ways,

169
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,120
but you don't like him.

170
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,120
Would you ever accept him?

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,840
Yu Xingchen,

172
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,120
that's a weird question.

173
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,040
Yeah.

174
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,080
I don't know why he's asking, either.

175
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,160
Maybe

176
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,480
the guy he's talking about is himself?

177
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,280
Sounds about right to me.

178
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,560
Likes you, helps you all the time...

179
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,720
But Su Ruo,

180
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,320
you don't like Yu Xingchen, do you?

181
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,160
No.

182
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,680
So, would you accept him?

183
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,600
No.

184
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,560
I think you two should talk things out

185
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,200
and clear things up soon.

186
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,960
Otherwise, it'll affect your exam focus.

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,560
Mm.

188
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,400
I think The Big Four aren't handsome at all.

189
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,200
I agree.

190
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,440
Looks like Ren Nan's my only option.

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,640
Ren Nan.

192
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,640
Let's talk for a bit.

193
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,280
About Su Ruo.

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,880
Just say what's on your mind.

195
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
Let me think how to put it.

196
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,240
Okay, I'll go first.

197
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,440
About that time I splashed water on you—

198
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,720
I acted impulsively.

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,880
Sorry about that.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,600
Oh.

201
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,960
It's fine.

202
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,120
Can I discuss something with you?

203
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,640
Could you stop chasing Su Ruo?

204
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Sure.

205
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,040
I've thought it over.

206
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
Who Su Ruo likes is her own business.

207
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
It's not about you.

208
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,440
I won't pursue her for now.

209
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,880
That's the right attitude.

210
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,600
Your top priority now is the Gaokao.

211
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,280
You know that, right?

212
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,160
Right, can't disturb her studies.

213
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,480
I'll go after her after the Gaokao.

214
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm serious about her.

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,440
As long as I keep at it,

216
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,320
I'll move her eventually.

217
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,960
One year, two years, fifteen years—

218
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
she'll be moved by me someday.

219
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,520
You really called it.

220
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,200
Don't overthink it.

221
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,720
Just focus on the Gaokao first.

222
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,640
Even if you do badly, you can inherit the company.

223
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,480
It's just about how nice your diploma looks.

224
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,800
You're such a humble brag.

225
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,120
What's a humble brag?

226
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
It means you need to be put in your place.

227
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,960
Talking to Ren Nan about this won't work either.

228
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,080
Even if he agrees not to chase Su Ruo now,

229
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,440
how can you be sure

230
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,200
he won't go after her fifteen years later?

231
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
I think I've said before

232
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,960
I don't have feelings for you.

233
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,720
Don't come looking for me anymore.

234
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,360
Ren Nan.

235
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,600
You now would never imagine

236
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,360
that you'd so firmly reject Lou Yuting,

237
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,520
but someday you'll compromise and accept her.

238
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Ren Nan said

239
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,720
he'll accept Lou Yuting in the future

240
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,840
because Lou Yuting

241
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,920
will help his family's company through tough times.

242
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,320
He never liked Lou Yuting.

243
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
So even if I try now

244
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,240
to keep Lou Yuting away from Ren Nan,

245
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,040
I can't guarantee that fifteen years later

246
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,840
they won't get involved with each other.

247
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,000
What should I do?

248
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,080
Yu Xingchen.

249
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,880
Do you have a minute?

250
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,600
What's up?

251
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,760
My guitar and drum set

252
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,920
were confiscated by my dad.

253
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,080
They're at his company.

254
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
I want to move them out.

255
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,440
My dad's company is close to your place.

256
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,880
So I was thinking—

257
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,760
could you help me store them at your place for a few days?

258
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,680
Would that be okay?

259
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,720
I'll treat you to a meal.

260
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,720
Thinking about it,

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,080
I don't really know

262
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,560
what kind of person Ren Nan is.

263
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,320
This is a good chance.

264
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,440
Sure.

265
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,080
Let's go.

266
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,240
Come on.

267
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,960
A whole day has passed.

268
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,240
Did you clear things up with Yu Xingchen?

269
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,200
I still haven't figured out what to say to him.
