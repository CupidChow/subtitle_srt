00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
Yu Xingchen

2
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,640
That night

3
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,320
What I said to you
on the bridge

4
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,240
Maybe it was
a bit inappropriate

5
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,040
Don't take it to heart

6
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,840
Get well soon

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,320
Good luck
on your exam

8
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,760
Thank you

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,160
Good luck to you
on your exam too

10
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,200
What am I
trying to say

11
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,680
Thank you

12
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,400
I feel like
I'm forgetting something

13
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,000
What is it
that I forgot

14
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,000
Today at 8 a.m.

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,920
-2010 Academic Proficiency Test begins  -Eat more, son

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,560
-About twelve thousand students in Minghe City  -Eat well for energy

17
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,440
Entering the exam room

18
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,320
Taking the first Gaokao exam
this year

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,080
Don't be nervous
during the exam

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,360
Be careful

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
Why say so much

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,760
Too much talk
makes kids nervous

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,360
Xingchen, eat all of this

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,200
Eat until you're full

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,360
Mom

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,040
I'm done eating

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,880
I'm heading out

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,000
Did you pack everything

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
Don't forget
your exam admission ticket

30
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,400
If you lose your exam ticket
before entering

31
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,760
Don't be careless

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,560
Even if I'm careless,
it'll be fine

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
Zhang Jie

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Morning

35
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,000
Morning

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,440
Let's go

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,080
Mom, Dad

38
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm leaving now

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
That's the lowest price, bro

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,840
Two hundred yuan,
what more do you want

41
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,720
Forget it

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,640
Fine, one hundred it is

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,960
You win

44
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,800
Selling such a small bouquet
for one hundred

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,680
That's too much

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,000
Mind your own business

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm not selling to you

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,800
Who says it's not her business

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,000
Here

50
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
This is for me

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,800
They said today is exam day

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,160
You're taking the exam too

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,720
My mom said

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,640
Flowers bring good luck

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,280
Not thinking straight,
still copying others giving flowers

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,280
Really a toad
lusting after a swan

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,080
Alright

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,320
I'll accept it

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,960
Thank you for the flowers

60
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,920
If you insist on selling for one hundred

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
I'll have to get someone
to judge

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,440
Then how much do you want

63
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,440
I'm about to take my exam

64
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,440
You can't bring flowers inside

65
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,400
Wait until I finish the exam

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,560
Then give me the flowers

67
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,360
Is that okay

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,120
I want to see the footage
from the day of the incident

69
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,840
Is that possible

70
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,960
What did I forget

71
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000

Get your exam ticket ready

81
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
What's wrong

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,120
I can't find
my exam ticket

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
Did you leave it at home

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
I must've dropped it
on the way

85
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,840
What should I do

86
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,560
Good luck

87
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,720
Good luck, son

88
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
You'll be fine

89
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,680
Like this

90
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,040
Check again carefully

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,760
We'll report your situation now

92
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,440
Yu Xingchen

93
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,040
Yu Xingchen,
what should I do now

94
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,960
I can't find my exam ticket
anywhere

95
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
What should I do

96
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,360
Don't worry

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm running out of time

98
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,760
What should I do

99
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,520
Are you sure
you brought your exam ticket

100
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm sure

101
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,360
When you left home

102
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,480
Which route did you take

103
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,760
After I left home

104
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,680
I took Bus Route 82

105
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,880
After getting off,
I went straight to school

106
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,800
Alright, don't worry

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,560
I'll help you look for it

108
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,960
Yu Xingchen,
the exam is starting soon

109
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,880
There's still time

110
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,800
Wait here for me

111
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,560
Can you stop following me

112
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,080
Come on, I'll take you home first

113
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,440
I said it's fine

114
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,600
This scene feels familiar

115
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,360
Can you stop following me

116
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,400
Yu Xingchen

117
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,080
Hurry up too

118
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,960
We're almost late

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Hurry, run for me

120
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,960
So absent-minded

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,240
You need to be alert today

122
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,880
I said it's fine

123
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,480
In your situation now

124
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,560
You should take care
of yourself first

125
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,400
You're alone now

126
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,320
If you catch a cold

127
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Who will take care of you

128
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,920
Don't worry

129
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
I'm not going anywhere

130
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
I'll wait here for you

131
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,440
I won't leave you
with this person

132
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,600
I'll take you away

133
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,560
I'll stand up for her
on behalf of her parents

134
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,360
Is that okay

135
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,240
Yu Xingchen

136
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
Are you alright

137
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,800
I want to get into
the same university as Yu Xingchen

138
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,400
Study together

139
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,040
I'll major in education

140
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,200
You can study
whatever you want

141
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,440
Sorry about that.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,560
I didn't know my own strength.

143
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,040
I just remembered.

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,080
I'm not from here.

145
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,880
I am.

146
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,560
Thanks.

147
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,040
You're welcome.

148
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,360
Did I hit you so hard you got confused?

149
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,760
You ran the wrong way.

150
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,800
The school is this way.

151
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,920
Darn it, darn it.

152
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,840
I'll head off now.

153
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,080
Don't be late.

154
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,720
By the second exam,

155
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,840
it was finally found and brought over.

156
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,200
Someone handed it to the officer.

157
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,560
The officer brought it here.

158
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,800
But that person didn't leave a name.

159
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,560
The class monitor said

160
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,200
someone gave Su Ruo's exam admission ticket
to the officer.

161
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,240
And the officer delivered it to the exam room.

162
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,080
It was during the second exam.

163
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
There wasn't much time between the two.

164
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,080
Did you see this exam admission ticket?

165
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,320
So when Su Ruo lost her ticket,

166
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,120
it must've been right after the first exam.

167
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,360
It was found quickly.

168
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,480
Since it wasn't on the road,

169
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,000
someone might've already found it.

170
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,400
Who picked it up?

171
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,640
Finding something as important as an exam ticket,

172
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,600
the officer would surely record the name.

173
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,520
Unless this person

174
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,000
couldn't communicate at all.

175
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,320
Did you see Su Ruo's exam ticket?

176
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
She went to school.

177
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,840
I'm waiting here for her to come back.

178
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
To give her flowers.

179
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,400
Su Ruo.

180
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,880
You just saw her.

181
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,040
Yeah.

182
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,680
But I have something urgent to do now.

183
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,640
She hasn't come back yet.

184
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,560
I can't leave.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,720
What's so urgent you need to do?

186
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,960
I need to find the officer.

187
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Look.

188
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,040
Her photo is on this.

189
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,880
It must be important to her.

190
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,800
Give it to me.

191
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

192
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,280
Yu Xingchen, come back quickly.

193
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,720
It's fine if you can't find it.

194
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,720
Just make sure you aren't late.

195
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,680
Su Ruo.

196
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,760
How did you manage this?

197
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,160
You even lost your exam ticket.

198
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,120
Sorry.

199
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,520
What should we do now?

200
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,400
Teacher, is there any way you can help?

201
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,440
She really is my student.

202
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
I can vouch for her.

203
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,120
I'll get her a new ticket later.

204
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,200
But there's nothing we can do.

205
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,080
Well...

206
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,160
Even if we let her in here,

207
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,400
she can't enter the exam room without her ticket.

208
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,800
We've already called the officer.

209
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,160
Everyone's searching for it.

210
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,080
Yes, Teacher Jiang.

211
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,680
All our teachers are looking for it.

212
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,320
Don't worry.

213
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,880
How can I not worry?

214
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,600
It's already been ten minutes.

215
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,960
Teacher Jiang.

216
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm not the most important right now.

217
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,080
It's Yu Xingchen.

218
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,400
He's helping me look for the ticket.

219
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,480
He hasn't come back yet.

220
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,960
What?

221
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,200
Su Ruo.

222
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,680
You two, stop dawdling.

223
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,800
Go in quickly.

224
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,480
Teacher Jiang.

225
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,200
We're going in now.

226
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,560
Su Ruo.

227
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,080
I'm in Exam Room 3.

228
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,400
Your Exam Room 7 is over there.

229
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,640
After your exam,

230
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
wait for me at the school gate.

231
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
I have something to tell you.

232
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,280
I have something to tell you too.

233
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,840
Sorry, I'm late.

234
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,280
Looks like Yu Xingchen is all you think about.

235
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,360
Don't write Yu Xingchen's name on your exam.

236
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,840
Darn it, I have no idea about this.

237
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,520
Good thing it's Chinese.

238
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,320
Forget it.

239
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,200
I'll start with the essay.

240
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,200
If you could go back in time,

241
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,040
what would you say to your past self?

242
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,440
Seeing you again

243
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,520
feels like after so many years,

244
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,480
I'm taking the Gaokao all over again.

245
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,480
So much to say,

246
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,440
but I just want to tell you a few things.

247
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,400
You need to have enough confidence.

248
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,920
Not because you'll be so successful someday,

249
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,360
like running a big company

250
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,640
or becoming a celebrity,

251
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,960
but you should be brave.

252
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,000
Even if the love letter you send

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,040
doesn't work out,

254
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,160
you should still face challenges head-on.

255
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Because your talent stands out.

256
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,080
You should care for others,

257
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,920
even if no one can put a price on your kindness.

258
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,160
You should stay true to yourself,

259
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,920
even if

260
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,440
the world crushes you to pieces.

261
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,880
Learn to make peace with the world,

262
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,960
even if it never treats you peacefully.

263
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,800
You also need to learn responsibility,

264
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,520
even if it feels suffocating.

265
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,880
Even if it feels suffocating.

266
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,920
Everyone from the past

267
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,400
and everyone in the future

268
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,120
faces all kinds of problems.

269
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,200
But everyone

270
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,640
in their own way

271
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,640
stands tall.

272
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,160
Unshaken.

273
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,720
They all respond

274
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,200
to the world in their own way.

275
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,280
And in the long river of life,

276
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,200
they leave a mark with resilience.

277
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,400
That's right.

278
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,320
You and I are not alone.

279
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,920
We don't only have each other.

280
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,160
You, right now,

281
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,520
are chasing a glimmer of the future,

282
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,600
fighting through the words of the Gaokao exam.

283
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,720
This is truly a tough thing.

284
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,480
But trust me,

285
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,400
it's not as hard as life will be.

286
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,520
So,

287
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,680
keep going.
