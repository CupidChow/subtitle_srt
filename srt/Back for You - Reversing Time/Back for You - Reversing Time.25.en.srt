1
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,040
Take care, Chen.

2
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,160
What did you just call me?

3
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,480
From now on,

4
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,840
you're my Chen.

5
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,520
Bye.

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,480
What am I even doing?

7
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,080
How did I become friends with Ren Nan?

8
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,280
Can this change what happens
fifteen years from now?

9
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,720
Will Su Ruo still end up with Ren Nan?

10
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,120
Probably not.

11
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,200
Seems like it can't.

12
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,760
Chen.

13
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,800
How did your exam go?

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,440
Not so great.

15
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,480
I did even worse than you.

16
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,080
You sure have a good attitude.

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,560
Chen.

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,000
Let me tell you something.

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,720
Isn't this amazing?

20
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,320
Last night after I got home,

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,360
my dad actually sat down
to talk with me.

22
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,480
He agreed to let me attend
an art college.

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,080
Isn't that a surprise?

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,200
Congrats!

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,320
Chen.

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,440
Chen.

27
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,680
If I get famous, I won't forget you.

28
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,760
Everyone in our class,

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
come to my concert.

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
Tickets are on me.

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,400
Awesome.

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,360
Chen.

33
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,200
In the future,

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,920
you'll have a front row VIP seat.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,160
Right next to Jay Chou.

36
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,960
If he gets into a music college,

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,800
he won't inherit his dad's company.

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,720
So he won't run it badly.

39
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,640
Then he won't marry Lou Yuting.

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,320
If that's the case,

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,800
will Su Ruo's fate change?

42
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,080
It worked.

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,160
I did it.

44
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,880
I did it.

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
I did it.

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Wait, Chen,

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,800
why are you so excited all of a sudden?

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,920
I'm sitting next to Jay Chou.

49
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,360
How could I not be excited?

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,920
I've already given you plenty
of encouragement.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,760
That's enough.

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,200
Let me stress one thing.

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,280
This is the last mock exam.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,320
Next time

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,400
is the Gaokao.

56
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,320
Why are you spacing out?

57
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,640
I'm just happy.

58
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,440
I can finally retire in glory.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,840
Do your best.

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,280
Got it.

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,240
Don't worry.

62
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,000
Did you forget

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,560
I still have my second form.

64
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,200
What are you whispering about?

65
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,160
Try it in the Gaokao exam room.

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,840
The exam begins.

67
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,760
Make good use of your time.

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,960
Looks like you didn't do so well.

69
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,280
445

70
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,800
Should be enough for art college, right?

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,200
271

72
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,240
Should be fine for Gaokao retake, right?

73
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,760
Yu Xingchen.

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,120
You only got 150?

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,600
Chen.

76
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,280
150 points.

77
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,120
Did you get a perfect score in math?

78
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,480
All four subjects add up to 150.

79
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Looks like your other form
can't come back yet.

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,200
Hurry and bring him back.

81
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,400
I'm begging you.

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,720
Yu Xingchen, don't be upset.

83
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
I remember last time,

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,800
you scored 550.

85
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,680
So this time,

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,920
you just weren't in the right state.

87
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,840
Statistically speaking,

88
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,000
getting every multiple choice wrong

89
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,280
is actually pretty impressive.

90
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,440
Did you know the right answers

91
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,560
and get them wrong on purpose?

92
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,000
Chen.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,920
Did you fight with your parents too?

94
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,280
You did it on purpose, right?

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,440
Stop talking, you guys.

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,560
I want to be alone.

97
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,840
Did you tell him about you and Yu Xingchen?

98
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,440
I think his situation

99
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,360
is probably like yours.

100
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Something must've affected his mood.

101
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,360
I had already decided

102
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
what to say to him.

103
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
But seeing him like this,

104
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,720
I'm afraid if I really tell him,

105
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,000
he'll have to retake the Gaokao.

106
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,400
Look,

107
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,920
the first time was one day.

108
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,400
The second time was two days.

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,560
The third time lasted longer.

110
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,600
About fifteen days.

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,520
Last time was also fifteen days.

112
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
That shouldn't be.

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
This time it's stretched to sixteen days.

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,920
I should've gone back by now.

115
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,440
If I don't go back in another half month,

116
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,440
I'll have to take the Gaokao here.

117
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,840
Wouldn't my life be ruined?

118
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
Did you see how he looked at me?

119
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,640
I saw it.

120
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,400
Confused, resentful, conflicted, helpless.

121
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,440
You should be saved.

122
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,200
But I think I'm really doomed.

123
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,040
As expected,

124
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,400
the end of science is...

125
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,160
God, please let me go back.

126
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,440
Do I need some kind of ritual?

127
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
Go back.

128
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,720
What is he doing?

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,800
Darn it, darn it.

130
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,440
I think he's lost it.

131
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,800
Go back.

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,120
Go back.

133
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,560
Son.

134
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,880
What are you doing up so late?

135
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,600
I want to stay up all night.

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,840
Trying to get that dizzy feeling.

137
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,000
Maybe that'll solve the problem.

138
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,000
Son, don't put too much pressure
on yourself.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,480
You should go rest early.

140
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,400
You'll study better with energy tomorrow.

141
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,240
Exactly.

142
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,800
I'll give you something good.

143
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,720
Back then, I took the adult college exam.

144
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,480
I was really nervous during the exam.

145
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,400
It was much tougher than what you face now.

146
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,640
Whenever I got tired of studying,

147
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,720
I would read this book.

148
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,440
Universal Gravitation

149
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,720
Yu Xingchen

150
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,760
Compared to the universe,

151
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,920
we are truly insignificant.

152
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,480
The Gaokao is important,

153
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,520
but it shouldn't be your only goal.

154
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,160
I mean, son,

155
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,320
even if you mess up the exam,

156
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,680
though I believe my son

157
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,040
definitely won't mess it up.

158
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,920
Even if, worst case scenario,

159
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,160
you fail the exam,

160
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,480
we will still love you.

161
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,040
Hui Ge, let me ask you something.

162
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,520
Be honest with me.

163
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
If I start studying seriously now,

164
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,400
and you’re willing to help me fully,

165
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,480
do I still have hope for the Gaokao?

166
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,280
Of course you do.

167
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,280
You really do.

168
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,720
Just follow my method and study systematically.

169
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,320
By this time next year,

170
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,400
getting into a first-tier university
is absolutely possible.

171
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,400
Next year?

172
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,400
Gaokao retake.

173
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,400
What did you expect?

174
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
A few days ago,

175
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,080
I had a physical checkup.

176
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,160
Everything was normal.

177
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,400
Very good.

178
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,600
Very good.

179
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,160
If this were in the past,

180
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,840
someone would have asked me,

181
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,600
"Why did you get a checkup?"

182
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,360
Now, no one asks anymore.

183
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,520
I feel relieved.

184
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,400
Because in your eyes,

185
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,680
I don't see anything unnecessary.

186
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,840
Only the Gaokao matters.

187
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,760
Let me say a few words now.

188
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,640
This year,

189
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,800
ten million people are taking the Gaokao.

190
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,520
Of those, nine million nine hundred thousand

191
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,160
are candidates from other provinces.

192
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,160
That means

193
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,960
your real competitors are just one hundred thousand.

194
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,960
And among these one hundred thousand,

195
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,200
one thousand get direct admission.

196
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,960
Two thousand have no hope for future jobs.

197
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,880
They give up right away.

198
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,920
Eight thousand take the exam unprepared.

199
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,040
Nine thousand can't perform normally.

200
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,800
One thousand will be late.

201
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,440
Forty-five thousand

202
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,720
won't apply to the same school as you.

203
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,600
Teacher Jiang,

204
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
did you copy this speech?

205
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
I've heard it several times already.

206
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,640
Can't you make up something heartfelt yourself?

207
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,160
Yu Xingchen,

208
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,600
you seem to have some thoughts on what I said.

209
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,080
Teacher Jiang means

210
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,800
not to let us be blindly optimistic,

211
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,440
but rather,

212
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,160
we shouldn't care about other competitors.

213
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,520
The real target to beat

214
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
is ourselves.

215
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,480
It's just a bit of motivational talk.

216
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
See? See?

217
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,240
Someone actually listens to what I say.

218
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,040
Chen is right.

219
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Teacher Jiang,

220
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,680
Yu Xingchen,

221
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,920
I've seen your grades.

222
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,160
The gap is quite big.

223
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,360
But don't worry.

224
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,400
Just perform at your usual level.

225
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,840
I believe you can do it.

226
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,960
Teacher Jiang,

227
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,000
please take care of yourself too.

228
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
What's wrong?

229
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,960
I can't solve any of these problems.

230
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,280
I really can't take it anymore.

231
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,040
I think I'm done for.

232
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,680
That's nothing.

233
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,800
Look,

234
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,680
Yu Xingchen scored 150 and didn't cry.

235
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Don't mention Yu Xingchen to me.

236
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,200
At this moment,

237
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,240
caring about her will only make her feel worse.

238
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,120
Let her be alone for a while.

239
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,600
What am I afraid of?

240
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,560
Even if I have to retake the Gaokao,

241
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,480
what's there to be afraid of?

242
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,280
I've already lived through these fifteen years once.

243
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,440
What am I afraid of?

244
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
After coming back so many times,

245
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,600
I've never really

246
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,800
fit in here.

247
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,560
I've never tried to study properly.

248
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,360
Never attended class seriously.

249
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,040
Never did the morning exercises properly.

250
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,880
Never looked again

251
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,680
at what I've already lost.

252
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,080
Maybe there's not enough time.

253
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,360
But I should seize

254
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,440
this rare opportunity.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,920
To experience again what I've long forgotten.

256
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,280
Besides Su Ruo,

257
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,560
this is also

258
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,080
the meaning of starting over for me.
