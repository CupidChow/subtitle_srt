1
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,880
You

2
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,680
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Get up!

3
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,320
I accept that the aircraft

4
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,760
but there's no choice

5
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,840
but to do it

6
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,040
The plane can only crash into the sea

7
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,000
There's no other way

8
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,440
I have to accept my fate

9
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,240
has no choice but to do it

10
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,680
Did you memorize this sentence?

11
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
Every cell in my body is collapsing now

12
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,080
By the way

13
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,440
Your workout intensity

14
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,840
You ran three thousand meters nonstop

15
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,400
This level of intensity

16
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,800
Even Zhang Xun's dad isn't as extreme as you

17
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,840
Come on, come on

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,640
Let's have breakfast first

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,160
Su Ruo

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,600
Auntie

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,440
It's cold

22
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,600
This scarf

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,800
I've never used it

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,560
You should wear it

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,840
It looks nice

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,920
I'll buy her some daily necessities today

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,920
She's a young girl

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,800
It's not right for her to use our shampoo

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,640
Also

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
Buy her a few more changes of clothes

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,440
Got it

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,720
You don't need to remind me

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,240
No need

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,320
It's too much trouble for you, Uncle and Auntie

35
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
It's no trouble at all

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,880
Sit down, sit down

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,120
Sit down, sit down

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,720
You

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,160
Just settle in and stay with us

40
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,400
Don't be so polite with us

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,520
This breakfast

42
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,760
is pretty light

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
Not sure if it suits your taste

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,680
Yu Xingchen, why are you spacing out?

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,560
Let your classmate eat

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,800
If you don't eat enough breakfast

47
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,440
how will you have energy for class?

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,520
Don't exaggerate so much

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,160
Su Ruo won't dare stay if you act like this

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,640
Are you jealous?

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,560
It looks so nice

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,200
Uncle, Auntie, we're heading out now

53
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,160
Take care

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,240
Be safe

55
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,600
I've always had one regret

56
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,000
It's that I never had

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,400
a sweetheart daughter

58
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,120
Yeah, it's a pity

59
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,720
It's too late, all your fault for not trying

60
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,000
Is not having a daughter just my problem?

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,760
Of course it's your problem

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,800
Sour for a boy, spicy for a girl

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Back then

64
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,720
You ate vinegar potato strips every day

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
It's fine, honey

66
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,640
Even though we didn't have a daughter

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,800
we can still have

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
a daughter-in-law

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,480
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,880
She's still so young

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
The college entrance exam is coming up

72
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,760
Let's talk after the exam

73
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
Let's talk after the exam

74
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,440
What are you thinking about?

75
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,520
I'm thinking about something important

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,360
Right now, in my heart

77
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,880
the only thing that matters is the exam

78
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,920
Don't worry, you'll get into a good university

79
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,480
Where did you go last night?

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,920
I waited all night and you didn't come back

81
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,880
We're at the school gate

82
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,960
I hope you stay rational

83
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,520
Otherwise, I'll call the police

84
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,000
Classmate

85
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,640
Sorry about yesterday

86
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,080
Why not take the money if you have it?

87
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,560
Ruo Ruo, come back tonight

88
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,400
Uncle drank too much before

89
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,760
It won't happen again

90
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,040
Seeing this

91
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
Maybe you shouldn't go back yet

92
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,520
I stayed at your place for a night

93
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,800
For a moment

94
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,320
I almost forgot all the unhappy things

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,840
Earning money early in the morning makes me happy

96
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,000
What are you doing?

97
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,200
This is the medical fee he gave you

98
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,960
I really can't accept it

99
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,200
What if he tells the teacher I extorted him?

100
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,640
He was in the wrong

101
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,240
but I end up being blamed

102
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,400
You take it

103
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,680
He gave it to you

104
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,680
It's reasonable

105
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
You really think things through

106
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,720
I'm an adult, after all

107
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,560
In a few months

108
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,200
I'll be an adult too

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,760
When something like this happens

110
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

111
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
I'm fine

112
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,280
How can you say you're fine?

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,240
Tell me

114
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,120
I can handle it

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,480
Yu Xingchen

116
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,760
Good thing you were here for this

117
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,880
Otherwise, it would've been terrifying

118
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,360
But

119
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,080
Teacher Jiang said

120
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,360
Although it's understandable

121
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
it's unforgivable

122
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
You snuck out of school

123
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,480
and skipped a whole afternoon of class

124
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,840
What punishment do you deserve?

125
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,960
I was at least doing the right thing

126
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,240
It's one thing if Teacher Jiang is unreasonable

127
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
but he even punishes me

128
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,920
What about Su Ruo?

129
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,520
Where has she been staying these days?

130
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,520
Did she go home?

131
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
I don't know

132
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
You have to ask her

133
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,320
Su Ruo

134
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,600
Where did you stay last night?

135
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,800
If you have nowhere to go, come to my place

136
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,240
My home is spacious

137
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Don't worry.

138
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,160
I have somewhere to stay.

139
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,480
It's not some shady motel, right?

140
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,800
Is it legit?

141
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,880
Is it safe?

142
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,600
Is there hot water?

143
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,360
Is it clean?

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
Sorry to trouble you, uncle and aunt.

145
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,640
It's no trouble at all.

146
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,920
We got some hot water ready for you.

147
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,920
You can take a shower.

148
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Sleep well.

149
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,440
My mom said I'm not allowed to eat this.

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,360
Only you can have it.

151
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,960
If you don't eat it,

152
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,160
I'll have to feed you myself.

153
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,680
Don't worry about me.

154
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,400
Someone took me in.

155
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,640
They're really nice to me.

156
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,440
Class is over.

157
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,640
Let me take a few more minutes.

158
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
I'll finish explaining this problem.

159
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,040
Delayed again, seriously.

160
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,160
What's wrong, what's up?

161
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,200
Isn't the teacher's time valuable too?

162
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,600
The teacher hasn't complained.

163
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,920
But you guys are already complaining.

164
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,920
This problem—

165
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,360
Who can solve it?

166
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
You can step out if you want.

167
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,960
Go stretch a bit.

168
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,560
You could go out too.

169
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,080
No one's expecting you to ace the big questions.

170
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,040
Really?

171
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,040
What do you think?

172
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,960
Sit down.

173
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,520
Before we solve the problem,

174
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,960
Let's emphasize something.

175
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,760
Normally, we focus on the big stuff.

176
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,360
But the college entrance exam is different.

177
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,560
Do what you know first.

178
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
Save the big questions for last.

179
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,600
Don't force yourself.

180
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,080
Got it?

181
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,280
Understood.

182
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,120
I've done all I can for her.

183
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
If I go back now

184
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,720
and tell Tang Song about her uncle,

185
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,720
the truth should come out.

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,360
But even if we find out who killed Su Ruo,

187
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,160
even if he's brought to justice,

188
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,520
Su Ruo still won't come back.

189
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,760
This last big question left—

190
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Should I

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,880
solve it or not?

192
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,080
What's wrong with you?

193
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,880
The very existence of women

194
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,160
is proof of quantum entanglement.

195
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,320
You can never predict what they're thinking.

196
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,160
Do you remember

197
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,080
the love letter you read to me last time?

198
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,800
You told me

199
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,560
my deskmate asked you to give it to me.

200
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,920
So what happened?

201
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,560
I couldn't accept her feelings,

202
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,680
but to show polite gratitude,

203
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,560
I just asked her

204
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,040
if she wanted help with her homework.

205
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,080
She said no.

206
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,720
I said that's all I can do for you.

207
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,560
She pretended not to get it, asked what's up.

208
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,640
She pretended not to get it, asked what's up.

209
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,760
I said I appreciate your feelings for me,

210
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,000
but I can't accept them.

211
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,280
She denied it.

212
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
I told her not to be shy about admitting it.

213
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,200
After all, hormonal response at the biological level

214
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,560
is hard to control.

215
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,920
Then she shoved me.

216
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,800
That's it.

217
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,040
Tell me,

218
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,000
my deskmate is just shy, right?

219
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,120
I really don't get girls.

220
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,520
I don't think you're cut out to understand girls.

221
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,240
You're better suited for scientific research.

222
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,600
By the way,

223
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,800
do you remember

224
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,440
what we said about parallel worlds last time?

225
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Good afternoon, teachers and classmates.

226
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,600
I'm your host, Su Ruo.

227
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,360
Today's daily news

228
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,080
will be brought to you by me.

229
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,920
Not long ago, British physicist Stephen Hawking

230
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,000
held a Time Traveler Party at Cambridge University.

231
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,240
Hawking sent out invitations after the party ended.

232
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,680
No doubt,

233
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,680
this was the ultimate test for time travelers.

234
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,040
Unfortunately,

235
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,400
the time travelers ignored Hawking's party.

236
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,720
Not a single person attended.

237
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,600
So, classmates,

238
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,960
do you think time travelers really exist?

239
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
If time travel is possible,

240
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,640
the things we did in the past

241
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,560
how much can they change the future?

242
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,440
That depends on what you changed.

243
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,640
For example,

244
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
there's a suspect

245
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,160
who kills the victim in the future.

246
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,440
But I stop

247
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,600
the suspect's crime now.

248
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,680
So in the future,

249
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,400
will the suspect

250
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,080
still kill the victim?

251
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,520
Did you stop the suspect by

252
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
locking him up,

253
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
or taking away his ability to commit the crime?

254
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,280
Seems like neither.

255
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,560
Then that's not absolute causality.

256
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,600
You only stopped him once.

257
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,520
Maybe you just made him angrier.

258
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,440
He might become more obsessed with the victim.

259
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,600
He could seek revenge.

260
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,920
Say you kill the suspect,

261
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,160
lock him up,

262
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,680
or cripple him.

263
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,320
Then he probably won't harm the victim in the future.

264
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Generally speaking,

265
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,560
if the change isn't strong enough,

266
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,240
the altered timeline

267
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,800
will heal like a wound,

268
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
tending to return to the original history.

269
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,240
From the timeline correction and convergence view,

270
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,560
years later,

271
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,560
he'll still go after the victim as he was meant to.

272
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,520
I only stopped Su Ruo's uncle once.

273
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,080
But maybe he'll still abuse her after drinking.

274
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,440
Maybe because of this,

275
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
he'll hold a grudge against Su Ruo.

276
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,440
But I don't know

277
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,400
if her uncle is directly

278
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,120
connected to Su Ruo's death.

279
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,440
I can't lock him up either.

280
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,320
What will the future become?

281
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,440
Why hasn't Su Ruo come back yet?

282
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
Did her uncle go after her again?

283
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,520
Why did you just get back now?

284
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,160
I don't want anyone to know I live at your place.

285
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,000
So I waited until everyone left.

286
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,560
I took a detour to get here.

287
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,680
Ren Nan hasn't left yet.

288
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,840
He might be waiting for me.

289
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
I've been working on practice papers.

290
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,080
I even finished previewing the next two days.

291
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,000
Maybe he got tired of waiting and left.

292
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,920
That's good then.

293
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,160
Your uncle didn't come looking for you, right?

294
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,880
Let's head home then.

295
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,200
Sorry to trouble your parents again.

296
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,400
It's no trouble.

297
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,520
They're really hoping you'll come home.

298
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,360
Let's go.

299
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,680
Mm-hmm.

300
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,800
Su Ruo, let me tell you—

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Seafood doesn't have sugar.

302
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,440
You can eat as much as you want.

303
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,320
After lobster, there's still crab.

304
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,640
Scallops and oysters are steaming in the pot.

305
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,520
I'm telling you—

306
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,280
Eating these won't make you gain weight.

307
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,320
Su Ruo—

308
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,360
Auntie.

309
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,000
I bought a few clothes.

310
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,360
Not sure if they'll fit.

311
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,120
Come pick some out.

312
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,080
My parents always said they wanted a daughter.

313
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,360
Guess their wish finally came true.

314
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,960
Su Ruo.

315
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,160
Try them on and show Auntie.

316
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,400
Let's go, Su Ruo, come on.

317
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:56,800
Go ahead.
