1
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Go ahead, eat.

2
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,360
Fried food affects your running, right?

3
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,360
What if your dad finds out?

4
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,080
Didn't he wrongly accuse me of eating fried chicken today?

5
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,360
Then I'll eat it right in front of him.

6
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,560
No need to do it out of spite.

7
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,360
This afternoon,

8
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,120
Lao Jiang, Director Liu,

9
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,880
and my dad

10
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,880
all took turns talking to me.

11
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,200
They insisted I have to run tomorrow.

12
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,280
It's so annoying.

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,240
Yu Xingchen,

14
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,640
don't try to persuade me.

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,280
Running or not is my own life.

16
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,960
Yes,

17
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,960
it's your own life.

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,320
I won't try to persuade you.

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,560
That's the way it should be.

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,520
I knew last semester

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,960
among all our classmates,

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,840
your ideas are the most unique, Yu Xingchen.

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,360
Class 3 heroes—

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,040
only you, Yu Xingchen, and me, Zhang Xun.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's bump fists.

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,480
Tell me,

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,520
is my life really just about running?

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,560
Running every single day—

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,600
it's exhausting.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,240
What if I don't make the provincial team?

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,760
Then I'd rather take the college entrance exam.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,800
Just get into a junior college.

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,240
Isn't there a saying, "There are three hundred sixty trades"?

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,280
Every trade has its own champion.

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
When I fell running back then, it wasn't because someone kicked me.

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,800
My Achilles tendon snapped just before the finish line.

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,880
The feeling of a snapped Achilles tendon

38
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,800
is just like being kicked.

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,120
As for my body,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
it's healthy.

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
No illness, no pain.

42
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,600
That's what matters most.

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,720
Exactly.

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,000
But if I don't run now,

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I feel restless.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,160
My results in the team weren't good back then.

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
I wanted to give up.

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,280
But then,

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,520
I thought, life only gives you one chance.

50
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,320
There's nothing much to lose.

51
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,040
Yu Xingchen,

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,760
if I stop running now,

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,080
what else can I do?

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,040
I asked myself back then,

55
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,560
do I still like diving?

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,160
If I give up,

57
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,240
will I regret it?

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,520
Do I still like running?

59
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
The result doesn't matter.

60
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,600
As long as I try my best, I have no regrets.

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,560
If I'm injured, so be it.

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,640
Even if I retire after that race,

63
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,720
it's still worth it.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm done eating.

65
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll keep running tomorrow.

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,440
Why are you here?

67
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,880
Your situation here—

68
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,960
your parents don't know yet, right?

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,480
That's good.

70
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,000
I looked it up.

71
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,400
Your current condition shouldn't be serious.

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,840
So no need to tell your parents for now.

73
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,320
They'd just worry about you.

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,120
Also,

75
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
I have—

76
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,200
this is—

77
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,160
I've researched all the related illnesses.

78
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
I've organized everything.

79
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,800
You can read it when you have time.

80
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,320
The main thing is psychological intervention.

81
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,160
Medication is just a supplement.

82
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,080
You must relax.

83
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,360
You need to find

84
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,400
the thing that hurt you the most.

85
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,400
Find the root cause.

86
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,120
Also, the information says

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,080
to regularly improve head blood circulation.

88
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
That can help relieve your condition.

89
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,760
Don't be nervous.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,920
I'm fine.

91
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,280
The information says

92
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,840
to gently massage your temple clockwise.

93
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,240
And the Baihui point.

94
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,960
By the way, Yu Xingchen,

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,080
do you still like me?

96
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,040
At this moment,

97
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,000
I can't help but recall that night.

98
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,840
She was just like this now,

99
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,720
gently and thoughtfully massaging me.

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,560
What's wrong?

101
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,760
Don't be afraid, Yu Xingchen.

102
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,480
Being sick isn't scary.

103
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,480
Look at all that's happened in my family,

104
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,600
I'm still doing fine, aren't I?

105
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,240
Yu Xingchen, you have to believe in yourself.

106
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,400
We can overcome this.

107
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,280
Don't be afraid.

108
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,760
Don't cry.

109
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,960
Yu Xingchen,

110
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,640
you've helped me so many times before.

111
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,840
This time,

112
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,760
it's finally my turn.

113
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,200
Let's face it together.

114
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Okay.

115
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,240
No matter what happens,

116
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,880
we'll face it together.

117
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,080
Hey, don't use chores as an excuse
to put off your homework.

118
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,720
Hurry up and get your homework done.

119
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,960
You know, when I was pregnant with you,

120
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,600
I should've spent more time reading.

121
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,360
Teaching by example, even before birth.

122
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,880
By the way, Mom,

123
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,160
the year I was born,

124
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,760
wasn't there a lady cab driver

125
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,800
who drove you to the hospital?

126
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
Your dad told you that, right?

127
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,680
What was her name again?

128
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,720
We haven't kept in touch for years.

129
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,320
Mei Xian.

130
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,040
Yes, yes, Mei Xian.

131
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,440
Mei Xian,

132
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,840
she's a really good person.

133
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,240
When you get into college,

134
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,600
I'll have your dad reach out to her.

135
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,360
You should thank her properly.

136
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,760
She's

137
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,480
honest, loyal, and decisive.

138
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,720
And she's beautiful, too.

139
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,840
If I were a man,

140
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,200
I'd definitely want to marry her.

141
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
Is she really that great?

142
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't laugh.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
If it weren't for her,

144
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,280
you probably wouldn't be here.

145
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,560
Mom,

146
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,520
if Dad had married her back then,

147
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,720
would you still think she's so great?

148
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

149
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,120
Didn't you just say it yourself?

150
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,400
Any man would want to marry her.

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,280
Your dad would've liked to,

152
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
but it depends if Mei Xian agreed.

153
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
She's kind and beautiful.

154
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,400
Would she really go for your dad?

155
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,600
Is it for his age or his lack of showers?

156
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,960
Yeah, Mom, you have a point.

157
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,160
Guess it's all fate.

158
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,200
Son,

159
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,800
you never know.

160
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
If you're not good at studying,

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,200
not getting into college is fate, too.

162
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,080
Even though sometimes

163
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
I get upset thinking about it,

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,480
but remembering the day you were born,

165
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,040
how anxious I was,

166
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,200
I learned to let things go.

167
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,880
As long as you're safe

168
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,200
and healthy,

169
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,440
that's better than anything.

170
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,720
By the way, Mom,

171
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,200
I asked you to get a checkup.

172
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,920
Did you go?

173
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,680
I went, everything's fine.

174
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,960
Don't lie to me.

175
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
Especially your stomach.

176
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,720
It was organized by work.

177
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,960
I'm healthy all over.

178
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,160
Can we get checkups every year from now on?

179
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,400
No problem.

180
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,440
As long as you get into a top university,

181
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
I'll go twice a year.

182
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Are you sure about this?

183
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,240
You really want to run?

184
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,080
I don't have any other choice.

185
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,040
Even if you get results,

186
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,320
you might end up sick afterward.

187
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,400
You might spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair.

188
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,360
Think about that boxing champion,

189
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,440
Ali.

190
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,880
How tragic is that?

191
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,280
If you really go this afternoon,

192
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,120
sports will be your only path.

193
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,720
You won't even have a way out if you want to slack off.

194
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,800
No way.

195
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Makes sense.

196
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,440
Pretty logical, right?

197
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,920
But Yu Xingchen,

198
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,640
if I don't run today,

199
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,480
then all I have left is the college entrance exam.

200
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,320
That's when there's truly no way out.

201
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,920
My logic checks out, doesn't it?

202
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,320
As for me,

203
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,800
I'm destined for the sports path.

204
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,520
Someday in the future,

205
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,920
when I stand on the podium,

206
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,280
watching the Five-Star Red Flag rise,

207
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,120
even if I end up in a wheelchair, it'll be worth it.

208
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,640
At that moment,

209
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,520
I'll return home in glory.

210
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,520
Sometimes I'll visit school in my wheelchair.

211
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,760
Tell me,

212
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,920
how should Lao Jiang introduce me

213
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,560
to the younger students?

214
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,360
Will he still say back then

215
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,600
I was at the bottom of the class?

216
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,920
Couldn't do anything right?

217
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,440
Alright.

218
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,040
I didn't expect to change your mind.

219
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,080
I just want to see if you'll regret it.

220
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,360
Why not change your shoes?

221
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
Those spiked shoes are intense.

222
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,480
If you kick someone, that's not good.

223
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,080
Spiked shoes make you run faster.

224
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,320
Alright.

225
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,920
Just be careful.

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,720
Don't worry, I'm a pro athlete.

227
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,640
Warm up well before running this afternoon.

228
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,480
Especially your ankles.

229
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
Relax.

230
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,240
Mental illness.

231
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I don't know much about it.

232
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,960
Why are you asking about this suddenly?

233
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,320
Nothing, I just want to know more.

234
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,120
I read a book called "Norwegian Wood" before.

235
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,720
I think it mentioned it.

236
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,160
"Norwegian Wood."

237
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
I borrowed it from the library before.

238
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Not sure if bookstores sell it.

239
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,360
So Su Ruo wanted to read this book.

240
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,520
Everyone, keep up.

241
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,400
Zhang Xun,

242
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,960
Go, Zhang Xun!

243
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,800
Lao Jiang.

244
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,760
Such a big turnout.

245
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,000
-It's up to you.      -It's not the last time.

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,800
Everyone, cheer for Zhang Xun.

247
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,080
If he gets selected,

248
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,520
we won't see him again.

249
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,040
Just treat it as a farewell.

250
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,240
Watch me.

251
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,240
Just wait and see.

252
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,440
He changed his shoes.

253
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,880
On your marks.

254
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,440
Yeah.

255
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,880
He said his spiked shoes came apart.

256
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,920
He insisted on swapping with me.

257
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,520
He said it was his only request in life.

258
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,720
Back then, I fell while running.

259
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
It wasn't because someone kicked me.

260
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,720
Could it be that he, back then...

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,320
Then this time...

262
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,720
Maybe things can change.

263
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,160
Nicely done.

264
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,960
What do you mean?

265
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,640
Ready.

266
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:42,520
Go, go!

267
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,480
Run faster!

268
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:54,600
Go, go!

269
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,920
When I was near the finish line,

270
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,080
I just heard a loud snap.

271
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,960
And I collapsed to the ground.

272
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
It changed.

273
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
Zhang Xun broke the record!

274
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,840
Class 3.

275
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,200
He's from our Class 3.

276
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,280
I won.

277
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
You should thank me—my battle shoes.

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,920
Come on, baby.

279
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,960
What do you mean, your class?

280
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,280
We're all seniors, you know.

281
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,240
Right, right.

282
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,360
I won.

283
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,920
Won.

284
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,040
The outcome can be changed.

285
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,000
Won.

286
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,920
What's wrong?

287
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,440
Generally speaking,

288
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,480
if the change isn't strong enough,

289
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,000
the altered timeline

290
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,760
will heal like a wound does,

291
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,440
tending to return to the original history.

292
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,480
When I was near the finish line,

293
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,960
my Achilles tendon snapped.

294
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,400
The feeling of a snapped Achilles tendon

295
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,520
is like being kicked hard.

296
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,480
Get him to the infirmary, quick!

297
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,440
Wait.

298
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,480
He has a ruptured Achilles tendon.

299
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,800
Don't take him to the infirmary—go to the hospital.

300
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,520
He needs surgery.

301
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,680
Hurry, or he'll be crippled.
