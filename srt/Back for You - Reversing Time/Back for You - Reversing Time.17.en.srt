1
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,480
Come on, this way.

2
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,120
Slow down.

3
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,320
All right.

4
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,400
I'll go to the hospital with him.

5
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,280
You go back to class.

6
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,240
Teacher Jiang.

7
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,360
Please remind the doctor.

8
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,160
Don't delay it.

9
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,400
He needs Achilles tendon surgery
as soon as possible.

10
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,880
Okay, okay, don't worry.

11
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,640
Classmates.

12
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,800
Hurry back to class.

13
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,400
Let's go.

14
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,880
Just as expected.

15
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,720
Things that are destined

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,360
can't be changed.

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,960
What are you thinking about?

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,040
Do you think

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,560
after Zhang Xun's leg heals,

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,760
can he still join the provincial team?

21
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,720
That's a shame.

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,720
By the way,

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
how did you know

24
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,000
what's wrong with Zhang Xun's leg?

25
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,840
Achilles tendon rupture.

26
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,560
Even the school doctor didn't know.

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,480
I guessed.

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
A friend of mine had an Achilles tendon rupture too.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,400
It was just like Zhang Xun's case.

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,880
But you seem so sure.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm sure about a lot of things.

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,920
For example,

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,840
our future

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,880
will definitely be bright.

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,480
Gather up.

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,000
Come on, everyone, gather up.

37
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,640
Classmates.

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,280
Today is your last PE class

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,480
in all three years of high school.

40
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,320
Starting today,

41
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,440
you won't have PE class anymore.

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,600
As for me,

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm not as talented as your Chinese teacher.

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,840
I'll just give you one piece of advice.

45
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,400
The college entrance exam doesn't test PE,

46
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,440
but in the exam of life,

47
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,920
it's your body that matters.

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,000
I know

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,560
you envy the younger students.

50
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,800
Just like I envy you.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,520
But

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,000
you're still young.

53
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,080
The future holds endless possibilities.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
Classmates.

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,040
Do you know

56
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,400
what it means to have no more PE class?

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,680
It means from today, you're all pandas.

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
You're all protected animals now.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,760
The school is afraid you'll get hurt.

60
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,080
Afraid it'll affect your studies.

61
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,440
But don't overthink it.

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,760
Take good care of yourselves.

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,440
Just do your best on the college exam.

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
Life is long.

65
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,840
But time flies.

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
In a blink,

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,480
you'll be my age.

68
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,160
So

69
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
cherish it.

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,240
Everyone,

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,040
dismissed.

72
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
PE class feels oddly sentimental.

73
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,600
You're getting ready for the after-school broadcast, right?

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,120
This is the last time.

75
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,240
I've been a broadcaster for almost two years.

76
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
It's hard to let go.

77
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,280
I suddenly had a feeling just now

78
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,040
that we're really about to graduate.

79
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,000
Then say a proper goodbye.

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,440
By the way,

81
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
can you mention Zhang Xun in your broadcast?

82
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,840
Like wishing him a speedy recovery.

83
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,560
I know he can't hear it,

84
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,560
but I still want to show

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,200
Class 3's feelings.

86
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,080
I'm ready.

87
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,520
Classmates.

88
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,760
You all look great.

89
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,840
It means you're used to the battlefield.

90
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,840
Teacher Jiang.

91
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,200
Is Zhang Xun okay?

92
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,160
Don't worry.

93
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,320
I'll take care of it.

94
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,760
After school today,

95
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,120
don't rush to leave.

96
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,360
There are some key questions.

97
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,400
They're important, I need to explain them.

98
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
Is it after school, teacher?

99
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,160
Yes.

100
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,120
You have broadcast station duties.

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,800
Yeah.

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,120
How about this:

103
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,160
Don't go to the broadcast station.

104
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,520
I'll have a sophomore take your place.

105
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,160
Come on, class leader.

106
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,320
Let's go back together tonight.

107
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,600
It's fine, no need.

108
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
I can handle it alone.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,400
You can't do the broadcast today.

110
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,880
You're upset, aren't you?

111
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,560
No.

112
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,160
I'm not that fragile.

113
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Brother Nan, I found out.

114
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,920
The person doing the broadcast after school

115
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,560
is a girl from sophomore class eight.

116
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,600
What's her name?

117
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,880
Lou Yuting.

118
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,560
Thanks, I'll buy you milk tea tonight.

119
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,240
Okay.

120
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,600
Lou Yuting.

121
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,200
Of the seniors, I think Zhang Han is the most handsome.

122
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
Zhang Han? No way, he's too plain.

123
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
What do you think, Yuting?

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,760
I think...

125
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,880
Isn't it obvious?

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,320
She definitely thinks Ren Nan is the most handsome.

127
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Alright.

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,400
Then you have no chance, Yuting.

129
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,960
Ren Nan already likes someone.

130
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,520
Seems it's someone from his class.

131
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,360
Her name is Su Ruo.

132
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,720
I wasn't expecting anything anyway.

133
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,760
Don't spread rumors.

134
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Let me tell you,

135
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,520
Classmate,

136
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,440
is there a Lou Yuting in your class?

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm Ren Nan from Class 3, senior year.

138
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,640
I'll keep it brief.

139
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,760
I need your help with something.

140
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Mm.

141
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,720
Go ahead.

142
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,640
You're hosting the broadcast tonight, right?

143
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,160
How did you know?

144
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,360
Will you be listening too?

145
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,680
Don't go tonight.

146
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Su Ruo from our class is hosting tonight.

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,800
How can that be?

148
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,200
The teacher assigned it.

149
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,560
I don't care.

150
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,680
Whether you skip it,

151
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,640
or stand them up,

152
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,120
just don't go.

153
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,960
Here.

154
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,440
I don't want it.

155
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,360
You won't listen to reason, huh?

156
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,520
Let me say it again.

157
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
Tonight's host

158
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,360
must be Su Ruo from our class.

159
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,640
Why are you speaking for her?

160
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm not speaking for her.

161
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,200
The teacher decided.

162
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,920
How can you be like this?

163
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,000
Ren Nan.

164
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,440
Ren Nan, what are you doing?

165
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,160
It's the teacher's arrangement.

166
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,600
Why are you taking it out on her?

167
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,080
Don't be scared.

168
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,240
It's your first time broadcasting, right?

169
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,480
Good luck! Do your best, don't be nervous.

170
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,040
Su Ruo.

171
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,040
Hey.

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
I heard everything you just said.

173
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,600
Hello.

174
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,720
I'm in the same class as those two.

175
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,880
My name is Yu Xingchen.

176
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,440
Are you here to tell me not to host, too?

177
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,160
Of course not.

178
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,440
The teacher gave you this job.

179
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,440
You should do your best.

180
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
Broadcast with focus.

181
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,800
Thank you.

182
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,000
Ren Nan isn't a bad person.

183
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
He just cares too much about the girls.

184
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
So when he sees a girl upset,

185
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,000
he wants to stand up for her.

186
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,320
Don't take it to heart.

187
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm not mad at him.

188
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,160
Can you return this money to Ren Nan for me?

189
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,120
Sure.

190
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,800
I'll let him know later.

191
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
Anything else you want me to tell him?

192
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,920
Please tell him

193
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,160
I'm not mad at him, that's all.

194
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,960
No problem.

195
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,720
Actually,

196
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,200
I have one more favor to ask.

197
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,080
What do you mean?

198
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,360
Do you think I care about this two hundred yuan?

199
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,040
If someone tells the teacher,

200
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,120
you'll be in real trouble.

201
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,920
You know that?

202
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,120
What do you call this?

203
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
Bribing a classmate.

204
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,200
Yu Xingchen, you really meddle too much.

205
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,080
If you have money to burn,

206
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,440
share some with me.

207
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,080
I'm buying Su Ruo milk tea.

208
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,000
Hello, everyone.

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
It's time for Melody Date on Wednesday evening.

210
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,400
Youth is white,

211
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,640
like fragrant wild lilies.

212
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,840
Unwilling to be unseen, it blooms in spring.

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,480
Youth is purple,

214
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,640
like brilliant lilacs.

215
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,360
Showing the world your unique self.

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,600
Let's go.

217
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll take you somewhere.

218
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,280
Where to?

219
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,040
To say a proper goodbye.

220
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,240
Where did you get the studio key?

221
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,040
I asked Lou Yuting for it.

222
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
I told her

223
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,960
that each of us

224
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,000
needs a chance to say goodbye.

225
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
We're seniors now.

226
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,320
We'll graduate in a few months.

227
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,280
No one will

228
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,760
be this strict with them anymore.

229
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,640
Yeah.

230
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,080
SPRING PROMISE CAMPUS RADIO

231
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,040
A busy week,

232
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,520
a relaxing moment now.

233
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,680
Hello, I'm your host, Su Ruo.

234
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,800
It's another night of self-study battles.

235
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,160
Surprised to hear my voice tonight?

236
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,800
But today

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,200
might be

238
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,160
the last time you hear me.

239
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,040
In our imagination,

240
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,680
high school life feels long.

241
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,360
Every day of going to and from school.

242
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,200
Why is the broadcast on now?

243
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,680
That's against the rules.

244
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,000
We're young.

245
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,280
Young people should act young.

246
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,760
Listen.

247
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,200
Listen closely.

248
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,320
During my time hosting here,

249
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I've played songs for many teachers and classmates.

250
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,920
But today's first song

251
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,880
is for my own eighteen years.

252
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,720
I also want to dedicate it

253
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,640
to all senior teachers and students fighting hard.

254
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,480
No matter the outcome,

255
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,200
at least we've all tried.

256
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,600
And

257
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,880
I want to say to Zhang Xun from Class 3,

258
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,280
get well soon.

259
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,080
Everyone in Class 3 is waiting for you.

260
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,120
That's wonderful.

261
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,640
So many blessings.

262
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,520
Stay positive.

263
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,960
Defending his own.

264
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,040
Others may not know, but I do, Director.

265
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,280
The most protective at Minghe Middle School

266
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,680
is you.

267
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,720
Youth will fade.

268
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,960
Time never stops.

269
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,560
But we, in our prime,

270
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,160
are the youths of this moment, full of possibility.

271
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,040
Everything is just right.

272
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,360
Because of the college entrance exam,

273
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,960
I have to say goodbye for now.

274
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,560
But the broadcast station will always be with you.

275
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,160
Youth won't fade.

276
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,520
Friendship won't fade either.

277
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,560
I'm Su Ruo.

278
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,480
Good night, everyone.

279
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,560
I have work tomorrow.

280
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,520
Let's talk about it tomorrow
if there's anything.

281
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
Did you do something?

282
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,880
Sorry, is this about me?

283
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,600
What?

284
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,560
Today, Yu Xingchen said
some really strange things to me.

285
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,320
You didn't tell him anything,
did you?

286
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,720
I feel like he knows something.

287
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Let me ask you.

288
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,520
If Mei Xian tried to get close to you,

289
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,680
would you be interested?

290
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,000
Mei Xian? Who's that?

291
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,480
Pretending.

292
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,120
You clearly have Mei Xian
on your mind.

293
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,240
You keep thinking about her.

294
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,960
And you still won't admit it.

295
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,840
Didn't you tell Yu Xingchen?

296
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,040
How else would he know?

297
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,200
Wait, who exactly is Mei Xian?

298
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,400
You really don't know
who Mei Xian is?

299
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
How would I know?
