1
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Fireflies...

2
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,240
There aren't many left now.

3
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,280
When I was little, there were so many.

4
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,400
Old Jiang.

5
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,480
This is for you.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,680
Pretty nice, right?

7
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,520
Alright, I'll accept it.

8
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,720
Students by the window, close the curtains.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,240
Tonight,

10
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
we're watching a movie.

11
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,480
Teacher Jiang, I don't want to watch.

12
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,520
I still have some mock exam papers to do.

13
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,000
How long has it been since you watched a movie?

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,760
It's been a long time.

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,640
After we finish tonight,

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,120
evening self-study session is over.

17
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,040
Everyone can go home early and rest.

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,040
Do the papers tomorrow.

19
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,480
By the way, Director,

20
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,280
after the movie ends,

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,560
will you give us a speech?

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,440
You think

23
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,240
I want to keep a stern face?

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,440
It's just to look authoritative.

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,000
See,

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,720
the kids are about to leave.

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
So I can

28
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,760
stop pretending.

29
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,440
No more acting, cards on the table.

30
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,640
(If you have a dream,)

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
(you must defend it.)

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
(People who achieve nothing)

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,920
(will say you can't succeed.)

34
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
(If you have an ideal,)

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
(you must strive for it.)

36
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,200
(That's it.)

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,960
Yu Xingchen,

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,040
what do you want to be?

39
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,280
And you?

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,200
I think

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,920
I can't be a stockbroker,

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,840
or an artist,

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,680
or a scientist.

44
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,720
I want to be a teacher.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,120
Teach in impoverished mountainous areas.

46
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,720
Have you thought about

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
in a dozen years,

48
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,080
our country will end poverty.

49
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,600
No more impoverished areas.

50
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,280
Really?

51
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,480
Then...

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
I'll just be

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,600
an ordinary teacher.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,960
I don't expect every student

55
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,720
to get into Tsinghua or Peking University.

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,880
But I hope

57
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
each one can be sincere,

58
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
kind,

59
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,360
confident,

60
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,120
and brave.

61
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,040
Just like...

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,280
like you.

63
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,560
So in her heart,

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,240
her future is so clear.

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,000
For her,

66
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,920
there are such beautiful dreams.

67
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,040
But what else can I do for her?

68
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,560
I can only wish her safety.

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,400
Do you think I can be a teacher?

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,440
You definitely can.

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,120
Let's go.

72
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Go, go, go.

73
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,480
Are you leaving?

74
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,600
Let's go together.

75
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,920
Aren't you going with Yu Xingchen?

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
He's rarely this focused.

77
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,040
I don't want to disturb him.

78
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,720
After watching the movie,

79
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,080
I want to think alone

80
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,800
about my future path.

81
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,800
Classmates,

82
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,360
I ask for your forgiveness

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,080
for not letting you

84
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,560
enjoy these three youthful years

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,000
carefree.

86
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,960
I couldn't lighten your burden.

87
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,400
Besides assignments,

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,480
I gave you little else.

89
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,360
But all of this

90
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,200
was to help you

91
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,760
do well in the upcoming college entrance exam.

92
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,720
Achieve good results.

93
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
Classmates,

94
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
I don't ask for anything in return.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
But when you succeed,

96
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,760
repay your parents,

97
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,160
your family,

98
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,800
and society.

99
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,440
You won't return here again.

100
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,280
These three years of high school

101
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,000
will be your fondest memories.

102
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,960
Cherish them.

103
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,360
What do teachers hope for?

104
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,000
One day,

105
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,520
I look at my phone,

106
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,440
or the newspaper,

107
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,200
and say,

108
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,840
"This person was my student."

109
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't know what you'll become

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,080
in the future.

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,160
Some of you may struggle.

112
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,880
I don't like doing business.

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,240
Nor do I want to inherit my dad's business.

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,240
Some may not achieve much.

115
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,320
I never thought

116
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,000
the last to see Su Ruo off

117
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,200
would be me.

118
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,200
Some may have a tough life.

119
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,280
Some wounds

120
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
never heal.

121
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,840
You'll feel lost,

122
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,880
disappointed,

123
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,600
unable to find your way.

124
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,080
You'll hesitate,

125
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
feel lonely,

126
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,880
and lose motivation.

127
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,040
All these years,

128
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,920
you've worked here.

129
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,960
For many years.

130
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,000
It's been tough, right?

131
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,440
What isn't tough nowadays?

132
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,920
But I hope you always remember this year.

133
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,000
Remember your youth at its best,

134
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,640
and how hard you fought.

135
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,760
Bye.

136
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,280
Su Ruo.

137
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,400
Go home.

138
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm not waiting for Yu Xingchen today.

139
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,560
It's getting late.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,440
Be careful heading home alone.

141
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,720
No wonder you're applying to police school.

142
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,400
You already sound like Officer Tang.

143
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,880
I applied to civil aviation too.

144
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
Still haven't decided where to go.

145
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,120
That's nice.

146
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,760
We'll have a classmate who becomes a cop.

147
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,040
That must feel really safe.

148
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,440
If anything happens in the future,

149
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,560
we'll rely on Officer Tang to help us.

150
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,880
Don't say weird things this late at night.

151
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,240
What could possibly happen?

152
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,640
Su Ruo.

153
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
Does that person know you?

154
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,480
He's been staring at you.

155
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,080
Is he your family?

156
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,600
My uncle.

157
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,640
I'm heading off.

158
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,400
Okay.

159
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,240
Bye.

160
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,040
No more buses.

161
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,920
There should be one more, right?

162
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,600
No idea why it hasn't come yet.

163
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,400
You worked hard today.

164
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,240
Heading home this late.

165
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Finished all the mock exam papers.

166
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,640
Today went pretty well.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,800
If you ask me,

168
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,240
you should've gone home earlier.

169
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,920
You could've left with Su Ruo.

170
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,960
Su Ruo just left.

171
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,840
Her uncle came to get her.

172
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,760
What's wrong?

173
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,440
Which way did she go?

174
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
That way.

175
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,720
Yu Xingchen.

176
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,880
Yu Xingchen, stay calm.

177
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
Su Ruo's uncle isn't a bad person.

178
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
He just loses control after drinking.

179
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,520
No need to be so nervous.

180
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,600
But what if her uncle

181
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
drank again today?

182
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,760
What if he loses control again?

183
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,400
Su Ruo's accident happens fifteen years later.

184
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,080
She's totally safe right now.

185
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,200
But...

186
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,160
I've already changed everything.

187
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
Who knows what could happen now?

188
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
RuoRuo.

189
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,440
The college entrance exam is coming.

190
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,360
Come back and stay here.

191
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,600
I tidied up your room.

192
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Where are you going?

193
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,720
I have somewhere to stay.

194
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,280
Are you okay?

195
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,120
Su Ruo.

196
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,920
There are so many things I want to do for you.

197
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,360
But I...

198
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
don't know what else I can do for you.

199
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,160
It feels like everything I should do

200
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,960
is already done.

201
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,120
I also have a lot to say

202
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,440
to you.

203
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,280
But...

204
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,800
I don't know what to say.

205
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,760
Feels like everything I should say

206
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,000
has already been said.

207
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
But...

208
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,640
I know what I should say to you.

209
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,960
And I just happen to know

210
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,000
what I want to do with you.

211
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,440
What do you want to do with me?

212
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,800
I want to be with Yu Xingchen

213
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,640
and get into the same university.

214
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,720
Study together.

215
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,840
I'll major in education.

216
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,240
You can study whatever you want.

217
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,640
We should always be together.

218
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
Yu Xingchen.

219
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,560
What do you want to say to me?

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,800
Su Ruo.

221
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,920
Don't be with Ren Nan.

222
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,040
Why bring him up?

223
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,760
No.

224
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,240
Not just Ren Nan.

225
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,280
Don't be with anyone else.

226
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,240
Whether before the exam

227
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,480
or in the future,

228
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,080
a year from now,

229
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
fifteen years from now,

230
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,720
never be with anyone else.

231
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,320
Okay?

232
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,680
Why?

233
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,600
Why not be with someone else?

234
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,400
Are you trying to say

235
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,480
you like me?

236
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,240
Are you trying to say you like me?

237
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,240
Yes.
