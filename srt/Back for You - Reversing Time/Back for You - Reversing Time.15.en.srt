1
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,960
The heavy rains we missed in those years

2
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,760
The love we missed in those years

3
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,920
I really want to hold you close

4
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,600
Embrace the courage we missed

5
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,920
That night, stars filled the sky

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,920
Brother

7
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,280
Brother

8
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,760
Aren't you picking a song?

9
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,480
I can't sing

10
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,400
You sing

11
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,880
I believe you're feeling down now

12
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,280
It must be something important

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,240
Of course, Mom and Dad understand you

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,000
So they won't blame you for yesterday

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,440
Everyone's just worried about you

16
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,960
Let me tell you something

17
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,960
Many years ago

18
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,960
My mom was a taxi driver

19
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,000
One day after work, she was rushing to return the car

20
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,680
She suddenly saw a couple on the road

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,760
The woman was pregnant

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
She held her belly, looking pale

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,320
She seemed about to give birth

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,080
Other drivers were afraid of trouble

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
No one wanted to pick them up

26
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,240
Only my mom let them in her car

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,400
She sped all the way to the hospital

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,560
She even drove on the non-motor vehicle lane

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,520
The man said on the way

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,640
Don't drive like this

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,320
You'll get fined for driving like this

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,680
My mom said she didn't care

33
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,200
And then

34
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,000
She got the couple to the hospital safely

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
Your mom is a good person

36
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,480
Yeah

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,520
Did she pay the fine later?

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,560
Of course she did

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,840
Brother, why do you focus on such odd things?

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,280
So

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,680
That couple was my parents

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,000
So, shouldn't you thank my mom?

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,360
Without her

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,360
You might not have been born safely

45
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,400
The beginning of a story

46
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,240
Is often beautiful

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,080
Just like your birth

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,240
Just like my mom meeting your parents

49
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,960
But the ending

50
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,640
Always surprises people

51
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,560
Your mom passed away

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
And my mom

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,360
Years later, she ended up with your dad

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
No one could have imagined this ending

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,360
But I always feel

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,520
Those

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,320
Beautiful beginnings

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,320
Those memories are beautiful

59
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
That's enough

60
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,680
Beautiful memories

61
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,560
That's enough

62
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,200
That's enough

63
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,720
The story I just told

64
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,240
Happened on this day years ago

65
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,760
My parents chose to marry yesterday

66
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,280
So that the day after

67
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,200
Our family could celebrate your birthday together

68
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,720
Even though it didn't go smoothly

69
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,520
But that's okay

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,840
I'm here on their behalf

71
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,880
Brother

72
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,080
Happy birthday

73
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,440
I know today is my birthday

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,840
I just didn't expect

75
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,040
Anything worth celebrating

76
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,960
Driver, stop the car

77
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,000
I have to go now

78
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,120
Thank you for celebrating my birthday

79
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,320
Brother

80
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,960
No matter the outcome

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,840
Leaving beautiful memories is enough

82
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,680
I'll remember what you said

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,680
Brother

84
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,560
You should

85
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,720
Memorize my phone number first

86
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
Is it spring already?

87
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,720
It's already the last semester of senior year

88
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,920
When Yu Xingchen pushes, let's move aside together

89
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,760
Let him fall hard

90
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,400
Zhang Xun

91
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,280
You're really boring

92
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,160
Yeah, Zhang Xun, you're the most boring

93
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,680
Life is boring anyway

94
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,160
If I'm not boring too

95
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,040
How can I join the herd?

96
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,760
Right?

97
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,520
So cultured

98
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,120
Don't hand in a blank essay next time

99
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
You're always so fussy

100
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,400
Su Ruo isn't here yet

101
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,400
She probably went out to eat

102
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,120
She went alone

103
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,080
She's been acting strange this semester

104
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,720
She doesn't eat with us anymore

105
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,040
She seems in a bad mood

106
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,880
Come on

107
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,440
You're the one who likes her

108
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,160
You should find out about her yourself

109
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,040
You don't like me

110
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,640
Why do you keep staring at me?

111
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,520
It's been so long

112
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,840
You're still holding a grudge

113
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,080
Did you forget last semester

114
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,040
I let you copy my homework, remember?

115
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,120
With your grades, you let me copy?

116
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,240
Your thirty-five points aren't worth copying

117
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,440
Zhang Xun, you're so busy after class

118
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,920
Blocking the back door, then the front

119
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,320
Take down the chalk box quickly

120
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,520
What if it hits a classmate?

121
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,080
It's senior year

122
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,640
Everyone's in such a tense atmosphere

123
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,080
I just want to lighten things up

124
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,760
See who gets lucky

125
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,800
You're not taking it?

126
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,960
I'll do it myself

127
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,400
How have you been lately?

128
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
I want to talk to you alone

129
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,960
Su Ruo

130
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,640
I disappeared for a while before

131
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,360
This might sound strange

132
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,960
But do you feel

133
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,120
I've changed somehow?

134
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,400
And before

135
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,320
We agreed to study together

136
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,080
For you, it was months ago

137
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,560
But for me, it feels like just yesterday

138
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,600
I broke the promise

139
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,280
I'm sorry

140
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,560
I can feel it

141
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,320
Sometimes I

142
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,440
Think you're very mature

143
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,920
So proactive and attentive

144
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,000
Facing you

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,440
I can say anything to you

146
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
But sometimes

147
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,800
You seem like a completely different person.

148
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,440
You don't even dare to look at me.

149
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,920
Did something happen to you?

150
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
Yu Xingchen

151
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,680
You've helped me a lot before.

152
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,320
I remember it all in my heart.

153
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,160
So,

154
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,440
if

155
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,160
you're willing to tell me what happened,

156
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,840
maybe I can help you too.

157
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,600
Actually,

158
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,240
there's another me inside my body.

159
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
Should you go to the hospital for that?

160
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,680
I've heard that's actually an illness.

161
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,560
It's called multiple personality.

162
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,160
So, can you

163
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,600
help me keep this a secret?

164
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,840
I won't tell anyone.

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,640
I promise.

166
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,760
Are you still mad?

167
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm not mad anymore.

168
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,960
I wasn't really mad before.

169
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,560
Why would I be mad at you?

170
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,920
I just feel

171
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,760
we're friends who can face hardship together.

172
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,040
If you don't tell me what's wrong,

173
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,040
of course I'd be upset.

174
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,120
By the way,

175
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,240
about your uncle's side,

176
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
I haven't seen them again.

177
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,000
I think

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,440
being alone is pretty nice.

179
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,800
It's peaceful by myself.

180
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,480
And I can focus on studying.

181
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,040
Those beautiful beginnings—

182
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
those beautiful memories—

183
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,080
that's enough.

184
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,400
Let's go out this weekend.

185
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,080
Where to?

186
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
As long as you're willing.

187
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,240
I'll handle the rest.

188
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,040
I didn't say I'm willing.

189
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,600
You have to tell me where we're going.

190
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,560
Then I'll think about agreeing.

191
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,760
Where we go doesn't matter.

192
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,360
It's the thought that counts.

193
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,080
Just see it as me making up

194
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,880
for missing out before.

195
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,080
Okay.

196
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,200
I agree.

197
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,240
But I think you're a bit strange.

198
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,920
You seem much more relaxed than before.

199
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,840
You used to be mature and meticulous.

200
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,360
Like an adult.

201
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,720
But you always looked so serious.

202
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,880
Like you had a mission to finish.

203
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
It felt heavy.

204
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,440
But this time,

205
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,960
you're different.

206
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,280
Because I've figured something out.

207
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,680
Su Ruo

208
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,960
I want to make beautiful memories with you.

209
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,120
What's wrong, what's wrong?

210
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,480
Why are you slowing down?

211
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,240
Zhang Xun is really working hard.

212
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,040
Training for sports isn't easier than the college exam.

213
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,760
Yeah.

214
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,880
The college exam is one in ten thousand.

215
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,960
Sports is one in ten million.

216
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,800
Xun, you need to hurry up.

217
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,280
Lift your head.

218
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,120
Why should I lift my head?

219
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,400
To show everyone I failed and I'm ugly too?

220
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,880
Did you eat fried chicken?

221
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,800
Dad.

222
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,560
I really didn't.

223
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,520
How many times have I told you?

224
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,080
Fried chicken is high-calorie, high-fat food.

225
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,160
It affects your muscle fiber growth.

226
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,640
It'll block your way to the podium.

227
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,720
Dad, I just have no talent.

228
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,760
How can you have no talent?

229
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,360
With a dad like me,

230
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,160
your talent is top-notch.

231
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,480
It's just

232
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,600
you're not disciplined enough.

233
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,880
I'm not disciplined?

234
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,680
I'm still not disciplined, Dad?

235
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,800
I'm exhausted like a dog every day.

236
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,960
I've worn out several pairs of spikes.

237
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,120
And you say I'm not disciplined?

238
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,440
Talent matters a hundred times more

239
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,200
than discipline in sports, you know?

240
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,440
Fine.

241
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,120
If you want to run, you run.

242
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,040
I'm not running anymore.

243
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,960
You little brat!

244
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,280
You dare talk back to me?

245
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,880
What's wrong with you?

246
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,000
You said the boss is coming tomorrow.

247
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,880
Zhang Xun isn't really quitting, is he?

248
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,560
A chance to change your fate—

249
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,760
it'd be a shame to miss it.

250
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,640
It'd be great if I missed it.

251
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,800
Why?
