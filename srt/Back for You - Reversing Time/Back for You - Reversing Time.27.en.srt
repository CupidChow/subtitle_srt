1
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,280
Are you trying to say

2
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
you like me

3
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,240
Are you trying to say you like me

4
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,240
Yes

5
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,480
Then

6
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,440
How long have you liked me

7
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,200
How long

8
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,360
Since

9
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Hello, everyone

10
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,800
My name is Su Ruo

11
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,000
I love music and reading

12
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,120
Glad to join Class 3, Grade One

13
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,160
I hope in the next three years

14
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,440
we can all become friends

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,720
Since

16
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,280
the very first glance

17
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,640
The first glance

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,840
You've liked me for three years

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,480
Eighteen years

20
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,120
Eighteen years

21
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,120
You liked me since you were born

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,680
That's not what I meant

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,400
What I mean is

24
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,440
No matter how much time passes

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,680
I still can't help but

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,600
want to be with you always

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,360
Yu Xingchen

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,520
I only want to be with you too

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,440
Now I do

30
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,240
And always will

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,280
Because

32
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,520
I like you

33
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,960
Yu Xingchen

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,520
Did you hear what I said

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm back

36
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,160
Su Ruo

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,880
Su Ruo is still alive, right

38
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,560
Hello

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,040
Where are you

40
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,480
I

41
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,480
Where are you

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,080
I'm at the cemetery

43
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,480
I have a habit

44
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
After the homicide case

45
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,240
I always pay respects to the victim

46
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,120
Even the date of death hasn't changed

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,920
Why hasn't anything changed this time

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,360
Is she still with Ren Nan

49
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,600
Or

50
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,880
What do you mean "or"

51
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,960
Before Su Ruo's accident

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,320
Was she still with Ren Nan

53
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,960
No

54
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,000
A year ago

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,960
Ren Nan met Su Ruo

56
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,040
He started pursuing Su Ruo

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,720
Just like back in school

58
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,400
But Su Ruo never agreed

59
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,520
But you know

60
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,640
When two people are alone

61
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,680
It's easy to be seen

62
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,360
And misunderstandings happen

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,120
What misunderstanding

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,920
Ren Nan's fiancée always held a grudge

65
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,000
Fiancée

66
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,480
Lou Yuting

67
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,280
You mean

68
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,720
Lou Yuting found out

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,280
about Ren Nan pestering Su Ruo

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,480
It was a misunderstanding

71
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,880
Anyway, that night

72
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,160
Lou Yuting's brother brought some people

73
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,080
to block Su Ruo

74
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,360
Maybe tried to use the railing

75
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,520
to climb down

76
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,760
So

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,760
Su Ruo was startled and

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,240
accidentally fell

79
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,480
I understand now

80
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,320
I stopped them from being together

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,360
But I didn't change their reunion

82
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,160
Nor Lou Yuting's hatred

83
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Except for their romance

84
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,560
Even Su Ruo's death

85
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,160
was exactly the same

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,760
Chen

87
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,360
How have you been lately

88
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,160
So-so

89
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,840
My dad mentioned recently

90
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,720
He always tells me

91
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,760
there's a classmate named Yu Xingchen

92
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,480
who's really impressive

93
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,160
You should learn from him

94
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,920
Didn't you become a singer

95
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,840
Why are you still

96
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,400
involved with Lou Yuting

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,560
Do you need her help as a singer

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,320
Maybe I really have no talent for music

99
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Releasing a single online needs traffic

100
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,880
Getting on the charts costs money

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,400
But at that time

102
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,760
only Lou Yuting said she liked my music

103
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
admired my talent

104
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,600
and was willing to help me release a song

105
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,400
Before we knew it

106
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,600
we were about to get married

107
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,960
Chen

108
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,320
I used to think

109
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,960
Su Ruo was already with you

110
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,560
But I found out later

111
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,240
she's been single all these years

112
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,360
I just wanted to see if she's doing well

113
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,080
see if there's anything I can do for her

114
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,560
I really didn't mean to two-time

115
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,640
Chen

116
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,720
I don't understand

117
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,360
Su Ruo clearly liked you so much then

118
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,000
Couldn't you see it

119
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,600
But why did you later

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,960
become like a different person

121
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,640
and keep your distance from her

122
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,520
That summer she didn't get into college

123
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,480
She was sad all summer

124
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,840
What about you

125
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,960
You acted like nothing happened

126
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,360
Even Zhang Xun went to comfort her

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,560
But you didn't say a word to comfort her

128
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,800
Why didn't you get together with her

129
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,520
I just don't get it

130
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,440
Why

131
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,520
Forget it, Chen

132
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,680
Who am I to judge you

133
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,560
After all, it's because I was engaged and still bothered her

134
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,800
that things turned out this way

135
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,880
It's all my fault

136
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,840
I wanted an Americano.

137
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,240
Why did you bring two lattes?

138
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
I can't tell them apart.

139
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,920
Let me put it this way.

140
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
A single drop of milk

141
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,960
is enough to make black coffee cloudy.

142
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Even a tiny outside influence

143
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
can blur the truth.

144
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,320
What is the pure truth you seek?

145
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,320
No one really knows.

146
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
What are you referring to?

147
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,600
Are you talking about Su Ruo's case?

148
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,880
Su Ruo's case

149
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,480
has many uncertainties.

150
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,000
And in your novel,

151
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,840
there are also many uncertainties.

152
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,200
What a coincidence.

153
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Your novel and Su Ruo's case

154
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,360
are somehow connected.

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
What's even stranger

156
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,040
is that your novel

157
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,840
even mentions time travel.

158
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,880
I don't know among these

159
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,560
which is real

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
and which is fake.

161
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,560
Suddenly, I thought

162
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
you scored over five hundred on the college entrance exam.

163
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,440
From over one fifty to over five hundred.

164
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,960
At first, I thought you scored low on purpose.

165
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,800
But then I reconsidered.

166
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,080
No, that's not it.

167
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,240
You got into Dongda Physics later.

168
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,320
With your intelligence,

169
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
I feel like

170
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,120
there are two of you.

171
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,920
Yu Xingchen,

172
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,080
what you said to Ren Nan,

173
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,400
I want to say to you as well.

174
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,240
Don't challenge me.

175
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,880
And don't hide things from me.

176
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,280
If you don't plan to tell me the truth,

177
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,800
then I'll just put these two cloudy coffees

178
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,560
in front of you.

179
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,480
You pick which one you want.

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,440
I am hiding something from you.

181
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
But I'm still not sure

182
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,720
if I can tell you.

183
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,840
These are the possible causes

184
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,080
of Su Ruo's death I've been considering.

185
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,840
There were over ten at first.

186
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
But every time I talk to you,

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
I rule out a few.

188
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,360
Now, after ruling out,

189
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,320
only one possibility remains.

190
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,160
Of course, the truth may not be this.

191
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,480
But if you're interested,

192
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,520
feel free to take a look.

193
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,560
I didn't expect

194
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
you'd care so much about Su Ruo.

195
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,960
Solving puzzles is my joy.

196
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,360
Give me some time.

197
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,840
If I think it's right,

198
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,040
I'll tell you the secret I've been hiding.

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,240
The part you're hiding,

200
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,040
I've guessed over thirty possibilities.

201
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,360
After ruling them out one by one,

202
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,240
only three remain.

203
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,480
So,

204
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,680
hurry up.

205
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,960
Tell me before I figure it out.

206
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,920
Let me know.

207
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,840
After Su Ruo left you at the physiotherapy clinic,

208
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,560
she went home,

209
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,200
then to the time of her death.

210
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,320
Not much time passed in between.

211
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,120
Based on this,

212
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,680
Su Ruo received the letter

213
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
about half an hour before the incident.

214
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,800
When the police collected evidence,

215
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,280
Ren Nan's letter

216
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,600
was still intact on the table.

217
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,560
This means the letter

218
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
was read not long before the incident.

219
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,680
Su Ruo had just finished reading it.

220
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,320
You had a letter in the mailbox.

221
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,080
No name on it.

222
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,840
I thought it was for you.

223
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
So I put it on the table.

224
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,120
She didn't even have time to put the letter away.

225
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
Su Ruo definitely didn't contact Ren Nan.

226
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,200
Because if she had called Ren Nan,

227
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,600
the police

228
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,280
would have found Ren Nan immediately.

229
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,520
Why did Su Ruo leave her home

230
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,840
and go to the rooftop?

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,760
This point

232
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,280
confused me at first.

233
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,400
But I checked the news that day

234
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,200
and found something.

235
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,560
Perseid meteor shower

236
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,440
would peak on the night of the twelfth.

237
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,280
The public could watch it on the twelfth night.

238
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,520
I remember Su Ruo loved meteors.

239
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,360
Of course,

240
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,880
this is just my own guess.

241
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,720
If there are meteors,

242
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,720
never give up.

243
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,200
Outstanding people have goals.

244
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
Others only have wishes.

245
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,320
You cannot change the past,

246
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,440
but you can make your future better.

247
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,560
You cannot change the past,

248
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,640
but you can make your future better.
