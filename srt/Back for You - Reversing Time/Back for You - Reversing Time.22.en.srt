1
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,840
Xie Haohui

2
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,760
How's it going, Haohui?

3
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,480
Is there any hope for the teacher?

4
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
It's rare

5
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,640
to see you stumped by a problem.

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,800
Teacher

7
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,640
It's not that I can't solve it,

8
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,200
it's just

9
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,800
the blackboard has no space left.

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's already

11
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,200
got nowhere left to write.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,880
You're still just like you were.

13
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,240
That's great.

14
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,280
Keep it up.

15
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,360
Teacher Jiang

16
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,240
I'm Yu Xingchen.

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,560
I know.

18
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,560
By the way,

19
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,720
how's Su Ruo doing?

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,760
Darn it.

21
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,120
He doesn't know about this.

22
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,760
I never said she had to come.

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,520
Maybe she's just busy with work.

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,080
I just saw you

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,640
and suddenly remembered.

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,520
You two were so close in school.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,760
So, Yu Xingchen,

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,640
after all these years,

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,560
anything ever happen?

30
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,840
Jiang, what are you talking about?

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,280
We're talking about Su Ruo.

32
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,520
Su Ruo, she...

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,080
What happened to Su Ruo?

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,120
Yu Xingchen

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,560
I have a few words

36
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,800
I'd like to say to you alone.

37
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,240
Yu Xingchen

38
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,120
You did it.

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,000
Teacher Jiang, what do you mean?

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,120
My mind is so clear right now.

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,120
I keep remembering the past.

42
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,080
I remember asking you back then,

43
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,240
what do you want to be in the future?

44
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,200
You said,

45
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,040
"I want to be a kind person."

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,720
I just hope

47
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,240
when everyone hits rock bottom,

48
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,480
I'm not just an indifferent bystander.

49
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,960
You remember something

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,840
from so long ago?

51
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,120
The moment I saw you today,

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,200
I felt

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,640
your eyes are just like before.

54
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,080
Yu Xingchen

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,440
You haven't changed at all.

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,520
Jiang fell asleep.

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,920
He's even talking in his sleep.

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,360
He said Su Ruo's family is gone.

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,680
He asked us to look after her more.

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,960
I just thought of something.

61
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920
Let's discuss it.

62
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,040
I already guessed.

63
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,160
Stop hiding.

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,280
Some things

65
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,320
are better cleared up face to face.

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,760
I've met your brother-in-law too.

67
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,440
If you're at the hospital,

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,880
let's meet up.

69
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,400
Hello?

70
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,840
What do you really want?

71
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
You got the photo, right?

72
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,880
You gave that to Su Ruo, didn't you?

73
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,760
Your fingerprints are all over it.

74
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
No point denying it.

75
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,600
Yu Xingchen

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,200
Yu Xingchen, long time no see.

77
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,400
Let's get straight to the point.

78
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,280
You were with Su Ruo.

79
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,760
You admit that, right?

80
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,240
Nothing to deny there.

81
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
It's free to love, after all.

82
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,520
Tang Song looked into you.

83
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,680
You weren't at the scene that day.

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,480
That's right.

85
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,920
Xie Haohui

86
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,960
You two are still just like before.

87
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,320
study partnership.

88
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,000
Can I ask you a few questions?

89
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,040
Go ahead.

90
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
On the photo,

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,880
why are your fingerprints there?

92
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,000
Enough, Xie Haohui.

93
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
I know you're smart.

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
Don't play word games, this isn't a test.

95
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,880
I won't lose to you.

96
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,600
I like being challenged.

97
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,440
At our age,

98
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,280
still think you're the center of the universe.

99
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,240
Can't say it, huh?

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
On the photo,

101
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
why are your fingerprints there?

102
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,760
If they used cut-out letters,

103
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,360
there shouldn't be any fingerprints.

104
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,160
How do you know they're cut-out letters?

105
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,560
You sent me the photo.

106
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,960
Isn't it obvious at a glance?

107
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,840
Maybe you got some on when mailing it.

108
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,360
You must've worn gloves.

109
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,680
No prints when making it.

110
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,600
How could you leave prints mailing it?

111
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,760
The photo you sent is so close up.

112
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,880
Looks just like a note.

113
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,960
How do you know it's a letter?

114
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,920
You said you mailed it.

115
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,280
So it must be a letter.

116
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,560
Not just a note, right?

117
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
You all have such wild imaginations.

118
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,680
Save that for Tang Song.

119
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,320
See if he'll give you a chance.

120
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,200
That's enough, you two.

121
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,920
So what if it's a letter?

122
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,360
Besides, the letter just shows

123
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,760
good intentions toward Su Ruo.

124
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,040
Don't go home.

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,480
Stay somewhere else first.

126
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
I don't even know what you're suspecting me of.

127
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,520
I only showed you the first half.

128
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
The police never

129
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,440
released the second half of the letter.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,120
How do you know the second half says

131
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
"Don't go home,"

132
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,520
"Stay somewhere else first"?

133
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,560
Unless you were the one who sent it.

134
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,120
Either way, you're involved.

135
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,440
We've known the truth for a long time.

136
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,120
This concerns the case.

137
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,880
I'll report everything I just heard

138
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,840
exactly as it is.

139
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,760
Su Ruo didn't get into college.

140
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,080
She had no one to rely on.

141
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,720
She could only support herself
with hard work and her skills.

142
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,040
You know Su Ruo hasn't had
an easy life these years, right?

143
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,680
When I met her again,

144
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,800
I treated her really well.

145
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,440
Before she even said what she wanted,

146
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,440
I'd already bought it and put it
in front of her.

147
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,000
Every day after work, I went to see her.

148
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,120
I tried everything to make her happy
every day.

149
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,600
That's how things went for a while.

150
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,400
Eventually, she was moved by me.

151
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,520
She agreed to be with me.

152
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,080
You already had a fiancée
at that time, right?

153
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,720
My fiancée has been after me
since high school.

154
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,960
She kept clinging to me.

155
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
But I didn't like her.

156
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,160
Until half a year ago,

157
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,600
my dad's company had
the capital chain broken.

158
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,560
She said her family could help me.

159
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,880
She had just one condition.

160
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,040
That I marry her.

161
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,520
But the one I love is Su Ruo.

162
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,320
So I kept delaying
and didn't marry her.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,880
Not long ago,

164
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,480
she found out about me and Su Ruo.

165
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,800
She made a huge scene with me.

166
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,600
She insisted Su Ruo come out
and settle things.

167
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,840
I was afraid she'd do
something extreme.

168
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,640
So I...

169
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,960
So you were worried about Su Ruo

170
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,360
but afraid your handwriting
would be recognized,

171
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,360
so you used cut-out letters.

172
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,560
After Su Ruo learned
I had a fiancée,

173
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,040
she broke up with me.

174
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,840
She returned everything
I gave her.

175
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,640
She gave it all back,
just as it was.

176
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,920
She kept everything
very clear and precise.

177
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,680
What exactly did your fiancée do?

178
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,520
Is Su Ruo's death
really related to her?

179
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,920
I don't know.

180
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,080
She said she wanted
to teach Su Ruo a lesson.

181
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,640
If it really was her,

182
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,760
then I'm the one
who caused Su Ruo's death.

183
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,480
I don't like doing business.

184
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,800
I don't want to inherit
my dad's business.

185
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,200
But I did inherit it.

186
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,160
I don't like Lou Yuting.

187
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
But I accepted her anyway.

188
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,160
I just want to protect
the one I love.

189
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,120
But I...

190
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,840
We've already summoned

191
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,600
your fiancée for questioning.

192
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,000
Actually, I have one more favor
to ask you.

193
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,480
So she's Lou Yuting.

194
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,280
Alright.

195
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,880
Leave the rest to us.

196
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,280
You should go back first.

197
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,680
Teacher Jiang passed away
last night.

198
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,520
He went peacefully.

199
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,920
In a way,

200
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
it's kind of a blessing.

201
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,960
You came to see me

202
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,320
not just because of Teacher Jiang,
right?

203
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,360
Is there progress
on Tang Song's side?

204
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
No matter what,

205
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,400
Tang Song wouldn't tell me
the case details.

206
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
He wouldn't share them with me.

207
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,880
But I've been thinking
for a few days.

208
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,680
I've figured out a few things.

209
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,320
Shortly before the incident,

210
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,200
Lou Yuting found out
about Ren Nan

211
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
cheating and seeing two people.

212
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,520
Ren Nan sent Su Ruo
that anonymous letter.

213
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,760
Lou Yuting was upset
when she found out.

214
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,120
She told her brother.

215
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,720
Her brother took some people
to block Su Ruo.

216
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,120
They planned to scare her.

217
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,400
Force her to leave Ren Nan.

218
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,000
Did they push her down?

219
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,560
That night, for some reason,

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,640
Su Ruo went to the rooftop
of the next building.

221
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,520
Just at that moment,

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,960
Di Ge and his group arrived
at Su Ruo's place.

223
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Open the door.

224
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,640
Jianshe Community is an old complex.

225
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,400
You can see the hallway
of the next building
from the rooftop.

226
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,360
When Su Ruo saw

227
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,080
her own doorway blocked by people,

228
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,520
her first reaction was to run.

229
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,760
She could've just run
out of the complex.

230
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,400
Why did she stay on the rooftop?

231
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,240
Because she was trapped
and couldn't get down.

232
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,840
Why?

233
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,680
She recognized her uncle
in the hallway.

234
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,640
Su Ruo, in extreme fear,

235
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,640
suddenly ran into her uncle
after fifteen years.

236
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,720
Her uncle was drunk,

237
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,880
which triggered her old trauma.

238
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,240
In a state of panic,

239
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,200
she could only run back
to the rooftop.

240
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,400
And locked the door behind her.

241
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,560
She might've tried to climb
down the railing.

242
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,520
You told me before

243
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,080
that railing was old
and in disrepair.

244
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,200
That's just my guess.

245
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,200
The police are already investigating

246
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,960
in the direction of negligent homicide.

247
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,800
They're investigating Lou Yuting
and her brother.

248
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,800
So...

249
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,760
Is there anything else
I can do?

250
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,240
Actually, the police have long
been investigating

251
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,640
Lou Yuting and her brother.

252
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,760
The case has made
great progress.

253
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,840
So...

254
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,760
Whatever you do
won't make much difference.

255
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,160
Tang Song asked me
to tell you this.

256
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,800
Class,

257
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,400
who knows how to solve
this problem?

258
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,640
You can come up and write
the answer.

259
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,320
Don't skip any steps
in your solution.

260
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,920
What's wrong, Xie Haohui?

261
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,400
Even you can't solve it?

262
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,280
No, teacher.

263
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,280
I have many ways
to solve this problem.

264
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,320
But there's no space left
on the blackboard.

265
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,600
I have nowhere left
to write.
