1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's go.

2
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,680
I'm home.

3
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,120
Hurry and dry your hair.

4
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,080
Don't catch a cold.

5
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,800
I'll head out now.

6
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,760
Wait a second.

7
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,440
Take off your wet clothes.

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,920
I'll return them after washing.

9
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,640
Thanks. You should go home.

10
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,640
Su Ruo.

11
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,680
You don't need to worry.

12
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,160
My uncle will be home these days.

13
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,400
Sorry about that.

14
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
I didn't notice just now.

15
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,720
What is this feeling?

16
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
I actually fell asleep here.

17
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,360
So it really was a dream.

18
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,680
But this dream felt so real.

19
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,640
What's wrong?

20
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,080
Come to the police station.

21
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,480
This is from the day Su Ruo had the accident.

22
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,160
Surveillance footage from the neighborhood.

23
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,640
This person.

24
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,240
Followed Su Ruo into this building.

25
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,800
Didn't come out until the next morning.

26
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,680
Do you remember him?

27
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,920
You've seen him before.

28
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,800
I have.

29
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,240
When was that?

30
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,120
I had a dream about going back in time.

31
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
He showed up in that dream.

32
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,720
We're investigating. Don't joke around.

33
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm being serious.

34
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,960
The reason I asked you here—

35
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120
First, you were her last visitor.

36
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,040
Second—

37
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,400
I remember you're very observant.

38
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,600
Observant? What do you mean?

39
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,440
When Su Ruo's parents passed away—

40
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,880
No one in class noticed.

41
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
Even Lao Jiang didn't know.

42
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,480
Only you saw she was upset.

43
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,160
She stayed late to finish homework that day.

44
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
I think I saw from outside—

45
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,040
You were talking to her.

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,560
Were you comforting her?

47
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,600
When did you all

48
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,320
find out about Su Ruo's parents passing?

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,280
After National Day.

50
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,640
That's impossible.

51
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,520
You told me yourself.

52
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,200
By the time everyone knew,

53
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,760
months had already passed.

54
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,800
When did I ever tell you that?

55
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,920
You must've forgotten.

56
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,600
Lao Jiang knew the day after the accident.

57
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Later,

58
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,160
he sent Su Ruo away

59
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,360
and told the whole class

60
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,120
that something happened to Su Ruo's family.

61
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,560
Teacher Jiang.

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,520
Su Ruo's parents died in a car accident.

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,960
He asked everyone to comfort her for a while.

64
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,400
Did I really go back in time?

65
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,400
So was it a dream or not?

66
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,120
According to the Grandfather paradox,

67
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
I must've entered a parallel world.

68
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,160
Only the two of us from our class came.

69
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,480
It's been years since graduation.

70
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,400
Everyone has their own life now.

71
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,920
Oh right, Zhang Jie is here.

72
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,040
Your deskmate.

73
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,760
She was that close with Su Ruo?

74
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,200
She—

75
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,480
works here.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,400
Is she Su Ruo's aunt?

77
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,040
Su Ruo's memorial is over there.

78
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,200
Class President.

79
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,760
Thanks for your hard work.

80
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,520
Just doing my job.

81
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,160
Long time no see.

82
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,280
Didn't expect you to work here.

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,720
What a coincidence.

84
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Is there a problem?

85
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,360
No problem at all.

86
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,640
Isn't this pretty good?

87
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,800
Everyone ends up here eventually.

88
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,720
I'll try to stay as long as I can.

89
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,360
Until you come by.

90
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,160
It's starting.

91
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,720
Over here.

92
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,960
You didn't have breakfast, did you?

93
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,400
Thank you.

94
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Back in school,

95
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,000
lots of boys in class

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,840
would secretly bring Su Ruo extra breakfast.

97
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,640
They'd stuff it in her desk.

98
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,080
So when Su Ruo arrived at school,

99
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,520
her drawer was always packed full.

100
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,040
But those who brought breakfast

101
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,240
didn't show up today.

102
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,880
Yeah.

103
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,960
No one came.

104
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,840
You two talk first.

105
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,760
I'll go see if anyone over there needs help.

106
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
She's up there now.

107
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Take a good look.

108
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,000
One last look.

109
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
All these years,

110
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,520
I haven't reached out to you.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,560
You...

112
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,200
Are you still in touch
with Hui Ge?

113
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,960
Zhang Jie.

114
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
I've wanted to apologize to you
all these years.

115
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,360
Actually, Hui Ge never replied
to me back then.

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,560
I was the one who lost the letter.

117
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,640
I know.

118
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,160
It's all in the past.

120
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,840
Back then, you only had Su Ruo
in your heart.

121
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,760
I understand.

122
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,600
If I could do it over,

123
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,600
I would never lie to you.

124
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,760
I'd make sure to give the letter
to Hui Ge.

125
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,280
There's really no need.

126
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,560
It's been so many years.

127
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,680
I don't want to talk to you now.

128
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,520
It's not because I'm mad at you.

129
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,120
I just don't see the point.

130
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,280
I remember back then,

131
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,040
you and Zhang Jie were close.

132
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,480
I messed up.

133
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,000
What happened between you two?

134
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,600
Senior year of high school,

135
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,880
Zhang Jie gave me a love letter.

136
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,480
She said it was for Hui Ge.

137
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,560
She was too shy back then,

138
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,280
so she asked me to pass it on.

139
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,880
But I lost that love letter.

140
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,160
Lost it.

141
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,800
I put the letter in my pocket
at the time.

142
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,880
It was hot.

143
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,440
So I tied my jacket
around my waist.

144
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,800
I think that's when
the letter got lost.

145
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
What are you looking for?

146
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
You came at the right time.

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,840
Let me ask you something.

148
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,120
Answer me seriously.

149
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,880
Don't ask.

150
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,840
I didn't do well on the test.

151
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,000
I only got second place.

152
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Just one point behind first.

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,480
Second place is the biggest loser.

154
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,120
Who asked you about that?

155
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,240
I'm asking you.

156
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,720
You know Zhang Jie, right?

157
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,960
Zhang Jie from our class.

158
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,800
She said she likes you.

159
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,880
Sociologically or biologically?

160
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,000
Biologically.

161
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,120
The kind sped up by hormones.

162
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,240
What does that have to do with me?

163
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,520
An egg against a rock.

164
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,800
The force on the rock
is negligible.

165
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,440
So,

166
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,600
the egg against a rock itself

167
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,520
has nothing to do with the rock.

168
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,960
Hui Ge said

169
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,200
he doesn't like you.

170
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
He read my letter.

171
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,600
He read it.

172
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,440
He read it.

173
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,560
He knows now.

174
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,600
Goodbye.

175
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,840
Since then,

176
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,920
she never replied to my messages.

177
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,360
She wouldn't answer my calls.

178
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,720
I went to apologize to her.

179
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,720
She ignored me too.

180
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,240
Sounds pretty harsh.

181
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,880
I think I went too far, too.

182
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
That's not what I meant.

183
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,280
Yu Xingchen.

184
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,840
Let's get some classmates together
sometime.

185
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,120
I just feel Su Ruo's funeral

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
was too lonely.

187
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,560
Funerals are always lonely.

188
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,400
Have you only been to
lonely ones?

189
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,200
Remember senior year?

190
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,000
You cooked a whole table
of dishes.

191
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,880
For me and your mom.

192
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,800
How many dishes did you make?

193
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,080
Boiled fish slices,

194
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,680
stir-fried pork with green pepper,

195
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,320
lettuce with oyster sauce,

196
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,200
chives with dried tofu,

197
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,120
and...

198
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,800
tomato and egg soup.

199
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,880
Right, right.

200
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,960
Young people have
better memories.

201
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,800
And back then,

202
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,480
you seemed so skilled.

203
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
Like you'd lived alone
for years.

204
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,880
After all these years,

205
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,560
I've only cooked for you two
that one time.

206
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
But you still remember.

207
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,280
Your wedding with Meixian Ayi.

208
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,040
I'll be there.

209
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,160
About the wedding,

210
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,480
you don't need to handle it.

211
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,400
Meixian Ayi has a daughter.

212
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,880
Her name is Ning Jing.

213
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,920
She'll take care of it.

214
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,320
You must trust our work.

215
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,360
You can't just suspect people.

216
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,920
Young man,

217
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,960
everyone entering or leaving
needs to register.

218
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,160
It's you.
