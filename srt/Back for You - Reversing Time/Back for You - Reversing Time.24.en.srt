1
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,040
You really love music.

2
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,040
You play and sing quite well, too.

3
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,080
You shouldn't be thinking about
inheriting the family business.

4
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,120
I remember you once said

5
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,840
you don't like inheriting the company.

6
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,120
Did I ever tell you that?

7
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,040
With your vibe,

8
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,320
isn't it obvious?

9
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,200
I passed the art exam ages ago.

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,200
My major score was really high.

11
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,880
But my dad found out.

12
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,800
My dad...

13
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
He insists I learn business.

14
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
Xiao Zhao.

15
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,040
Ren Nan is downstairs at the company.

16
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,200
If he asks about me,

17
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,520
just say I'm not here.

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,120
Okay.

19
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,840
He's definitely here to nag me
about art school.

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Hello, Young Master Ren.

21
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,480
Hello, Young Master Ren.

22
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,520
My dad loves being so flashy.

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,080
I'm just afraid you'll be even flashier
in the future.

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,520
You're clearly in the office,

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,200
but you have the secretary say
you're not here.

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,960
No way.

27
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,040
I'm not that kind of person.

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,480
By the way,

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,360
where's my dad?

30
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,120
I think Mr. Ren isn't here.

31
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,640
That's perfect.

32
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,360
Let's go.

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,680
Young Master Ren.

34
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,440
Young Master Ren.

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
Your dad—

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,480
Why won't he let you study music?

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,720
He says the record industry
is struggling.

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,800
This thing—

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,040
he bought it for me in middle school.

40
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,120
And now?

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
Now he tells me to give it up.

42
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,600
Old men—

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,720
they're just fickle.

44
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,160
How is it?

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,280
It's great.

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
Back in middle school,

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,560
his business wasn't so busy.

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,720
He even played drums with me.

49
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,440
Later, his business grew bigger.

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,240
He didn't have time for me anymore.

51
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,800
Isn't this Brother Liu, the Stock God?

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,560
Hello, Stock God.

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,440
Stock God? Please.

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,240
I just know a bit about stock investing.

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,920
Stock God, we all heard from Mr. Ren—

56
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,760
he said every stock you recommend rises.

57
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,680
Stock God, could you mentor me someday?

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
You're too kind.

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,360
Is Mr. Ren here?

60
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,240
Mr. Ren isn't here.

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,240
Young Master Ren is here.

62
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,240
Aren't you leaving yet?

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,640
It's fine.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,080
My dad won't be back for a while.

65
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,880
I'll play some video games.

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,640
You take a break, too.

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,160
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,040
I've never sat in a CEO chair before.

69
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,240
I might as well try it out.

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,520
See what it's like to be Young Master Ren.

71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,760
I hate it when people call me Young Master Ren.

72
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,680
It's like I'm only my dad's son,

73
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,080
and don't even have my own name.

74
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,480
But your name—

75
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,960
wasn't it given by your dad, too?

76
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,520
Is Young Master Ren here?

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,360
Nice to meet you, Young Master Ren.

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,520
My surname is Liu.

79
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,680
I've met Mr. Ren a few times.

80
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
You've got it wrong.

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,560
I'm not Young Master Ren.

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,240
Young Master Ren, you're being dramatic again.

83
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,560
Even though

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,360
he never respects your choices,

85
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,800
never cares what you really think,

86
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,120
he's still your real dad, no matter what.

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
This young man makes sense.

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,080
Oh, right—

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Liu Haishi.

90
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,280
If you don't mind,

91
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,000
you can call me Uncle Liu.

92
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,160
Uncle Liu.

93
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,560
Looks like your dad

94
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,280
has been following my stock picks.

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,240
Look at this—

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,640
they've all skyrocketed!

97
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,040
Three months ago,

98
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,280
I recommended some promising stocks
to your dad.

99
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
He didn't believe me.

100
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,480
They went up the very next day.

101
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
And then?

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,000
I recommended a few more.

103
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,360
He still didn't believe me.

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,640
He missed out again.

105
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,480
Later on,

106
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,520
I recommended stocks to him several times.

107
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,080
Every time they rose,

108
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,520
they skyrocketed!

109
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,640
That's amazing!

110
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,000
You came today

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,720
to talk business with Mr. Ren, right?

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,520
Should we let Mr. Ren know?

113
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,440
Have him come over.

114
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,680
No rush.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,520
I'm just here to sit for a bit.

116
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,840
Young Master Ren also likes the drums.

117
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,240
I liked them too when I was young.

118
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,280
In the future,

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,840
are you planning to pursue art?

120
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,200
Not planning to inherit the family business?

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,400
Young Master Ren can't decide his own life.

122
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,840
Of course he'll inherit the family business.

123
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,360
Isn't that right, Young Master Ren?

124
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,680
Well,

125
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,840
since that's the case,

126
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,640
Young Master Ren can start managing money now.

127
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,720
Uh,

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,000
Money,

129
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,400
the more you know it,

130
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,040
the more it knows you.

131
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,560
Look at your outfit.

132
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,040
Oh,

133
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,480
just look at your classmate's shoes.

134
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,560
It shows Young Master Ren's social circle

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,240
is quite valuable too.

136
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,560
Young Master Ren,

137
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,840
you're usually pretty well-off, right?

138
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,480
I...

139
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,080
When I'm free,

140
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,760
I like to throw parties for the class.

141
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,480
Set off fireworks,

142
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,280
do some flashy, romantic activities.

143
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,320
So, are you interested

144
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,120
in the stock market?

145
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,040
Just think,

146
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,280
if you make money in stocks,

147
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
you can treat the whole class

148
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,320
to a party,

149
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,240
watch fireworks,

150
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,160
and have another romantic class event.

151
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,360
Most importantly,

152
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,040
you can buy instruments you like.

153
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,320
If you can earn money on your own,

154
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,040
then in the future,

155
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,240
your father won't control you as much.

156
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,760
How much money do I need?

157
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,280
Well,

158
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,760
we can start by buying some loose stocks.

159
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,600
I'll scrape together some more,

160
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
help you get one hundred thousand.

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,200
Try to get you in the market first.

162
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,800
No need to scrape up one hundred thousand.

163
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,680
I already have that much myself.

164
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Look at your handsome classmate,

165
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,200
he's got a business mind.

166
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,960
Want to consider

167
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,440
starting with one hundred or two hundred thousand?

168
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,240
Just to practice.

169
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Sure.

170
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
I'll put up one hundred thousand first.

171
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,120
Alright.

172
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,360
So, um...

173
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,560
You're not much older than me.

174
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,360
Calling you "uncle" doesn't fit.

175
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,120
How about I call you Brother Liu?

176
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,560
Okay.

177
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,720
Brother Liu,

178
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,320
this trip wasn't easy for you.

179
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,640
It wasn't really hard.

180
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,840
As long as there's profit,

181
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,320
it's all worth it.

182
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,080
Of course, I mean

183
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,560
from thousands

184
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,880
or hundreds of stocks,

185
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,440
you picked someone like Young Master Ren.

186
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,640
That's really not easy.

187
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
What do you mean by that?

188
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,120
Did Young Master Ren tell you that?

189
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Brother Liu,

190
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,800
I have a question for you.

191
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,080
If a stock rises a lot and falls a little,

192
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,040
is that a bull market trend feature?

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,800
Uh...

194
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,880
Young Master Ren,

195
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,160
I'm all about real trading.

196
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,200
I don't study theory much.

197
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,280
As long as it makes money, that's enough.

198
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,800
You...

199
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,440
Look at the stocks I recommended to your dad.

200
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
Every single one

201
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,840
was accurately predicted to rise or fall.

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,280
Open your dad's email,

203
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
check the dates.

204
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,240
Didn't I recommend them first,

205
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,560
and then they went up?

206
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,520
I think,

207
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,960
no need to bother opening his email.

208
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
How about you open your own email

209
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,480
and let me take a look?

210
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,360
Uh...

211
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,640
That's not a good idea.

212
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,000
Besides Young Master Ren,

213
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
you probably send

214
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,400
the same email to hundreds of people daily.

215
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,840
You pick a stock that day,

216
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,560
then send to different groups

217
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,080
whether it'll rise or fall.

218
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,640
The chance of rising or falling is fifty-fifty.

219
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,560
So,

220
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,640
some people

221
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,360
will think your prediction is right.

222
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,760
Next,

223
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,280
you repeat the trick.

224
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,720
Eventually, you'll filter out a group

225
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,560
who, in their eyes,

226
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,360
you

227
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,600
are the Stock God.

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,320
Because your predictions

229
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,160
are always correct.

230
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,880
That's why I admired you just now.

231
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
One in a thousand.

232
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,520
If you had this perseverance,

233
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,080
and did a proper job,

234
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,440
you'd have made it long ago.

235
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,120
But I think,

236
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,760
such a complex job

237
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,360
can't be done by just one person.

238
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,080
Behind you,

239
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,760
there must be a whole

240
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,520
scam team, right?

241
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,520
Don't panic.

242
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,280
Go turn yourself in.

243
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
Try to get leniency.

244
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
Yu Xingchen.

245
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,600
Yu Xingchen.

246
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,320
Ruoruo

247
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,760
Why are you here?

248
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,600
Auntie

249
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,960
Is Yu Xingchen home?

250
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,360
I need to talk to him.

251
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,600
He'll be back soon.

252
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,200
Don't just stand there.

253
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,120
Come in and have a seat.

254
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,000
Hurry up, come on.

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,520
No need, Auntie, really.

256
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,240
Old Yu

257
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,520
Your daughter is here.

258
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,400
Hurry up.

259
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,640
Cut some fruit, make tea.

260
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,520
Grab a bottle of cola.

261
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,760
Quick, don't dawdle.

262
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm coming, I'm coming.

263
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,720
Yu Xingchen

264
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,240
How did you figure out

265
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,360
he was a scammer just now?

266
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,040
This kind of trick is only popular now.

267
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,520
In a few years, most people will spot it.

268
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,640
But your way with words was amazing.

269
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,760
Just a few sentences,

270
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,040
and that guy was speechless.

271
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
If I had your eloquence,

272
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,840
could I convince my dad

273
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,880
to let me study music?

274
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
That's how it is.

275
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,840
Your dad's point

276
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,720
is actually right.

277
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,880
In a few years,

278
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,320
the record industry will decline.

279
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,960
But what he doesn't know

280
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,120
is this field will have new ecological development.

281
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,360
The future is the internet era.

282
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,360
We won't need CDs to listen to music.

283
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,280
So you mean

284
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,120
using a portable media player

285
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,840
or listening on a phone?

286
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
Just think about it.

287
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,040
If one day

288
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,840
we can shop and order food by phone,

289
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,440
listen to music on our phones,

290
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,280
watch movies, live streams, play games—

291
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
what does that mean?

292
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,880
What does it mean?

293
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,240
That's a huge change.

294
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,400
Let me just tell you one thing.

295
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,000
Right now,

296
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,040
we line up at CD stores for albums.

297
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,160
But in the future,

298
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,680
just a tap on our phones,

299
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,480
and the album is on our phone.

300
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,280
And your songs will instantly go online,

301
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,160
so people can hear them anytime, anywhere.

302
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,720
So tell me,

303
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,760
the decline of the record industry

304
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,120
and you being a singer—

305
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,520
are they really connected?

306
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,880
But the key is,

307
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,680
your songs have to be good.

308
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,240
That's too far-fetched.

309
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,520
Is that even possible?

310
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,000
-But what you said seems   -Yeah,

311
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,600
to make some sense.

312
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
These things

313
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,120
are hard for you to grasp.

314
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
But your dad's been in business for years.

315
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,400
As a successful entrepreneur,

316
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,760
he surely knows.

317
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,360
It's 2010 now.

318
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,600
Change has already begun.

319
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,920
Your dad probably

320
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,600
senses this trend.

321
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,280
Alright.

322
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,360
I'll do as you said

323
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,400
and talk to my dad.

324
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,480
Ruoruo, have some more.

325
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,240
Uncle, Auntie,

326
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,400
I really can't eat anymore.

327
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,080
Also,

328
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,280
I need to head back.

329
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
Ruoruo

330
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,000
Stay a bit longer.

331
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
Xingchen will be back soon.

332
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,280
It's getting late.

333
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,120
I need to go home and study.

334
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,880
Of course, you can't neglect your studies.

335
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,680
Uncle's only regret is

336
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,840
he just learned Sea View Buddha Jumps Over the Wall

337
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,760
and hasn't had a chance to show you.

338
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,920
Then next time, I'll try it.

339
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,920
While you have these days,

340
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,520
learn a few more dishes.

341
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,480
Next time, cook them for Ruoruo together.

342
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,080
I'll walk her home then.

343
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,160
No need.

344
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,080
I can go back myself.

345
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,200
I won't trouble you, Uncle.

346
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,800
It's no trouble at all.
