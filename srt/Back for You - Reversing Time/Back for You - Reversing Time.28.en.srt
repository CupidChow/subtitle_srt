1
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,760
Come on.

2
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,560
It's really fine, don't worry.

3
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,800
Do you have my contact info?

4
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,800
Open the door.

5
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,400
Open the door.

6
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,280
Brother.

7
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,160
Let's go.

8
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,720
Su Ruo.

9
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,000
Su Ruo.

10
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,600
Su Ruo.

11
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,840
Help!

12
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,440
Help!

13
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,520
Help!

14
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,320
Help!

15
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,520
After reading Brother Hui's notes,

16
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,120
for several days in a row,

17
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,360
I kept having the same dream.

18
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,960
Su Ruo's death kept replaying

19
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,080
and haunting my mind.

20
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,360
I don't know what really happened.

21
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
What was the actual scene like?

22
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,040
Maybe I'll never know.

23
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,920
All I know is, in my dream, Su Ruo

24
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,040
was desperately calling out to me.

25
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,840
She screamed until her voice broke,

26
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,080
but I didn't notice at all.

27
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,240
Fragments keep flashing

28
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,400
through my mind.

29
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,000
Some are from my real past,

30
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,960
some happened when I traveled through time.

31
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,200
Maybe changing the past so often

32
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,960
is making my memories start to blur.

33
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,760
I've tried everything I could,

34
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,240
but I still can't stop Su Ruo's death.

35
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,520
What else can I do?

36
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,720
But...

37
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,440
I'm not ready to give up yet.

38
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,440
Before that,

39
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,640
there's one more thing I need to confirm.

40
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,680
I haven't been back in over ten years.

41
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
This place hasn't changed much.

42
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,760
You're wearing so many layers.

43
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Aren't you hot?

44
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,600
Hot or cold is just how you feel.

45
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,040
It depends on the person.

46
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,280
You said the weather's been strange lately.

47
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
Could it be related to cosmic events,

48
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,400
like comets or something?

49
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,960
Anyway, it's not about space-time tunnels.

50
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,640
What about the students?

51
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,920
Every few years, there's a new batch.

52
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,880
And the climate?

53
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,600
Every few hundred years,

54
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,240
there's a mini ice age.

55
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,600
Nothing in this world stays the same.

56
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,440
Change is the only constant.

57
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,720
Space-time rifts are the same.

58
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
They won't always be there.

59
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,440
Based on the timing in your novel,

60
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,480
in two days,

61
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,560
at nine o'clock the night after tomorrow,

62
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,440
it should recede.

63
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,080
So you're saying it'll disappear that night?

64
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,440
After that, every night at nine,

65
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,880
there won't be a time rift there anymore.

66
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,000
When will it show up again?

67
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Maybe in a few hundred years,

68
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,080
or a few thousand years,

69
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,040
or maybe

70
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,520
it'll show up again next month.

71
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,440
It could appear in the northeast,

72
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,320
or in Oceania,

73
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,880
or even on the moon.

74
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,280
The universe is so vast,

75
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,840
it can show up wherever it wants.

76
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,760
Anywhere it wants.

77
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,280
Whenever it wants to appear,

78
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
it just appears.

79
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,640
Right?

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,960
So basically,

81
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,880
the night after tomorrow is my last chance.

82
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,920
But...

83
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,040
How do you know this so precisely?

84
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,920
I just used your novel's

85
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
appearance times,

86
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,200
disappearance times,

87
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,960
and the intervals between them

88
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
to make a chart.

89
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
The pattern is obvious.

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's easy to calculate.

91
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,240
But...

92
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,760
Are you sure you want to talk math with me?

93
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,320
I've decided to wrap up the novel.

94
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,680
There's something I need to remind you.

95
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,600
Every time your protagonist goes back,

96
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,680
it's random.

97
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,200
The only constant is

98
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,440
time flows forward there, just like here.

99
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,000
It always moves forward.

100
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,320
Based on your last chapter,

101
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,400
it was ten days before the Gaokao.

102
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,920
So if you go back this time,

103
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,880
and end up right at the Gaokao exam,

104
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,520
what will your protagonist face?

105
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,760
Do you know?

106
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
One hundred fifty points.

107
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,640
It's a Gaokao retake.

108
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,640
It's more than just a retake.

109
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,200
Magnetic field shifts disrupt protein phosphorylation cycles,

110
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,320
causing sleep disorders and metabolic syndrome.

111
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,120
Continuous energy output from another universe

112
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,400
is like your organs being starved of oxygen.

113
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,200
Besides that,

114
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,640
the college you attend will be different.

115
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,200
The people you meet,

116
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,920
the jobs you do, all will change.

117
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,400
Everything will be turned upside down.

118
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,280
No one knows if it's good or bad.

119
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,120
Are you sure

120
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,520
you want to take this gamble?

121
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,400
And also,

122
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
space-time has a rejection mechanism.

123
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,240
If it detects

124
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,960
something that doesn't belong here,

125
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,520
it'll force you back to your original world.

126
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,960
If you try to fight this rule,

127
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,720
your body might suffer irreversible damage.

128
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,440
I don't know what will happen.

129
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,320
Maybe

130
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,200
you'll never come back.

131
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,200
Is it worth it?

132
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,400
I have another question.

133
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,760
If I truly have no other way,

134
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
and I tell her everything,

135
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,160
including that I'm from the future,

136
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,160
what will happen in the end?

137
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,360
When someone knows the future,

138
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,680
what kind of butterfly effect will it cause?

139
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,120
No one can predict that.

140
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,240
But personally,

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,760
I wish you luck.

142
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
Xie Haohui.

143
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,040
The thing I kept from you—

144
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,000
did you already guess

145
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,320
the final possibility?

146
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,280
I'm heading out.

147
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,000
Thank you.

148
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,760
Brother

149
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,160
Why are you here?

150
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,640
Dad

151
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,120
Auntie

152
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,480
I'm here.

153
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,400
Xingchen, you've worked hard.

154
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:03,960
Eat some more.

155
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,520
Okay.

156
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,200
Brother

157
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,160
What are you planning to do next?

158
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm planning to find a girl.

159
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,640
Congrats, Old Yu!

160
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,120
Good things are coming.

161
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,680
Which girl?

162
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,720
Do you have a photo to show me?

163
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,640
Dad

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,880
You've met her.

165
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,640
It's Su Ruo.

166
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,760
It's been years since we met.

167
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,800
Is she doing well?

168
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
She's doing great.

169
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
That's good.

170
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,960
Your cooking skills

171
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
haven't declined at all.

172
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,560
It still tastes the same.

173
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,440
It's delicious.

174
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,720
You should eat more.

175
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,600
Alright, alright.

176
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,400
Auntie, here.

177
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,360
You should eat more too.

178
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,400
Alright, alright.

179
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,840
You eat too.

180
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,640
Brother

181
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,320
What exactly are you going to do?

182
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,160
Su Ruo

183
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,360
Isn't Su Ruo already gone?

184
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,280
She's still alive.

185
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,560
Brother

186
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,040
You're always welcome home.

187
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,640
Su Ruo, in my eyes

188
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,200
Yu Xingchen

189
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,320
What do you want to do now?

190
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,120
I want to settle

191
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,720
everything once and for all.

192
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,880
Should I say you're devoted

193
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,240
or just stubborn?

194
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,440
Darn it.

195
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,760
You suddenly ask this—

196
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,920
Who would remember?

197
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,600
It's all in the past.

198
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
I've handled many similar cases.

199
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,760
But Su Ruo's case—

200
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,560
Even without the classmate connection,

201
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,120
I still feel regret.

202
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,360
Everyone could see

203
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,000
she actually liked you.

204
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,280
We should always be together.

205
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,640
Yu Xingchen

206
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,600
I like you.

207
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,640
Why wouldn't I admit how I feel about her?

208
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,840
Are you the only one who knows?

209
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,640
Her smile when she looks back—

210
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
It really hits different.

211
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,960
She often looked back at me like that.

212
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,720
She never really accepted me.

213
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,080
Her heart was always only for you.

214
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,200
If she worked somewhere else,

215
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,040
or lived in a different place,

216
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,040
maybe things would end differently.

217
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,280
If only she could be with you.

218
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
I mean it.

219
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,880
Still talking about "if"?

220
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,080
What if she trained for sports and went to a sports school?

221
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,560
There's no "if" in real life.

222
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,080
If I could,

223
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,600
I'd try my best to pursue her.

224
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,880
I wouldn't get involved with Lou Yuting again.
