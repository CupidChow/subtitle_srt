1
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,200
Looks good.

2
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,320
Looks good.

3
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,240
So beautiful.

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,000
Good.

5
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,640
Does it look good?

6
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,800
It looks great.

7
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,240
I was worried my wife's taste was old-fashioned.

8
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
This is pretty nice.

9
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,720
The older, the wiser.

10
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,520
Who are you calling old?

11
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,720
I meant the hotpot.

12
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,240
The tripe in the hotpot.

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,560
If it's overcooked, it tastes bad.

14
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,480
Come on.

15
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,400
Come.

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,960
Come, have a seat.

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,880
Hurry.

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,680
Come.

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,640
Come, eat up.

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
-Cheers.      -Come on.

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,280
Come.

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,480
Cheers.

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,360
No way, Yu Xingchen.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,440
If this keeps up, I'll get fat.

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,080
I was worried my parents were too enthusiastic.

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,400
You might not be used to it.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,720
But you seem fuller than me.

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
Ask Auntie later.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,600
How much is the clothing?

30
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,400
And also,

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,880
I can't keep staying here.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
Your family is really great.

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,000
But this can't go on forever.

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,120
Uncle and Auntie take care of me.

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,320
They haven't rested well.

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,000
They have to work in the morning.

37
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,120
It's too hard for them.

38
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,440
I know.

39
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,600
But you can't go back to live there, right?

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,960
How about this:

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
I'll go with you to look for a place.

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,240
Ruo Ruo, I heated bath water for you.

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,280
You can take a bath now.

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,600
Got it, Auntie. I'll be right there.

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,880
Thank you so much.

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,680
Yu Xingchen.

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,640
It feels like I'm living at home.

48
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,320
Yu Xingchen.

49
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,320
There's a meteor.

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,640
I heard from Zhang Jie and the others

51
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,200
Tonight is the Gemini meteor shower.

52
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,840
You still study this?

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
I used to.

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,680
After so much has happened,

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,040
I'm not as interested anymore.

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,240
Are you making a wish?

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,360
Childish.

58
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,920
The moment you see a meteor,

59
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,520
there's no time to make a wish.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Just like me fifteen years later,

61
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,960
the instant I saw you,

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
I couldn't make a wish.

63
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,760
Tell me,

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,000
with so many meteors passing by,

65
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,800
will the sky break?

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,120
Generally,

67
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,160
if the change isn't strong enough,

68
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,720
the altered timeline

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,560
will heal like a wound

70
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,840
and return to its original history.

71
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,680
No matter how many times I

72
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,160
rush here like a meteor,

73
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,600
that cruel night sky fifteen years later

74
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,480
won't change.

75
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,400
It won't.

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,320
No matter how many meteors cross the sky,

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,960
it won't break.

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,640
Isn't that a good thing?

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,680
Why are you sighing?

80
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,480
Because you're not in that sky.

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,360
What are you talking about?

82
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,400
I mean,

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
no matter how many late-night snacks you eat,

84
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
you won't get fat.

85
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
Don't worry.

86
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,800
I didn't forget.

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,880
You two...

88
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,040
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

89
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,920
Yu Xingchen.

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
Come here, I need to discuss something.

91
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,200
I don't want to do morning exercises these days.

92
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,280
If my dad asks,

93
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,560
I'll say I lent you my shoes.

94
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,280
Is that okay?

95
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,440
You only have one pair of running shoes?

96
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,280
True, that's not very convincing.

97
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
You came to my door early in the morning

98
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,080
just to ask me this?

99
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
You're something else.

100
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,520
Well...

101
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,880
Something happened at my home.

102
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,560
So I'm staying at Yu Xingchen's for a few days.

103
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,440
You two...

104
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Are you official now?

105
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,520
What are you saying?

106
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,600
Su Ruo.

107
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,640
About this...

108
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,000
Help me keep it secret.

109
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,200
You know I can keep my mouth shut.

110
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,680
Absolutely won't tell anyone.

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
What?

112
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,200
Su Ruo is living at Yu Xingchen's place.

113
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,200
Living together.

114
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,040
Sharing a bed.

115
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,040
Discussing the last big question in bed.

116
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
I want to tell you,

117
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,120
don't let rumors affect you.

118
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,400
Just focus on your studies.

119
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,040
From what you're saying,

120
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,960
you want to stay at my place longer?

121
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,880
Not really.

122
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,480
We're both innocent.

123
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,840
My conscience is clear.

124
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,480
Are you hiding something?

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,200
If I were,

126
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,800
why would I ask you to move out?

127
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,800
That's true.

128
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,680
Seriously,

129
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,440
even if you keep living at my place,

130
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm not afraid of gossip.

131
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,440
But it's senior year now.

132
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,360
My parents are too enthusiastic.

133
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,000
My home isn't good for your exam prep.

134
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,800
It's settled then.

135
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,480
We'll look for a place together tomorrow.

136
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,920
Classmate,

137
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
Our rental info here

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,840
is all clearly priced.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,120
The place you like

140
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,720
really

141
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,760
can't be rented at your price.

142
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,640
Well...

143
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,360
Is there water?

144
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,840
Yes.

145
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,360
Come.

146
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,640
I'd like a cup of hot water.

147
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,120
Yes.

148
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,040
It's a bit hot, be careful.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Here's the situation.

150
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,680
I trust your claim of transparent pricing.

151
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
But I don't believe the price is fixed.

152
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,320
That it's unchanging.

153
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,760
You're using peak season prices in off-season.

154
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,840
Isn't that a bit much?

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,880
Young man,

156
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,920
The apartment is in demand all year.

157
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,680
Really?

158
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,280
Then why are we the only three here?

159
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,400
No one else is around.

160
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
It's the weekend, fewer people.

161
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,480
Didn't you just say that yourself?

162
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,040
It's always in demand, year-round.

163
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
So weekends don't count?

164
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,600
Let me guess.

165
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,000
Because this is a university town.

166
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,840
The best time to rent here each year

167
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,160
is when the semester starts.

168
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,640
But now it's almost finals.

169
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,760
It's harder to rent apartments.

170
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,880
So you must have

171
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,440
your own bottom price now.

172
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
I just want to ask,

173
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,160
what exactly is that bottom price?

174
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,280
Young man, yes,

175
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
We do lower the rent at this time.

176
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,960
If you only rent for one or two months,

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,880
like during winter or summer break,

178
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,720
I can talk to the landlord

179
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,920
and maybe lower the price a bit.

180
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
The problem is,

181
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,760
this young lady mentioned long-term rental.

182
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,400
So winter and summer break don't apply.

183
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,960
Long-term rent is actually higher.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
So you mean

185
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,000
there's a discount for breaks,

186
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
but only during winter and summer break.

187
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,840
After the break, I won't rent anymore.

188
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,400
I'll offer it to someone who pays more.

189
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,160
The price gap between finals and semester start

190
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,320
is about the same as your agency fee, right?

191
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,800
How much is your agency fee?

192
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,160
Five percent.

193
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
Ten percent.

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,160
Agency fees these days, let me think.

195
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,240
Hmm, that's pretty high.

196
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,920
Must be fifteen percent.

197
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
To be honest with you,

198
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,200
when I viewed the apartment earlier,

199
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,320
I noted the landlord's contact and address.

200
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,120
So if I skip you

201
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,400
and contact the landlord directly,

202
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,040
he won't pay the agency fee.

203
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
We can pocket the difference.

204
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,480
Everyone wins, right?

205
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,000
Mine.

206
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,480
Do you really want this apartment?

207
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,680
If the price isn't right,

208
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,480
that's a shame.

209
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,160
Wait a moment.

210
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,040
I can rent it to you at the current price.

211
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,200
No increase when school starts.

212
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,000
Is that okay?

213
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,960
First, we can't pay the deposit upfront.

214
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,320
For this contract,

215
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,680
I'll sign only when the landlord is here.

216
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,080
Second, the water and electricity fees

217
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,640
aren't clearly stated.

218
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,880
Is it residential or commercial?

219
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,960
You didn't clarify the property or internet fees.

220
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,120
I need to meet the landlord in person.

221
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,600
How do I know it's really the landlord

222
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
and not a sub-landlord renting to us?

223
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,200
What if there's a dispute later?

224
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,560
Who do we turn to then?

225
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
No way.

226
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,680
How about this instead?

227
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,280
Add one more clause.

228
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,120
If a dispute arises,

229
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,520
we tenants aren't responsible.

230
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,000
Any other requests?

231
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,760
Just say it.

232
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,840
We'll only pay one month's deposit.

233
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
We can't run off anyway.

234
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,000
Alright.

235
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,120
Anything else to add?

236
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,760
Okay then.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,400
I'll revise the contract right now.

238
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,320
Bro,

239
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
Where are you from?

240
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,480
I'm just a student.

241
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,920
I believe her.

242
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,840
You—

243
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,800
I don't believe you.

244
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,560
Yu Xingchen.

245
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,800
Let's go celebrate.

246
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,000
Sure.

247
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,440
But I don't have much cash today.

248
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,240
Who said you have to treat?

249
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
You treat.

250
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,440
Forget it.

251
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Save your money.

252
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,720
Don't you still have to pay rent?

253
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,960
Who said I'm treating?

254
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,200
My uncle is treating.

255
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,320
I want to eat wontons.

256
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,680
I know a place.

257
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,160
It probably just opened.

258
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,840
I've eaten there once.

259
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,440
It's really delicious.

260
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,040
I'll take you there.

261
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,880
Really?

262
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,600
Let's go!

263
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,880
Yu Xingchen.

264
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,760
Didn't you say this was an old shop?

265
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,200
How come—

266
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,160
I just remember it's around here.

267
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,680
Maybe it's on that street?

268
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,320
It's fine.

269
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,040
Let's go.

270
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,480
This is a food street.

271
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,840
I'll make sure you try the best wontons.

272
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
Let's go get our ID cards now.

273
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,760
Do you still have enough New Year's money?

274
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,760
Yeah.

275
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,240
Pack up what you need to bring.

276
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,280
Oh, right—

277
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,600
I asked the agency about it.

278
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
This university town

279
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,440
is a bit far from our school.

280
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,400
But there are three buses every morning.

281
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,520
At six thirty, seven, and seven thirty.

282
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,960
They all go straight to Huayuan Supermarket near our school.

283
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,080
They're all free.

284
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
You think of everything.

285
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,800
You don't seem like a high schooler.

286
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm much older than you.

287
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,520
I've had more takeout than you've had meals.

288
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,920
You never know when to stop.

289
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,200
No idea how this kid is doing now.

290
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,800
This—

291
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,960
Ruo Ruo—

292
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,560
Ruo Ruo.

293
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,800
Auntie.
