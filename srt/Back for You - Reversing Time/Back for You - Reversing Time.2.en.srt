1
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,720
Everyone, please take your seats.

2
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,920
Teacher Jiang will be here soon.

3
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,640
Ren Nan, take a look.

4
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,840
Does it look like an adult's signature?

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,120
Not at all.

6
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,680
Hui Ge, can you sign my dad's name?

7
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
I didn't do well on this test either.

8
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,800
Let me be alone for a moment.

9
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,680
148

10
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,360
This is a multiple-choice question.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,880
Last chance.

12
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Tang Song, what are you doing?

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,600
New shoes?

14
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,720
How about these Air Force Ones?

15
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,600
I have a pair of Jordan 5s, bought too big.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,920
I'll sell them to you for half price.

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,000
Sure.

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,040
School rules say no selling on campus.

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
And you, Tang Song.

20
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,280
Your dad's a cop.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,520
Why are you doing business here?

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,200
So what?

23
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,320
I'm not going to be a cop when I grow up.

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,400
Exactly.

25
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,480
Wait till Teacher Jiang comes and deals with you.

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,080
Who are you trying to scare? It's PE class.

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,600
He's really here.

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,720
Wake up.

29
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm dreaming.

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,480
The deceased was our high school classmate.

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,960
The one you've never forgotten.

32
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,080
I can't even dream of you.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,720
Yu Xingchen.

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,360
If you like standing so much,

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
then keep standing.

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,720
Today,

37
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,760
the PE teacher is out sick.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,320
I'll be teaching this class instead.

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,400
Taking over PE again.

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,200
What are you doing?

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,000
The First Mock Exam results are out.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,120
Our class, out of all thirteen classes,

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
has the worst grades.

44
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,200
You're the worst senior class I've ever taught.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
I really missed hearing that.

46
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,640
Take out your test papers.

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,200
Question two.

48
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a freebie.

49
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,000
You don't even want free points.

50
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,920
What are you doing?

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
This dream feels so real.

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,120
Are you looking for trouble?

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,040
Zhang Jie.

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,320
You explained it well down there.

55
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,640
Why not come up and explain?

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,240
Teacher Jiang.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,440
Yu Xingchen poked me first.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
Yu Xingchen.

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,880
Always joking around.

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,240
How many points did you get?

61
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Just poking at the girls.

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,400
Come on, poke me and see what happens.

63
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,960
Quiet.

64
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,560
Yu Xingchen.

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,680
Reporting.

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,640
Sorry, I was held up by something.

67
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,280
Did I tell you to go back to your seat?

68
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,280
Fine, hand in your homework.

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,280
Then go back to your seat.

70
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,160
Sorry.

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,040
I didn't do it.

72
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,160
Su Ruo didn't do it either.

73
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,000
Why not?

74
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,080
I was held up by something.

75
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,040
What was it?

76
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,080
You're wasting everyone's precious senior year.

77
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,400
People get sick sometimes.

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,960
She must have her reasons too.

79
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,960
Why not just start the lesson?

80
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
You're wasting time by dragging this out.

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,480
Yu Xingchen.

82
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,000
You're out of control.

83
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,720
I'll go to your house and talk to your parents today.

84
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,960
Don't make up any stories.

85
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,200
Like saying they're away on business.

86
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
I won't make anything up.

87
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,160
My mom's laid off, she's home all day.

88
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,840
But that's not true for you, Teacher Jiang.

89
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,560
You said the PE teacher took leave.

90
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
How many times has it been now?

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
How could that be true?

92
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,840
Always on leave.

93
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,480
Yeah.

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,760
Quiet.

95
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,440
Yu Xingchen, fine.

96
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,640
This time, the teacher

97
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,960
won't play games with you.

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,280
Let's do something real.

99
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,080
A self-criticism report, one thousand words.

100
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,240
Write it right now.

101
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,440
Don't go home until it's done.

102
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
Su Ruo, finish your homework.

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,320
Don't go home until it's finished.

104
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,640
Her silhouette is the one I know best.

105
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,400
I've watched this silhouette for three years.

106
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,920
Sometimes, even after school ends,

107
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,120
I still stay behind on purpose.

108
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,040
Wait for her and walk home together.

109
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,640
Just like now, watching her from behind.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,280
But she's already gone.

111
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,120
Even this familiar silhouette

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,800
only appears in my dreams.

113
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,600
Is something on your mind?

114
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
Do you need something?

115
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,880
I want to tell you,

116
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,880
Teacher Jiang is actually a good person.

117
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,560
He likes you too.

118
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,280
He wasn't mad at you in class today.

119
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,320
So it's okay if you don't finish.

120
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,240
Mm.

121
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
Turns out, even in dreams,

122
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,880
you still ignore me.

123
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,640
I wonder, in your world,

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,280
do you ever dream?

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,040
Yu Xingchen, let's go home together.

126
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,360
Hurry up, let's go.

127
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,600
Su Ruo was acting strange today.

128
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
She ignored everyone.

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,160
She wasn't like this before.

130
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,320
Why am I still dreaming?

131
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,960
Since Mom passed away,

132
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,040
I haven't dreamed of her for five years.

133
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,200
Why are you back so late?

134
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,360
Where did you go?

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
You didn't even change your shoes.

136
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,080
I just remembered,

137
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,080
I've never cooked a meal for Mom.

138
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,600
Is it good?

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,040
It's pretty good.

140
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,800
Yu Xingchen.

141
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,120
You're a senior now.

142
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,800
Make sure to work hard, okay?

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
I'll be fine on the college entrance exam.

144
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,160
I got into Physics at East City University.

145
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,920
Why physics?

146
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,280
I mean,

147
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,480
I'll definitely get into East City University.

148
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,720
Mom.

149
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,960
At your age, you should get regular gastroscopies.

150
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,760
Why are you worrying about me now?

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,040
Waiting for you to get into a good college.

152
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,200
Next National Day, our family of three
will go on a trip.

153
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,440
I've heard you say that
so many times before.

154
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,880
Always "next year,"
again and again.

155
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,880
Stop saying "next year."

156
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,400
How about this year instead?

157
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,840
This year's National Day
is already over.

158
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,160
Are you out of your mind?

159
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,080
Even if it wasn't over,

160
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
you still wouldn't take me.

161
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
What did you just say?

162
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,640
This year's National Day
is over.

163
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,840
It's been two days
since it ended.

164
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Isn't today your second day
back at school?

165
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,720
Su Ruo is really pitiful.

166
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,000
I remember her parents
were...

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,360
They passed away
in our senior year.

168
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,800
It was a car accident,
wasn't it?

169
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,840
I think it happened
around National Day.

170
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,440
She kept it from everyone,
never told a soul.

171
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,240
By the time we found out,

172
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,880
several months
had already passed.

173
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,200
Su Ruo rarely ever
takes time off.

174
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,400
But that National Day,
she took several days off.

175
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,040
She had something
holding her up.

176
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,760
Turns out Su Ruo's parents
had an accident.

177
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
It happened
just yesterday.

178
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
Su Ruo must feel
so helpless now.

179
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,680
This seventeen-year-old girl

180
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,680
faces it all
with such stubbornness.

181
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,240
She says nothing
when Teacher Jiang questions her.

182
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,960
Yu Xingchen.

183
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,200
Where are you going
instead of doing homework at night?

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,240
Why does Teacher Jiang
always steal the show in my dreams?

185
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,520
Darn it, will you ever stop?

186
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
Teacher Jiang, I have something to do.

187
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
I'm about to go to your house
to meet your parents.

188
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,920
Come on, take me
to your house.

189
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,600
Teacher Jiang.

190
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,200
Yu Xingchen, try pushing me again.

191
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,760
Stop messing around
with your teacher.

192
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,920
Why does this dream
never end?

193
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,080
What are you mumbling about?

194
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,600
Teacher Jiang.

195
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,680
Let me tell you the truth.

196
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,600
Su Ruo's parents
have passed away.

197
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,640
What?

198
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,840
Su Ruo's parents died
in a car accident.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,200
So I need to go
and take her home now.

200
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,600
Yu Xingchen.

201
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,200
You can't joke
about things like this.

202
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,080
If you're making this up,

203
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
just wait and see
how I deal with you.

204
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,280
Teacher Jiang.

205
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,400
Think about it.

206
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,640
She was late
to class again today.

207
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,000
She didn't finish
her test paper.

208
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,840
Was she ever
this out of character before?

209
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,960
Uh...

210
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,040
When did this happen?

211
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,240
Just yesterday.

212
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,560
Goodbye, Teacher Jiang.

213
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,440
Stop right there.

214
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,640
It's going to rain.

215
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,880
Take this.

216
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,960
Thank you.

217
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,960
Su Ruo.

218
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,360
Let me walk you home.

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,920
No need.

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,440
Can you please
stop following me?

221
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,320
Let me take you home first.

222
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,680
I said no need.

223
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,120
Given your situation now,

224
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,480
you should really
take care of yourself.

225
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,920
You're on your own now.

226
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,480
If you catch a cold,

227
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
who will look after you?

228
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,400
How did you know?

229
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,000
It's not important.

230
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,720
What's important now

231
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,240
is that I get you home first.

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,760
Okay?
