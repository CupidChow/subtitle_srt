1
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,400
Say it.

2
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,200
Why did you come to someone else's home?

3
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,360
Isn't this my dress?

4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,240
Your dress

5
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,760
fell onto my balcony.

6
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,280
I climbed up to return it to you.

7
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,360
You climbed through the window?

8
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,000
That's so dangerous.

9
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,360
It's not dangerous.

10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
You're not lying to me?

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,360
I'm not lying to you.

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,760
I wouldn't lie to someone I like.

13
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
Even if you like someone,

14
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,920
you can't just enter their home.

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,120
Don't scare him.

16
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,600
Thank you for bringing my dress.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,560
Don't do this again next time.

18
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,640
It's too dangerous.

19
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,400
If he's always been like this,

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,040
he won't change even after fifteen years.

21
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,400
Did I get my investigation all wrong before?

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,480
Why do you run away when you see me?

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,520
If you chase me, I'll run.

24
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,320
Even if you like someone again,

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,520
don't climb over walls.

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,680
It's a special time now.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,840
She's in danger.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,280
Someone is bullying her.

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,000
Bullying?

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,320
What do you mean?

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,680
Tell me.

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,640
Who's bullying her?

33
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,560
Tell me.

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,840
Don't pull me, don't pull me.

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,480
Yu Xingchen.

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,880
He fell by himself.

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,960
Yu Xingchen, are you okay?

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,640
Are you okay?

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,080
Why am I here?

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,920
It's getting late.

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,600
My mom is calling me home for dinner.

42
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
I'll head back now.

43
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,200
Investigating again?

44
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,320
I want to check the footage from that day.

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,080
Is that okay?

46
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,320
Hello, Tang Song.

47
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,760
Zhang Chuan was here on the day it happened.

48
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,080
Is there a problem with him?

49
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Zhang Chuan's intellectual disability

50
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,160
is real, not faked.

51
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,520
He's liked Su Ruo since high school.

52
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,240
And he still does to this day.

53
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,200
By the way,

54
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,400
he climbed the balcony fifteen years ago

55
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,360
and entered Su Ruo's home.

56
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,440
Even if he's liked Su Ruo for fifteen years,

57
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,280
so what?

58
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,280
Haven't you liked Su Ruo for fifteen years too?

59
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,200
The clues you mentioned

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,400
we already have them.

61
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,960
If it's not your business, stop investigating.

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,960
Su Ruo.

63
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
I haven't contacted her in a long time.

64
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,920
Why ask about this suddenly?

65
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,840
Tang Song is right.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,480
I've always liked her.

67
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,600
I've never let go.

68
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,800
Yu Xingchen.

69
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,400
Brother.

70
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,080
Nice to meet you.

71
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
I'm Ning Jing.

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,640
Your Meixian Ayi has a daughter

73
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,040
named Ning Jing.

74
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,440
Sorry.

75
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,560
I didn't have time to tidy up.

76
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,840
Come on.

77
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,840
From the looks of it,

78
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,960
you never tidy up, do you?

79
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,880
I kept calling you, but no one answered.

80
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,160
So I thought I'd come check on you.

81
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
I was busy just now.

82
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,640
I saw it was an unknown number,

83
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,200
so I ignored it.

84
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,120
Are you okay?

85
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,600
You look distracted.

86
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,600
I've had something unusual these days.

87
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,920
So I just...

88
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,240
But it's fine.

89
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,720
I like people with personality.

90
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,000
It's just strange to be called "brother" suddenly.

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,440
I'm not used to it.

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,240
You'll get used to it.

93
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,200
Do you support your mom marrying my dad?

94
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,680
Yes.

95
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,080
I wish them well.

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,960
Do you oppose it?

97
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,640
I don't oppose it.

98
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,720
It's their life, after all.

99
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,360
A middle-aged researcher's fridge—

100
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,280
I've never seen one before.

101
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Middle-aged man.

102
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,600
Thank you.

103
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
I just wanted to ask you one thing.

104
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,640
How do you want me to address you?

105
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,440
Call me "brother"

106
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,480
or Yu Xingchen?

107
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,920
That's all you came for?

108
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,080
What do you think?

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,520
Talking about our parents' assets before marriage—

110
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,240
That's really something.

111
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,800
Many people come to my home

112
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,480
and open my fridge without asking.

113
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,440
Maybe they think I look

114
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,760
harmless.

115
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,840
Easygoing, maybe.

116
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,200
So they think

117
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,680
invading my privacy is fine.

118
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,200
But as you can see,

119
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm alone and have achieved nothing.

120
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,000
So,

121
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,600
people opening your fridge without asking

122
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,680
is pretty normal, right?

123
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,240
Just like some people enter your life

124
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,880
without warning.

125
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,040
Brother, at your age,

126
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,320
saying things like that

127
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,320
isn't poetic,

128
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,880
it's pretentious.

129
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,720
Really?

130
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,440
I feel like I'm only eighteen this year.

131
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,680
Young at heart.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,920
Good for you.

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,720
Anyway,

134
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,040
I'm glad to have a sister like you.

135
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,720
I mean it.

136
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,520
Then congratulations

137
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,760
on having a sister like me.

138
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,280
So polite,

139
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,680
even bringing gifts.

140
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,360
What are you thinking?

141
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,720
Your mailbox downstairs wasn't locked.

142
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,640
I saw it and brought your mail up for you.

143
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,280
Just a friendly reminder—

144
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,520
lock your mailbox next time.

145
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,240
Hui Ge.

146
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,960
I just suddenly thought of our school days.

147
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,000
You seem interested in time travel.

148
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,120
You even studied a related field later.

149
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,520
The book I translated was published recently.

150
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,760
So I bought a copy for you.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,520
What is it?

152
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,920
Looks like you have ordinary worries.

153
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,200
How did you know?

154
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
We haven't met in over ten years.

155
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,400
We aren't exactly close.

156
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,720
If you just wanted to thank me,

157
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,000
I could've mailed you the book.

158
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,440
A phone call would suffice.

159
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,000
No need to come all this way.

160
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,480
Go ahead.

161
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,600
My time—

162
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,360
You know it too.

163
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,000
Your time is valuable.

164
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,000
It's about Su Ruo's unexpected death.

165
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,360
We're all old classmates.

166
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,440
I didn't see you at the memorial.

167
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,360
That's not important.

168
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,400
Let's get to the point.

169
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
I heard the rooftop door was locked that day.

170
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
The girl probably locked it herself.

171
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,240
You saw the surveillance too, right?

172
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,560
The night Su Ruo had the accident,

173
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
he stayed in that building all night.

174
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,040
He showed up again last night.

175
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,440
That's quite a coincidence.

176
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,280
Zhang Chuan's intellectual disability

177
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,080
is definitely not an act.

178
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
Yu Xingchen, let go of him.

179
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,160
We all know about his condition.

180
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,480
Based on what you just said,

181
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,000
then Su Ruo's death

182
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,040
probably has little to do with Zhang Chuan.

183
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,000
Why are you so sure?

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,640
Because the rooftop was a locked room.

185
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,520
You said it yourself.

186
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,240
Only the guard has the key.

187
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,280
That's right.

188
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,960
But I've read many novels.

189
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't they all have similar locked room murder tricks?

190
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,240
For example, making a key out of ice.

191
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,480
Pour water into the lock, freeze it into a key.

192
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,800
After locking the door,

193
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,000
the ice melts and the key disappears.

194
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,560
Or sticking tape on the lock.

195
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,240
After closing the door, it can still be pushed open.

196
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,400
But none of these methods work here.

197
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,400
Making ice keys only works up north.

198
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,840
The ice there is hard enough.

199
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
But not here.

200
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,000
And if you use tape,

201
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,320
sure, you can push it from outside.

202
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,040
But you can't lock it to create a locked room.

203
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,720
Even if there's a perfect locked room method,

204
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,280
do you think Zhang Chuan

205
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,720
with his intelligence level

206
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,040
could come up with it?

207
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,400
Don't be so down.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,920
I'm not good at comforting people.

209
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,560
By the way—

210
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,760
I'm thinking of writing a novel lately.

211
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,400
It's about parallel worlds.

212
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,520
Isn't that your field of study?

213
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:24,920
Yes.

214
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,760
Because of the grandfather paradox.

215
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,080
So parallel worlds exist.

216
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,720
Here's the outline of my story.

217
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,440
To be honest,

218
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,200
the plot is pretty cliché.

219
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,040
The tropes are all overused.

220
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,160
The plot isn't important, the key is—

221
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,280
As a novel,

222
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,080
it's too much entertainment.

223
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Not much literary value.

224
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,320
When I was at Tsinghua,

225
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,560
I also audited literature classes.

226
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,960
Writing this kind of novel is pointless.

227
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,640
The point of writing it is

228
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,000
just for my own amusement.

229
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,440
I don't plan to publish it.

230
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,320
Literature is all about the self.

231
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,880
Fitzgerald,

232
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,520
Kafka,

233
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,760
Yukio Mishima,

234
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,360
Eileen Chang—

235
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,920
all are reflections of the self.

236
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,480
If you want to find yourself,

237
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,760
I suggest you read earlier writers.

238
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,960
I just want to build, in my novel,

239
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,720
a time travel system.

240
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
Why does all this happen?

241
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,600
Do you get it?

242
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,360
Then you're the author.

243
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,160
You're in charge.

244
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,640
The author still needs to make sense.

245
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,520
Now, audiences everywhere

246
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,000
love to dig for answers.

247
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,320
Then use what we mentioned before—

248
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,480
the parallel world theory.

249
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,960
Each time you go back in time,

250
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,720
the world you were in before

251
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,480
becomes

252
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,960
a parallel world you've abandoned.

253
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,120
When did I tell you that?

254
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,320
You must've forgotten.

255
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,480
And you enter

256
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,760
a newly created parallel world.

257
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,240
Sometimes you're not like I imagined.

258
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,240
In the new world,

259
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,120
you start from the entry time point

260
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
and begin a new timeline.

261
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,600
So you returned to this time point.

262
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,920
That's how it works, see?

263
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,280
Like my previous two times—

264
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,680
I mean the sections I wrote in my novel.

265
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,800
Both departures were at 9 p.m.

266
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,320
Both started from the rooftop.

267
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,560
Arrival location:

268
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,880
First time, the classroom.

269
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,360
Second time, the school corridor.

270
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,040
Trigger reason unknown.

271
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,480
Look.

272
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
Doesn't this just prove my point?

273
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,200
Everything else is exactly the same.

274
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,400
Even the time and place you depart each time

275
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,120
and the place you return to are always identical.

276
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,200
The time, place, and even the method you use

277
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,120
are all through something like

278
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,080
a space-time rift.

279
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,560
Can I take this as time travel?

280
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,760
Each time you travel,

281
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,880
it's based on your current world,

282
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,480
creating a parallel world.

283
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,240
And the essence of these parallel worlds

284
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,560
is that they're all the same mirror image.

285
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,840
It's like a game save file.

286
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,720
Every time you load your progress,

287
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,520
you're continuing from the old save

288
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,040
and keep playing.

289
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,680
At the same time, you create a new save.

290
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,520
Anyway, what we know is

291
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,520
the time is the same,

292
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,160
the place is the same,

293
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,040
and the method is the same.

294
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
It feels like

295
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
a periodic Temporal Leap Motion.

296
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,360
Can you speak Chinese?

297
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,600
I can't really understand you.

298
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,720
What I say doesn't matter.

299
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,240
What I really want to know is,

300
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,240
next time,

301
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,320
at the same time and place,

302
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,840
can you still use the same method

303
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,880
to go back again?
