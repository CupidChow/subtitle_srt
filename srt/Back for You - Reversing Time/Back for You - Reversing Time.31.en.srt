1
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,640
This time around,

2
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,600
is it up?

3
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,960
But I still have things to say to her.

4
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,760
Hey, are you okay?

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,440
I want to hand in my paper.

6
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,520
You can hand it in now,

7
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,400
but,

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,800
once you do, there's no turning back.

9
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,240
The college you go to will change.

10
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,480
The people you meet

11
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,240
and the jobs you do will all be different.

12
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,520
Everything will be completely different.

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
Are you sure

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,800
you want to take this risk?

15
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,960
If you need the restroom,

16
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,520
someone will escort you.

17
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,720
I want to hand in my paper.

18
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,160
Space-time has a rejection property.

19
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,520
If it detects

20
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,160
something that doesn't belong here,

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,800
it will force you back to your original world.

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,120
If you try to fight this rule,

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,440
your body may suffer irreversible harm.

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,800
I don't care.

25
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,560
Yu Xingchen, why did you hand in your paper?

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,240
You're being so irresponsible.

27
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,120
Whatever it is,

28
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,720
can't you wait until after the exam?

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,600
What's wrong?

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,160
Are you feeling sick?

31
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,120
There's no time.

32
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,280
I'll take you to the nurse's office.

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,280
Director,

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,360
please give this letter

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,920
to Su Ruo from Class Three.

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,040
Can you do that?

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,600
This isn't the time for that.

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,480
Go to the nurse's office first.

39
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,360
Come on, hurry up.

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,720
Director,

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,000
please give this letter to Su Ruo.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,800
Can you do that?

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,520
Hang in there.

44
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,200
Director,

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,320
You've confiscated a lot from us before,

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
but you can't take this letter.

47
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Please give it to her.

48
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,480
Alright, alright.

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,960
After the exam is over,

50
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,200
I'll make sure she gets it.

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,080
Good.

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,680
Su Ruo,

53
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,040
Stay alive.

54
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,520
LOCAL TIME, 5 PM

55
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,000
AS THE FINAL FOREIGN LANGUAGE BELL RINGS

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THE 2010 COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM ENDS SMOOTHLY

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,680
ALL EXAM SITES

58
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,520
COMPLETE THE EXAM ORGANIZATION SMOOTHLY

59
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,560
ACHIEVE THE SAFE EXAM GOAL

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
AT MINGHE CITY FIRST HIGH SCHOOL

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,920
REPORTERS SEE

62
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,160
MANY PARENTS HAVE GATHERED HERE

63
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,480
PARENTS LOOK NERVOUS

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,160
BUT EVEN MORE HOPEFUL

65
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
It's over.

66
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,520
Didn't you have something to tell me?

67
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,040
Ah...

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,240
It's nothing.

69
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,440
Su Ruo,

70
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,760
I didn't do well.

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,280
I want to be alone for a while.

72
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,360
Don't be mad.

73
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm not.

74
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,440
Su Ruo,

75
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,400
You look great in white.

76
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,120
Thanks.

77
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,560
I want a fresh start in college.

78
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,680
So I won't fall for someone

79
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,000
who likes someone else.

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,600
How's my perm? Does it look good?

81
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,280
It does.

82
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Got a perm.

83
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,200
See?

84
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,840
Zhang Jie even got a perm.

85
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,280
Darn it.

86
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,680
Hui Ge,

87
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,920
what are you reading?

88
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,880
Tsinghua's extracurricular materials.

89
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,680
Don't mind me.

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,400
Tsinghua?

91
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,160
How do you know your score?

92
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,720
You can just estimate it.

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,480
It's easy.

94
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,000
Impressive, Hui Ge.

95
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,600
Ren Nan,

96
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,880
where are you going this summer?

97
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,960
Yunhai is pretty nice.

98
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,440
I just got back from there.

99
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,960
Seafood is super cheap.

100
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,760
You already went on a trip?

101
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,960
No, just went to see the sea.

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
Not really a vacation.

103
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,360
As for me,

104
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
I'm planning after the results

105
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,400
to travel abroad.

106
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,800
If you need help,

107
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,720
I know Yunhai's resorts well.

108
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,520
Just mention my name,

109
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,000
and you'll get a discount.

110
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,320
Alright.

111
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,360
Thanks.

112
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,360
That's odd.

113
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,520
I don't remember writing this.

114
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,400
You forgot?

115
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,640
You bought this book for me.

116
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,320
Then Teacher Jiang confiscated it.

117
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,240
Oh, right.

118
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,800
Can you get it back for me?

119
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,320
And return it to me, okay?

120
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,480
I don't remember that at all.

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,080
Just go get it back for me.

122
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,080
And make it my graduation gift.

123
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,320
Please?

124
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,000
Alright.

125
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,480
Su Ruo,

126
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,600
can I ask you something?

127
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,400
People say we're close,

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,240
but I always feel

129
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,400
we're not that close.

130
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,640
Are we friends?

131
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,760
Silly,

132
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,240
of course we're friends.

133
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
Is everyone doing okay?

134
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,640
Good.

135
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,840
Let yourselves go, right?

136
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Anyway, the college entrance exam is over.

137
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,000
Go for it.

138
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,400
Teacher Jiang.

139
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,120
You're dressed in such a bold red.

140
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,560
It's graduation, after all.

141
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,920
Make a wonderful memory.

142
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,920
I promised you all before

143
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,400
that the things I confiscated

144
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
would be returned to you

145
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,600
when you graduate.

146
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,560
Take your own things.

147
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
Slam Dunk.

148
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,320
This is Zhang Xun's, right?

149
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,080
Take it.

150
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,680
Teacher Jiang, it's for you.

151
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,000
Take it.

152
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,280
The Laws of Time Travel.

153
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,720
Besides reading more books,

154
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,360
learn some social skills.

155
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,040
Teacher Jiang, I understand people,

156
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,960
but not the ways of the world.

157
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,240
You did your makeup well today.

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,080
How about

159
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,960
I don't give it back?

160
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,640
I want it.

161
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,640
Norwegian Wood.

162
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,560
Who is this drawing of?

163
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,440
Su Ruo.

164
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,640
Su Ruo.

165
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Who drew it?

166
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,240
Yu Xingchen, I mean you.

167
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,760
You're an adult now.

168
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Why don't you have that old drive anymore?

169
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,760
Teacher Jiang,

170
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,800
I didn't draw it.

171
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,960
I can't draw.

172
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,960
You think I'm senile?

173
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
Yu Xingchen, I personally

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,480
confiscated this from you.

175
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,760
Take it.

176
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,680
Go get it.

177
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,520
Hurry up.

178
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,720
Go on, go get it.

179
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,880
Go.

180
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,080
It's a pretty good drawing.

181
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,000
Maybe you should apply to art school.

182
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,120
I know this past year

183
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,040
felt very long for you all.

184
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,560
But time is relative.

185
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,560
What you think is past

186
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,320
may come back at some point.

187
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,240
What you think is far in the future

188
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,120
is actually right in front of you.

189
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,320
Maybe you don't quite understand

190
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,240
what I'm saying.

191
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,720
I'm saying the future isn't far.

192
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,680
Very soon,

193
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,760
you'll be my age.

194
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,800
So, as your teacher,

195
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,960
I hope on your journey ahead

196
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,920
you always remember

197
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,120
these three years of high school

198
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
and the friendship between classmates.

199
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
In life's big exam,

200
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,400
I hope you all get the results you deserve.

201
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,960
Class dismissed.

202
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,920
Stand up.

203
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,120
Classmates,

204
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
goodbye.

205
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,680
We graduated.

206
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,520
No matter which space-time we're in,

207
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,280
Alright.

208
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,200
Comrades,

209
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,480
See you out there.

210
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,800
Bye.

211
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,000
Bye.

212
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
Bye.

213
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,920
Su Ruo.

214
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,920
Su Ruo.

215
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,120
This is

216
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,920
what Yu Xingchen gave me on the first day of the exam.

217
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,680
He asked me to hand it to you myself.
