1
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,440
It's you.

2
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,040
Don't run.

3
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,600
You get in the car first.

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,040
Okay.

5
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,640
Did you get the message I sent you?

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Why didn't you answer my call?

7
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,520
Didn't I already tell you?

8
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
Su Ruo's death was just an accident.

9
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,400
Stop getting involved for no reason.

10
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,680
If he has nothing to hide,

11
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,640
why would he run?

12
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,280
If it's late at night

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,800
and a stranger comes at you,

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,840
you'd run too.

15
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,240
But you saw the footage, right?

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
The night Su Ruo had her accident,

17
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,720
he stayed in that building

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,800
and didn't come out all night.

19
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,240
He showed up again last night.

20
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,640
That's quite a coincidence.

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,600
It is a coincidence.

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,320
That's why we're investigating.

23
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,760
So, how's it going?

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,360
Did you check last night's footage?

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,440
Is it the same person as the night Su Ruo died?

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,400
It's the same person.

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,320
Did you catch him?

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,720
Do you know where he lives?

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,360
Even if you can't arrest him,

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,920
you could at least keep him under surveillance.

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
Let me tell you again:

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,040
The cause of the accident still needs investigation.

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,160
Alright.

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,560
Then I'll give you another clue.

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,480
I don't know where he lives now,

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,160
but fifteen years ago

37
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,360
he lived in Jianghong Community, Area 3,
Building 3, Unit 2, Room 201.

38
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,320
Where did he live fifteen years ago?

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,480
How do you know that?

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,800
Fifteen years ago, I...

41
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,920
I lived close to Su Ruo.

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,000
I've seen that person before.

43
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,320
You remember things from fifteen years ago so clearly?

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,640
Your classmate is quite interesting.

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,160
The clues you have

46
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,840
match our investigation perfectly.

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,080
That person showing up at the scene might be a coincidence,

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,320
but he lived below Su Ruo fifteen years ago.

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,360
That's definitely true.

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,520
Why would such a coincidence happen?

51
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
He must have some connection to Su Ruo.

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,000
At the very least, they know each other.

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,600
If only I could go back and check again,

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,640
that would be great.

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,520
As a researcher,

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
I know how dangerous this is.

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,520
But

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,000
I want to do something for her.

59
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,120
Give up.

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,960
Ability.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,080
It's really back again.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Banana.

63
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,600
Banana.

64
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
We're cleaning the designated area together today.

65
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,520
The top priority

66
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,120
is to find the person in the footage quickly.

67
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,120
Su Ruo.

68
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,800
I need to leave campus for a bit.

69
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,120
Can you cover for me?

70
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,280
If the teacher asks later,

71
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,040
just say

72
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,160
If the teacher asks,

73
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,960
Say what?

74
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,200
Director.

75
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,760
You look so young, Director.

76
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,000
Let me ask you:

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,880
Do you realize your mistake?

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
What mistake?

79
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,320
Playing dumb.

80
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,360
Teacher, I really don't know what happened before.

81
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,880
Why did you throw trash

82
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,520
in your own designated cleaning area?

83
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,600
Throwing trash in your own cleaning area...

84
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,360
So I've come back to this moment.

85
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,040
Feels like before.

86
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,840
What do you mean, before?

87
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,760
It's right now.

88
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,320
I just saw it five minutes ago.

89
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,080
The leaves you swept up here,

90
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,360
you dumped them right here.

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
How could you do something

92
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,200
so outrageous and crazy?

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,600
Director, I...

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,160
What do you mean, "I"?

95
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't explain to me.

96
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,640
I know your little tricks.

97
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,760
I've been Director for so many years,

98
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,040
I can see through things like this.

99
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
You should focus your mind on studying,

100
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,040
not on all that nonsense.

101
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,640
You're wasting your youth.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,960
Doing this

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,520
is just because your class

104
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,600
has a test early in the morning.

105
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,880
You don't want to take the test,

106
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,000
so you're wasting time here.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,760
Slacking off.

108
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,760
Lazy cleaning.

109
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,840
You really have sharp eyes.

110
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,880
No wonder you'll be the next principal.

111
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,840
What did you say?

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,880
I mean,

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
you have sharp eyes.

114
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,600
And a broad vision.

115
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,760
You'll definitely be the next principal.

116
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
You're too young to talk nonsense.

117
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,320
That's not your concern.

118
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,880
You're in your final year now.

119
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,040
You need to focus on studying in senior year, understand?

120
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,480
Okay, Director.

121
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,080
I'll go back to class after cleaning.

122
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,040
Mm.

123
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,840
Su Ruo.

124
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,680
Su Ruo.

125
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,480
You're a good student.

126
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,000
Don't let

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,320
someone lead you astray.

128
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,040
Director.

129
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,800
I didn't throw trash in the cleaning area.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,160
You didn't throw trash in the cleaning area,

131
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
but you're in the same group as him.

132
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,080
He threw trash everywhere.

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,840
Why didn't you stop him?

134
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,600
I...

135
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,720
Yu Xingchen.

136
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,160
Wait for me in the classroom after cleaning.

137
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,760
Don't go anywhere, got it?

138
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,920
You're looking for me?

139
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,120
Yu Xingchen

140
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,880
Your clothes

141
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,320
Thanks

142
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,240
Where's the shirt I gave you?

143
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
The one you gave me?

144
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,960
Let me check if he brought it.

145
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,560
I'll take a look first.

146
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't you know if you brought it?

147
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,920
I really don't know.

148
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
Looks like you didn't bring it.

149
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,520
What are you whispering about?

150
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,720
Come on

151
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,680
Want some? I'll share half.

152
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,560
No, thanks.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,240
Something's up.

154
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,920
Su Ruo helped Yu Xingchen with laundry!

155
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,120
Big news!

156
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,400
Su Ruo did Yu Xingchen's laundry.

157
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,320
Don't take it to heart.

158
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,000
They'll forget about it soon.

159
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,040
It's fine with me.

160
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,480
It's not a big deal anyway.

161
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,240
What's going on?

162
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,520
My clothes got wet.

163
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,680
Su Ruo, top student, always helps others.

164
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,640
She washed my clothes for me.

165
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,840
Is there a problem?

166
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,800
I think there is.

167
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,520
What's the problem?

168
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,080
You think Su Ruo isn't

169
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,760
a good, helpful, top student?

170
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
What's up with Yu Xingchen?

171
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,240
Did he lose his memory?

172
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,680
Come in

173
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Teacher Jiang

174
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,440
I'd like to take a few days off.

175
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,000
There's something going on at home.

176
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,560
I understand.

177
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,720
Of course you can.

178
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,840
Do you need any help from me?

179
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,400
Teacher Jiang

180
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,480
About my family issue,

181
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,120
Did Yu Xingchen tell you?

182
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,360
Where did Su Ruo go?

183
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,760
Her backpack's gone too.

184
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,760
She probably went home.

185
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,280
She left after the first class.

186
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,720
No way, I have to go too.

187
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,200
Let's go

188
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,760
Come back, sit down.

189
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,000
Sit properly.

190
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,800
I have an announcement.

191
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,560
The National Olympic Chemistry Competition
is about to begin.

192
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,760
Winning means bonus points for college entrance.

193
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,840
Each class gets two spots.

194
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,760
For our class,

195
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,560
besides Xie Haohui,

196
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,640
who else wants to sign up?

197
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,320
If not, I'll pick someone.

198
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
Then

199
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,920
Su Ruo, it is.

200
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,880
Su Ruo's been on leave for days.

201
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,000
She's home alone.

202
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,640
Isn't she close to the person on camera?

203
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,520
Tomorrow afternoon,

204
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,000
there's a special lecture for the competition.

205
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,520
This lecture is very important.

206
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,200
Su Ruo's been absent lately.

207
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,640
Who wants to go

208
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,560
and let her know?

209
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,800
Teacher

210
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,760
I'll go tell Su Ruo.

211
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,080
Why are you going?

212
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,880
I live nearby.

213
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,760
And I run fast.

214
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,400
Of course I'll go.

215
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,160
Teacher, I'll go.

216
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,720
Teacher, let me go.

217
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,520
Aren't you going?

218
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,920
Chance to be alone, you know.

219
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,240
Anyone can go, doesn't matter.

220
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,760
First, make sure she gets the message.

221
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,760
Second,

222
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
don't tell me tomorrow

223
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,520
you didn't do your homework
because you went to find Su Ruo.

224
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,600
So you skipped the assignment.

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
Class rep, hand them out.

226
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
On the night of the incident,

227
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,880
that guy in the hoodie

228
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,200
also showed up at Su Ruo's neighborhood.

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,240
He stayed in that building all night.

230
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,160
And he was there again last night.

231
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,400
Su Ruo

232
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,080
Su Ruo, are you home?

233
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,680
Su Ruo, where are you?

234
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,320
Su Ruo

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,600
Su Ruo

236
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,360
It's me, Zhang Xun. Are you home?

237
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,000
Why are you here?

238
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,120
Just passing by.

239
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Why did you come?

240
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,200
I...

241
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,080
I was warming up running.

242
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,320
Ran and ended up here.

243
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,160
Just so you know,

244
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,760
I'm not lending you my homework today.

245
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,160
She's actually not home.

246
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,480
Where do you think she went?

247
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,920
Maybe she's on a date?

248
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
That's all you ever think about.

249
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,680
Looks like I gave too little homework.

250
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,120
Oh right

251
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,120
Did you hear something happened at Su Ruo's home?

252
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,440
Bro, you already know?

253
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,600
How could I not know?

254
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,280
Honestly, whether you know or not

255
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,760
doesn't really matter.

256
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
True.

257
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,680
Yu Xingchen, why are you here?

258
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,160
Go back, Su Ruo isn't home.

259
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,880
Honestly, it doesn't matter if you're here or not.
