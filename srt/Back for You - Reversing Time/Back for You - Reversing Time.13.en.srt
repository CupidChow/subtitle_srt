1
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,520
We have no idea how she's doing now.

2
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,120
This...

3
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,280
Su Ruo...

4
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,880
Su Ruo.

5
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,360
Where have you been these days?

6
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,000
About your situation...

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,960
I've heard about it.

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,760
I've already scolded your uncle.

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,840
This time, he really was in the wrong.

10
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,280
But no matter what,

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,520
we're still family.

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,400
No need to stay away from home, right?

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
I'll handle my own family matters.

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,960
I promise,

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,280
your uncle from now on

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,680
will never hit you again.

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,760
If he dares touch you,

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,680
tell your aunt.

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,840
I'll stand up for you.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,680
Yes, yes.

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,640
Auntie, I'm not angry anymore.

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,560
We're all family.

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
It's just...

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,120
I don't want to live with uncle anymore.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,320
But we can't just kick your uncle out.

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,720
Su Ruo,

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,680
this house belonged to your grandpa.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,600
When your dad got married,

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,440
he let your dad live here first.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,520
Your dad did pay your uncle some money.

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,800
But you know how house prices are now.

32
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,120
That little money...

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,800
Dad told me,

34
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
this house

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,200
was left by grandpa for dad and uncle.

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,800
I can't make him leave.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,040
So after thinking it over,

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,360
I can only move out myself.

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,400
What you're saying...

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,080
Is it really that serious?

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,760
Has your face healed?

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,680
Let auntie take a look.

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,640
No need to check.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,680
We've already rented a place.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,520
No need for you two to worry.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,120
Since you've decided,

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,080
I won't stop you.

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,280
Come visit often.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,560
Okay.

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,960
Don't just stand there, bring it over.

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,680
Alright.

52
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,320
The fox's tail is finally showing.

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,680
After all that talk,

54
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
her things were packed long ago.

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,680
You wanted her gone, didn't you?

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,320
This is our family matter.

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,920
What's your relationship with Su Ruo?

58
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,640
Why are you making comments here?

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,640
I'm Su Ruo's classmate.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,640
I'm backing her up for her parents.

61
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,360
Is that okay?

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,080
Su Ruo, I've checked everything for you.

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,040
Take a look.

64
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
Some are your clothes,

65
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,200
some are your mom's things.

66
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,560
All packed up.

67
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,440
What do you mean?

68
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,840
Except for these,

69
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,120
she can't take anything else.

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,040
Is that what you mean?

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,520
Su Ruo is still young.

72
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,120
We're just keeping some things for her for now.

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
When she grows up,

74
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,640
we'll give them back to her.

75
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,280
So you split ties before splitting assets?

76
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,800
Auntie,

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,880
this house

78
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,600
should be split one-third for each sibling.

79
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,000
It's more than that, isn't it?

80
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,920
Temporary safekeeping...

81
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,720
How long is "temporary"?

82
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,760
Shouldn't you write a receipt first?

83
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,880
It's a fact you injured Su Ruo, right?

84
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,720
Why don't you check

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,200
the sentence for crime of intentional injury?

86
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,680
Su Ruo,

87
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,200
Don't make a fuss.

88
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,520
We're family, you know.

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Don't talk to me about

90
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,840
family or not family.

91
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,520
Take it to court,

92
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,840
your custody over her

93
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,280
might not even remain.

94
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,000
You...

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,120
-You...   -Forget it.

96
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,920
Forget it, just forget it.

97
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
I've never been this impulsive before.

98
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,400
I kind of regret it.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,720
I should've brought you an umbrella.

100
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,160
I made you get soaked with me.

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
It's fine, like washing my hair.

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
Luckily, uncle didn't really hold it against us.

103
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,040
If you go head-to-head, you'll lose out.

104
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,640
I think they just don't get it.

105
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,120
They're all legally clueless.

106
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,000
You're actually pretty lucky.

107
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,240
Anyway,

108
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,040
last time you committed illegal trespassing.

109
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,720
That's against the law, you know?

110
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
Don't be so impulsive next time.

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,240
Honestly, I don't have to live in that house.

112
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,320
I just refused to move out before.

113
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,080
I just felt that room

114
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,520
still held memories of my parents.

115
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,040
I didn't want to leave.

116
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,920
But now I suddenly feel

117
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't have a home anymore.

118
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,640
Maybe that's okay.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
Being alone isn't so bad.

120
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,040
I'll just be by myself.

121
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,440
Yu Xingchen.

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,320
I can do just fine on my own.

123
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,600
Didn't expect that after so many years,

124
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,280
you're still alone.

125
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,480
Thank you.

126
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Yu Xingchen.

127
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,000
The water heats up fast.

128
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
But it's a bit too hot.

129
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,720
Be careful when you shower.

130
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,760
Shower now?

131
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,720
Of course.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,400
You'll catch a cold if you don't shower after the rain.

133
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,680
I always feel so awkward in front of you.

134
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,240
Are you happy with your new home?

135
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,120
Speaking of the new place,

136
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,200
the things you said to the agent before,

137
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,440
I couldn't understand any of it.

138
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,640
It felt like you thought of so much.

139
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,800
Stuff I never even considered.

140
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,760
If it weren't for you,

141
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,760
I definitely couldn't have managed alone.

142
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,680
Looks like I really need to see you differently.

143
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,600
See me differently?

144
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,080
So how did you see me before?

145
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,360
If you feel uncomfortable living here,

146
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,360
you're always welcome to stay at my place.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
But...

148
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,560
If you ever come to my place

149
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,920
and find me acting weird,

150
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,240
don't take it to heart.

151
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,480
What do you mean?

152
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,760
I mean,

153
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,360
even if I'm not around,

154
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,920
you still have to believe in yourself.

155
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,400
Everything will get better.

156
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
It's just encouragement.

157
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,720
So where are you going?

158
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,240
I'm heading back.

159
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,040
I'm Su Ruo's classmate.

160
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,760
I'm backing her up for her parents.

161
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,640
Is that okay?

162
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,640
You're alone now.

163
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,480
If you catch a cold,

164
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,640
who'll take care of you?

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,080
I saw Yu Xingchen come here with you.

166
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,240
Then I saw him leave alone.

167
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,520
So I guessed maybe you live here.

168
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm not stalking you, really.

169
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,040
My place is nearby.

170
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,880
Just the next building.

171
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,040
Let's go to and from school together.

172
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,800
The first time I went back was after ten p.m.

173
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,520
The second time was after school.

174
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,920
Around six or seven in the evening.

175
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,080
This sync just won't end.

176
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,120
The quantum state of the universe is so weak.

177
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,000
The further from the original world, the more chaotic.

178
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,000
Uncle, hoodie guy,

179
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
neighborhood security guard...

180
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,200
Darn it, it's been fifteen days.

181
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
I still haven't gone back.

182
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,360
Am I really stuck here?

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,880
Congrats!

184
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,160
You've improved again.

185
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,920
I want to go home.

186
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,440
I want to go back.

187
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,800
Are you skipping class?

188
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,560
I mean going home,

189
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,840
not skipping class.

190
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,600
Why do I feel

191
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,360
you don't care about the college entrance exam?

192
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,720
Didn't you say Su Ruo lives near you?

193
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,800
Why didn't you two come together?

194
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,640
Is she still living at Yu Xingchen's place?

195
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,440
How is it? Are you used to living there?

196
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,080
It's good. How about you?

197
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,520
I'm good too.

198
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,480
Your food looks delicious.

199
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,160
Then let's swap.

200
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
I'll just have a taste.

201
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,080
I know.

202
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,840
At your age,

203
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,320
developing feelings beyond friendship

204
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,040
is totally normal.

205
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,280
It's youth. I was young once too.

206
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,280
I understand.

207
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,560
But you must remember,

208
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,160
you're in your final year.

209
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,840
You're facing a crucial time in life.

210
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,880
You don't think we're dating early, do you?

211
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,560
Since you admit it,

212
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,680
I won't beat around the bush.

213
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,520
Teacher, we're not.

214
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Did you hear rumors in class?

215
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,280
I believe you aren't.

216
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,160
You've always been

217
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,880
a student I can trust.

218
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,880
But...

219
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,400
So you're blaming me?

220
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,760
It's a critical time in senior year.

221
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
After the college entrance exam,

222
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,360
honestly, I won't nag so much.

223
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,000
Teacher Jiang,

224
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,080
I just have one question for you.

225
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,160
What do you think Su Ruo likes about me?

226
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,080
Is it that I skip class all the time,

227
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,960
or that I always fail English,

228
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,880
or that I hand in blank math tests?

229
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,880
What right do I have to date someone

230
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,640
as smart and kind as Su Ruo?

231
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
If you put it that way,

232
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,600
I really can't argue with you.
