1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,720
In the world where I come from,

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,400
you are already gone.

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,480
That's why I came to find you.

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,960
So, at that time,

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
you would tell me

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,000
you're on your own now.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,160
If you catch a cold,

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,760
who will take care of you?

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,040
How did you know?

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,320
So sometimes,

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,640
I feel like I'm not myself.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,400
I told you I have another personality,

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,240
but actually,

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,880
Yu Xingchen

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,560
was lying to you.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,920
He fell down on his own.

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,280
How did I end up here?

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,440
So,

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,280
you sometimes get like that.

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,440
You know so much.

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,680
You don't seem like a high schooler.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,720
I'm much older now.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,960
I've had more takeout than you've had meals.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,880
So,

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,080
that's why you're different from the old Yu Xingchen.

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,280
Su Ruo

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,920
I hope I can change your fate.

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,240
I won't let you stay with this person.

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,040
I'll take you away.

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
That's why you showed up here.

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,840
I want you to live happily.

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
That's why you came to me.

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,520
I want you to see the people around you clearly.

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
Someday, a boy will really like you.

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,120
He'll treat you well.

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
Will you

37
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,240
accept him?

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,120
That's why you said those things to me.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,400
I don't know if I can make myself clear.

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,880
Everything I've done

41
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,160
was to help you survive.

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,400
Please remember one place.

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,880
It's called Jianshe Community.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
Fifteen years from now,

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,480
you must never rent a place there.

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,560
Actually, these words

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,600
should've been said the first time I came.

48
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,960
I should've told you then.

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,960
But I wasn't sure.

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
I was afraid you wouldn't trust me then.

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,960
Actually,

52
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,760
even this time,

53
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,400
I still don't know

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,320
if you'll believe me.

55
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,360
You made it very clear.

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,080
But how am I supposed to believe you?

57
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,400
If you still don't believe me,

58
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
I can tell you something

59
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,240
that's about to happen.

60
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,600
Hey, class leader.

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Six hundred eighteen points.

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,600
Congratulations, then.

63
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,480
I want to ask you one more thing.

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,960
Where did you apply for college?

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,000
The class leader scored 618 on the exam.

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,080
She went to Jiangcheng Social University, finance major.

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Now,

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,720
I'm leaving.

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,120
If nothing goes wrong,

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,440
I won't be able to come back.

71
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,400
Luckily, before I go,

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,600
I can give you your exam admission ticket.

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,520
Teacher Jiang always says

74
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,240
the college entrance exam changes your fate.

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,080
It's true.

76
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,520
I believe you'll get into the best university.

77
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,400
The only thing I didn't expect

78
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
is that after fifteen whole years,

79
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,440
I still fell for you.

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,720
Even though I didn't hear your reply myself,

81
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,640
but this time,

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,880
please let me be a little selfish.

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,040
Su Ruo

84
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,160
Fifteen years from now,

85
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,520
let's meet again.

86
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,600
I already answered you.

87
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,000
I already answered you.

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,360
I told you I like you.

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,040
Why are you crying?

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
Yu Xingchen

91
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,160
Why did you come here?

92
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm reporting to the exam retake class tomorrow.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,960
I came to ask the teacher about it today.

94
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,040
I just happened to pass by.

95
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,480
I heard about it.

96
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,160
You didn't do well on the Chinese exam.

97
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,280
It's all my fault.

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,880
How could it be your fault?

99
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,680
Good luck.

100
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,560
You'll definitely get into a good university.

101
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,320
Su Ruo

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
I have something to tell you.

103
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,120
But you seemed so sad just now,

104
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,080
I thought it wasn't the right time.

105
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,640
I...

106
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,000
It's okay.

107
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,800
As long as it's from you,

108
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
anything is fine.

109
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,040
Yu Xingchen,

110
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,920
are you trying to say

111
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,440
you like me?

112
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,240
I got it.

113
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,760
I'll wait for you.

114
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,640
Wait...

115
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,760
I...

116
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,840
Please,

117
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,800
wait for me too.

118
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,120
Gone.

119
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,400
Finally, everything is gone.

120
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,440
Everything about me has changed.

121
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,360
I didn't get into Dongda's physics major.

122
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,840
The me here

123
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,800
is just like so many other workers,

124
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,280
living an ordinary, fulfilling life.

125
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,640
The world didn't change because of my recklessness.

126
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,800
Nothing was altered.

127
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,880
People hurry back and forth.

128
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,880
Young people stare down at their phones.

129
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,600
World War II hero veterans pass away.

130
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,240
Celebrities clarify they haven't cheated.

131
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,400
TOMORROW'S STAR finals spark scandal debate.

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,400
Nothing has changed.

133
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,120
And yet, none of it seems to concern me.

134
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,360
Old Yu

135
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Long time no see.

136
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,560
It's been two years, hasn't it?

137
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,560
Fifteen years have reshaped everything.

138
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,880
It's become a little unfamiliar to me

139
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,640
yet still feels like a familiar world.

140
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,160
Hello, let me introduce myself.

141
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,960
-Introduce yourself  -Everyone is working hard
to change.

142
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,080
Everyone is striving to grow.

143
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,120
Except

144
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,320
I feel like I've been left behind.

145
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
Yu Xingchen here

146
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,040
wasted a year in the exam retake class.

147
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Lost old college friends

148
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,840
and also lost

149
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,000
a cherished school and job.

150
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,160
I've been feeling down lately.

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,320
Our company had layoffs too.

152
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,000
It's so frustrating.

153
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,040
Taking care of family is tough too.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,080
And

155
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,520
now there are two of us.

156
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,520
Here,

157
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,320
there really isn't anyone named Su Ruo.

158
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,920
I think

159
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,200
I haven't let anyone down.

160
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,600
You've grown up.

161
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,720
Look at you, look at you.

162
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,400
You were right to trust me.

163
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,360
Good thing we found out early.

164
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,560
You're getting more capable.

165
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,080
You,

166
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,400
now you're teaching me.

167
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,480
You, you.

168
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,400
What would you do without me?

169
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Today, I'm so happy.

170
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,320
Let's go home.

171
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,240
Okay.

172
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,840
I've asked myself many times

173
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,360
if giving up everything

174
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
over and over again

175
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,640
Loading progress

176
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,040
doing this

177
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,440
is it really worth it?

178
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,080
I don't know.

179
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,160
Have you

180
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,560
visited Lao Jiang lately?

181
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,040
He

182
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,160
Is he doing well?

183
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,240
Cancer.

184
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,240
Luckily, it was found in time.

185
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,560
He had a minor surgery.

186
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,920
Now

187
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
he's fine.

188
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,800
Really?

189
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,560
That's great.

190
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,640
All these years,

191
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,320
you haven't kept in touch with classmates?

192
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,960
I've lost contact with many people.

193
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
That's a strange thing to say.

194
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,840
Aren't you the one not keeping in touch?

195
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,080
That's true.

196
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,720
But I understand.

197
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,280
You were in the exam retake class that year.

198
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,400
You were a year behind us.

199
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,240
When we started college, you were retaking exams.

200
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,960
We graduated and started working,

201
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,840
but you were still studying.

202
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,280
Actually,

203
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,200
Lao Jiang always felt sorry for you.

204
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,600
He said back then

205
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,920
you just messed up on the Chinese exam.

206
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,280
Well,

207
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,240
who hasn't made mistakes?

208
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,200
Are you still in touch with Su Ruo?

209
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,360
Her?

210
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,800
She's even more extreme.

211
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,240
She hasn't contacted us for fifteen years.

212
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,400
She went abroad alone.

213
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
Many say she's cold-hearted.

214
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,880
In my view,

215
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,240
maybe she's

216
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,840
avoiding something.

217
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,880
Or waiting for something.

218
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,560
Maybe

219
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,600
I'm waiting for someone too.

220
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,880
Come on, let's have a drink.

221
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,720
Sounds good.

222
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
Come on, cheers.

223
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Okay.

224
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,400
Impressive.

225
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,200
Sounds nice.

226
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,880
Hey superstar, sing one too.

227
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,640
Sing one, sing one, sing one.

228
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,480
If I sing,

229
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,240
none of you will want to sing.

230
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,320
There you go bragging again.

231
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,760
Come on.

232
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,840
Look at him.

233
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,160
Showing off.

234
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,960
Chen,

235
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,240
Oh wow.

236
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,400
A rare guest!

237
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,400
Stop looking.

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,240
She's still abroad.

239
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,560
Haven't heard she's back.

240
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,240
Come, come, come.

241
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,920
Sit, sit, sit.

242
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,360
Sit.

243
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,480
Come, come, come.

244
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,280
Come, come, come.

245
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,640
Sit, sit, sit.

246
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,080
Come.

247
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,920
Come.

248
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Let's get hyped!

249
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,120
I'll sing a song with Chen.

250
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,160
Go ahead and sing.

251
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,240
Okay.

252
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
Sing.

253
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,720
Sing!

254
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,480
This old shop

255
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
has finally opened.
