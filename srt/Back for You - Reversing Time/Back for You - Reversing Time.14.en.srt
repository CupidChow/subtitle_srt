1
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,440
Yu Xingchen

2
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,640
I think what you just said isn't right.

3
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,240
Isn't it?

4
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
We really didn't date early.

5
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
No,

6
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,200
I mean,

7
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,640
Yu Xingchen,

8
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,280
you're much better than you think.

9
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,400
Yu Xingchen,

10
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,600
I think

11
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,480
what you said just now makes sense too.

12
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,600
If this keeps up,

13
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,240
it really won't work.

14
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,280
Yu Xingchen,

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
you scored in the single digits,

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,320
taking my spot.

17
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,840
The old me wouldn't have let that happen.

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,040
But now I've really forgotten everything.

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
How about I help you review systematically?

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,840
Will that even help now?

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,000
You have to believe in yourself.

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,520
If you can't go back for a while,

23
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,840
staying here, you won't get into college.

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
That would change my whole future.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
If that's the case,

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,680
that would be terrible.

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Thank you, teacher.

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,240
Please.

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
Su Ruo, let's go back together.

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,760
No,

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,920
I need to help someone study.

32
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,400
Okay.

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,560
Yu Xingchen,

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,560
let's go play basketball.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm studying now.

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,240
Maybe another day.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,160
Everything's ready.

38
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,040
Now we just need a tutor.

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,600
Forgot to buy drinks.

40
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,400
Yu Xingchen,

41
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,080
Yu Xingchen,

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,120
You finally came.

43
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,280
I've waited for you for an hour.

44
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
Su Ruo,

45
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,640
why are you still here?

46
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,280
Strange, why did I come here?

47
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,400
If you feel too tired,

48
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,960
we can skip studying today.

49
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,240
What studying?

50
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

51
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,640
It's like a voice keeps telling me

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,440
to go back and check the classroom.

53
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,920
But why should I go back there?

54
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,480
I'm a little dizzy.

55
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
Maybe I'm sick.

56
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,960
Sorry, my head feels fuzzy.

57
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,440
If you ever come to my place

58
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,640
and find me acting strange,

59
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,640
please don't take it to heart.

60
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,240
What do you mean?

61
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,320
I mean,

62
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,160
even if I'm gone,

63
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,600
you still have to believe in yourself.

64
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,240
Everything will get better.

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,320
So where are you going?

66
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,880
I'm heading back.

67
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,760
What has this place become?

68
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,920
If her death is related to Uncle,

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,720
I've already changed what happened fifteen years ago.

70
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
She moved out.

71
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,800
She didn't keep living with Uncle.

72
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,880
So fifteen years later,

73
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,480
she shouldn't have any accident, right?

74
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,360
Hello, the number you dialed is powered off.

75
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,080
For example,

76
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
if you kill the suspect,

77
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,520
lock him up,

78
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,360
or cripple his hands and feet,

79
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,800
then he probably won't hurt the victim in the future.

80
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,560
But if you don't do that,

81
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,880
from a timeline correction and convergence view,

82
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
many years later,

83
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,560
he'll still hurt the victim if that's meant to happen.

84
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
No,

85
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,920
I need to tell Tang Song

86
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,840
about Uncle being a suspect.

87
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,120
Why do I feel like between us,

88
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,880
you're the cop

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,360
and I'm the guilty one?

90
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,120
Have you investigated Su Ruo's uncle?

91
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,240
He was the security guard that day.

92
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,800
Fifteen years ago, he beat Su Ruo after drinking.

93
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,400
And the abuser still had a key.

94
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,880
Shouldn't that be investigated?

95
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,720
Why aren't you saying anything?

96
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,760
Or is it

97
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,200
you've already looked into it?

98
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,360
This is my last reminder to you.

99
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,640
This is police business.

100
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,600
You open the door and come in.

101
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,440
This is an old-style lock.

102
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,720
It's locked from the inside.

103
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,720
If you're outside,

104
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,640
even with a key, you can't open it.

105
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,120
So many years have passed,

106
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
and you still care about Ruoruo.

107
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,200
I've been here for years.

108
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,400
Actually, the first day Ruoruo moved in,

109
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,560
I already knew.

110
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,200
But because of what happened back then,

111
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,240
I've never had the face to acknowledge her.

112
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,880
I avoided her whenever something happened.

113
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,360
I drank some that day.

114
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
I can't remember much.

115
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,840
Besides, the police already ruled

116
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,760
it was an accident.

117
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,400
You really don't remember anything from that night?

118
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,720
Drinking causes trouble.

119
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
I let Ruoruo down.

120
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,800
So that means,

121
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,840
if Su Ruo locked the rooftop door from inside,

122
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,240
people in the hallway,

123
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,760
even with a key, can't open it.

124
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,040
And if Su Ruo was really murdered,

125
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,880
the killer couldn't have locked it from inside

126
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,520
after committing the crime.

127
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,640
So what do you think caused it?

128
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,200
I've read some crime books lately

129
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,280
and summed things up.

130
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
Can't just say it was suicide.

131
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Maybe it was an accident.

132
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,920
Anyway,

133
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,480
Su Ruo probably wasn't murdered.

134
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,000
This leg of mine

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,040
can't take much more.

136
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,800
Feels like it'll break after two shots.

137
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,360
If at this moment

138
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
It'd be great if someone could massage my legs.

139
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,360
Are you deep down

140
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,840
already sure there isn't a killer?

141
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,240
I just don't want to accept it.

142
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,000
I know.

143
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,280
You're really upset about Su Ruo's death.

144
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,000
But there's nothing you can do.

145
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,880
If there really was a killer,

146
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,600
and you could bring them to justice,

147
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,160
would you feel a bit better?

148
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,720
Yu Xingchen,

149
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,800
your mindset right now is just like

150
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,360
those unreasonable people who blame doctors.

151
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,200
Their family dies,

152
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,880
they're heartbroken,

153
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,520
so they have to blame the doctor.

154
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,880
You know the doctor is innocent.

155
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,320
But you just want someone to hate.

156
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
What you said

157
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,360
actually makes sense.

158
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,360
Let me tell you a secret.

159
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,560
Back then, I didn't fall while running because someone kicked me.

160
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
No one kicked you?

161
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,720
Right.

162
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,600
My Achilles tendon ruptured near the finish line.

163
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,640
The feeling of it snapping

164
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,520
was just like being kicked.

165
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,160
I just heard a snap and fell to the ground.

166
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,360
So who should I blame?

167
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,560
Blame my parents?

168
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,600
Blame them for not getting me surgery in time?

169
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,440
I was always skipping class back then.

170
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,200
If I said my leg was broken,

171
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,280
even I wouldn't believe it.

172
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
How could they?

173
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,280
Blame this leg?

174
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
It's already broken.

175
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,480
Blaming doesn't help.

176
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Be careful. I'll walk you home.

177
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,200
It's fine.

178
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
I don't live far.

179
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,400
I'll go by myself.

180
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,400
Yu Xingchen, I know what you're thinking.

181
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,280
If Su Ruo really did take her own life,

182
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,320
there's nothing you can do.

183
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,240
You don't know what to do either.

184
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,600
Me too. I have nowhere to vent my anger.

185
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,560
You're awake.

186
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,160
Why is it you?

187
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,800
Did you clean the whole place?

188
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,600
Did you think it was the house fairy?

189
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,960
How did you have time to come over?

190
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
Aren't you supposed to be

191
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,320
busy with my dad and your mom's wedding?

192
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
When was the wedding?

193
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,480
Yesterday.

194
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,240
Sorry.

195
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,280
I forgot.

196
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,960
I wasn't in a good mood yesterday.

197
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,400
And I didn't save your number.

198
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,000
Is my dad and Meixian Ayi mad at me?

199
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,320
About this,

200
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,800
I'll definitely apologize in person another day.

201
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,920
I really did forget.

202
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,960
What do you mean, apologize in person?

203
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,520
It's your own home.

204
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,640
Bro,

205
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,400
you don't have anything else today, right?
