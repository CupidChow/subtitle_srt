1
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,280
Mr. Do Min Ik?

2
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,049
Who are you?

3
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,020
Nice to meet you.
I'm Veronica Park.

4
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,000
You are Veronica Park?

5
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:05,340
Awesome.

6
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,109
So our first encounter takes place
in a place like this.

7
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:11,640
What do you mean by, "first"?

8
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,810
So you're saying...

9
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,579
you're Veronica Park...

10
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,450
and this is our first time
meeting each other?

11
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:21,989
Who are you?

12
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,890
Who are you to impersonate
Veronica Park?

13
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,489
Impersonate?

14
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,260
Hey!

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,400
I'm the only daughter of
the great Park Group,

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,769
and the president of Cinepark,
Vero...

17
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,170
You stay here.

18
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,239
Stay?

19
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,540
Hey!

20
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,040
You brat!

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,609
- Mister!
- I'm sorry!

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,209
I think my hair is stuck in there!

23
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:48,450
Yes, Boss.

24
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,349
There's something
I need to report to you.

25
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,370
Hey, are you crazy?

26
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,330
You saw him?

27
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,199
Yes, he shaved his beard
and had a different hairstyle.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
But it was definitely him.

29
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,840
Okay.

30
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,110
9:10pm at the Sangmo Hospital
Intersection.

31
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,069
Call the control center and ask them
for the CCTV footage.

32
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,449
Oh, right.

33
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,349
That woman.

34
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,599
- Director Do.
- What?

35
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:18,840
It's me, Secretary Jeong.

36
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,009
Where were you?

37
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,610
Let's talk about that later.

38
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,979
Did you happen to see a really
loud woman who was standing here?

39
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,150
- Who?
- I met this woman earlier,

40
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,849
and do you know
what she said to me?

41
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,550
Nice to meet you.
I'm Veronica Park.

42
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,860
I know we're living in a world
that's full of scams,

43
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,360
but how could she be so brazen?

44
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,500
She apparently met me
for the first time.

45
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,659
We met so many times,

46
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,830
and we even kissed...

47
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,870
Anyway,

48
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,939
she was wearing a weird hat
that looked like a curtain.

49
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,509
So look for her inside.
I'll look for her outside.

50
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,180
No, wait.

51
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,110
She's probably gone.

52
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,849
She got caught by you,

53
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,020
so there's no way
she'd still be here.

54
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,090
Then I should at least tell her.

55
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,449
Tell whom?

56
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,689
Who do you think?
The real Veronica Park.

57
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,189
Director Do, I really don't think
that's necessary...

58
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,759
Director Do, I need to go
to the bathroom.

59
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,439
The double life of Veronica.

60
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,170
Who are you?

61
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:30,779
Who are you to impersonate
Veronica Park?

62
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,480
I guess someone's going around
impersonating me.

63
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,160
How dare that person
make me, the real Veronica Park,

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,790
look like a fake?

65
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,990
Wait until I catch that person.

66
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:51,730
I will rip that person apart
and grind her into little pieces...

67
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,829
and make baby food out of her.

68
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,500
Veronica Park, speaking.

69
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,240
Awesome.

70
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,009
Are you saying someone's
impersonating me?

71
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,910
Wait until I catch that person.

72
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:08,610
I will rip that person apart
and grind her into little pieces...

73
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,209
and make baby food out of her.

74
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:15,350
Awesome.

75
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,089
(Boss)

76
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,490
Hello? Hello?

77
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,790
President Park? President...

78
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,399
Maybe I shouldn't have called her
to tell her about this.

79
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,810
Why isn't Secretary Jeong
coming back?

80
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,250
What kind of an interesting
storyline is this?

81
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,060
The person who was brazen enough
to impersonate me...

82
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,430
was you? Jeong Gal Hee?

83
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,500
I'm sorry, President Park.

84
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,800
I really...

85
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,199
don't know what to say.

86
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,540
I get how you could've faked
your voice to sound like me...

88
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,310
since you had to deal
with the guys I dated...

89
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,209
for many years
while you worked for me.

90
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,680
But what about my face?

91
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,149
My photos are everywhere on the web
if you search my name.

92
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,120
So what kind of magic spell
did you use...

93
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,620
to make him think
that I have that face?

94
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,689
Well, the thing is...

95
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,100
Well, let me explain.

96
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,500
Secretary Jeong.

97
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,899
Are you inside?

98
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,769
Secretary... Secretary Jeong.

99
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,550
If you can't give me an answer,

100
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,519
I'll just have to ask him myself.

101
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,949
President... President Park.

102
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:58,860
Excuse me.

103
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,689
I'm sorry for asking you this
when we just met but...

104
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:02,860
Did you say we just met?

105
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,060
Director Do.

106
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,730
What took you so long?

107
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:11,670
I couldn't find my mom
because you were gone.

108
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Over there.

109
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,339
She's 10m away,
and she's walking this way.

110
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,610
She's wearing a black suit
and holding a blue bag.

111
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,410
Okay.

112
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:26,720
Mom.

113
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,250
What took you so long?

114
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,759
I'm sorry. I suddenly
ran into someone.

115
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,930
I pretty much
get the gist of it now.

116
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:40,800
Does your boss have a problem...

117
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,899
seeing people's faces?

118
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,250
It was a joke at first.

119
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,850
Nice to meet you.
I'm Veronica Park.

120
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,420
I was just a minion at work.

121
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,920
But once I changed my identity...

122
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:08,490
to the heiress of Park Group,

123
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,199
I got treated very differently.

124
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,240
But once out of curiosity...

125
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,870
and twice by accident...

126
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,149
As I kept going on dating
with Director Do,

127
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,419
I ended up falling for him.

128
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,019
And as I constantly saw...

129
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,759
how much he liked me
while he mistook me for you,

130
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,799
it made me want to keep
seeing him like that...

131
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,769
even though I knew it was wrong.

132
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,539
The puzzles are finally
coming together.

133
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,480
So I guess that's why...

134
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:04,220
Chief Director Sim thinks
Director Do likes me.

135
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,080
And that's probably why
she said that...

136
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,049
to my mother.

137
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,190
I've also exaggerated
and scammed people...

138
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,230
to promote the movies I screen
in my movie theaters.

139
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,799
But this is on a totally
different level.

140
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,830
I'm almost starting to respect you.

141
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,100
I'm sorry, President Park.

142
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,110
I'm so sorry...

143
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,509
that I even feel bad
about apologizing.

144
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,720
I'll tell Director Do everything
tomorrow...

145
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,350
and gladly get punished
for what I did.

146
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,549
You can get punished...

147
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,090
tomorrow.

148
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,730
You know...

149
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,929
that I make the best use...

150
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:53,460
of people's weaknesses
to my greatest advantage, right?

151
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,070
I'll think about it all night...

152
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,740
and come up with
just the right punishment for you.

153
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,370
So meet me at my office
tomorrow morning.

154
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:05,009
Right now,

155
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:08,580
there's something very urgent
I need to take care of.

156
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,100
I guess your daughter didn't come.

157
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,570
She would never come
to a place like this.

158
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,240
Chief Director Sim.

159
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,610
Oh, hello. Just a second.

160
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,070
Director Kim.

161
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,279
Thank you so much
for dating my daughter.

162
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,950
I guess your daughter hasn't
told you anything yet.

163
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,289
Our relationship is a little...

164
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,730
What's wrong?

165
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,700
Is she seeing someone else again?

166
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,899
Did you know?

167
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:03,230
That darn brat.

168
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,100
I will sew that brat's eyelids...

169
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,470
and make sure she never sees
another guy again.

170
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:10,639
Please don't do that.

171
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,480
I'm having a hard time,

172
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:15,149
but I'm trying my best
to get over her.

173
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,250
Does that mean...

174
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:21,220
you still like her?

175
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,889
I liked her a lot.

176
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,629
My goodness, my son-in-law.

177
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,360
Ma'am, wait.

178
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,600
According to many years
of my experience with her,

179
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,070
whenever she falls head over heels
for a guy, it only lasts a week.

180
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,740
And when she says her love will last
a lifetime, it only lasts a month.

181
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:41,070
I will do whatever it takes
to make that brat...

182
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,940
walk down the aisle with you.

183
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:50,679
So please do not give up
on that brat.

184
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,820
Chairwoman Park...

185
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,820
Gosh, what's going on?

186
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,230
About the exclusive run of Cinepark.

187
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,629
I'll tell my daughter to sign
the contract by this week.

188
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,230
Are you serious?

189
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,740
She's finally making
Min Ik the president.

190
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,409
Isn't that right, Min Ik?

191
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:43,299
Thank you for working
until late night as always.

192
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,139
I'm going home in my mom's car.
You should go home too.

193
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,769
(Secretary Jeong)

194
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,509
I can't do anything without you.

195
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,649
I'm sorry about that.

196
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,679
And...

197
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,789
thanks for always being there...

198
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,490
(Thanks for always
being there for me.)

199
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:14,330
(Secretary Jeong)

200
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,559
Well... Secretary Jeong.
What's wrong?

201
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,659
Because I'm so sorry.

202
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,029
I feel really bad.

203
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:57,240
Gosh, I feel so sorry too.

204
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,049
I'm really sorry.

205
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,279
I didn't know Gal Hee was
such a great actress.

206
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,450
She even weeps crocodile tears...

207
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,350
to make her boss the president.

208
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,629
I'd like to ask something to the
living witness of TnT Mobile,

209
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:16,259
Ms. Lee, who worked for everyone
from Chairman Do Wan Bae...

210
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,929
to Director Gi Dae Ju.

211
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,929
Who do you think will be
the next president?

212
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,340
I told you not to gossip.

213
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,370
If you're done, just leave.

214
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Okay.

215
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,679
I'm so sorry, Mother.

216
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,889
(Funeral Hall)

217
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,789
Hey, Dae Ju.

218
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,190
Did you not see me
sitting right here?

219
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,799
I've been sitting here the whole
time, but you never talked to me.

220
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,299
How could you be so remote?

221
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,509
And how could you be so dull?

222
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,039
Director Park's mother is
a complete stranger to me.

223
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,179
Why do you think I stayed here
until three in the morning?

224
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,279
Are you saying...

225
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,720
you've been sitting here...

226
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:52,759
just to see my face?

227
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,889
Unfortunately, you were
sitting back to back with me,

228
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:59,159
so technically, I got to see you
just now.

229
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,470
You're really strange.

230
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,399
If you wanted to see me that bad,

231
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,179
you could've hung out
with me at least once.

232
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,110
I guess you're still not interested
in a serious relationship with me.

233
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:19,779
All right, then.

234
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,559
Dae Ju.

235
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,769
Dae Ju?

236
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,399
Dae Ju.

237
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,440
Are you upset?

238
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,610
Do you think I just like
having flings with guys?

239
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,990
What kind of people
do you think approach me?

240
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,019
They just want to start
a business with my money...

241
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,730
and build personal connections
using my name.

242
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:06,460
Actually, you're one of them too.

243
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:11,269
They're happy when I spend money
or arrange a meeting.

244
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,670
And once they're done
sponging off of me,

245
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,710
I lose contact with them.

246
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,609
Do you know what I realized after
it happened to me like 12 times?

247
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,250
I have no chance of being in love.

248
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,819
I should just have some fun
with any guy I find interesting.

249
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,759
It'd hurt less...

250
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,829
if I don't let anyone
break my heart.

251
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:59,819
If you can't trust me,
you don't have to.

252
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,450
But you should love someone.

253
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,819
It doesn't have to be me though.

254
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:11,660
I lived with no money before,
but I could manage to live somehow.

255
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,569
And I've lived without parents.

256
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:17,730
It was hard,
but I could handle it anyway.

257
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,839
But without love...

258
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,640
No one can live without love.

259
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,680
Dae Ju.

260
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,819
Then why don't we try this?

261
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,690
It's not a fling
nor a serious relationship.

262
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:48,500
We can try something between those
two and go date for a month.

263
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,269
I need some time to find out
if I can trust you.

264
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,240
Can we give it a try?

265
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:02,849
I see.

266
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:07,650
That's not going to work
for you, Mr. Chastity.

267
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,500
Does this mean you're in?

268
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,500
To be honest,

269
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,130
I'm not sure about this.

270
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,799
I only offer all of my heart
or none of it.

271
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,710
I've never done something
between those two.

272
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,180
But...

273
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,609
I'll give it a try.

274
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,980
If that's the only way
to be with you.

275
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,589
Mom, I don't know
what you're doing here this time,

276
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,730
but you should at least give me
some time to get my guard up.

277
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,960
Didn't I tell you to keep
a low profile and get married?

278
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,069
Hopes for world peace is
all over the world these days.

279
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:35,609
But you still believe violence
is the only definite solution.

280
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,839
I'm so sick of it now.

281
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,950
Premature menopause and late
childbearing is an issue these days.

282
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,450
But you still flirt with...

283
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,980
any guy you see.

284
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,650
That just makes my hands and feet
tremble with rage.

285
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,819
How could you tell
a guy who's just like Gandhi...

286
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:53,759
that you have feelings
for someone else?

287
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,289
I swear it wasn't me who said that.

288
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,559
All right. Then I guess...

289
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,970
someone else told him that
impersonating you.

290
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,339
Jeong Gal Hee, that darn wench.

291
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:10,039
Once you get to the office,

292
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
take a day off...

293
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,279
on the 20th next month.

294
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,809
Is that...

295
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,809
the day...

296
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,349
of my funeral?

297
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:26,059
It's your wedding day.

298
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,089
The fortune teller in Cheongdam-dong
says it's an auspicious day.

299
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,029
I'll print wedding invitations
with that date today.

300
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,799
You can't!

301
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,740
It's less than a month away.

302
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,279
There's something
I need to do in a month.

303
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,509
Ms. Park Seok Ja!

304
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,319
You can make me...

305
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,460
stand at the wedding.

306
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,559
However,

307
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:08,299
I'm Veronica Park.

308
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,869
Filming a movie...

309
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,970
where I hold another man's hand
and run away from the wedding...

310
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:19,039
is not a big deal for me.
You know that, right?

311
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,440
Are you threatening me?

312
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,910
I'm making a deal.

313
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,690
Maybe I should hire a baby too.

314
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,690
Goodness.

315
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,119
What do you want?

316
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,160
One month.

317
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,230
In 1999,

318
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,369
when I lost you at Seoul Station...

319
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,769
I shouldn't have looked for you.

320
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:46,839
Then...

321
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:50,869
I want you to sign the contract
with TnT Mobile and send it.

322
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,450
I already signed it.

323
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,390
Don't be nervous, Gal Hee.

324
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,430
It was going to happen anyway.

325
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:18,769
No matter what task she gives me,
just take on it.

326
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,509
You're here.

327
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Let's go.

328
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,880
To where?

329
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,039
This.

330
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,059
Ma'am.

331
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,599
Could you please explain
what we're doing?

332
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,700
Do you know
what offended me the most?

333
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:26,400
Jeong Gal Hee,
your pronunciation...

334
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,210
is awful.

335
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,910
"Awesome" doesn't have "th" in it.

336
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,279
And speak more gracefully.

337
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,150
Listen and repeat.

338
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,779
Awesome.

339
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,750
Awesome.

340
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,289
Now, I'm going to give you
a severe punishment. So listen.

341
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,799
From now on,

342
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,839
you're going to be
the real Veronica.

343
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:08,910
The housekeeper said
she found this in your pants.

344
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,420
It's not Veronica Park's.
Who is she?

345
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,920
How did you know?

346
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,930
They are not diamonds, but
rhinestones. Plus, it's gold-plated.

347
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,230
And this design...

348
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,700
It's a Cartier replica.

349
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,230
A replica?

350
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,829
Yes, it's fake.

351
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:34,440
It's what people who can't buy
the original ones buy.

352
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,069
It's what people who can't be
the original do.

353
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,710
Give it to me.

354
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,579
It's Secretary Jeong's.
I need to give it back to her.

355
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,380
Why was her earring in your pants?

356
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:48,619
I told you to fire her.

357
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,450
Fire her, if you don't want to be
betrayed by your secretary again.

358
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,259
Why did I bring this?

359
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,470
The person you have reached
is not available.

360
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,680
Why is the driver not answering?

361
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,519
Did your driver not come?

362
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,390
Get in.

363
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,130
Are you well these days?

364
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,569
I mean, have you seen a doctor
recently due to sickness...

365
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,809
I thought it wouldn't be
a free ride,

366
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,349
and I was right.
This is an expensive taxi.

367
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,819
Did you change your driver?

368
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,519
- I fired my former driver.
- Again?

369
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,119
He kept spying on me
through the rear-view mirror.

370
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,690
You need to look at
the rear-view mirror when you drive.

371
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,259
That's absurd.

372
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:08,430
Absurd?

373
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,299
Why do you think
your driver didn't come today?

374
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,339
I don't know.

375
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,309
He either made trouble
and ran away,

376
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:16,769
or stole information
and ran away.

377
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,809
Drivers and secretaries.

378
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,980
They're always the ones
that cause trouble.

379
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,690
What do you mean by
me being the real Veronica?

380
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:41,529
I'm supposed to see a man
for a month.

381
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:44,400
But my family should think...

382
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,400
that I'm seeing your boss.

383
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,509
Then...

384
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,380
You will be dating
Director Do Min Ik for one month.

385
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:58,819
Not as Jeong Gal Hee,
but as Veronica Park.

386
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,279
I can't do that.

387
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,619
Did you forget that you said
you would accept any punishment?

388
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,660
But...

389
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,329
I can't lie to him again.

390
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,029
Yesterday,

391
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,200
he kept saying sorry to me...

392
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,440
although I'm the one
who should be sorry.

393
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,869
I like him,
but I have to lie to him.

394
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,210
He trusts me, but I betrayed him.

395
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,009
I can't do it anymore.

396
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,519
I would rather...

397
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,319
just tell him the truth
and end this whole thing.

398
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:39,859
I will accept...

399
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,789
any other punishment but this.
I don't care if it's much harder.

400
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,400
I'm sorry, ma'am.

401
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,769
Your love is not the only thing
that matters.

402
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,650
You know...

403
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,950
what men did to me...

404
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,819
and how they left me.

405
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,289
Still...

406
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,430
If you can't do this,
there is only one other way.

407
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,759
On the 20th next month,

408
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:23,400
I will have to hold
your boss' hand...

409
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,900
and walk down the wedding aisle.

410
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,670
It's just for one month.

411
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,009
If you're going to tell him
the truth anyway,

412
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:35,180
it doesn't have to be now.

413
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,619
If the relationship between me and
this guy gets serious in a month,

414
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:44,750
I will end this thing
with Director Do.

415
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,519
So, Gal Hee,

416
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,559
help me.

417
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:53,930
Please.

418
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,880
It is indeed a replica
of one of our products.

419
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,980
But why...

420
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:13,720
I'd like to buy the original one.

421
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,019
I wonder if they're twins.

422
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,619
They're wearing
the exactly same dress.

423
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,509
How am I going to lie
to Director Do again?

424
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:25,390
- I'm sorry, Director Do.
- What?

425
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,819
I mean... Hello, Director Do.

426
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,829
What did you do wrong
to apologize like that?

427
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:35,930
Is it because the driver
didn't show up today?

428
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,829
He didn't show up?

429
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,700
He never told me
that he's going to skip work today.

430
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,079
Did you ask about the USB file?

431
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,910
What did Director Gi say?

432
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,420
He told me
that he doesn't know what it is.

433
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,690
What? It came from his office.

434
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,319
How could he not know?

435
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,059
Don't get him involved
in this anymore.

436
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,599
I'd rather doubt
that the earth is round...

437
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,799
than to doubt Dae Ju.

438
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,500
I should hurry up
and get my laptop fixed.

439
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,880
Hey.

440
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,609
What's your plan for tonight?

441
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,019
I need to help my brother
get discharged from the hospital.

442
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:29,750
That's great. Let me go with you.

443
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,490
I need to go to your house anyway.

444
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,190
My house? Why?

445
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,799
We need to take your brother home
once he gets discharged, right?

446
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:44,400
Well, yes.

447
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,319
What's this?

448
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,849
Can't you read?

449
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:04,220
It's a contract...

450
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,819
regarding TnT Mobile's exclusive
rights to Cinepark's contents.

451
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:10,160
I already signed it,

452
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,960
so take a look at it,
and have it signed by TnT Mobile.

453
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:17,329
Are you doing this
because we agreed to see each other?

454
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:19,369
I had already signed it...

455
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,000
as soon as I read your proposal.

456
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,609
I'm only giving it to you now...

457
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,750
because I wanted to use it
to make you feel desperate.

458
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,849
Thank you.

459
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,920
But shouldn't you be sending this
directly to my company?

460
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:37,690
Mr. Chastity.

461
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:42,690
I know I should be sending it
directly to your company.

462
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:47,660
But that is exactly why
I'm giving it to you.

463
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,140
You can tell everyone...

464
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,599
that you won the exclusive rights
to Cinepark's contents...

465
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,809
and take full credit for it.

466
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:06,220
I'll make sure
you don't regret this.

467
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,590
I'd also like to make an offer...

468
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:19,059
that you will surely never regret.

469
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,530
In Paju,

470
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,469
there's a place
that goes completely dark at 5pm...

471
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,539
with absolutely no one
living nearby.

472
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:31,039
and so secluded that no one would
know if anyone got murdered there.

473
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,980
It's an incredibly romantic villa.

474
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,449
And I happen to be...

475
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,820
the owner of that villa.

476
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,760
I'm planning on...

477
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,789
staying there tonight.

478
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:53,699
And I was wondering...

479
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,199
if you'd like to join.

480
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,469
You can go first.

481
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:06,440
I have an appointment,
so I'll join as soon as I'm done.

482
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,150
Oh, yes!

483
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,650
I should ask someone
to have the firewood ready...

484
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,920
so I could...

485
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:18,090
fire you up, Mr. Chastity.

486
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:25,599
Nice to meet you.

487
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,800
I'm Do Min Ik.

488
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:31,130
Nice to meet you.
I'm Jeong Jung Hee.

489
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,440
I'll carry that.

490
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,340
There's something else
you need to carry.

491
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,510
Pardon?

492
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:43,210
Put your arm out like this.

493
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,510
- My arm?
- Yes.

494
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,050
- Sit down.
- Okay.

495
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,250
- That's good.
- What?

496
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,820
- Jung Hee!
- My gosh.

497
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,230
My gosh, you have an amazing back.

498
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,130
It's good enough to do manual labor.

499
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:02,099
It's a waste that you have to work
in an office.

500
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:05,900
I'm sorry, Director Do.

501
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,940
What is going on?

502
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,039
I'm sorry.

503
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,610
Taxi drivers don't like
coming this far.

504
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:28,019
It's Mr. Eun.

505
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,289
He must not be feeling very well.

506
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,130
He wants to know if he could take
a few days off.

507
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,199
- Tell him that it's fine.
- Okay.

508
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:42,369
Jung Hee, we're almost here.

509
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,369
Put me down.

510
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:50,150
Thank you.

511
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,989
I knew it.

512
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:05,090
I'm sorry.

513
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,530
You can go home now.

514
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,139
Can I use your bathroom?

515
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:23,750
My legs hurt so much.

516
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,070
Was it here?

517
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,929
Okay, great.

518
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,469
So you came late...

519
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:49,610
because you had to put new
earrings at Secretary Jeong's place?

520
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:52,909
Yes.

521
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:55,480
Why?

522
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,610
What do you mean why?

523
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,780
Secretary Jeong doesn't always need
to wear fake earrings.

524
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,920
That's exactly my point.

525
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:05,050
Why do even care whether
Secretary Jeong's earrings...

526
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:07,719
are real or fake?

527
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,460
- That's because...
- Because what?

528
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:12,429
Because I...

529
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,900
Because you what?
Because you like her?

530
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:20,000
What are you talking about?
I don't like her.

531
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,340
I told you already.
I like someone else.

532
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,079
You've been acting weird ever since
the stockholders' meeting.

533
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,309
You keep saying
you like that other woman,

534
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,809
but you're always
looking at Secretary Jeong,

535
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,650
and you're always right next to her.

536
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,480
Hey, that's because...

537
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,690
That's because...

538
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:43,429
There's actually...

539
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:46,429
something I don't quite get.

540
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,159
What is it?

541
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,769
My blood pressure only goes up...

542
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,699
when I'm with Secretary Jeong.

543
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,070
Your blood pressure?

544
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,369
It never went up when
I was with that woman I like.

545
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,010
But when I'm with Secretary Jeong,

546
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,210
my heart starts throbbing,

547
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,980
and it starts
beating really quickly.

548
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,980
Whatever the reason is,
what's there to hesitate?

549
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,949
Secretary Jeong also likes you...

550
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,360
She likes you
because you're a great boss.

551
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,659
And if you like her as well,

552
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:17,159
just forget about that other woman
and start dating Secretary Jeong.

553
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,630
I can't forget about that woman.

554
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,099
What?

555
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,130
She's someone
that's very hard to forget.

556
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,469
If you ever get to meet her,

557
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:26,969
you'll understand what I mean.

558
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:28,599
Really?

559
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,469
Who is she?

560
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:35,679
Veronica Park.

561
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:46,519
What did you just say?

562
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,130
Are you saying the woman you like...

563
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,230
is Veronica Park,
the president of Cinepark?

564
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:56,199
Do you know her?

565
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:59,000
Why are you telling me that now?

566
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:03,469
I thought we'd stop meeting
each other after a couple dates.

567
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:04,909
There's nothing serious...

568
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,380
going on between you guys, right?

569
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,780
It was just a one-sided thing
on your end, right?

570
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,079
We even kissed.

571
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,559
I'm sorry. I don't think
I'll be able to make it today.

572
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,739
There's something
I need to take care of.

573
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:39,510
But you said you'll come.
Why are you suddenly canceling?

574
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,239
Dae Ju?

575
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:44,550
Hello?

576
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,719
Mr. Chastity?

577
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,949
Hey!

578
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:52,489
If you don't want to give up on her,

579
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,360
what about Secretary Jeong?
Did you toy with her?

580
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,360
Who toyed with her?

581
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,429
Do you know how I felt when she
didn't want to renew the contract?

582
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,199
When I was seven,

583
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,500
my mom abandoned me here.
It felt just like that.

584
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,670
So what are you trying to do?

585
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:14,980
I don't know, Dae Ju.

586
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,579
You might not believe it,

587
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,480
but I'm serious.

588
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:26,659
What I felt around
Veronica Park is real.

589
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,389
And it's true...

590
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,289
that my heart flutters...

591
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,800
whenever I see Secretary Jeong.

592
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,000
Listen up, Min Ik.

593
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,969
I wish I could tell you...

594
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,340
whom to give up.

595
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:47,710
But it's your choice.

596
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,510
I won't tell you what to do.

597
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,280
But you must give up one of them.

598
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,920
I'll see you at There,
same time tomorrow.

599
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:57,820
Make up your mind until then.

600
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,960
Only then will I be able
to find my answer.

601
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:36,489
Go down. Go down.

602
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,199
It shall go down
as if there's oil in it.

603
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,969
So don't give up and keep running
until you can be the president.

604
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,730
I'll help you.

605
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,349
Goodnight

606
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,920
My baby

607
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:10,130
My cute baby

608
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,340
Hello, Director Do.

609
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,820
But you must give up one of them.

610
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:11,320
I'll see you at There,
same time tomorrow.

611
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:12,789
Make up your mind until then.

612
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,860
Why are you staring at me like that?

613
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,260
What are you doing?

614
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:24,829
You got me the pebbles,
but I didn't clean the tank yet.

615
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:29,469
I had to do something like this
to feel a little better.

616
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,550
Don't do it. Just call in
some service vendor.

617
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:46,119
Why? This is your favorite fish.

618
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,190
Just...

619
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,659
Why...

620
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:53,030
Why are you doing something
that I didn't even ask for?

621
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,269
The other day,

622
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:01,070
you said a secretary should
do things even before you ask for.

623
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:04,139
Forget all about what I said before.

624
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:08,840
If you don't have anything to do,
just go get some coffee.

625
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,679
You should take your laptop
to repair. You could've gone there.

626
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:14,820
I did it this morning.

627
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,389
Give me that. I'll finish wiping it.

628
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:26,760
What's wrong with you?

629
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,469
Director Do,
I think it's being weird.

630
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:47,119
Gal Hee, where are you going?

631
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,949
Ms. Lee, the fish is sick.

632
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:52,090
Secretary Jeong, hurry!

633
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,059
I'm sorry. I should get going.

634
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,699
Jeong Gal Hee, you're finally...

635
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:04,630
unlatching the door.

636
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,869
Please save it, sir.

637
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,780
Director Do treasures it
as much as his life.

638
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,949
It's about to pass away.

639
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:19,780
Rest in peace.

640
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,019
Pass away?

641
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,349
A fish that's worth 100,000 dollars
is dying this easily?

642
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,119
Who says the fish is
worth 100,000 dollars?

643
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,929
This is a platinum arowana.

644
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:33,460
I think it's the most
expensive arowana.

645
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,559
This isn't a platinum arowana.

646
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,070
- This is a golden arowana.
- What?

647
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:38,869
Well...

648
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:40,170
That can't be right.

649
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:44,469
You can buy this golden arowana
for about 10,000 dollars.

650
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,730
I'm sorry, Director Do.

651
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:13,099
I should've taken better care of it.

652
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:18,440
Why do you keep
saying sorry these days?

653
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,880
You heard it died
because it's about time.

654
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,849
But what do you think
this is all about?

655
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,250
You think Chairman Do treasured
the fish without knowing what it is?

656
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,690
- How did you know that?
- What?

657
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,760
I don't think I told you
about my father before.

658
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,760
Eul Wang Lee... I mean...

659
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,699
Ms. Lee Eul Wang.

660
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:46,800
I heard her talk about it before.

661
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:50,170
She used to work for Chairman Do.

662
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,179
Go home.

663
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:04,320
And call in someone
to get rid of the tank tomorrow.

664
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,590
Okay.

665
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,050
The motherboard was broken,
so we replaced it.

666
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,780
What about the data?

667
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,449
Check the files. I think
they all are still in there.

668
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,719
Okay. Thank you.

669
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:37,949
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

670
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,730
Director Do.

671
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,139
Why are you back?

672
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:44,719
Ta-da.

673
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:48,019
What are these?

674
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,230
They are moss balls.

675
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:52,760
- What?
- Moss balls.

676
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,929
If we get rid of the tank,

677
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,570
you'll feel more empty inside.

678
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:03,670
But then again, the empty tank will
remind you of the fish.

679
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,309
I heard they live for more
than a hundred years.

680
00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:12,650
Is it some kind of moss?

681
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,219
Yes.

682
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:17,690
They are on the bottom now,

683
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,590
but they float above water
when they feel good.

684
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,690
- How can moss have feelings?
- I'm serious.

685
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,659
I hope they will float soon.

686
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,300
It was Arom.

687
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:35,369
What?

688
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,239
The fish's name.

689
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:41,380
"Since it's an arowana,
let's call it Arom."

690
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,079
My father said that and smiled.

691
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:54,420
Then let's call them Arom.

692
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:59,730
Arom number 1, number 2,
and number 3.

693
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:10,139
You should go home now.

694
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:14,309
I want to see if they will float
before I go home.

695
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,480
It's okay. I also want...

696
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,480
to wait and see
if they will float.

697
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:37,670
You miss President Park, right?

698
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,139
What?

699
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,710
Whenever you missed her,

700
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,409
you wanted to see me.

701
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,179
That's not true.

702
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,719
I just want to be with you.

703
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:57,789
Excuse me?

704
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,570
Well, I mean...

705
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:20,579
That's not necessarily
the reason, I think.

706
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:24,579
Sometimes,

707
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,719
I just want...

708
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:34,420
to be with you, I think.
Maybe I'm wrong.

709
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,630
Well...

710
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:41,860
Well, then.

711
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,130
You can stay.

712
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,530
I like...

713
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:49,199
being with you.

714
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,239
Even if I have to stay up
the whole night.

715
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:56,849
What?

716
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,949
I mean...

717
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,219
You can't see people's faces,

718
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:09,760
so that's why I stay with you.

719
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,760
But that is...

720
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:17,369
probably not the only reason why.

721
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:19,329
Well, it would be nice...

722
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,000
to have company
when I see them float.

723
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:26,940
They're floating.

724
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,340
What?

725
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,010
They're really floating.

726
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:32,750
I told you they will float.

727
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:36,219
Aren't they pretty?

728
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,429
They are.

729
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,469
Why number two?
Are you not feeling good?

730
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,670
It's moving.

731
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,570
I think it will float soon.

732
00:53:58,239 --> 00:53:59,940
It's floating.

733
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:01,679
It's floating.

734
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:03,780
Look.

735
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:05,809
It's floating.

736
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,280
- It's floating.
- It's floating.

737
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,159
So this is...

738
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:55,900
your eyebrow.

739
00:54:57,769 --> 00:54:58,800
This is...

740
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:00,840
your eye.

741
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,679
This is...

742
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,010
your lips.

743
00:55:38,139 --> 00:55:39,170
Wait.

744
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:48,750
- Well...
- I...

745
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,250
I will see you tomorrow.

746
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:15,780
Hi, Dae Ju.

747
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,010
Okay. I'll be right there.

748
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,920
(Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just.)

749
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,059
(Are you sure you want to
permanently delete this folder?)

750
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:15,639
The work is done, Boss.

751
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:19,010
The file is gone,

752
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:21,340
but Director Do is suspicious of me.

753
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,809
I think I should disappear
from the company now.

754
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:29,250
I will never forget...

755
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,750
your kindness.

756
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,030
I'm so tired.

757
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,909
You...

758
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,820
(Boat There)

759
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:24,639
Did you find out...

760
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,039
who you like?

761
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:31,579
Good.

762
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,320
Who is she?

763
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,219
Before that...

764
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:43,289
I want you to punch me once, Dae Ju.

765
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:44,829
Why?

766
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,239
Is the person you like...

767
00:58:57,139 --> 00:58:58,539
Veronica Park?

768
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,210
Then is it Secretary Jeong?

769
00:59:05,449 --> 00:59:07,679
Who's the one you love?

770
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,570
(This drama was filmed with the
support of fish pathology experts.)

771
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:35,409
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

772
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:39,110
Secretary Jeong, don't approach me
within one-meter radius.

773
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:42,280
- Do you think it was a mistake...
- It wasn't a mistake.

774
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,820
President Park. My family is
planning our wedding.

775
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,420
So we are dating now.

776
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:51,159
I must be out of my mind.
I'm thinking about Secretary Jeong.

777
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:54,159
Could you do me a favor?
Please let me say it!

778
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:56,730
I like you, Director Do.
