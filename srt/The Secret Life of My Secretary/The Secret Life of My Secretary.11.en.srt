1
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,609
Is the person you like...

2
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:41,780
Veronica Park?

3
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,920
Then is it Secretary Jeong?

4
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,859
Who's the one you love?

5
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,329
Both of them.

6
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,130
I love both of them.

7
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,040
Hey.

8
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,409
This is not a question like,
"Do you like Mom or Dad?"

9
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,019
How could you love both of them?

10
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,819
If you're an adult, don't you
at least have to know...

11
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,019
who you love?

12
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,019
It frustrates me too.

13
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,390
I'm confused too.
It drives me crazy.

14
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,560
I have no idea
how my brain came up...

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,670
with such an awful conclusion.

16
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,640
When I'm with Veronica Park,

17
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,140
I think of Secretary Jeong.

18
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,409
When I'm with Secretary Jeong,

19
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,849
I think of Veronica Park.

20
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,019
I don't even want to hear more.

21
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,219
I don't know when this started,

22
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,189
but I feel like...

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,689
the two women are similar.

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,530
Sometimes, even their voices...

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,069
sound alike.

26
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,840
I touched
Secretary Jeong's lips earlier...

27
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,270
and for a second,

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,979
I was reminded of...

29
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,909
Veronica's lips.

30
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,419
Are you really
the Do Min Ik that I know?

31
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,750
I know. Even I hate myself.

32
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,860
No wonder you hate me.

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,629
I'll get going.

34
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,990
What do you think it was, Mom?

35
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,460
It was his true heart, of course.

36
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:15,370
Really?

37
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,900
The fish he got
from his late father died.

38
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,370
He was in one of
his weakest moments.

39
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,639
And I happened to be
next to him.

40
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,879
So he made a mistake.

41
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,949
But your boss isn't the kind of man
who does that to any woman.

42
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,250
Don't you know it?

43
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,090
The woman he's in love with
is Veronica Park.

44
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,259
And that woman is you, after all.

45
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,030
Money.

46
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,669
He said he liked her because
she had a lot of money.

47
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,039
He said he liked how she's competent
and from a rich family.

48
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,740
How is that me?

49
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,009
That's not me.

50
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,650
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,389
If you were born to a rich family,

52
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,659
you wouldn't have had to
lie to him in the first place.

53
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,090
Come on.

54
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm the one who is sorry.

55
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,699
I should...

56
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,970
let my dead mom rest...

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,009
instead of consulting her
about my love life all the time.

58
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,550
Still, I would like to believe...

59
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,220
that it wasn't a mistake
and he did it because he likes you.

60
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,199
Get up!

61
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,709
You can't just show up in the
morning and ask for a CT scan.

62
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,279
I think there's something wrong
with my brain.

63
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,120
I think the incident not only
damaged the face recognition area,

64
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,920
but also the emotion control area
and the desire control area.

65
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm sure
those areas are damaged too.

66
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,420
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,029
I...

68
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,829
I'm in love with two women
at the same time.

69
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,899
You must have
seriously lost your mind.

70
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,670
Right? I live in a modern society...

71
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,410
where monogamy is the social norm.

72
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,879
I have never had any girl issues
in my life. I'm Do Min Ik!

73
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,709
And now my brain is crazy.

74
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,180
Now scan it.

75
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,180
I'm sure it's broken.

76
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,689
Looking at you being like this...

77
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:54,029
reminds me of the time
when I had to choose my major.

78
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,129
I was torn between neurosurgery...

79
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,699
and orthopedics.

80
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,029
That's not the same.

81
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,800
People are funny.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
We think about where to go,

83
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,370
but we don't think about
where we came from.

84
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,009
What are you talking about?

85
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,639
Don't think about to whom
your heart is going to,

86
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,449
but think of what your heart
was like in the beginning.

87
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,180
Then you will find the answer to...

88
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,980
whom you should choose.

89
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,750
Secretary Jeong.

90
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:58,860
Director Do.

91
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,410
Hey, Director Do.

92
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,779
About yesterday...

93
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:22,750
Don't come near me.

94
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,519
From now on,
if I ever approach you,

95
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,149
make sure you avoid me.

96
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,560
I'm a filthy jerk.

97
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,350
No.

98
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,990
Always stay a meter away from me.

99
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,860
You're forbidden to make private
conversations and physical contact.

100
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,420
- Director Do.
- No, wait.

101
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,790
You never took a day off after you
renewed your contract, right?

102
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,889
That's good.

103
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,060
How about you just take
a few days off?

104
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,029
All of a sudden?

105
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,040
Are you being like this...

106
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,810
because you think what you did
yesterday was a mistake?

107
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,939
It wasn't a mistake.

108
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,939
It wasn't a mistake.

109
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,509
Anyway, I still want you...

110
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:34,019
to keep your distance.

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,899
Can you explain to me
why I need to keep a distance?

112
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,139
Your boss...

113
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
isn't as good of a guy...

114
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,009
as you think he is.

115
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,250
Yes, I know.

116
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,090
I'm a fool who can't tell
who's whom when you're not around.

117
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,620
And I know I'm an idiot
who can't even tell...

118
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,789
if someone's laughing or crying.

119
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:18,700
But I'm doing this...

120
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,299
for a reason.

121
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,429
So please just go.

122
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,769
If you're next to me,

123
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,169
I might...

124
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,250
do something crazy again.

125
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
So...

126
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,740
Can you...

127
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,210
go get me a bucket...

128
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,009
so I can use it to collect my tears?

129
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,080
What's the matter?

130
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,419
He won't call me.

131
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,789
Mr. Chastity.

132
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,789
It was pretty obvious
that he was using you.

133
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,960
What did he have to take care of
in the middle of the night?

134
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,230
Do you think
he's just really hygienic?

135
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,500
Or do you think he suddenly
felt the urge to clean his house?

136
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Or...

137
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,870
do you think
I signed the contract...

138
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,340
way too quickly?

139
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,610
Bingo.

140
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,980
Which way is the Han River?

141
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,590
My goodness gracious.

142
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,059
President Park,
I found Mr. Gi Dae Ju.

143
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,070
I'll see you.

144
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,440
You can go to the Han River,

145
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,610
but at least tell me
why you asked me to come here.

146
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,879
I want you to say "Darn it."

147
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,850
You're supposed to teach me
how to act.

148
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,250
But you're teaching me
how to swear?

149
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,379
This is your workplace,

150
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:22,090
and that's going to be
your first line.

151
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:23,950
Darn it.

152
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,519
How do you feel? Do you feel
the urge to swear a lot more?

153
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,159
That's the line you want me to say
at a theater like this?

154
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,429
Considering how much
I helped you out with this guy,

155
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,399
shouldn't you at least get me
a main role in a drama?

156
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,539
This is how I teach acting.

157
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,139
I teach actors and actresses
how it feels to be humiliated...

158
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,210
and add emotions in their lines.
It's called method acting.

159
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,879
Always chase after your dream
and stay hopeful.

160
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,789
Darn it.

161
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,970
May I borrow some of your bait?

162
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,399
Ms. Park Ok Soon?

163
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,870
I'm going to change my name.

164
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,610
Did you tail me?

165
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
You're about to make me
feel upset again.

166
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,580
I made someone else tail you.

167
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,320
I mean, seriously.

168
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,190
"Trust people."

169
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,059
"You should love someone."

170
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,460
You're the one...

171
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,029
who said all those sweet things.

172
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,769
But as soon as I signed
the contract,

173
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,299
you totally went MIA.

174
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,340
It swayed.

175
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,309
You got swayed by another woman?

176
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,279
No, that.

177
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,039
If it swayed,

178
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,580
I will do my best to hold onto it.

179
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,799
My goodness,
it got cooked really nicely.

180
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:28,909
She's someone
that's very hard to forget.

181
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,250
Why did you have to be
so attractive...

182
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,090
and make another man
fall for you?

183
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,120
Me?

184
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,519
First of all,

185
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,659
I'd like to apologize.

186
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,259
For not calling me?

187
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,029
I'd like to apologize
on behalf of Min Ik.

188
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,470
I guess you found out about us.

189
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:56,840
If Min Ik ever hurt you
in any kind of way,

190
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,340
please be a little understanding.

191
00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,710
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,779
I can totally understand
why you have the wrong idea.

193
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,080
But Do Min Ik and I...

194
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,049
aren't exactly in a...

195
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:08,549
I'm the one who's sorry.

196
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,389
When I heard Min Ik
talking about you,

197
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,360
I started to get really confused.

198
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:18,129
So I needed some time
to come to a conclusion.

199
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,129
I'd rather not hear it...

200
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,529
if it's something bad.

201
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,210
It's not something for me to decide.
That was my conclusion.

202
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,419
Two guys...

203
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,690
fighting over one woman
and telling each other to give up...

204
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,019
is just absurd.

205
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,190
We shouldn't be the ones
to decide who gives up.

206
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,129
It should be you.

207
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,860
If you like Min Ik,
I'll give up on you.

208
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,129
But if you like me...

209
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,200
If you choose me,

210
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,009
I'll do everything I can
to make Min Ik give up on you.

211
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,240
So just think about yourself,

212
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,139
and do whatever you want to do.

213
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,779
Then...

214
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,379
I...

215
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,789
Wonder whom I should choose

216
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,220
Gi... Are you nervous?

217
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,690
I know...

218
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,360
a great way to help you realize
how you feel...

219
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,700
when you're confused.

220
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,669
What's that?

221
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,809
No.

222
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,590
I'll do that when you've become
more certain about your choice.

223
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,220
I wonder what Do Min Ik
is doing right now.

224
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,659
We should restrain ourselves
from doing anything...

225
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,669
until you make a choice.

226
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,370
You restrain yourself from peeing,
yawning, crying, and dozing off.

227
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,440
But what kind of a guy
restrains himself from kissing?

228
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,470
On top of that,

229
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,840
that over there
and my heart right here...

230
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:13,340
are both burning like crazy
right now.

231
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:22,590
Let me burn the wood.

232
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,360
Dae Ju.

233
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,460
Stop right there!

234
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,379
Were you covered with filth or what?

235
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:53,220
Why did you take
a shower for two hours?

236
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,389
I must say...

237
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,860
- I'm the filth itself.
- What?

238
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,099
Thank you, Mom.

239
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,900
For taking in a scumbag like me.

240
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:14,539
And for feeding me and raising me.

241
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,269
So it's worthwhile to be a mom.

242
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,009
I went through all that
to raise you,

243
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,410
and you're paying me back
with your marriage.

244
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,279
Did you get the contract
for the exclusive run of Cinepark?

245
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,450
Not yet.

246
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,690
Not yet?

247
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:35,490
No wonder why Chairwoman Park
isn't calling me these days.

248
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,259
It's not like you have a problem
with Veronica Park, right?

249
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,329
- Well... The thing is...
- You know what?

250
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,269
Veronica is a woman too.

251
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,140
If she gets sulky or upset,
don't leave her alone.

252
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,210
You should meet her and comfort her.

253
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,529
I should meet Veronica
and ask how she feels about me.

254
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,039
If she wants to get back
together with me,

255
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,769
I don't have to worry anymore.

256
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,880
And if she doesn't
want to see me again...

257
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,210
All right. Then...

258
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:33,019
I'll think about it again.

259
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,700
Why did Mom say such a thing?

260
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,079
It's probably better off this way.

261
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,210
If he was serious, then what?

262
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,779
I lied to him already.
I would feel sorry.

263
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,890
It's better off this way.

264
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,569
Hello?

265
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,680
When I told you to impersonate me,

266
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,809
I didn't know things would
turn out this way.

267
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,650
But you know what?

268
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,549
Gi Dae Ju and Do Min Ik are
fighting over me.

269
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,720
Now I'm in an interesting
love triangle...

270
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,089
hindering a friendship.

271
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,190
The guy you're meeting...

272
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,259
is Director Gi Dae Ju?

273
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,460
Why did he tell me
that there was nothing going on?

274
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,630
- What?
- Nothing.

275
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,799
President Park.

276
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,839
You shouldn't tell anyone
about Director Do's illness.

277
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,170
Not even Director Gi.

278
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,640
You promised you'd
impersonate me for a month.

279
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,380
As long as you keep
your promise, I'll...

280
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,559
How do I get to the office?

281
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,519
May I ask what you're here for?

282
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,630
What is your boss doing here?

283
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,960
What?

284
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,269
I'm here to meet President Park.

285
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,599
He's here to see me.

286
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,299
What do we do?

287
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,509
You know what to do.

288
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,750
Come right away.

289
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,430
Hello, President Park.

290
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,009
President Park.

291
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,049
I'm sorry that I didn't call
before coming over.

292
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,089
I'm Veronica Park.

293
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,930
Have you been waiting long?

294
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,240
No. Actually...

295
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,440
Secretary Park got me some coffee.

296
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,779
So I was doing fine.

297
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,210
It's me. Secretary Park.

298
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,079
Secretary Park.

299
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,119
Okay. Thank you.

300
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,450
It's my pleasure.

301
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,319
Thank you for the compliment,
President Park.

302
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,900
Well... Secretary Park.

303
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:17,609
We need to talk.
Could you give us a minute?

304
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,910
Me?

305
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:20,980
Never mind.

306
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,109
Just think that I'm not here.

307
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,880
Go ahead and have a talk.

308
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,599
She's always like that.

309
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,269
Don't mind her.

310
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,640
What brings you here?

311
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,410
Well...

312
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,809
I'm sorry to say this,

313
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,750
but my family wants to
proceed with our marriage.

314
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,019
I thought we should talk it out.

315
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,589
If...

316
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,960
you're still dating...

317
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,390
the guy you talked about...

318
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,430
She broke up.

319
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,500
- What?
- You told me before.

320
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,440
Once out of curiosity
and twice by accident.

321
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,769
As you kept going on dating
with Director Do,

322
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:22,869
you ended up falling for him.

323
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,779
And now you'd like to start over
with him as a man and a woman.

324
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,349
Secretary Park.

325
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:34,250
President Park has been
waiting for you to call.

326
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,819
She checked her phone all the time.
Oh, right.

327
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:42,029
She wanted to watch
this concert with you,

328
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,329
so she even bought the tickets.

329
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,299
President Park, look at his face.

330
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,740
He must be flattered.

331
00:23:56,869 --> 00:24:01,079
His face turned white and pale.

332
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,220
Secretary Park.

333
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,900
I guess we should talk outside.

334
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:21,630
Okay.

335
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,119
Come to think of it,

336
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,789
I should be grateful
to my secretary.

337
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,519
Your secretary seemed...

338
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,430
very unique.

339
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,700
Anyway,

340
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,799
I told you I was
seeing someone else,

341
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,299
but you came to see me again.

342
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:01,539
Does that mean...

343
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,809
you still have feelings for me,

344
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,980
Veronica Park?

345
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,109
You're not...

346
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,579
interested in anyone else?

347
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,619
Anyone else?
What are you talking about?

348
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,859
I see.

349
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,670
You're not interested
in anyone else.

350
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:31,329
I knew it.

351
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:37,009
How could you
when you're with a woman like me?

352
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:41,109
If I were you,
I would've liked myself too.

353
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,410
What about you?

354
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,319
Is what your secretary said
all true?

355
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,420
You liked me as a man?

356
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,259
Isn't that true?

357
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,859
It is true.

358
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:10,009
I like you so much to the point...

359
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,440
where I forget what I'm doing.

360
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,690
I guess we're dating now?

361
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,359
What?

362
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,700
Sure.

363
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,299
But...

364
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,910
Oh, right! The meeting.

365
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:46,809
Is that the time already?

366
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,650
I'm sorry.
I forgot that I had a meeting today.

367
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,650
What?

368
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,119
But he has no meetings today.

369
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,750
I think I should get going.

370
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,819
Wait.

371
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:04,490
Then what is happening between us?

372
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:08,329
Well...

373
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,670
Surprise.

374
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,109
How about we decide
whether we should date or not...

375
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:17,339
on the concert day?

376
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:18,910
Why?

377
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,349
Yes, Secretary Jeong.
I need to hurry?

378
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,349
Okay. I'll be right there.

379
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:31,859
Well, then...

380
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,130
See you on Wednesday at 7pm...

381
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,099
at the Arts Center.

382
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,740
(President Sim Hae Yong)

383
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,220
You...

384
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,059
So?

385
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,160
What?

386
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:14,299
I'll call you back.

387
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,500
Just hang up for now.

388
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:22,809
Hey.

389
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,640
How many times did I tell you
not to eat in the car?

390
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,809
It's definitely him.

391
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,349
(Director Do Min Ik)

392
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,619
See you on Wednesday at 7pm...

393
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:40,490
at the Arts Center.

394
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,690
Why did I suddenly
bring up the concert there?

395
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,769
Forget it.

396
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,730
She said she liked me.

397
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,769
I will officially ask her to be
my girlfriend on Wednesday.

398
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:10,119
I must be out of my mind.

399
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,960
Here I am
thinking about Secretary Jeong.

400
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,099
I wonder how she is doing.

401
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:22,269
She should be doing all right.

402
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,740
It's been only one day,
and why do I miss her so much?

403
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,150
What do you think about...

404
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,579
meeting Secretary Jeong
for one last time?

405
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,950
Okay.

406
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,190
If you guys float up,
I will go see Secretary Jeong.

407
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:49,490
If you don't, I won't.

408
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,200
Okay. Here we go.

409
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,700
1, 2, 3.

410
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,309
I'm not that cold-hearted.

411
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,140
I will give you one more chance.

412
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,779
Here we go.

413
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,009
One.

414
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,750
Two.

415
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,049
Three.

416
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,420
What do you guys know about?

417
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,089
I can go see her
if I want to see her.

418
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,940
He was hesitant, right?

419
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,109
I think he was hesitating
because of you.

420
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:40,809
No, that's not it.

421
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,650
All he had to say was "Yes."

422
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,019
Why would he make up an excuse
and leave?

423
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:47,779
If you're going to keep saying
things like that, leave.

424
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,420
Just leave.

425
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,720
Darn it.

426
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,990
Hey, look. He came to see you.

427
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,700
He really did.

428
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,890
I'm the one who told her
to take some days off.

429
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,230
What am I doing here?

430
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,359
Gosh.

431
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:37,099
Sir.

432
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,000
Goodness. Secretary Jeong?

433
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:44,170
It's you, right?

434
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:45,880
Yes.

435
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,880
Are you here to see me?

436
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,980
What?

437
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,079
No. Why would you say that?

438
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,750
Then...

439
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,319
Well...

440
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,089
It's...

441
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,059
The laptop.

442
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:09,000
I think it's restored,

443
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,230
but you didn't send me the file.

444
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:14,099
That's why you're here.

445
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,240
You should check your e-mail.

446
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,680
I was afraid of
losing the file again,

447
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,079
so as soon as I got my laptop back,

448
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:23,250
I sent it to your e-mail.

449
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,049
I see.

450
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:27,349
Yes.

451
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,619
Then I should go now.

452
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,460
How are you doing?

453
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,759
Are you having a good time
with your days off?

454
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,400
Yes.

455
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:45,299
I think I know...

456
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,369
why you gave me days off.

457
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:50,339
Do you?

458
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:51,839
You like...

459
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,009
Veronica Park,

460
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,210
but that incident happened...

461
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,549
and now you want to avoid me
because you feel bad. Am I right?

462
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:07,960
I guess I am right.

463
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,799
You once said...

464
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,269
you're not as good of a guy
as I may think.

465
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,109
It's the same for me.

466
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,210
Your secretary is...

467
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,279
not as good of a person
you might think.

468
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,450
So if you're avoiding me
because of what happened that day,

469
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,119
we can pretend nothing happened.

470
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:43,289
If you want me to forget about it
and move on, I will do that.

471
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,460
So please don't feel bad for me.

472
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,799
Why are you saying you're sorry?

473
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,099
How am I supposed to
make up my mind now?

474
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,069
What does that mean?

475
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,180
Dae Ju says I'm disgusting...

476
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,410
and Dr. Gu says I lost my mind.

477
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,410
I think...

478
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:07,980
my puberty is hitting me now,

479
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,389
because I haven't had it before.

480
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,989
So please be understanding.

481
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,000
I will make up my mind...

482
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,000
anyhow...

483
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,469
as soon as possible.

484
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,019
This way.

485
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,929
This is the person you saw
at the funeral hall, right?

486
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,880
Isn't this man Eun Jung Su?

487
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,539
The fingerprint from the box cutter
matches his.

488
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,010
What did you just say?

489
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,179
Eun Jung Su is
the name of my driver.

490
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:16,519
What?

491
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,090
Are you serious? He's your driver?

492
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:20,659
What's your problem?

493
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,690
You told us that you remember
the culprit's face.

494
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,429
But you couldn't recognize
the guy who tried to kill you...

495
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:27,659
even when he got hired
as your driver?

496
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,000
And then you reported him
to the police saying...

497
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,300
you saw him for the first time
at the funeral hall?

498
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,300
Does that mean...

499
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:37,769
he already knew that I have trouble
recognizing people's faces?

500
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,110
Where is this guy right now?

501
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,210
He took a few days off
because he wasn't feeling so well.

502
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,880
My gosh. I called
the telecommunication company,

503
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,519
and it turns out he canceled
his cell phone service.

504
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:47,619
Really?

505
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,789
You have his resume, right?

506
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:53,289
Send it to us
so we can trace his address.

507
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,460
Wait a minute.

508
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:59,730
That means Eun Jung Su...

509
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,869
went to Secretary Jeong's house
with that knife.

510
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,030
Yes.

511
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,570
Then you should've sent someone
to her house!

512
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,440
Why are you yelling at us?

513
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,610
Didn't you see her house?

514
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:16,210
Her door is so easy to open.

515
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,610
Her windows look like
they're about to break.

516
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,519
And the only man who lives there
is her blind brother.

517
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,519
She has no parents,
and no one's there to help her.

518
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,860
And she doesn't even have
a security system installed.

519
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,659
But you didn't even think
of protecting her?

520
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:31,059
How could you...

521
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,300
just leave her like that?

522
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:37,469
Do you think we have enough people
to do that kind of stuff?

523
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:39,699
Okay, we get it.
Calm yourself and sit back down.

524
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,139
My gosh.

525
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:43,309
Mr. Do, wait.

526
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,369
Mr. Do, where are you going?

527
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:00,590
Director Do.

528
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,130
Nothing happened here, right?

529
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,500
No.

530
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,570
Pack up.

531
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,539
You want me back at the office?

532
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:19,639
No, not the office.

533
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,449
I want you to move.
How about you move?

534
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,880
Just pack what you need
for the time being...

535
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,349
Why do you want me to move
all of a sudden?

536
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,050
It was Eun Jung Su.

537
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,420
The guy who stabbed me
by the Han River.

538
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,590
It was Mr. Eun?

539
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,730
Remember the box cutter you found
at your place?

540
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:37,289
That was also his.

541
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:42,000
Thank goodness you weren't home
when he came.

542
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,300
If you were home all by yourself...

543
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:48,170
But all this time,

544
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,210
he's been working as your driver.
So why...

545
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:53,110
Hurry up and pack your stuff.

546
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,280
You should stay at a hotel
for a while...

547
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,010
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

548
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,650
I can't leave my blind brother here
and go to a hotel all by myself.

549
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:02,889
Then go with him.

550
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,849
I told you already.

551
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,920
My brother has no choice
but to live here.

552
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,130
Hiding won't make a difference.

553
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,230
We need to figure out
why Mr. Eun...

554
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,400
tried to hurt you...

555
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and why he broke into my place.

556
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,769
Let's figure that out together.

557
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,809
I'll figure it out myself.

558
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,940
You stay out of it.

559
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,280
And I'm going to call
a security company tomorrow,

560
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,650
so just keep that in mind.

561
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,320
Director... Director Do!

562
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,199
(Under CCTV surveillance)

563
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,699
My gosh, he really sent
a security company.

564
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,039
Hey, Myung Jung.
Did he come to work?

565
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,179
How does he look?

566
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,889
He lost his smile.

567
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:14,190
He looks so dispirited.

568
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,789
His shoulders are so droopy
down to his belly button.

569
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,630
And he looks so daunted
that he even seems shorter.

570
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:28,400
Ri Ra, I'm sorry to ask you this,

571
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,369
but can you make sure
he eats something?

572
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,239
Hurry up and go.

573
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,309
Director Do.

574
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,980
Gal Hee asked me to get you lunch.

575
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,250
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

576
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,590
No.

577
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:45,920
I see.

578
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,199
It looks like he's trying
to starve himself to death.

579
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,699
What does it mean
to not crave anything?

580
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:59,139
Don't people always have...

581
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:01,599
at least 1 or 2 menus in mind?

582
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:05,110
Sweet and sour chicken,
gan jjajang, sweet and sour pork,

583
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,510
ox blood soup, intestine soup,

584
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
fermented skate
with pork and kimchi.

585
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,809
Hello?

586
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,550
I sent you everything
that could be of help...

587
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,449
including Eun Jung Su's resume
and contract.

588
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,449
So please find him
as soon as possible.

589
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:21,090
Okay, bye.

590
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,559
Why did Eun Jung Su...

591
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,630
go to Secretary Jeong's house?

592
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:36,510
You should check your e-mail.

593
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,010
I was afraid of
losing the file again,

594
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:42,309
so as soon as I got my laptop back,

595
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,579
I sent it to your e-mail.

596
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,280
The file...

597
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,559
(TnT Mobile, Webmail)

598
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,360
(Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just.)

599
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:00,699
What's this?

600
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,099
"End of year bonus".

601
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:06,139
"There are no fish in clear water"?

602
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:11,070
What is all this?

603
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,639
(Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just.)

604
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,949
"Aromi"?

605
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:22,320
(May 17, 2004:
Aromi, 100,000 dollars)

606
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,449
"May, 2004".

607
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,219
"Aromi. 100,000 dollars"?

608
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,230
Who says the fish is
worth 100,000 dollars?

609
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:32,900
This isn't a platinum arowana.

610
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,030
This is a golden arowana.

611
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,070
What's going on?

612
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,670
If this is...

613
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:42,500
what I think it is...

614
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:45,739
(Gi Dae Ju)

615
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
Dae Ju?

616
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,820
Why is Dae Ju's name in this file?

617
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:00,789
He definitely told me
that he doesn't know anything.

618
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:28,349
If he said he doesn't know anything,

619
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,590
I should believe him.

620
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,199
Come in.

621
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:54,980
Director Do.

622
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,949
I'm here for next week's meeting
with the entire Media Department.

623
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,250
Ms. Lee, right?

624
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,590
Yes, I came to check your schedule
for next week...

625
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,659
because Gal Hee's
on vacation right now.

626
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:08,920
Just a second.

627
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:13,829
Let's see.

628
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,099
(Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just.)

629
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,130
Tuesday works for me.

630
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,269
Okay, I'll get back to you
after I check.

631
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,139
Ms. Lee.

632
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:26,739
Yes?

633
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:30,449
What's Dae Ju's schedule
for the rest of the day?

634
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,780
He has a meeting soon
with the PR Team.

635
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,289
(A Lover's Concerto,
Roman Philharmonic Orchestra)

636
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,960
This concert is today.

637
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,260
I didn't know
it was Wednesday already.

638
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:49,230
You should hurry up and get ready.

639
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,900
You'll get stuck in traffic
if you leave during rush hour.

640
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,469
Plus, you don't even have
a driver right now.

641
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,269
Okay.

642
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,190
Do you remember
that I promised to do...

643
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,289
whatever I could...

644
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,289
to protect Dae Ju?

645
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,829
I didn't know
it'd be so challenging...

646
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,869
to keep that promise.

647
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:41,719
Yes, Ms. Lee?

648
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:45,889
Hey, can you come see me...

649
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,320
at the Driver's Lounge
a little later?

650
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:49,960
I'd like...

651
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:54,329
to introduce you to a gathering.

652
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:59,739
I'm sorry, but I have
an appointment right now.

653
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,199
It doesn't matter.
You can come late.

654
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,610
You'll see a lot of familiar faces
once you come.

655
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,340
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

656
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,780
Okay, I'll be there.

657
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,329
(Arts Center)

658
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,150
All right.

659
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:48,050
Once we meet here tonight,

660
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,489
I'll officially ask her out.

661
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,920
I'm going to tell her that.

662
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,070
Is Secretary Jeong doing fine?

663
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,809
Is the security system
working all right?

664
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,050
This is my first time
to get flowers from someone.

665
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:30,929
The flowers must've
shriveled up by now.

666
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:52,920
What are you doing out here?

667
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,219
I didn't even call you.
Why did you show up again?

668
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,690
Why?

669
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,289
Now that you're here, are you afraid
he'd want to date you?

670
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm not afraid.

671
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,800
If Director Do wants to date me,

672
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:14,199
I will readily say yes...

673
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,409
with a big smile.

674
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,349
It's my fault that I lied to him.

675
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,079
I should do what
President Park tells me to do.

676
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:30,989
I can do it.

677
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:32,719
What if...

678
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,059
he doesn't want to date you?

679
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:42,760
No.

680
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,369
I won't expect
anything like that anymore.

681
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:49,869
I should get going.

682
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,809
I don't want to keep
my boss waiting.

683
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:11,829
Don't expect anything.

684
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,230
Don't expect anything.

685
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:19,429
Don't expect anything from him.

686
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,000
Attention.

687
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,909
In the preview today,
there will be a guy...

688
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:38,880
who's very important...

689
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,320
in Veronica Park's life.

690
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,489
So I will have to look...

691
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,719
even more attractive
than I did yesterday.

692
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:51,659
So I can catch his eyes...

693
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,429
and lips at the same time. Okay?

694
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:56,570
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

695
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:10,210
My gosh.

696
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:12,710
You're here, President Park.

697
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,250
I can't do this.

698
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:39,369
Aren't you supposed to
be at the Arts Center today?

699
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,980
I hate her so much.

700
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:47,079
Director Do was waiting
for Veronica Park...

701
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,420
with a bouquet of flowers.

702
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:53,389
I hate him waiting for her.

703
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,460
I also hate the woman
who stole him away from me.

704
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,260
Do you know...

705
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,170
that you're talking
about yourself now?

706
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,570
The woman who took
Director Do away from you...

707
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,210
is eventually you.

708
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:21,320
I don't even know
what this is all about.

709
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,760
Who am I?

710
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,860
Who is this woman I hate?

711
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,369
Do you get it now?

712
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,269
Why this was
a severe punishment for you?

713
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:48,280
Yes.

714
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:51,780
I'm sorry, President Park.

715
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,920
I have to end this today.

716
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,920
I'll tell him the truth
even if we'll have to cut ties.

717
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,059
I don't care if
my life will end today,

718
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,099
but I have to end this today.

719
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,559
I can't do this anymore.

720
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,599
Please.

721
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:16,739
Please let me tell him everything.

722
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,139
Okay.

723
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,119
I guess you've been punished enough.

724
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:32,090
But...

725
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,989
what do we do?

726
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:43,030
If I tell you about this,

727
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,269
you won't...

728
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:49,039
want to end this just yet.

729
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,610
Excuse me, President Park.

730
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,480
You're running late.
You should leave now.

731
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,690
Tell me what?

732
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:11,329
Let's go.

733
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:16,260
Whatever you choose, you still
need to go back to the Art Center.

734
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:27,739
Please enter if you are here
for the 7pm concert.

735
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,309
The concert will begin
in a few minutes.

736
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:34,849
Entrance is not allowed
once the concert has begun.

737
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:36,719
Is she coming late?

738
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:48,900
Can't you hurry?

739
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:53,639
Tell me what it is.

740
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,969
(Boss)

741
00:53:57,809 --> 00:53:58,909
Answer it.

742
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,139
Tell me first.

743
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,110
Answer the phone first.

744
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,429
What was that sound?

745
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,900
Hello? President Park?

746
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,900
President Park?

747
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,679
(New Members)

748
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:36,880
The new member must
be Gal Hee, right?

749
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:41,019
If Gal Hee joins us,
do we need a new slogan?

750
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,550
I like the slogan we have now.

751
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:45,820
Me too.

752
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:47,559
It is named after our names.

753
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:51,260
And it's a quote by
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

754
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,860
"Justice prevails in the end."

755
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,469
I think we're ready.

756
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:00,800
Shall we start by shouting
the slogan as always?

757
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,599
- Yes, Ms. Lee.
- Yes, Ms. Lee.

758
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:04,010
- Humans.
- Humans.

759
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,210
- Is.
- Is.

760
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,570
- Unfair.
- Unfair.

761
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,739
- But.
- But.

762
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:08,840
- The deities.
- The deities.

763
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,980
- Are.
- Are.

764
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,980

00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:22,289
Thank you.

(Boss)

768
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,369
Hello?

769
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,369
Is this President Park's phone?

770
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:39,670
What? She had another phone?

771
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,239
Yes.

772
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,380
I was just talking to her...

773
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:47,449
and I heard a strange sound
over the phone.

774
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,380
Well, actually...

775
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,820
She had a car accident.

776
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:53,789
Pardon?

777
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:55,659
How?

778
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:57,630
Is she hurt badly?

779
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,789
She was already late,

780
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:02,500
but one of her former secretaries
made a surprise visit,

781
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,199
and they were riding together.

782
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:06,400
Does...

783
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:11,869
that secretary's name happen to be
Jeong Gal Hee?

784
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:13,980
Yes, it is.

785
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
Where are they now?

786
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:41,739
They are both hospitalized
in Sangmo Hospital.

787
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,639
President Park had her neck injured,
so she's in the neurosurgery ward.

788
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:47,739
Secretary Jeong had her arm injured,
so she's in the orthopedics ward.

789
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:53,179
If you want me to forget about it...

790
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:55,980
and move on, I will do that.

791
00:56:56,849 --> 00:56:59,289
So please don't feel bad for me.

792
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:03,929
It is true.

793
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,199
I like you so much to the point...

794

(Orthopedics ward)

796
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,440
I was torn between neurosurgery...

797
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,440
and orthopedics.

798
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:22,380
Don't think about to whom
your heart is going to,

799
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,349
but think of what your heart
was like in the beginning.

800
00:57:56,949 --> 00:57:58,849
- Is there a patient named...
- I saw her...

801
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:00,250
going to the rooftop.

802
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320

(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

807
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:42,820
While running, I realized...

808
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:46,420
why I fell in love with her
in the beginning.

809

Jeong Gal Hee, I think it's you.

810
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,690

811

This will be my last time
playing her.

- Don't you like peanuts?

Why?
