1
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,450
You don't need to do that.

2
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,329
Armand de Brignac Blanc de Blancs.

3
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,140
It's the wine you always ordered,
but never got to try.

4
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,510
I ordered it for you today.

5
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,769
I would like to introduce
myself again.

6
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,439
My name is Jeong Gal Hee.

7
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:43,640
My father passed away when I was 12,
and my mother when I was 19.

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,049
I don't have money and parents.
I don't have much things,

9
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,549
but I have a brother and sister
who are always supportive of me.

10
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,750
At work, I have fellow secretaries
whom I can count on.

11
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,390
And I'm working for a great boss,

12
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,760
who accepts me warts and all.

13
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:06,930
I see.

14
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:09,770
So that's you.

15
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,099
You know,

16
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,340
I'm Do Min Ik.

17
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,409
I'm a man who is crazily
in love with you.

18
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,050
Let's have a toast.

19
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,490
To what?

20
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,960
To Jeong Gal Hee and Do Min Ik's...

21
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,659
first encounter.

22
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,280
- What's going on?
- What happened?

23
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:53,650
"Leakage of
confidential information"?

24
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:55,879
"TnT Mobile announces..."

25
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,020
"to refer all full-time
and dispatched employees..."

26
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,219
"who were involved with the
subversive group called Euldoguk..."

27
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,520
"to the disciplinary committee
and terminate their contracts."

28
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,889
Oh, no.

29
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,030
"Disciplinary action will be taken
against Gi Dae Ju and Lee Eul Wang."

30
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,229
"Lee Eul Wang formed the
subversive group called Euldoguk,"

31
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:13,699
- Yes, Ri Ra.
- "and caused a disorder."

32
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,870
"Director Gi Dae Ju cooperated
with her in founding Euldoguk."

33
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,969
"The dispatch workers that
joined Euldoguk disclosed..."

34
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,770
"confidential business information,"

35
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,039
"besmirching the company's
name and reputation."

36
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,979
"We hereby announce that their
dispatch contracts are terminated."

37
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:27,580
Myung Jung!

38
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:29,780
What should we do?

39
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:50,500
Hey, what do we do now?

40
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,500
If you don't fire them, I will
expose all commercial bribery...

41
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,840
and violations of
the anti-graft law you committed.

42
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,939
If bribery can be so easily proved,

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,650
I wouldn't be where I am now.

44
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,650
And about the anti-graft law,
thankfully, you guys covered for...

45
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,319
most cases.

46
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,990
If I can't bring you to justice
by law, I will expose it on media.

47
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,960
There are so many people
in this world...

48
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,330
who embezzled much more money
than me.

49
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,930
Try. Let's see if they will write
a single article about a man...

50
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,459
who received a painting
and some money.

51
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,100
It's dusty.

52
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,709
When the ledger is disclosed,
you'll get in trouble too.

53
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,439
So let's just wrap it up here.

54
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,850
You should be thankful that I didn't
charge you for embezzlement.

55
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,600
You don't need to feel anxious
at all anymore. It's all over.

56
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,620
Jeong Gal Hee.
Could you take a day off too?

57
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,800
The weather is nice today.
Let's go on a picnic with Nam Hee.

58
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,870
On a sunny day like today,

59
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,810
I don't want to go on a picnic.

60
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,709
I want to go to work.

61
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,879
Let's go to work, baby.

62
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,720
Who is it?

63
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,889
What brings you
all the way to my place, sir?

64
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,560
Who is he?

65
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,069
She's my sister, Jeong Nam Hee.

66
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,769
Hello, I'm Do Min Ik.

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,569
I'll go get my bag.

68
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,810
Do I look like I'm dressed for work?

69
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,850
Are you working out of office today?

70
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,019
I'm going on a date. A date.

71
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,420
What?
Are you going out with your boss?

72
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,420
A date?

73
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,259
What about work?

74
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,930
Take a day off.
Ask your boss right now.

75
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,300
How?

76
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,730
"I would like to take
a day off today"?

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,029
Request accepted.

78
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,110
You should have told me
if we were going on a date.

79
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,810
My hair is all messy
and I didn't even put on makeup.

80
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:48,550
You know, your boss...

81
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,279
can't see faces.

82
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,720
Still...

83
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,389
It's our first date.

84
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,189
I want to look pretty...

85
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,790
and nice.

86
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,899
Then I will be waiting in the car.

87
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,800
Come when you're ready.

88
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:08,629
Okay.

89
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

90
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,639
Sir.

91
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,910
Well.

92
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,240
You look great.

93
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,949
Do I?

94
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,620
All I did was take off the glasses.

95
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,620
Why did you bring that?

96
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,850
You should wear whatever you want
on a day like this today.

97
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,790
You said you would like to have
at least one person you can see.

98
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:12,029
Same for me. Even if
you can't recognize all others,

99
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:15,199
I want you to recognize me at least.

100
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,639
Do you remember the concert...

101
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,139
we were supposed to go together?

102
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,279
I was thinking about
going there today with you.

103
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,079
Okay. I'll buy the tickets.

104
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:32,549
I already did.

105
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,419
I just asked
in case you wouldn't like it.

106
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,190
Well.

107
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,990
With you, I'm okay with anything.

108
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,139
Get in, sir.

109
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,379
Get in, Ms. Jeong Gal Hee.

110
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,759
What a nice car you have.

111
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,929
Where are you two going?

112
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,669
Well, just...

113
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,500
Nam Hee, don't interrupt their date.

114
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,539
I apologize, sir.

115
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,840
Don't mind people like us...

116
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:30,269
and keep on dating. Bye.

117
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,490
My goodness. The able-bodied
people are riding a great car,

118
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,190
and I, a blind person, am walking.

119
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,389
Oh, my. Poor you.

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,474
I'm sorry, Director Do.

121
00:09:58,734 --> 00:09:59,787
No need for that.

122
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:01,290
They don't have a car.

123
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,298
I should send them back.

124
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:05,655
Where should I send you?

125
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:09,870
Well, if possible, please send us to the beach.

126
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,580
The beach?

127
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,750
We're supposed to go watch a show.

128
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:15,519
Nam Hee, you know
where I'm coming from, right?

129
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,860
Because I'm blind,
the only thing I can enjoy...

130
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,789
is to get some fresh air
once in a while.

131
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,700
She's practically
head over heels for him.

132
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,830
So I'm sure she doesn't
care much about you.

133
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,740
Nam Hee, do you think
you have the right to say that?

134
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,370
I'll... I'll take you there.

135
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,470
It's going to take ages
to go to the beach.

136
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,279
Do you know how much I waited
to go on a date with you?

137
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,610
I really want it to be
just the two of us today.

138
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,549
Then let's...

139
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,549
drop them off at the beach first.

140
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,289
Then we can go on a date.

141
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,659
We can have grilled clams
like we did last time...

142
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:57,460
and go to a pretty cafe.

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,070
That sounds nice.

144
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,820
This feels nice.

145
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:32,529
Catch me if you can!

146
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Jung Hee!

147
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,000
- Jung Hee!
- We were supposed to go on a date.

148
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,649
- Jung Hee!
- Catch me if you can!

149
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,419
I thought it was just going to be
me and you.

150
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,889
What if he ends up drowning?

151
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,789
Let's spend
a bit more time with him.

152
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,830
Instead, let's have dinner
without them.

153
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,029
Now is the time.

154
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:07,129
Nam Hee will take care of him.

155
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:08,629
- We should leave right now.
- Now?

156
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,070
- Hurry up.
- But...

157
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:53,139
Why did you suddenly
wear heels today?

158
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:01,220
There we go.

159
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,919
Can I ask you something?

160
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,360
I think I'm lost.

161
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,429
Can you please help me look
for my sister and her boyfriend?

162
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,830
I'm sure they were here
up until a while ago.

163
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,769
We were playing catch.

164
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,730
Weren't we supposed to have dinner
by ourselves?

165
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,090
Well...

166
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,629
What could I do? He suddenly became
hungry after all the running.

167
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,570
We should let him eat first.

168
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,110
Jung Hee.

169
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,110
Can you see by any chance?

170
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,750
How is it that you always grab
the right one?

171
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,950
I don't know.

172
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,720
I also feel as if I can see stuff
right now.

173
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,330
You're done eating, right?
Let's get going now.

174
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,330
Let's go.

175
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,070
Oh, okay.

176
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,299
Nam Hee, I haven't had
Korean beef...

177
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,909
ever since the 2010
South African World Cup.

178
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,070
What about you?

179
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,080
I've never eaten Korean beef
in my entire life.

180
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:36,179
I've only tried American
and Australian beef.

181
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,480
I didn't even know
there were cows in Korea.

182
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,990
I thought frozen meat was
the only kind of meat that existed.

183
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,789
I didn't know
there was refrigerated meat as well.

184
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,889
Director Do, did you know this?

185
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,029
The IMF crisis had
no major effect on our family...

186
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,860
because we were already so poor.

187
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,639
Ma'am, three more portions, please.

188
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,769
Okay.

189
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:02,840
Director Do.

190
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,549
Oh, okay...

191
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,279
No, you can't.
If you accept that drink,

192
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,149
we'll never be able
to say goodbye to them.

193
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,720
Oh, right.

194
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,029
You probably only drank expensive
alcohol throughout your entire life.

195
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:24,230
A shot of soju given to you
by a blind man must mean nothing.

196
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,370
I'll drink it.

197
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,919
(Bed and Breakfast)

198
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,330
I can't let you sleep
at a place like this.

199
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:01,129
That's why you shouldn't have
drank that shot of soju.

200
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,870
You eventually drank, too.

201
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,409
I really don't think this is right.

202
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:12,509
How about we wait
until I sober up...

203
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:13,909
so I can drive you back to Seoul?

204
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:16,549
This is why you should've
reserved a place beforehand.

205
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:18,620
It's not easy to get a room
around here without reservations.

206
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,519
Since you're a director,

207
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,419
I thought we'd get to sleep
at a six-star hotel.

208
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,960
But you're the one who suddenly
asked me to drive you here.

209
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,990
I can't tell if it's
a six-star hotel or a shabby motel.

210
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,730
It's nice that I'm blind.

211
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:39,570
This is actually for the better.

212
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,309
What?

213
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:44,110
Let's hurry up and put them to bed.

214
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,879
Then it'll be just the two of us...

215
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,220
at this very hour.

216
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,500
Okay, get ready and shoot.

217
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,430
(Gwangbak Building)

218
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,839
You won Gwangbak Building
that's located near Gangnam Station.

219
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,769
What's this?

220
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,839
Well, the thing is,

221
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,509
I just wanted to repay you...

222
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,279
for having spent an amazing night
with me last night.

223
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,150
And think about the stuff I own.

224
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,119
All I have are buildings and money.

225
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:35,289
So I wanted to make a small gesture
by giving you a building.

226
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:40,259
What I want is the building owner,
not the building.

227
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,799
And the amazing time
we spent last night was for myself,

228
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,500
not you.

229
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,039
My gosh, this isn't fair.
If you keep doing this,

230
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,480
you'll only make me want
to give you more stuff.

231
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,150
What should I do for you?
What do you want?

232
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,019
You don't have a car, do you?
Would you like a car?

233
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,450
Pick one. A sedan, sports car,
or an SUV.

234
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,720
We were able to spend
an amazing night last night...

235
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,829
thanks to all the bike rides
that strengthened my thighs.

236
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,230
Are you willing to say goodbye
to these thighs?

237
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No, not at all.

238
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,099
I wonder...

239
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,599
why I become so thoughtless
when I'm with you.

240
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,150
Hey, Eul Wang.

241
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,380
"Eul Wang"?

242
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,089
I see. I'm not surprised.

243
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,019
Okay, I'll be right there.

244
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,259
Hey, Mr. Park.

245
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:47,630
I just sent you
the news release via email.

246
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,130
Please write an article for me.

247
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:53,670
(I request the withdrawal
of the employees' unfair dismissal.)

248
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,670
It won't be easy, Eul Wang.

249
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,680
President Sim made it seem like you
were involved to get you punished.

250
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,450
But you'll be fine.

251
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,480
It's not like you were actually
involved in this.

252
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,950
Ms. Lee!

253
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,789
I told you to act like you guys had
nothing to do with this at work.

254
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,190
I'll do whatever I can to prevent
you all from getting fired.

255
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,190
- No.
- We're just going to get fired.

256
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,029
What?

257
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,000
Even if I get the job back,

258
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,329
my contract ends in three months.

259
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,799
I'll be anxious about getting fired
sooner or later anyway.

260
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,000
Gosh, I'm so sick and tired
of living this way.

261
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,670
The company changes subcontractors
every year to sign an illegal deal.

262
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,180
And it's because they don't want to
make us become full-time employees.

263
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,549
Even if we're reinstated,
if things don't change,

264
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,079
we will still be ephemeral.

265
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,819
So what? You will
just give up like this?

266
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:40,849
No.

267
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,349
We want to challenge ourselves.

268
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,250
Even if we get fired,

269
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,190
we will proclaim
why we did such a thing...

270
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,960
so people like us
will be treated properly.

271
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,740
(A mass sit-in demonstration
requesting...)

272
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:10,579
(dispatch-workers to be transferred
as full-time workers.)

273
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:50,819
Secretary Jeong.

274
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,029
Yes, Director Do.

275
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:04,940
You shouldn't fall asleep.

276
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,740
I'm sorry, Director Do.

277
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,309
Gosh, you're sorry?

278
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,650
She said it'd be just the two of us
after they fall asleep.

279
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,650
Where are you?
Why are you calling me at this hour?

280
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,079
I'm sorry, Mom.

281
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,289
I'm sorry for not telling you
about my illness before.

282
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,660
I'm not...

283
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,490
going to pity you for your illness.

284
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,900
So don't make a fuss about it.

285
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,569
Just make sure
to become the president.

286
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:45,900
Sure.

287
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,940
Don't worry about it
and make me samgyetang.

288
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,279
And...

289
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,549
let's go...

290
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:59,920
to a beach together sometime.

291
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,119
You and me.

292
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,720
And probably Uncle if he wants.

293
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,299
Good night then.

294
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,470
You're up.

295
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,539
So it's finally...

296
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,009
just the two of us.

297
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:29,880
I guess so.

298
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:36,420
What?

299
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,589
Nothing.

300
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,990
I just want to see you.

301
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,630
Dae Ju saw it.
Even Veronica Park saw it too.

302
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm the only one who hasn't seen it.

303
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,029
The way you look at me.

304
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,170
I want to show it to you too.

305
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,309
How I look at you now.

306
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,579
Oh, right. Did I
tell you this before?

307
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,150
I've...

308
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,920
seen your face before.

309
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,619
You saw my face?
Even the expressions on my face?

310
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:13,089
Yes.

311
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:14,960
But...

312
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,430
it's not like it works every time.

313
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:25,369
My blood pressure should shoot up,
and my heart should...

314
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:27,640
pound so hard.

315
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:31,579
What makes
your blood pressure go up?

316
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,309
Well...

317
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:38,150
Even medical compression
stockings didn't work.

318
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,220
But strangely, when I...

319
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:45,289
touch some part of your body,

320
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,289
my blood pressure...

321
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,190
surges up.

322
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,369
Some part of my body?

323
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,000
Just like when we were
under the excavator.

324
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:04,170
When we were sticking close.

325
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,480
Then...

326
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,049
what should we do now?

327
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,519
Like this?

328
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,960
How do you feel?

329
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,369
Can you see me?

330
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,799
No.

331
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,039
Not at all.

332
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,480
I guess...

333
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,710
I should touch more parts
of your body.

334
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,650
What about now?

335
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,720
This is strange.

336
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:25,660
Why isn't it working?

337
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:27,759
I guess...

338
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:31,089
this isn't...

339
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,900
good enough.

340
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:39,539
Then how far
are we supposed to go?

341
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,400
It's actually...

342
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,339
all up to you.

343
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,680
How far can you go?

344
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,880
Well... I mean...

345
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,619
We should try everything we can...

346
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:59,220
to make you see my face,

347
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,230
Everything we can?

348
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,529
For your information,

349
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,400
these are my lips.

350
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,980
What are you thinking about now?

351
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,579
I was just thinking about
putting my arm...

352
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,920
around your shoulders.

353
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,190
Oh, right.

354
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:35,660
I see.

355
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,529
That's what it is.

356
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,829
But don't you think there's
something wrong with the order?

357
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,470
We just held hands and cuddled.

358
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,839
Why would you put your arm
around my shoulders after that?

359
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,490
If I opened my eyes
at that moment,

360
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,190
would I have seen your face?

361
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,890
But I didn't want to open my eyes...

362
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,759
at that moment.

363
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,130
Because the lips I've longed for...

364
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:53,839
and the person I've wanted...

365
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,769
was you after all.

366
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,240
And I could know it was you
without seeing you.

367
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,950
Girls.

368
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,819
When I said we should hold a sit-in,
I didn't mean a hunger strike.

369
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,420
What about a tonsure strike instead?

370
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:12,819
My hair will grow again,

371
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:15,930
but I can't undo
the meals I skipped.

372
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:19,259
I'm going to put it on now,
so swallow what's in your mouth.

373
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,569
Now!

374
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,069
(Hunger strike, Day 1)

375
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:37,450
Would you like to have dinner
with me after work?

376
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,119
What about the restaurant
we went before?

377
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,990
I would love to.

378
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,990
(We do not want a corrupt owner.
Do not pass down the company.)

379
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,630
Ms. Lee.

380
00:29:58,369 --> 00:29:59,440
You guys...

381
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:03,210
What are you doing here?

382
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:06,210
(Dispatch workers are workers too!
Guarantee our basic labor rights!)

383
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:09,680
I would love to.

384
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,089
Sir.

385
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,069
It's Eun Jung Su.

386
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,170
I came to apologize.

387
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:53,089
You think I'm an idiot? Hey!

388
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:55,630
Hey!

389
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,490
As you can see,

390
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,660
I got hurt while working, and yet
didn't get any compensation.

391
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,700
Ms. Lee gave me the compensation
that the company didn't give me,

392
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,039
and I was just looking
for the ledger.

393
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,569
I didn't mean to harm you at first.

394
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,250
You heard it from President Sim...

395
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,549
that Mr. Eun was once
President Sim's driver, right?

396
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:22,119
So it's my uncle...

397
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,519
that made you like that.

398
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,630
There he is.

399
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,700
They're the police. I called them.

400
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,339
I know nothing I say
can make up for what I did,

401
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,170
but I wanted to apologize to you
in person...

402
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,140
before I turned myself in.

403
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,589
I'm truly sorry for what I did.

404
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,789
Director Do.

405
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:03,029
Hands.

406
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,099
You have the right to remain silent,
and to hire an attorney.

407
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,500
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in court.

408
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,309
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

409
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,019
All this time,

410
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,059
you knew Director Do couldn't see
people's faces?

411
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:39,500
You all knew it
and pretended you didn't?

412
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,529
We're sorry.

413
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,099
We heard about it only recently.

414
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,680
Sir, I'm Lee Eul Wang.

415
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,250
You met Mr. Eun, right?

416
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,059
I'm the one who committed
something unforgivable.

417
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,559
So you should hate me only.

418
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,829
Please forgive all the others.

419
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,609
Did you really have to do all that?

420
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,339
I wanted to compensate for them.

421
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,750
Dae Ju's mother died
to save your father's fish.

422
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,450
Eun Jung Su was used and then
was abandoned by your uncle.

423
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,559
If I didn't do this, they would have
never received any compensation.

424
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,090
Sir.

425
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,239
Sir.

426
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,579
What is it?

427
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,659
Are you going to say
I should forgive them too?

428
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,230
I'm not going to forgive them.

429
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,630
They have no idea...

430
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,369
what I see when I see people.

431
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,639
Mr. Eun made me like this.

432
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,440
My uncle made Mr. Eun like that.

433
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:08,909
Secretary Lee started all this.

434
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,050
And my father.

435
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,150
I hate all of them...

436
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,260
and I will resent them
for the rest of my life.

437
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:21,090
Okay.

438
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,429
Do resent them.

439
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,099
I will resent them with you.

440
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,800
I will be hating them with you.

441
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:34,769
So hate them as much as you like...

442
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,340
until you feel better.

443
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,539
We want compensation
from the evil corporation!

444
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:12,480
- We want compensation!
- We want compensation!

445
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,309
Make the dispatched workers
full-time employees!

446
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,079
We want job security!

447
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,349
- We want job security!
- We want job security!

448
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:22,320
Dispatch workers are workers too!
Guarantee our basic labor rights!

449
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:26,489
Why are you back?
I thought you wouldn't come back.

450
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:29,090
- Evil corporation out!
- Evil corporation out!

451
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,630
I'm sorry about earlier.

452
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,659
I lost it before I knew.

453
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:35,460
(Dispatch workers are workers too!
Guarantee our basic labor rights!)

454
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,969
We're the ones who are sorry.

455
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,440
If we knew we would all get fired,
we would have told you sooner.

456
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:45,039
At least you're not fired.
That's a good thing.

457
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,909
You said you signed a contract
directly with Director Do, right?

458
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,880
When does the contract expire?

459
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:54,019
Well...

460
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,719
It's written that it will expire
when the employee wants, but...

461
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,760
That's great.

462
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:04,630
That means you will never be fired.

463
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:08,329
Come to think about it,
your luck turned around.

464
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,300
Not so long ago you got fired
and made a fuss,

465
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,699
saying you would kill your boss.

466
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,150
Yes, sir.

467
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,320
Dinner?

468
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,590
(Hunger strike, Day 1)

469
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,230
Okay.

470
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:39,699
Go ahead.

471
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:42,869
You hate keeping your boss waiting.

472
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,539
You should go.
Director Do must be pretty upset.

473
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,809
You should go comfort him.

474
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,389
That's great.

475
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:05,889
That means you will never be fired.

476
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:11,059
What's wrong?

477
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,230
You don't like the food?

478
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:14,800
That's not it.

479
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,630
Then...

480
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,340
Try this.

481
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,079
Come to think about it,
your luck turned around.

482
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,889
Why aren't you eating?

483
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:40,789
Well...

484
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,369
I promised to hate them with you,
but I'm sorry.

485
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,440
I know you ended up like this
because of the ledger.

486
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,239
And the fact that you got injured
because of that...

487
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:00,539
makes me get really angry
at the other secretaries.

488
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:03,480
But...

489
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:06,750
I was the official minion
of TnT Mobile...

490
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,920
who was always anxious
about getting fired...

491
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,590
and whether or not I'll be able
to renew my contract or not.

492
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:14,690
And when I got fired,

493
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,530
the other secretaries were there
to cheer me up.

494
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,760
But right now, they all got fired
and they're starving.

495
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,500
I'm the only one...

496
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,710
I just can't seem to eat anything.

497
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
You can go.

498
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:48,920
What?

499
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,630
I can't forgive anyone...

500
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,190
including Eun Jung Su
and the secretaries.

501
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,329
But I came here
to feed you good food,

502
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,900
not to see you look so miserable.

503
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,780
I'll be here hating you guys,

504
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,980
so you can join them...

505
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,710
and hate me.

506
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,320
Can you please take a look at this?

507
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

508
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,929
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

509
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,929
Hey.

510
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,969
I think I'm seeing things...

511
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,670
now that I've been
starving for a few hours.

512
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:35,239
That person who's running.
Isn't that Gal Hee?

513
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,210
What are you doing here?
I told you to go to your boss.

514
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,349
(Hunger Strike, Day 1)

515
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:47,780
The thing is,

516
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:51,150
I was thinking about fasting
because I've gained some weight.

517
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:54,090
But then, I figured this is
the best place to do that.

518
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,590
I won't have to pay for therapy,

519
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,889
and I'll have friends
who will fast with me.

520
00:40:58,429 --> 00:41:00,699
Hey, we're not your friends.

521
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:05,800
What should I begin with?

522
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:08,969
Gal Hee.

523
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:12,139
Wear this and hand out these flyers.

524
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,340
(We denounce TnT Mobile
for its unfair business practices.)

525
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,150
(We do not want a corrupt owner.
Do not pass down the company.)

526
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,920
Hey, how will she
disrespect her boss...

527
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,650
when she can't even make him wait?

528
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,219
You don't need to help
if you feel uneasy about it.

529
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,719
We'll be fine.

530
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,179
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed...

531
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:52,449
Why isn't she answering her phone?

532
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,320
No way.

533
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:58,090
I hope she's still not outside.

534
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,789
Please sign the petition.

535
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,099
Hello, please take a look.

536
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:09,429
Hello, please have a read.
Thank you.

537
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,469
Hello, please have a read.
Thank you.

538
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,710
Director Do.

539
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,710
(We do not want a corrupt owner.
Do not pass down the company.)

540
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,250
Well...

541
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,420
Did you eat?

542
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,760
We're on a hunger strike.

543
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,599
Is that where you're sleeping?

544
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,340
I will be staying here
for the night,

545
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,840
but I'll make sure it doesn't affect
my working hours.

546
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,920
I'm sorry, Director Do.

547
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,139
It's cold.

548
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:41,119
(Working overtime endlessly!
No overtime payments!)

549
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,800
You're here already?

550
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,139
You, come in here for a moment.

551
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760
Ta-da.

552
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,030
Jokbal?

553
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,329
Come here.

554
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,809
No one's looking right now.

555
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:33,639
So have a bite before you go
to the protest.

556
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,550
No, I can't.

557
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,619
Don't be like that.

558
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:41,420
Just have one. Here.

559
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,829
This is only my second day
on a hunger strike. I can't do this.

560
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,789
The secretaries...

561
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,329
are doing this...

562
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:56,199
because they have no other way.

563
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,239
Then don't go.

564
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:03,670
Director Do.

565
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,010
You can shout and say
you want me to resign...

566
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,440
or want me dead.

567
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,880
I don't care whatever you do
out there.

568
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:13,750
But I don't like you having to
stand there on an empty stomach...

569
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:16,050
and you having to sleep in the cold
with only a cardboard box.

570
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:19,150
And I also don't like
seeing other people pity you...

571
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,519
as they walk by.

572
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,590
So...

573
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,159
just have one bite.

574
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,630
You see...

575
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,239
I may be wearing that sign
over my neck,

576
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,039
but I can't stop
feeling sorry towards you,

577
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:42,110
and it drives me nuts
because I keep thinking about you.

578
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,519
But regardless of all that,
you should make sure to eat well.

579
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,320
Don't worry about me.

580
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,090
I promise to stay healthy
until the protest is over...

581
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,389
so that you won't...

582
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:57,230
have to worry about me.

583
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,269
(Hunger Strike, Day 3)

584
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,539
What are we going to do now?

585
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:14,539
The reporters that interviewed us
haven't written any articles.

586
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,710
And President Sim doesn't seem
to care about us at all.

587
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,880
Boys, let's get rid of everything.

588
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,920
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

589
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,119
If you're sleepy,
go sleep at your house.

590
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,550
- Get out of here!
- Don't sleep here!

591
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,920
- What are you doing?
- Move!

592
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:29,789
My gosh.

593
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:31,329
- Get out of here!
- Move it!

594
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:33,599
Do you really think
this is going to change anything?

595
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,400
- Let me go.
- You're so pathetic.

596
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,869
- I said, let me go!
- What do you think...

597
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,539
Who... Who are you?

598
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:40,639
Director Do.

599
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:46,110
My goodness,
thank you for your hard work.

600
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,179
Let me tell you who I am.

601
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,090
"TnT Mobile, Media One, Director..."

602
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,460
Yes.

603
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:03,730
Do you see this?

604
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,559
"Chairman Do Wan Bae,"

605
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:09,460
"the root of all the unfair
treatment." That's my father.

606
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,869
"Sim Hae Yong,"

607
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,570
"the corrupt president."
That's my uncle.

608
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:15,599
And they're saying...

609
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,539
they don't want the company
to be passed down to a jerk.

610
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,610
And that jerk is me.

611
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:26,110
Oh, I see.
But what brings you here, sir?

612
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,219
I'll take care of this place,
so you guys should go.

613
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:33,789
But we received orders
from President Sim.

614
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:39,230
I'll explain everything to my uncle.

615
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,260
So don't worry about it
and just leave.

616
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,099
Well, I'm not exactly worried but...

617
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:46,340
- You guys can go now. Go on.
- But...

618
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,840
- Goodbye.
- Let's... Let's go.

619
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,809
- You should all say goodbye.
- Bye, sir.

620
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:51,070
Please take care of it for us.

621
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,239
We'll trust that you'll handle this.
Okay, bye.

622
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:54,440
Come on.

623
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:10,730
The CT scan isn't much different
from the last one.

624
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:13,829
Come on. Don't be like that.

625
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,900
Take a look at the ingredients
of this medicine.

626
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,530
I got this cold medicine
at a pharmacy.

627
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,340
Are you not allowed to take it
on an empty stomach?

628
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,670
How many days did she starve?

629
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:26,039
Well... Three days?

630
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:27,579
What?

631
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,309
Then make her eat something
instead of making her take medicine.

632
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:32,309
I'm asking you this
because she won't eat anything.

633
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,849
Make her eat something immediately.

634
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,889
Or at least bring her to the ER
and make her get an IV injection.

635
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,190
She doesn't want to see
a doctor either.

636
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,860
By the way,
let me ask you something.

637
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,130
Have you not seen anyone's face
again since the funeral?

638
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:54,500
Remember Dr. Park's patient
in the US?

639
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:55,940
That patient recently...

640
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,170
Someone's sick and hasn't been
eating anything now.

641
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:59,309
I don't care about seeing faces.

642
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:00,380
My gosh.

643
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,239
You're the one
who wanted to see faces,

644
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,110
begging me to help you at any cost.

645
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:06,849
The glorious advancement
of medicine? My foot.

646
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,920
There isn't one medicine
people can take on an empty stomach.

647
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:13,690
Give me that.

648
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:21,360
Why did I perform surgery
on that jerk in the first place?

649
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,969
Aren't you going to do anything
about the secretaries and drivers?

650
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:28,599
They haven't eaten
anything for three days.

651
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:30,210
I know.

652
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:32,210
It spoils the appearance of
the company. It's so annoying.

653
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:34,809
But you stopped me
from getting rid of them.

654
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,949
If you didn't violate the law
in the first place...

655
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,710
and had accidents
covered by insurance,

656
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,449
they wouldn't have done any of that.

657
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,449
You must be out of your mind.

658
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:44,550
It's them who siphoned off
the company money.

659
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,489
And what? I violated the law?

660
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,829
If you can't hire them all
immediately,

661
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,929
at least have the negotiating table
ready so they stop fasting.

662
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,659
I didn't let this happen
to negotiate with them.

663
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,300
I should step in and show how I
take care of things...

664
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:00,769
so I can have the directors
take my side.

665
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:03,840
You will leave them like that
just to take the president position?

666
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,309
Is there another way?

667
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:07,239
Despite your illness,

668
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,949
I'm still on the brink
of losing my position.

669
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:18,989
(Gwangbak Building)

670
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:22,960
Hello, Mother.

671
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:25,429
You're here.

672
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:27,929
Why did you want to see me here?

673
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:31,130
Do you see this building?

674
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,110
It's Gwangbak Building which is
in President Park's name.

675
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:40,579
I knew it. You're an ambitious guy.

676
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:44,309
You already know
all about our property.

677
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:46,050
What about this building?

678
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,219
I'll just...

679
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:53,820
I was going to send you
to your doom.

680
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,230
But I thought I might end up
losing all my money.

681
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,960
I'll give you this building...

682
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,800
if you stay away from my daughter.

683
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,400
I won't stay away from her
just for a building.

684
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,840
I can't give you two buildings!

685
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:12,010
I didn't tell you this.

686
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:15,340
I only buy things that I can use
for more than 10 years.

687
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:17,949
And I only meet with women whom I'll
keep in touch, even after I die.

688
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:22,150
You're just a toy for my daughter.

689
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,849
If that's the case,

690
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,090
I'll be so happy.

691
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,989
She will smile and feel happy
when she sees me.

692
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:34,360
Only if I can live as her toy
for the rest of my life...

693
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,920
I heard the secretaries
are being a headache.

694
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:06,360
What is this for?

695
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,559
You sounded so confident,
so I cooked it in advance.

696
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,869
Eat this and make sure
to become the president.

697
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,380
What are you waiting for?

698
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:32,849
I'm sorry, but I can't eat this.

699
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,690
You said you wanted
to eat this samgyetang for days.

700
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:37,289
I know.

701
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,429
I really...

702
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,929
wanted to eat your samgyetang
cooked just for me...

703
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:46,800
after 20 years.

704
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:51,909
I'm sorry.

705
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,579
I'm so sorry, Mom.

706
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:12,690
(Internal medicine)

707
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:26,039
I should step in
and take care of things...

708
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:28,409
so I can have the directors
take my side.

709
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,849
Hey, it's me. Where are you?

710
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,530
What's the matter? Why did you
want to see me here?

711
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:55,239
I'm sorry I didn't call you sooner
after hearing about your mom.

712
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,909
I just had a lot on my mind.

713
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:02,239
I didn't call you for the same
reason. I'm sorry about that.

714
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:05,010
If it weren't for me,

715
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,780
Ms. Lee wouldn't
have done such a thing.

716
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,019
And you...

717
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:12,519
wouldn't have fallen ill like that.

718
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:13,590
You lunatic.

719
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:16,860
How could you come to the meeting
to still support me...

720
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:19,289
when you heard how your mom died?

721
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:23,159
I still hate your father.
Don't worry.

722
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:28,670
Which one of you is it for?

723
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:32,039
Me?

724
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,909
I want to buy...

725
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,650
my wife a suit.

726
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,449
One moment, please.

727
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,250
You're the lunatic.

728
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,219
Why would I need a suit
when I'm unemployed?

729
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,989
You will need a suit from now on.

730
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,630
Dae Ju.

731
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,500
I'm trying to plan something.

732
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:57,000
And I need your help.

(Application for
President of TnT Mobile)

What is this?

735
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,110
I took it back
from the executive office.

736
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,550
What are you doing?

737
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:19,190
I'll withdraw my application
for president.

738
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,690
What?

739
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,730
I will knock myself out for you.

740
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:28,230
If you withdraw your candidacy,
I'll be the sole candidate.

741
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,469
Do you expect me to believe that?

742
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,269
I have one condition.

743
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,139
I want to go home.

744
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:42,280
I miss my mom.

745
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:46,750
I want to sleep.

746
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,519

What are you doing here?

750
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,150
I want to know
what you want to eat most.

751
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:28,960
Why do you ask?

752
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,789
Jokbal? Pizza?

753
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,730
I want to eat them all.

754
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:36,030
What about chicken and hamburgers?

755
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:37,929
That sounds great.

756
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,039
No. I'm not eating, Director Do.

757
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:46,780
Fine.

758
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,639
I know you want to eat them all,

759
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:53,079
but you haven't eaten for
three days. You should eat porridge.

760
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,920
Stand up.

and let's go eat some porridge.

Director Do, you're putting me
in an awkward situation.

764
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,469
You guys should go home too.

765
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:16,269
The company will have
the negotiation table for you.

766
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,969
You can go home
and have some food now.

767
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:22,010
What do you mean, Director Do?

768
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:24,750
I talked to President Sim.

769
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,179
There will be
an announcement tomorrow.

770
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:28,449
He will tell you
the details himself.

Are you that glad?

777
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,849
Yes. I'm so happy.

778
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,659
Now we can work without
worrying about getting fired.

779
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,130
And now I can eat everything I want.

780
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:16,030
But the best thing is...

781
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:20,099
that I'll be the president's
secretary in a few days.

782
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,079
Why are you staring at me like that?

783
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:30,179
What?

784
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,619
I'm just happy
to see you feel happy.

785
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:40,789
I really wish you can see
my face right now.

786
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,489
You should see how happy I am.

787
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,730
Then...

788
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,929
Could you show me
how happy you are...

789
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:52,599
by giving me a tight hug?
