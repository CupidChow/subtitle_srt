1
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:43,079
(One day before
TnT Mobile stockholders' meeting)

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,090
Dear my brother,

3
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,219
I don't know how to describe
my life in the suite room here.

4
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:55,630
Living an easeful life
must change one's face.

5
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,200
My eyes shine...

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,570
and my skin is glossy.

7
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,069
I'm doing great,
so make sure not to skip meals.

8
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,180
Life in a suite room must be
beyond imagination, as I assumed.

9
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,689
Who is it?

10
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,980
How strange. Whenever I'm back home,
there's always something...

11
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,480
dropped on the floor.

12
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,950
Could it be a thief?

13
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,280
No way.

14
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,519
If the thief has eyes,

15
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,920
he should be able to see
how miserable this place is.

16
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:30,460
Oh, my goodness!

17
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,889
I said I would swim for
just 30 minutes and go back.

18
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,229
I found something amazing
and I couldn't wait.

19
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,930
Did you stay up all night
looking for that alone?

20
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,599
Including this,
I found five in total.

21
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,699
I'm not sure
if that's enough though.

22
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,669
Let me see.

23
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,639
What are you doing?

24
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,080
It's just that your swimming suit
looks a bit too small.

25
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,879
Of course swimming suits are small.

26
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,490
Oh, dear. Put this on at least.

27
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,060
Stay away from my son, right now!

28
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,099
Ma'am.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your words and
this situation just now...

30
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,669
can be misleading in many ways.

31
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,180
Are you saying
you can't stay away from him?

32
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,879
What I'm going to say might sound
misleading in many ways too,

33
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,849
but our relationship is...

34
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,550
quite serious. We can't separate
just because you tell us to.

35
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,189
When you guys were seven,

36
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,289
you followed Secretary Choi
and constantly came to my house.

37
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,729
I should have separated
you two then already.

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,599
Then I wouldn't have had to see you
raising your hand at the meeting.

39
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,900
I just realized why this situation
felt familiar to me.

40
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,500
Something similar to this happened
when I was seven.

41
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,009
That's why I'm going to
take care of it properly this time.

42
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,080
If water doesn't work...

43
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,050
Nothing works better than this.

44
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,020
This actually looks very misleading.

45
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,319
Think of it as severance pay
and go travel with this money.

46
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:15,360
After this stockholders' meeting,
quit the boarder and the company.

47
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,600
You're shameless, but not brainless.
I'm sure you got what I mean.

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,829
I have to go.

49
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,579
Who is it?

50
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,649
Director Gi.

51
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:37,720
Secretary Jeong.

52
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,920
What happened to your face?

53
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,120
Come in.

54
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,259
You haven't had coffee, have you?

55
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,769
The cup is supposed to be here.

56
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,399
What's with this messy room?

57
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,139
Are you okay?

58
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,579
I would rather not drink coffee.

59
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:06,810
Where's Min Ik?

60
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,050
He's swimming now,
but he'll be back soon.

61
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,019
That...

62
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,990
Is that the list of people
who signed the power of attorney?

63
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,100
Park Ok Soon.

64
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,600
Why hasn't she signed yet?

65
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,269
You said you were going to
write a power of attorney.

66
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm getting her signature today.

67
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,269
Really? Are you certain?

68
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,339
After signing it, she's not coming
to the stockholders' meeting, right?

69
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,939
I guess so.

70
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,839
Is Park Ok Soon's signature
that important?

71
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,810
I remember you were checking
on that multiple times.

72
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,790
Park Ok Soon is
Veronica Park's real name.

73
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,129
- Really?
- Who?

74
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,759
Goodness.

75
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,329
Look at you all startled.
What were you whispering about?

76
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,629
Is it a secret?

77
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,529
Is it a scheme?

78
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,240
Is it love?

79
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,069
Coffee...

80
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:13,110
Director Gi Dae Ju said
he wanted some coffee, so...

81
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,050
What brings you here?

82
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,050
Are you here to say
you're quitting again?

83
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,620
I'm here to see
if you're doing all right, buster.

84
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,990
How have you been shoving her around
for the last two weeks?

85
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,360
She looks terrible.

86
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:30,360
What about her look?

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,029
Can't you see?

88
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,930
Her face looks like
you put a straw on it...

89
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,699
and sucked all of her soul out.

90
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,480
She's imprinted on your mind.

91
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,779
Your eyes are not actually
seeing and recognizing her.

92
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,689
Your brain just imprinted her
in your mind.

93
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,220
Just because I can see
Secretary Jeong's face,

94
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,790
it doesn't mean
I can see her facial expressions.

95
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,129
Sir, why...

96
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,540
- Go.
- What? All of a sudden?

97
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,199
Did I do something wrong?

98
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:15,509
Since you've been living in such
a nice suite room until now,

99
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,480
I think you can let me use it
at least for one day.

100
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,279
Tomorrow's stockholders' meeting
will be held in this hotel anyway.

101
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,649
I think staying here tonight will
help me stay in shape.

102
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,649
You have your point, but...

103
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,250
we still need to practice...

104
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,930
Here are the slippers, shampoos, and
conditioners you've been collecting.

105
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,370
Take them all
and go get some sleep.

106
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,870
They said
those would be charged extra.

107
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,370
You know how embarrassing it is
if you don't use the minibar...

108
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,639
in a room like this?

109
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,350
I can't eat these anyway
because they have peanuts in them.

110
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,149
There are no peanuts in it.

111
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,860
"This product was produced
in the same factory..."

112
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,220
"that produces peanuts"!

113
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,560
Take the hotel limousine.

114
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,829
- I can take the bus.
- Just take the limousine.

115
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,699
Act like a guest who stayed
at a hotel suite.

116
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,800
Don't walk to the bus stop
with a bag full of hotel slippers.

117
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,110
Call me when you get home.

118
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,540
Okay.

119
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,050
Go on.

120
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:30,250
I'll be off, then.

121
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,379
Will you just... Just go.

122
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,200
What's wrong?

123
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,129
Why don't you just drive her home?

124
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,340
What kind of a boss
drives his own secretary home?

125
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,919
"I should be sorry..."

126
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,190
"to have that voice fall silent..."

127
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,330
"and pass out of my life."

128
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,789
Do you remember?

129
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,200
We wrote an essay
about this in college.

130
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,830
"The Diaries of Adam and Eve"
by Mark Twain.

131
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,870
Why are you suddenly
being so poetic?

132
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,600
Looking at you right now...

133
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,700
just reminded me of that quote.

134
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,039
You seem really sad...

135
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,440
to see Secretary Jeong leave.

136
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,179
You lunatic.

137
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,620
It's my camaraderie
toward my secretary...

138
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,320
since she worked really hard with me
for the past two weeks.

139
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,190
It's my love for humanity
toward someone who's never slept...

140
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,360
in a hotel suite before.

141
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,129
And I'm just a guy who has love
for every human being...

142
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,289
on earth, you jerk.

143
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,100
Are you sure you're not dating her?

144
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,269
There's someone else I want to date.

145
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,600
Really?

146
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Who?

147
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,409
Well...

148
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,610
I really didn't know I'd end up...

149
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,519
liking her so much.

150
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,919
When I think of you,

151
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,019
I have a funny feeling
in my stomach.

152
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,889
I guess I have indigestion.

153
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,000
Every time I look at her,
my heart starts racing,

154
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,169
and my blood pressure goes up.

155
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,899
Is she pretty?

156
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:37,539
She's pretty.

157
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,580
And here's what's interesting.

158
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,379
Her voice sounds so familiar.

159
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,580
And although it was my first time
seeing her,

160
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,289
it felt as though she knew me.

161
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,590
You're head over heels for her.

162
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,919
Hey.

163
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,929
Call her.

164
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,159
Let's hear her voice.

165
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,669
The stockholders' meeting
is tomorrow.

166
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:03,029
I shouldn't be thinking about her.

167
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,539
You should go.

168
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,940
I know you're here to tell me
that you're going to quit.

169
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,370
The least you could do is call her.

170
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,980
Here.

171
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,710
When did I ever lend you money?

172
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,019
I borrowed money from your mom.

173
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,620
She somehow knew I needed money
and lent me this.

174
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,389
Give this back to her
and thank her for me.

175
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,429
And make sure to be well-prepared.

176
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,500
Even if I quit, you'll still be...

177
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,639
Here's a song by Cho PD.

178
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,070
"My Friend".

179
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,379
Hurray!

180
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,289
Isn't it a great place for a date?

181
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,860
It's a great place
to sign a document.

182
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,000
If I sign this,

183
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,799
what will you give me in return?

184
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,600
From what I know,
you don't need anything from me...

185
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,809
because you already have
everything you need.

186
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,070
I may have everything I need,

187
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,639
but I never got anything from you.

188
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:24,419
Then how about I treat you
to a meal?

189
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,090
100,000 of my shares
for just 1 meal?

190
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,820
That doesn't sound too bad.

191
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,730
As you already know,
I really like stuff...

192
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,960
that aren't very cost-effective.

193
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:45,840
By the way,

194
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,440
are you asking me to sign this...

195
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,139
because you're against...

196
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,879
the dismissal of Do Min Ik?

197
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,409
Don't you trust me?

198
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,980
It's because I can't trust myself.

199
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,419
I sometimes made the wrong choice
because of men.

200
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,659
And it adds up
to about 12 times in total.

201
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,990
If that's what it is, don't worry.

202
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,299
I've never made
any bad judgements...

203
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,659
because of a woman before.

204
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,700
My goodness.

205
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:21,210
I think I forgot my signature.

206
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,750
There you go.

207
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,289
When will we get to eat together?

208
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,659
I don't feel comfortable
about paying in advance.

209
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,299
Please free your schedule tomorrow.

210
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,600
I'll treat you to a meal right after
the stockholders' meeting.

211
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:53,669
Yes.

212
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,539
I checked the file,
and everything was fine.

213
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,509
No, you don't need to come.

214
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,509
I'll leave it where you told me to.

215
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:08,850
(Media 2, Director Gi Dae Ju)

216
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,549
I am...

217
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,059
sleepy right now.

218
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:19,029
I am...

219
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,629
sleeping right now.

220
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:28,769
I am asleep.

221
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,350
I am asleep.

222
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,450
Darn it! Why can't I go to sleep?

223
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,139
Director Do.

224
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,210
They give us two new pairs
of slippers every day.

225
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,480
I'm going to wear new ones
every other day,

226
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,409
so would it be okay
if I take the rest?

227
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,980
Thank you.

228
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,539
I spent way too much time with her.

229
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,990
It's true that I love hotel buffets
more than I love myself.

230
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,990
But I can't let you eat
hotel buffets...

231
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,429
every single day.

232
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,529
I'll cook a hearty meal for you...

233
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:01,830
at least once a day.

234
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,139
At first,

235
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,039
I thought she was too talkative.

236
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:24,149
(Boss)

237
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,299
Hello?

238
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,299
Are you sleeping?

239
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,840
Yes.

240
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,509
I'm sleeping.

241
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,779
You must think of me
as your friend...

242
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,509
after spending
the past two weeks with me.

243
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:51,580
Didn't I tell you to call me
once you got home?

244
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,389
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:58,190
I got home just fine.

246
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,620
Bye, then.

247
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,190
I can't even sleep right now because
of the stockholders' meeting.

248
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,930
But it seems like my secretary
is sleeping very well.

249
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:08,029
What kind of attitude is that...

250
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,670
when you promised to help me
become the president?

251
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,869
You have no respect for your boss.

252
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,140
And you've forgotten your duty
as my secretary.

253
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Is this some sort of mutiny or what?

254
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,910
"Mutiny"?

255
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,750
You're the one who told me to leave.

256
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,250
And is it my fault
that you can't go to sleep?

257
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,519
Why don't you...

258
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,789
go ahead and blame me
for your constipation?

259
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:32,589
I don't have constipation.
You're disgusting.

260
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,359
I could tell after spending
a few days with you.

261
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,029
You always flush the toilet
three times.

262
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,099
And if you take your cell phone,

263
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:42,529
you're in there
for at least 30 minutes.

264
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,940
The reason I looked so worn out...

265
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,599
wasn't because of overwork.
It was because of the nasty smell.

266
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,140
I'm not the one...

267
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,480
who left that nasty smell.

268
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,549
It's the smell
coming from the hotel pipes.

269
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,349
You see, I'm very much...

270
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,049
indebted to you,

271
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,960
so I was going to stay quiet.

272
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,660
But how could you call me
at this hour?

273
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:11,299
This is a breach of contract.

274
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,759
As soon as the stockholders'
meeting is over,

275
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,799
I'll take some time off
and turn off my phone.

276
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,970
And I'll go to someplace nice and
have some soju with grilled clams.

277
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,839
But now,

278
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,740
it feels like I'll be
disappointed...

279
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,380
- if she keeps her silence...
- Director Do?

280
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,220
- and I can't hear her anymore.
- Hello?

281
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,680
- Wherever she may be at,
- Hello?

282
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,650
- Hey!
- the place she's in...

283
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,720
- is always a paradise.
- Director Do?

284
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,529
(The day of TnT Mobile's
stockholders' meeting)

285
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,740
Just say something.

286
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,369
Did you eat?

287
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,910
Yes. I ate what you cooked.

288
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,349
Good.

289
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,250
Gosh, you should
put something on your face.

290
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,390
What?

291
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:18,700
Your skin is all flaky.

292
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,009
Don't be nervous.

293
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,609
You know what your boss is like.

294
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,779
Other than prosopagnosia,
I'm perfect.

295
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,819
So you don't have to be nervous.

296
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,000
What are you talking about?

297
00:19:58,369 --> 00:19:59,900
You heard me.

298
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:02,809
The power of attorney is withdrawn.

299
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,009
It hasn't even been 24 hours.
Why did you change your mind?

300
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,960
Did I tell you this before?

301
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,289
I'm more ambitious
than what you think.

302
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,049
You go ahead first.

303
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,019
I was hoping not to see you here.

304
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,589
Don't say anything sweet like that.

305
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,789
I'm a very positive person,

306
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,029
so to me, it sounds like you
want to see me someplace else.

307
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
If you're here to see me,
we can go someplace else now.

308
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,569
I'm here to see your wife, not you.

309
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,539
As you know, I'm not naive enough...

310
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:10,940
to ditch homemaking...

311
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:12,910
just because I started some romance.

312
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,809
Mr. Gi Dae Ju.

313
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,819
Who are these shabby guys?

314
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,359
I asked you not to
come to my company.

315
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,500
It's not like
we're here for no reason.

316
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,670
We checked some data...

317
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,440
and figured you might be...

318
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,039
a flight risk.

319
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,970
Did you borrow money
from a loan shark?

320
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,680
I'm sorry, but would you
go inside first?

321
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:50,009
Call me anytime
if you have any problems.

322
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,650
A kind loan for powerless commoners.

323
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,890
Veronica Loan.

324
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,259
- Gosh.
- She's so tiring.

325
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,130
Do you want to talk here
or go to the police station?

326
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,700
TnT Mobile's stockholders' meeting
will begin soon.

327
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,109
I'll go to the police station
after the meeting.

328
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:19,440
I have to finish this
no matter that.

329
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,609
We will wait outside.

330
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:26,250
The board of directors believes that
conniving assault...

331
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,289
in the workplace
is an irresponsible action...

332
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:30,990
that encourages abuse of power...

333
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,589
and depresses
the morale of the employees.

334
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:33,890
Don't get nervous, Gal Hee.

335
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,289
Director Do said he'd be okay.

336
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,259
That's the agenda
of today's stockholders' meeting.

337
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Sir.

338
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,069
Yes, please go ahead.

339
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:50,269
I would like to hear Director Do's
stance regarding the matter.

340
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,480
I second the motion.

341
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,329
What is she doing here?

342
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,759
Ma'am.

343
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,329
Good to see you here.

344
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,470
How did you...

345
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,170
- Park Ok Soon...
- Stop.

346
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,839
How dare you call my real name?

347
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:22,970
I'm changing my name.

348
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:27,839
No.

349
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:31,519
If he sees her...

350
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,250
See whom?

351
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,450
Well...

352
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,930
I know this could sound weird,

353
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,730
but if you're here just for fun,

354
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,000
could you please just leave?

355
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,970
For you, it might be
just a fun thing to watch.

356
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,200
But my life is on the line.

357
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,640
It really sounds weird...

358
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,470
and I don't want to leave.

359
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,440
I have no idea
how many shares you have,

360
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,680
if you want to help your boss,

361
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,950
or if you want to take down
your boss.

362
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,549
But whatever it is, do you think
you have enough votes for it?

363
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,990
I, on the other hand,

364
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,859
can cut off your boss' neck
and put it back...

365
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,730
with just one finger.

366
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,960
I can twist and squeeze his neck.

367
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,259
I can do anything I want.

368
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,799
What do you say?

369
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:26,539
Do you still want me to leave?

370
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:29,410
As the stakeholders suggested,

371
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,910
we're going to hear
Director Do Min Ik's stance.

372
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,049
Should I leave?

373
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,809
Please don't resign, sir.

374
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,619
Don't give up. Keep running
until you can be the president.

375
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,380
I'll help you.

376
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,599
No. Please stay.

377
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,430
Please stay here.

378
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,230
I almost missed out on the fun.

379
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,970
It's okay, Gal Hee.

380
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:37,109
Trust him and focus on him.

381
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,980
Even if they run into each other,
nothing will happen.

382
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,849
He can't even see her face.

383
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,359
(Good luck.)

384
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,940
I can see faces.

385
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,190
Mom.

386
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,289
Dae Ju.

387
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,789
Uncle.

388
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,130
Secretary Jeong.

389
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,910
Who is that woman?

390
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,880
What are you doing?

391
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,180
Go back to your seat
if you have nothing to say.

392
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,519
Oh, okay.

393
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,490
(TnT Mobile
Extraordinary Stockholders' Meeting)

394
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:23,049
You're the best. Good luck.

395
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,450
First of all, I'm sorry
to have caused...

396
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,589
the stockholders so much anxiety
with the unfortunate incident.

397
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,660
I believe I deserve to be criticized
in lacking prudence...

398
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,799
as the company's executive.

399
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,700
But there's one thing
I can tell you devoid of shame.

400
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:49,670
It was never an assault
as an abuse of power...

401
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,980
and I, Do Min Ik, didn't face...

402
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,509
any legal punishment...

403
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:55,480
for this matter.

404
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,779
What kind of nonsense is that?

405
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,589
Who is she? Isn't she
Director Do's secretary?

406
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,819
Why is she trying
to attack her boss?

407
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:08,690
Let me attack you.

408
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,960
Are you out of your mind?
You should be protecting me,

409
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,660
not attacking me.
Why would you attack me?

410
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,500
I need to attack you first
in order to protect you.

411
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,099
Crows have painted
themselves white...

412
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:21,099
and are saying an egret is a crow.

413
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,740
How would you reverse
such a situation?

414
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:26,339
I don't know.

415
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,410
Go to the crows...

416
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,079
and pretend you're a crow too.

417
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,750
You can wash off
their white paint afterwards.

418
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,490
We will see who is the real crow.

419
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:39,789
Why do you keep
talking about punishment?

420
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,059
Do you have to be
legally punished...

421
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:45,700
to damage the company's dignity?

422
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,730
There are so many articles...

423
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,230
talking about
abuse of power and what not now.

424
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,509
Shouldn't that be counted as
injury to dignity as well?

425
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:59,640
Is that so?

426
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:05,880
What do you think, Director Lee?

427
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,450
Me?

428
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:12,359
It depends on how one may
interpret it,

429
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,990
but these days,

430
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,160
so many incidents happen.

431
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,700
So I believe injury to dignity...

432
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,940
should be interpreted
in a broader sense as well.

433
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:27,099
Yes!

434
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:33,940
Then I would like
all of you to watch this video.

435
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:36,809
(TnT Mobile
Extraordinary Stockholders' Meeting)

436
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:42,619
The video you're watching now is...

437
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:46,559
what Director Lee's secretary
posted on her social media recently.

438
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,690
"I'm not bragging or anything,
but I can do it without drugs."

439
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:55,670
"Secretary Lee,
you're my personal entertainer."

440
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,869
- Darn it.
- "Could you..."

441
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,140
"come over to my hotel
for a second?"

442
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,339
Oh, my gosh.

443
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,539
What is that?

444
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,140
Let's move on to the next video.

445
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,549
This video was
even on the news recently.

446
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:12,250
It's a video of one abusing power
in a parking lot.

447
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,849
The man threw trash
to the security guard...

448
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,650
because he opened the gate late.

449
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,990
Why does he have so much trash
in his car?

450
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,019
Let's zoom in.

451
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:22,630
Oh, no.

452
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,430
It's Director Woo.

453
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,869
This video is so famous...

454
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,799
I'm sure everyone here has
watched it.

455
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,970
Although the public relations
department spent...

456
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:38,069
over 10,000 dollars
to delete this video,

457
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,940
it's still all over the Internet.

458
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:42,549
It's so-called...

459
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,049
"TnT Mobile's crazy old man video".

460
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,450
I'm a director of this company!

461
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,430
Goodness. Turn that off already!

462
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,789
Goodness gracious!

463
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,400
This is humiliating.

464
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,109
I prepared two more videos
of other directors.

465
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,380
Due to a setback
in electric power supply,

466
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,579
I'm afraid I have to wrap it up.

467
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:20,079
Darn it. It was fun to watch.

468
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,420
He's good.

469
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,589
You said
injury of dignity has to be...

470
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,559
broadly interpreted these days.

471
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,230
To Director Lee's opinion,
I'd like to say,

472
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,329
"Me too."

473
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:38,500
Stakeholders' meetings are so fun
because it's all about the drama.

474
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,539
Who wrote this scenario? Is it you?

475
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:44,309
We still have one more left.

476
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,779
Though they violated the law
regarding dignity multiple times,

477
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,950
they haven't apologized
to the stockholders at all.

478
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,450
They have been staying silent.

479
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,980
Today,

480
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,720
I would like to offer my sincere
apologies to everyone here...

481
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,819
on behalf of all the directors here.

482
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:11,799
Are we not getting apologies
from the other directors?

483
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:15,170
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

484
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,240
- Apologize right now!
- Come out!

485
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,180
- Why isn't anyone coming out?
- Come on!

486
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,779
- Come forward!
- Right now!

487
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,279
I want apologies
from every single one of you!

488
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,680
- What are you?
- Apologize!

489
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:37,430
Let's wrap it up...

490
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,359
- and begin the vote.
- Wait!

491
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:48,200
What is she up to now?

492
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:53,140
Ma'am, the next line is
very important.

493
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,250
I have to say it
so Director Do says the next line.

494
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,609
Writers don't have complete control
over the scenario.

495
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:00,920
Viewers' opinions must be
reflected as well.

496
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:02,549
Goodness.

497
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,890
Put your hand down.

498
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,029
Yes, go ahead.

499
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:15,369
All stockholders' meetings are
messy.

500
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:18,269
I get that people here...

501
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,299
are way worse than you.

502
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:24,240
But what's your point?

503
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,779
Are you trying to...

504
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:28,980
drag them down with you?

505
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,319
I'm trying to...

506
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:38,759
save all of us.

507
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,089
I think I deserve the penalty...

508
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:44,130
for troubling the company.

509
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,059
But instead of having me dismissed,

510
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,269
could you give me
a different punishment?

511
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,970
Since Chairman Do Wan Bae's...

512
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:56,170
sudden death in 2016,

513
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,740
the stock price of TnT Mobile
has decreased by 21 percent.

514
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,180
But last year, the IPTV project...

515
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,049
led by Director Gi Dae Ju and I...

516
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,319
have successfully attracted
new members.

517
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,920
And the stock crossed
the 40,000 mark.

518
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
We...

519
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,320
saw hope.

520
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,460
If you want to punish me,

521
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,000
please give me
a punishment of labor.

522
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,699
I will make amends for the trouble
I caused by raising the stock price.

523
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,440
Making your wallets thicker.

524
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,139
I believe that is...

525
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,570
the punishment I deserve.

526
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,280
And it is also my duty.

527
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,929
You'll save him, right?

528
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,170
When my boss says he will do it,
he really does it.

529
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,369
He will never waste your money.

530
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,869
You can trust me.

531
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,480
Since when did you like him?

532
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,710
Excuse me?

533
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,210
You like your boss.

534
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:14,820
What are you talking about?

535
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,659
Your eyes are not saying,
"Please save my boss."

536
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,530
They're saying,
"Please save my man."

537
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,860
That's not what it is.

538
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,800
I'm doing this purely
out of respect,

539
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,269
as I've been working with him.

540
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,539
If you call that fond look
is for someone you respect,

541
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:37,539
I'm sure you'll melt the statue
of Admiral Lee in Gwanghwamun.

542
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,210
You can never tell how you look
by looking yourself in the mirror.

543
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,550
You need to look from the side
to get a proper look.

544
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:48,119
Hey, I wish I could show
your eyes just now...

545
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,090
to a horrible actor.

546
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,090
This is exactly what the eyes of
a person in love looks like.

547
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,360
What kind of witch are you?

548
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,400
It's Park Seok Ja. Your mother.

549
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,539
Hello, ma'am.

550
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,909
Is this a school reunion or what?
Why are you goofing around here?

551
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,309
Stand up.

552
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,010
I would like to say hi to
the chief director and her son.

553
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,079
Let's see.

554
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,289
I think I saw him somewhere here.

555
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,519
Sir.

556
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,119
Who was the woman next to you?

557
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,230
Because of that woman's question,
I...

558
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,789
Get in!

559
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:39,300
Jeong Gal Hee,
what are you doing now?

560
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,070
- What are you doing?
- I know.

561
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,809
What am I doing?

562
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:47,179
You want to vote together
since we've been together...

563
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,179
for the last two weeks?

564
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:52,650
Do we really have to be
in such a small booth together?

565
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,750
Let's just do it then.

566
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,389
We need to go somewhere actually.

567
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,889
We do?

568
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,659
Okay. Let's go.

569
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,230
Wait.

570
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,269
(Voting Booth)

571
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:21,780
Okay, you can go now. Right now.

572
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:25,920
Nice to meet you.
I am Veronica Park.

573
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:33,119
I'm sorry.

574
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:35,059
I should've...

575
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:37,590
taught her manners
when she was young.

576
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,659
But as you already know,

577
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:42,469
I had to work really hard
for TnT Mobile,

578
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,170
so I didn't have much time...

579
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,039
to be around her back then.

580
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,070
Your daughter managed
to turn that Seokja Corporation...

581
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,340
into our country's
top culture company.

582
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,920
Nice to meet you. I'm Sim Hae Ra.

583
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:05,349
I heard things are going well
with my son.

584
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,690
Me?

585
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:13,730
So you told them I was there?

586
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,000
Yes.

587
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,699
I told them
you actually met each other.

588
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,170
Yes, that's right.

589
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:27,239
This brat rarely attends
stockholders' meetings.

590
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,880
But she purposely came today
to meet your son.

591
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,650
My goodness, is that so?

592
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,550
Then you should say hello.

593
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,489
Where did he go?

594
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:43,659
Where are we going?

595
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,260
- Give me your cell phone.
- What?

596
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,670
Give me your cell phone.

597
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:54,269
Director Do.

598
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,750
Get in.

599
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,849
Where are we going?

600
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:07,250
It's working hours right now.

601
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,389
Are you refusing to follow
your boss' orders?

602
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,719
Get in.

603
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,090
How are the stockholders?

604
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:19,730
Will things go as planned?

605
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,829
It seems like a few of them
got swayed.

606
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:25,099
But small investors can't make
that much of a difference.

607
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,539
The major stockholders already
made up their minds coming here.

608
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,940
It's all about
how many votes we get,

609
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,309
so don't worry too much.

610
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,849
The problem is...

611
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:38,909
that we don't know
what she's going to vote for.

612
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,050
Let me get this straight.

613
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,949
If I vote for you...

614
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,619
at your company's
stockholders' meeting,

615
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,960
you're going to vote for me...

616
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,360
at our company's
stockholders' meeting?

617
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,130
Are you suggesting that we should
mutually help each other?

618
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,500
It's more like repaying my thanks.

619
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,800
It's only right...

620
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,639
for me to repay my thanks
to someone I'm indebted to.

621
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:02,340
Do you know that I purchased...

622
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,969
an additional 80,000
of Cinepark's shares?

623
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,750
President Park.

624
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,920
Goodness, President Sim.

625
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:16,019
You should make a wise choice.

626
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,789
You don't want to lose money
by getting swayed.

627
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:21,119
Of course.

628
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:25,130
I can't let myself make
another wrong judgement...

629
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,030
because of a guy.

630
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,809
Your destination is 2km away.

631
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,550
Where are we going?

632
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:50,019
Then can I at least have
my cell phone back?

633
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,820
What are you doing?
Get your hands off me.

634
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,760
You're not kidnapping me, are you?

635
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,059
Wasn't it your wish to have grilled
clams with a bottle of soju...

636
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,559
after the stockholders' meeting?

637
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,030
Director Do,
it's true that I felt...

638
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,440
extremely nervous and anxious
to attend...

639
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,400
the stockholders' meeting.
But still...

640
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,409
I don't think we should be gone
when it isn't even over.

641
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,510
Turn back the car.

642
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,139
Will you be able to relax
if I tell you this?

643
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,150
What if there's another good reason
why we should celebrate...

644
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,480
apart from
the stockholders' meeting?

645
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,820
What's that?

646
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,090
I can see.

647
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:45,440
(TnT Mobile
Extraordinary Stockholders' Meeting)

648
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,980
I'll announce the results.

649
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:59,420
A total of 125,116,807 shares
participated in the vote.

650
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,030
And the number of shares that voted
for the agenda is five thousand...

651
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,070
Here.

652
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,239
You want me to grill them?

653
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,940
Of course.
Do you expect me to grill them?

654
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,139
I kindly drove you all the way here.

655
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,280
Shouldn't you be grateful?

656
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,449
It seems like you got
the wrong idea.

657
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:30,050
When I said I wanted to eat
grilled clams,

658
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,690
I meant that I wanted to eat it
with someone I like,

659
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,190
hearing sounds
of the waves in the background.

660
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:35,789
I didn't mean
I wanted to put on work gloves...

661
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,760
and grill clams for my boss
like a minion.

662
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:46,400
Here. Will this make you happy?

663
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,579
About that USB I told you about...

664
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:02,219
I looked for it everywhere,
but I couldn't find it.

665
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,119
- You couldn't find it?
- No.

666
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,920
I'm sure I put it in my drawer,
but it was gone.

667
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:10,230
But thankfully, I copied the files
onto my laptop.

668
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,730
It was in the suit you wore
on the day of the accident.

669
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,659
So I got worried
that it might not work.

670
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,809
The results should be out by now.

671
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:35,880
If you won the vote,
it'll be a celebratory drink.

672
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:39,519
If not,
it'll be a drink of consolation.

673
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,000
I hereby announce that
Director Do Min Ik's dismissal...

674
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,730
(For: 50,005,500,
Against: 55,111,307)

675
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,139
(Mister Grilled Clams)

676
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,510
What are you thinking?

677
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,849
I'm surprised that a human's mind
can be so complicated...

678
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,150
even when looking at
a very calming scenery.

679
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:10,889
What about you?

680
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:14,960
I'm just glad
that I came here with you.

681
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,730
Grilled clams taste best when
my secretary grills them for me.

682
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,840
They look so happy.

683
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:35,710
Aren't they fighting?

684
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,050
They're in love.

685
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,610
I can tell just by
looking at her face.

686
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,889
You can never tell how you look
by looking yourself in the mirror.

687
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,360
You need to look from the side
to get a proper look.

688
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,059
She's right.

689
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,630
I can see properly from the side.

690
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:00,699
See what?

691
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,340
It's nothing.

692
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:07,079
What were you
going to tell me earlier?

693
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,610
You said there's
another good reason...

694
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,210
why we should celebrate apart from
the stockholders' meeting.

695
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,019
Well...

696
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,059
It happened only for a short moment
when I was on stage.

697
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,460
Just a second.

698
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:24,090
(Gi Dae Ju)

699
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,000
The results must be out.

700
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,070
You should answer it.

701
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,269
Answer the phone.

702
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,780
Where are you?

703
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:41,039
Hey.

704
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,079
Okay.

705
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,309
Okay, bye.

706
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,119
What did he say?

707
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,789
Secretary Jeong.

708
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,860
Do you think that bird over there
is a seagull or a wild goose?

709
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,929
My gosh. Come on, Director Do.

710
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:03,699
What did he say?

711
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,340
The drink we had earlier...

712
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,469
Was it a celebratory drink?

713
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:11,539
Or was it a drink of consolation?

714
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:21,349
A celebratory drink.

715
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:26,019
A celebratory drink?

716
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:29,289
Director Do, congratulations.

717
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:30,889
Congratulations.

718
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,880
Great job, Secretary Jeong.

719
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,500
I got you a gift.

720
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,269
I was going to give you
before the announcement.

721
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,670
Here.

722
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:54,610
Open the trunk.

723
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,840
The trunk?

724
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,010
Why did you keep
the gift in the trunk?

725
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:09,789
(Mister Grilled Clams)

726
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:11,230
Gosh.

727
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,829
Are there thousands of roses
and millions of balloons?

728
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:19,599
I don't like surprises like that.

729
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:27,179
What? There's nothing in there.

730
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,980
There's something. Look carefully.

731
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,250
What's in there?

732
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,090
Is this it?

733
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,900
(TnT Mobile
Extraordinary Stockholders' Meeting)

734
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,530
Min Ik stays in office?

735
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,539
Well done, Min Ik.

736
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:02,639
(President Sim Hae Yong)

737
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:14,159
Mr. Gi Dae Ju?

738
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,429
Where are we having dinner tonight?

739
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:21,030
I think I deserve something
in return of my 100,000 shares.

740
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,829
- I'm sorry, but...
- But?

741
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,469
Did I tell you this?

742
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,840
I'm a jerk...

743
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,780
worse than you think.

744
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:41,420
I'm sorry, but I can't
have dinner with you today.

745
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,989
He's so attractive.

746
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:04,869
I'm really nervous here.

747
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:07,210
Can I just open this here?

748
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,449
I told you to open it
when you get home.

749
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,380
I'm so curious that I can't help it.

750
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,750
How much would it be?

751
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,389
How much?

752
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,150
Isn't this money? A monetary gift.

753
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,190
In the world you live in,
is money the only thing...

754
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:25,929
that can be in an envelope?

755
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:28,630
Can't you expand your mind
and think further?

756
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:32,429
No way.

757
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,000
Is this a hand-written letter?

758
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,440
It's just useless.

759
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,710
If you have anything to say,
you can just text me.

760
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,449
Gosh, just open it.

761
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,849
Gosh.

762
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,929
A contract?

763
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:06,570
I'm going to say this only once,
so listen carefully.

764
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,070
I had a secretary.

765
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:11,039
Three years ago.

766
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:17,079
But the secretary whom I
trusted and followed the most...

767
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,750
deceived and betrayed me...

768
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,489
at the most critical moment.

769
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:27,920
Since then, I worked my fingers
to the bone.

770
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:29,719
And I decided...

771
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:32,260
not to trust secretaries anymore.

772
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:36,630
I know...

773
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:40,440
I fired you, hated you,

774
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:42,969
bullied you,
and gave you a hard time.

775
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,309
But it's not that I hated you.

776
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,849
I hated that old secretary.

777
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,719
It's her who deceived me.

778
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,949
It's not like you did it to me.

779
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:03,289
But I was afraid...

780
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,699
you'd be just like her.

781
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,900
It was me being in fear.

782
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:17,110
If I've upset you,
please understand me.

783
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:22,280
And if you're interested,

784
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:25,679
I want you to sign a new contract.

785
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:29,519
You know what?

786
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:32,550
I'm deceiving you too.

787
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,730
As you'll see...

788
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:40,559
"As soon as my disease is cured,
the contract between you and me..."

789
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,559
"will be terminated."

790
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:47,900
I changed that article
into something more beautiful.

791
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:52,840
(Article 1, Term of Contract,
It ends when the secretary asks.)

792
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,110
"The contract ends..."

793
00:52:56,909 --> 00:52:58,949
"when the secretary asks"?

794
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:05,190
Director Do.

795
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,059
What do you think? Your heart
is fluttering with joy, right?

796
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:15,530
Why? That's the only thing
you wanted from me.

797
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:17,969
Stable employment.

798
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,739
I don't have to
see it to believe it.

799
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:24,070
I know what's the look on your face.

800
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,010
For your boss
who can't read your face,

801
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,420
tell me about the look
on your face right now...

802
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,750
in detail.

803
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,889
Well...

804
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:40,920
I'm...

805
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,489
I'm smiling.

806
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,800
I'm smiling brightly
from ear to ear.

807
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:57,139
My cheeks are on their way up.

808
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:02,440
The middle of
my forehead is so flat.

809
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,619
And I got wrinkles around my eyes.

810
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,989
Because I'm smiling too much.

811
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,670
If...

812
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,469
What if...

813
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:33,170
I'm deceiving you too?

814
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,309
What?

815
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:37,949
What if...

816
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,280
there's something
I've been lying about?

817
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,429
Then...

818
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:57,929
I won't be able...

819
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:02,440
to trust people
for the rest of my life.

820
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:08,539
Wait.

821
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:11,409
Hello?

822
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:14,420
Well done. Where are you?

823
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,789
I'm outside now.

824
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:20,519
We're going out to have dinner.
You should come.

825
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,489
We? Who?

826
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,190
Did you not see her?

827
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,199
Veronica says she came here
to see you today.

828
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,730
Veronica came to see me?

829
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,340
Yes. Okay. Bye.

830
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,110
What do I do?

831
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,780
Will you go?

832
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,449
How long does it take
to drive to Seoul?

833
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:45,650
Is the traffic bad?

834
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,420
Don't go.

835
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:53,250
What?

836
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,690
Please don't go.

837
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:57,630
Why not?

838
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,329
I'm not sure where I should begin
and how to explain it.

839
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:06,769
Whether it's an excuse or
explanation, we can do that later.

840
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:10,269
Shall we go to Seoul now?

841
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,340
Do you want to see her that bad?

842
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,679
Did you not hear me?

843
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,480
Veronica Park came to see me.

844
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,789
I want to go. I want to meet her.

845
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:34,599
Okay.

846
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:37,130
Go.

847
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,570
Before I explain, it'd be better...

848
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,639
for you to see it yourself.

849
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:48,309
Right.

850
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:03,489
Hurry up.

851
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,639
Why? Aren't you getting in?

852
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,650
I'm not going.

853
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,179
What?

854
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,619
I need to sober up.

855
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:30,050
You go first.

856
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,289
The sun will go down soon.

857
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,429
How are you going to
go home by yourself?

858
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:44,900
I put water on the passenger seat,

859
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,840
so drink it when you get thirsty.

860
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:49,900
You almost ran out of gas,

861
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:52,769
so make sure to fill up the tank
before entering the highway.

862
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:56,280
Don't drive too fast
because you feel rushed.

863
00:57:56,949 --> 00:57:57,980
And...

864
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,019
Well...

865
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:08,960
While talking to Veronica Park,

866
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:14,099
you will want to
hear something from me.

867
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:18,530
Then feel free to call me.

868
00:58:20,769 --> 00:58:22,340
I will tell you everything.

869
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,510
Do you know you're acting
really weird now?

870
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:30,139
Didn't you say you can
easily drink a bottle of soju?

871
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:36,420
Go before the traffic gets worse.

872
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,980
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

873
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,690
Are you going to meet Veronica Park?

874
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:46,750
Let's break up.

875
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,789
The relationship
between your boss and me.

876
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,329
You don't want to
make contracts with me anymore?

877
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:53,630
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

878
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:54,630
"Yes"? Gosh!

879
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:56,800
Secretary Jeong.

880
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,900
Can you stay by my side?
