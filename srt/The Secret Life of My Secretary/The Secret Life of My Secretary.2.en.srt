1
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:36,469
Pirates!

2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,179
Attack!

3
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,710
When he was a little boy,
Dae Ju was his favorite friend.

4
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,850
And the person he loved the most
was his mother.

5
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,850
Mom.

6
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,020
- Did you have fun?
- Mom.

7
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,799
Mom is angry.

8
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,469
Ms. Choi. Ms. Lee.

9
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:01,969
How is Min Ik's birthday party
planning going?

10
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,740
- We're working on it, Ma'am.
- We're working on it, Ma'am.

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,310
What did you say
you wanted for your birthday?

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,349
A boat.

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,549
He thought it was going to be
an awesome birthday party.

14
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:24,519
(Happy 7th birthday, Do Min Ik!)

15
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,560
Until he saw the real boat.

16
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,040
Here. You can have it.

17
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,209
I'm tired of it now.

18
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,680
Really?

19
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,079
Then what should I do with that?

20
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,560
Then let's use it
as our secret place.

21
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:01,129
When we have secrets
we want to share with each other,

22
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,629
let's meet at There, Boat There.

23
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,930
Okay.

24
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,169
Seriously!

25
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,080
Ms. Jeong.

26
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,639
Help...

27
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,479
Save me, please.

28
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,219
What? Why...

29
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,090
Why should I...

30
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,189
Min Ik!

31
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:33,460
Ms. Jeong.

32
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,360
Wait a second!

33
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,699
Okay, go, go!

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
Min Ik.

35
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:46,500
Min Ik!

36
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,169
What... What's wrong?

37
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:22,939
What?

38
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:27,710
Is it back?

39
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:31,949
Yes, I came back
because I felt so upset.

40
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:34,219
Right? It's back, right?

41
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,020
No, I'm not back for you.

42
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,759
I'm back to clear my name.

43
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,460
I'm back to clear my name!
Not to see you get undressed!

44
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,360
- My dress shirt.
- Okay.

45
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,400
Darn it.

46
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,909
Are you allowed to leave
the hospital?

47
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,610
I need to go somewhere.

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,250
Me too.

49
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,150
Hello.

50
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:08,689
Where to?

51
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,150
- Tanhyun Studio.
- Yeongdeungpo Police Station.

52
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,389
Have you ever seen me
miss an appointment?

53
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,360
Have you ever seen a secretary
who got fired go to work?

54
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
We need to go to the police station
and clear my name first.

55
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,230
Then get out of the car.
I'll meet you there after work.

56
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,199
What if you don't come?

57
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,610
Then get in.

58
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,939
Are you going to stay or leave?

59
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,180
You promised to go to the police
right after the shoot, okay?

60
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,949
I won't run away, so just...

61
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,990
Director Do.

62
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:55,730
Who is she?

63
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,839
Gosh, it's Eul Wang Lee.

64
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,939
I mean, it's Ms. Lee Eul Wang.

65
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,470
That's her?

66
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,269
What are we going to do?

67
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,610
She was even supposed to come...

68
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,180
to my goodbye party yesterday
because she heard I got fired.

69
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,720
Gal Hee, what are you doing here?

70
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,389
Well, the thing is,
I kind of had a situation.

71
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,529
- What about you? Why are you here?
- What?

72
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,329
Oh, well,
the director called my team...

73
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,439
because he couldn't reach
neither Director Do nor you.

74
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,170
Are you okay, Director Do?

75
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,709
Yes, I'm okay.

76
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,550
You're here.

77
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,750
Who is he?

78
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,279
Who do you think?
He's the video director.

79
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,519
Hello. Why didn't you answer
any of my calls?

80
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,089
Everyone's waiting for you inside.

81
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,290
Well...

82
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,829
I'll be waiting for you outside.

83
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,970
Don't go.

84
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:12,779
From now on,

85
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,110
stay by my side...

86
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,290
no matter what happens, okay?

87
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,930
Director Do,
please stand next to Da Young.

88
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,500
- Who is it?
- Pardon?

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,639
Who's Da Young?

90
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,209
Why are you asking me that?

91
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,439
Da Young, please raise your hand.

92
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,279
Yes, ma'am!

93
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,949
It's her.

94
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,420
Why do you keep asking me
who people are?

95
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,920
You're normally so good
at remembering people's faces.

96
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,300
Okay, let's give it one more try.

97
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,730
You know what to do, right?
Okay, let's go.

98
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,000
Why does she keep calling me?

99
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,540
I'm sorry,
but I can't talk right now.

100
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,610
Are you in a detention center,
or did you just go missing?

101
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,110
There are so many rumors
about what happened to you.

102
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,009
What took you so long
to answer your phone?

103
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,680
It's more like I'm taken hostage.

104
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,560
Okay, great job.

105
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,089
You guys, this is really
going to be the last time.

106
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,689
Get to your positions.

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
I need to get to my senses.

108
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,800
I need to get to my senses.

109
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,079
Director Do?

110
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:13,970
My gosh!

111
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,600
Director Do, where are you going?

112
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,569
The doors are opening.

113
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,670
The doors are closing.

114
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,810
Are you purposely trying to make me
have a hard time?

115
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,310
Didn't I... Didn't I tell you
to stay right by my side?

116
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,379
Why are you angry at me?

117
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,490
Gosh, why are you sweating so much?

118
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,299
What is this?

119
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,330
What do you think? I'm Ms. Jeong,
the one who got fired yesterday.

120
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,129
The Jeong Gal Hee you fired
with a smile on your face.

121
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,799
I'm Jeong Gal Hee, the famous minion
of TnT Mobile!

122
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,340
Yes, I know that!

123
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,909
Secretary Jeong.

124
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:59,279
Why are you the only one
who doesn't change?

125
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:01,679
Yes, you're right.

126
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,879
I got fired,

127
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,720
but I'm still being patient
and helping you out.

128
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,690
I can't believe I just wiped
the sweat off your face.

129
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,850
The doors are opening.

130
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,990
Dr. Gu.

131
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,360
I need to meet Dr. Gu first.

132
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,600
I knew you'd do this.

133
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,200
It's time to go see a detective,
not a doctor. You promised.

134
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
Your name, please.

135
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,039
Do Min Ik.

136
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:36,110
Do Min Ik.

137
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,350
(Call 112 to report a crime.)

138
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,950
It's either 1 of the 2.

139
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,049
Either the world is going crazy...

140
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,559
- Address, please.
- Seocho-dong, Seoul.

141
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,259
Or I'm crazy.

142
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,129
Excuse me. You're not him.

143
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm asking him questions.
Why do you keep answering?

144
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,740
I'm sorry. But...

145
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,240
He has trouble
memorizing his own address.

146
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,710
Excuse me, sir.

147
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,549
Who were you supposed to meet
at the site of the incident?

148
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,879
My friend.

149
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,120
But he didn't show up
for some reason.

150
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,519
Without even calling you?

151
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,889
He didn't exactly need to call...

152
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,720
because we're close enough
to understand.

153
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,360
I see.

154
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,230
You said you saw
the criminal's face, right?

155
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Yes.

156
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,669
I definitely saw his face.

157
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,269
Do you think you'll be able
to recognize him?

158
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,669
How did it go?

159
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:38,179
Okay.

160
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,639
I'll go see you tomorrow, sir.

161
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,879
(Boss)

162
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,850
Even right now,
I remember his face vividly...

163
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,490
as if he's right next to me.

164
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,629
Here's the CCTV footage.

165
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,230
Okay, let's see.

166
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:01,200
It was really dark by the dock,
so nothing got caught on camera.

167
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,269
This one is a footage
from the parking lot.

168
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,039
Look.

169
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,210
It's him.

170
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,440
The guy wearing a black outfit
and a black hat.

171
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,409
I can't see his face at all.

172
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,950
- Rewind it a little.
- Okay.

173
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:22,720
Stop.

174
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,460
What's this?
You guys came in a group?

175
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,600
Well...

176
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,070
The secretaries overate.

177
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,830
So we wanted to work out. Look.

178
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,340
A golf club, a baseball bat...

179
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,470
They're all for sports.

180
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:42,740
What about that jokbal?

181
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:47,509
It's a great replacement
for dumbbells.

182
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,919
What... What is she saying?

183
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,350
- Zoom in.
- Okay.

184
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,559
"I'm going to kill him."

185
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,929
- She said "I'm going to kill him."
- What?

186
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,129
Kill? Whom?

187
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,399
Me?

188
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,940
I meant it's a killer view...

189
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,710
and that I'm in such a good mood.

190
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,440
Let's not focus on this
and continue watching the footage.

191
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,850
Stop right there.

192
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,389
Who's that?

193
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,090
What? Can't you tell who it is?

194
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,490
Who is that?

195
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,029
Your colleague and best friend.

196
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,730
The friend you were there to meet.

197
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,840
Dae Ju?

198
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,909
11:53pm?

199
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,080
He was already there
when you arrived.

200
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,019
Then where did he go
without meeting you first?

201
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,950
Not even a friend can be trusted.

202
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,700
(Honest and energetic
Yeongdeungpo Police)

203
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,299
Secretary Jeong,
how did you know about There?

204
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,500
Boat There is Dae Ju and my
secret hide-out place.

205
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,139
There's no such place...

206
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,710
that is still only kept
between you two.

207
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:26,080
Every one of yours
and Director Gi's secretaries...

208
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,679
know about Boat There.

209
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,580
I'm exhausted,
so let's head home for now.

210
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,250
Right, I should go home.

211
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,990
Me, not you.

212
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm tired, so take me home.

213
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,529
You have money...

214
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,230
and you also have your own car.

215
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,629
There's only one thing
you don't have though.

216
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,269
As if that's possible.

217
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,710
A secretary.

218
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,850
I did go there to kill you.

219
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,590
You fired me even after
all the work I put in.

220
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,690
I thought of my mom,

221
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,059
and it just made me so angry.

222
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,460
Still, I ended up saving your life.

223
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,139
This is my final act
as your secretary.

224
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:29,039
I wasn't in a good place...

225
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,379
to formally bid farewell
when you fired me.

226
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,379
Thank you for everything,

227
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,580
Director Do.

228
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,970
Wait...

229
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,250
And here I thought
you had finally moved out.

230
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:18,659
Uncle...

231
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,860
It's you, right?

232
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:25,500
Uncle?

233
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,330
Not exactly.

234
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,100
We're not actually related by blood.

235
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,009
Nonetheless, we did
swap saliva though.

236
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,909
Since I was seven,
we ate soups and stews...

237
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,080
out of the same bowl.

238
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,190
Chirping like a cuckoo, are you?

239
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,860
Don't call him that.

240
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,830
Min Ik is my son
whom I gave birth to.

241
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,429
Are you even trying
to fool yourself now?

242
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,799
You took him in
while your husband was alive,

243
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,039
so you've done more than enough.

244
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,610
We let him take over for our dad,

245
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,039
but he ran off with some young cow.

246
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,440
Are you announcing
how much of a fool I am?

247
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,750
Are you deliberately looking away?

248
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,299
Why must it be that face, Mom?

249
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,070
You seem like...

250
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,909
the stranger I met...

251
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,379
on my first day here.

252
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,090
Are you sick?

253
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,859
Of course not.

254
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,230
It'd be wrong of me
to fall ill again.

255
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,539
I wouldn't do that to those...

256
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,809
who took care of me when I could
barely stand on my feet.

257
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:30,119
Our goal is...

258
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,660
to conceal how
we're not blood-related.

259
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:38,200
My role is to be
a good mother to you...

260
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,769
while your role is to be
the perfect son now.

261
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,269
Don't forget that.

262
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,269
It's the only reason
I'm letting you stay in this family.

263
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,710
I have...

264
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,079
nothing but gratitude.

265
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,549
Also, I dearly...

266
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,990
love you, Mom.

267
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,930
Aren't you sick and tired
of this game of 20 years?

268
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,509
Do Min Ik, male, 34.

269
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,009
In 1992, to treat
his congenital giant aneurysm,

270
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,819
an urolift was performed on him
at this hospital.

271
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,589
There weren't any complications
after the surgery,

272
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,720
but he came in with
a head trauma yesterday.

273
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,720
It so happens that...

274
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,759
the inserted clip is right by the
brain's facial recognition system.

275
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,309
Eight.

276
00:18:58,809 --> 00:18:59,839
Nine.

277
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,150
Five, butterfly.

278
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,150
Your vision is normal.

279
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:17,559
Everything else
seems to be normal too.

280
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,630
Now, take a good look at his face.

281
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:29,910
Choose the man with the same face.

282
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,680
What?

283
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,720
Did I get it wrong?

284
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:45,119
You think they're the same person?

285
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:47,019
- Be loyal.
- Be loyal!

286
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,230
Are they not?

287
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,700
You probably thought so
because they're in similar outfits.

288
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,900
Can't you recognize faces at all?

289
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:00,470
At first,

290
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,809
it was only a few people.

291
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,980
Now, it's with everyone.

292
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,279
Actually,

293
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:11,980
all but one.

294
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,380
Who? Is it a family member?

295
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,490
A friend?

296
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,990
You can't recognize your own mother,

297
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,089
so who's the person
you can recognize?

298
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,970
My strict former boss
taught me how to be patient,

299
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:36,039
and this item of clothing
represents my passion for...

300
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,410
How old are you?

301
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,579
I'm 29.

302
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,779
Is this HR's idea of a joke?

303
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,250
I told them to hire
those 26 or younger!

304
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,890
Sorry?

305
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:52,289
Well,

306
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,390
it was nice to meet you.

307
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,960
Sir, hang on.

308
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,230
Is it because of my age?

309
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,930
You know very well...

310
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,730
that the secretary
is the face of an office.

311
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,369
Dashing, slender,

312
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,210
and young and sweet.
That's how you should be.

313
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:12,539
Look at how dry and boring you seem.

314
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,109
Sir.

315
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,480
Which university did you graduate?

316
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,119
Me?

317
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,220
Harvard University.

318
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
How old are you?

319
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,319
I was born in 1958.

320
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,859
What time do you get off work?

321
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:31,190
It differs.

322
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,599
I work late often too.

323
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:36,900
Wait. What on earth is this?

324
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,539
I'm conducting
an interview of my own.

325
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,799
- What?
- It's not just for secretaries.

326
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,670
From now on,
I'll check if my future boss...

327
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,180
is competent, good-natured,
and has good conduct...

328
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,680
before I work for him or her.

329
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:49,880
How dare you insolent...

330
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,250
An executive is
the face of a company,

331
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,950
so he should be slender and...

332
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,119
Come back here.

333
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,250
I'd rather work
with someone fit and dashing too!

334
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,589
Come back here. Get back!

335
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,299
I hope I didn't wound his ego.

336
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,130
It's nice to say what's on my mind,

337
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,670
but I feel a little guilty.

338
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,279
Could this be another job interview?

339
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:30,250
Hello.

340
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,220
This is the inpatient ward
of Sangmo Hospital.

341
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,059
The patient won't answer his phone,

342
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,430
so I called you
as you're his guardian.

343
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,970
So this is the part
that will be operated on.

344
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,539
This is where the clip
that blocked your brain aneurysm is.

345
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:50,710
And this is...

346
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,180
the part that is in charge of
face recognition.

347
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,380
This is just an assumption,

348
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,880
but I think, when you fell,

349
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,420
the clip slipped
by the external shock,

350
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,150
narrowing the blood vessel connected
to the face recognition part.

351
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,059
So...

352
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:09,559
is this some kind of a disease then?

353
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,230
Prosopagnosia.

354
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,470
It's caused by a malfunction
of the brain part...

355
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,339
that is in charge of
face recognition.

356
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,970
Do you think
that I'm blind or something?

357
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,380
You might not recognize
the faces of the people you know...

358
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,779
and the face you saw just
a second ago might look strange...

359
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,079
after a blink.

360
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,819
When it gets worse,
all the people look...

361
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,420
All the people what?

362
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,089
Never mind.

363
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,119
That's a rare case.

364
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,059
And since the result of your
brain vessel test wasn't bad,

365
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,390
it's too early to judge anything.
Let's wait a few more days.

366
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,390
There are many people...

367
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,599
who temporarily show the symptoms,
but soon get well naturally.

368
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:48,869
Right.

369
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,799
I should get back to normal soon.

370
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,170
Who are you?

371
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,380
Gosh, you're really mad at me.

372
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:43,619
You must be really mad at me. How
could you pretend you don't know me?

373
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,789
You didn't even answer your phone.

374
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,220
Fine. I'm mad at you.

375
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,430
What happened yesterday?

376
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,960
I tried to call you I couldn't come,

377
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,029
but you wouldn't answer your phone.

378
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,970
But you came.

379
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:01,640
What?

380
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,910
You came.

381
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:09,849
Did you check the CCTV or what?

382
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,319
Actually, I almost went in,

383
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,319
but then I left because
Secretary Lee got in trouble.

384
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,059
Secretary Lee?

385
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,299
It's a long story.

386
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:27,400
I'm sorry.

387
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,470
Dae Ju.

388
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,470
You don't keep any secrets from me,
do you?

389
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,680
I do.

390
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,089
What is it?

391
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,019
Later.

392
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,460
I'll tell you at There.

393
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,299
What about you? You don't keep
any secrets from me, right?

394
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,700
I think I have one.
We can talk about it at There.

395
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:17,450
Oh, right. Do you really still
not need a driver?

396
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,720
I prefer a bicycle.

397
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,579
Why do you suddenly ask that?

398
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:24,150
I think I need to find
a driver urgently.

399
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,619
What a nice coincidence.

400
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,430
The father of my former driver
passed away...

401
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,589
and I'm going to his funeral today.

402
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,029
I'll ask around there.

403
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,450
Yes, Do Min Ik speaking.

404
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:54,180
Hello, this is General Manager Kim
from the art center.

405
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,589
I didn't hear anything
from Secretary Jeong.

406
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:58,150
I was wondering if you were
not coming to the opening.

407
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,519
Right. I'll be there on time.

408
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,690
Okay, Sir.

409
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,289
Wait.

410
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,430
May I ask...

411
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,700
what my mother is wearing today?

412
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:11,299
What she's wearing?

413
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,940
She's wearing
just a normal black jacket.

414
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,309
And she's wearing
a floral shawl on it.

415
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,509
Ms. Sim.

416
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,309
How about switching these two?

417
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:31,049
That sounds good.

418
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:34,619
Okay. Thank you.

419
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,329
A floral shawl. A floral shawl.

420
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,710
Hey! Come over here!

421
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,210
Are you okay?

422
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,309
Are you okay? Stand up.

423
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,210
There you go.

424
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:09,329
Hey! Wait for me!

425
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:14,130
What was that?

426
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,210
A floral shawl.

427
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,950
Please excuse me for a second.

428
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,519
You're here.

429
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,839
I'm here.

430
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,880
Congratulations on the exhibition.

431
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,680
I love you, as always.

432
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,019
Who are you?

433
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,829
What's wrong with him?

434
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,299
It's a sexual harassment.

435
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,299
Min Ik, what was that just now?

436
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:23,859
Min Ik.

437
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:36,369
He's an executive
of a mobile company.

438
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:38,880
Why is he not getting
a new phone already? Gosh.

439
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:42,109
You said I would go back to normal.
You said it was temporary!

440
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,650
What?

441
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,180
Isn't it Director Do's voice?

442
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,390
Have the symptoms gotten worse?

443
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,359
They're gone.

444
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,789
People's faces are
not just changing.

445
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:57,329
They totally disappeared.

446
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,859
I hoped it wouldn't get there.

447
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,430
Doctor. What's happening to me?

448
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,240
You promised me when I was seven.

449
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,710
You promised...

450
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:14,009
there would be no problem
with my brain anymore!

451
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,049
As it's deteriorating rapidly,

452
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:20,079
it's highly likely to be chronic.

453
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:31,589
Then give me a medication.

454
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,329
Why?

455
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,269
It can't be solved by medications?

456
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,210
Then do I need injections?

457
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:45,039
Do I need another surgery?

458
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,279
You fraud!

459
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:52,279
Medications can heal anything.

460
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,750
Surgeries can fix anything!

461
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,849
Dr. Park said he had met...

462
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,190
patients like you
in the United States.

463
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:05,160
He's coming back in a few days.
Let's see what we can do then.

464
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,859
Don't you remember?

465
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,930
You're a survivor from a very
dangerous surgery that could have...

466
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:12,869
taken your life,
when you were seven.

467
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,980
I don't want...

468
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:23,650
to be a survivor.

469
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,779
I don't want to pretend
like I'm not sick.

470
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,789
I don't want to do any of that.

471
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:33,990
So get me better again.

472
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
If you do that,

473
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,299
I'll give you my money,

474
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,069
my clothes,

475
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,299
and everything else...

476
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,400
I'll give you everything you want.

477
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:52,140
So just make me see
people's faces again!

478
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,619
You haven't found it yet?

479
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,930
We're checking the cars that have
been parked for a long period...

480
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,759
through dash cameras.

481
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,460
By the way,

482
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,269
I would like to meet that person.

483
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:53,740
I told you it's not Dae Ju.

484
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:55,640
Please make it quick.

485
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,880
I will catch the person
who did this to me. I'll ask him...

486
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,140
why he did that and what he wanted.

487
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,349
I need to see that person's face.

488
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,590
Why don't you get in?

489
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,539
To which floor are you going?

490
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,980
Could you press the button
to the rooftop?

491
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:40,579
Rooftop.

492
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,989
37th floor.

493
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,869
Who is it?

494
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,239
Who are you to come into my room
without permission?

495
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,250
It's me. Director Gi's secretary,
Lee Eul Wang.

496
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,719
You do recognize my face, right?

497
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:27,000
I didn't get much sleep last night.

498
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,199
By the way,

499
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,170
what brings you here
in the middle of the night?

500
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,670
Because of the joint meeting
next week.

501
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,579
Usually, Gal Hee and I set the date
according to your schedule,

502
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,510
but I couldn't hear anything
about your schedule.

503
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,349
My apologies.

504
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,380
I'll send it to you right away.

505
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:53,619
I heard you postponed
the secretary interviews.

506
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,099
I...

507
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,530
I had a situation.

508
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,400
I think you should find one soon.

509
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,570
The president election is
just around the corner.

510
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,139
It'll be hard on your own.

511
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:26,420
(Personal Contract, Jeong Gal Hee)

512
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:41,900
Secretary...

513
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,039
Experience...

514
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:50,409
Sir!

515
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,650
Oh, no.

516
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,380
Why would he just pass me?

517
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,789
They said if I don't get any answer
by today, it means I didn't get it.

518
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:04,389
What is this?

519
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,309
Money?

520
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,840
Did you finally see
how poor my life was?

521
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,389
Did you finally decide
to change my fate?

522
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,820
This is a lot of money.

523
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,230
What is this?

524
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:41,000
I know you are fired.

525
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,769
Therefore I command you
to have a compulsory holiday.

526
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:45,329
Rule number one. Don't work.

527
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,539
Rule number two. Don't work
until you use all the money here.

528
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,019
Jeong Jung Hee!

529
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:11,889
What is this?

530
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,969
I wanted it to be done quietly,
but I messed it up.

531
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:18,429
This is obviously a handwriting
of a blind person.

532
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,900
This can't be a handwriting
of a sighted person!

533
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,940
You do nothing but loaf around.
Where did you get the money...

534
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,340
No way.

535
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,880
Did you do
the part-time massage job again?

536
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,019
I told you not to do it.

537
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,789
I hate it...

538
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,059
when you massage
other people's body...

539
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:43,889
until your wrists turn
black and blue.

540
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,429
Do you know why Nam Hee
didn't make it?

541
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,269
Are you sure she didn't?

542
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,300
Yes. And it's because of you.

543
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,639
Because of me?

544
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,199
She didn't make it,
so you can take a break.

545
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:57,909
You have been living a hard life
to earn her tuition.

546
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,510
Now, you can take some rest.

547
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,650
- I don't care how I live...
- Listen.

548
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,949
From now on,

549
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,179
use this money
as if it's toilet papers.

550
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,190
This is not toilet paper.

551
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,519
It's your blood, sweat, and bruises.

552
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,460
All right, then.

553
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,289
Let's go...

554
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,960
somewhere else then.

555
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,199
What are you doing?

556
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:24,929
What are you doing?

557
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,000
You have no idea how blessed you are
to have vision.

558
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:35,110
Toilet papers belong to...

559
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,150
No way. You're not...

560
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,349
Stop!

561
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,760
You might want to see it
as you're a blind person,

562
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,730
but as a sighted person,
it's a horrible thing to see...

563
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,409
Make sure to be home late.

564
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,269
Nam Hee.

565
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,110
Well done.

566
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,210
Gosh.

567
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:44,880
Seriously.

568
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,050
Gosh.

569
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,059
(Jeong Gal Hee, I know you're fired.
Therefore I command you to have...)

570
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,099
(a compulsory holiday.
Rule number 1. Don't work.)

571
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:06,840
"I command you to have
a compulsory holiday."

572
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,489
Okay, fine. Let's have fun.

573
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,090
I'll do that.

574
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,860
I know how to have fun.

575
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:32,730
I'll spend all this money
to the last penny today.

576
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,039
See you.

577
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:50,010
Really? You're at Daehangno?

578
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,780
I envy you for getting fired,
Gal Hee.

579
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,710
You're able to watch plays
whenever you want now.

580
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,500
Gal Hee,
I need to follow President Sim...

581
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,530
to his dinner appointment.

582
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:17,000
Gosh, of course, you do.

583
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,869
You just had to be busy
on the day we agreed to meet.

584
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,179
But...

585
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,809
is it always so empty like this
on weekdays?

586
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,130
Hello, Director Do. You're here...

587
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,960
Yes, I'm here.

588
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,730
Gosh.

589
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:14,590
Did you...

590
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,230
buy all the tickets?

591
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:27,039
I didn't want to be around anyone.

592
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,280
This is why people don't like
being around you as well.

593
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,949
Enjoy the play.

594
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:38,179
No, wait.

595
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,590
I'm not here to watch the play.

596
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:47,590
Then why are you here?

597
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,260
I'm here to see you.

598
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:52,429
Me?

599
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,900
Why?

600
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:01,539
Secretary Jeong, congratulations!

601
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,239
I decided...

602
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,780
to hire you back.

603
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,019
(Employment Contract)

604
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:19,860
Get lost!

605
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,389
You begged me to hire you,
but now you want me to get lost?

606
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:25,329
You fired me with a smile,
and now you're congratulating me?

607
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:27,329
That was just
a small misunderstanding.

608
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:29,769
What are your conditions?

609
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:33,869
I'll add them as much as possible
on the contract.

610
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,010
Then...

611
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,340
is it okay if I interview you?

612
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,579
What? You want to do what?

613
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,380
Why did you come back for me?

614
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,349
Why do you suddenly want me back
after having me fired?

615
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,650
Well, that's because...

616
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,119
I realized once you were gone...

617
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:57,860
that you were...

618
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,130
that kind of person to me.

619
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,530
"That kind of person"?

620
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,739
What kind of person?

621
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,480
Someone...

622
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:16,880
important?

623
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,920
Someone grateful?

624
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,460
Or maybe...

625
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,099
Someone precious?

626
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,670
You're someone convenient.

627
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:55,380
Am I a loan service or something?

628
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,090
Or am I a toilet that flushes
on its own once you get up?

629
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:01,789
How can you call
a human being convenient?

630
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,590
Isn't that
a pretty amazing compliment?

631
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,789
Convenient...

632
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:08,699
is a word you would use
to describe a remote control.

633
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:11,230
A remote control you throw away
once it breaks!

634
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:16,039
You should go.

635
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,039
I decided to no longer
suppress my feelings.

636
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,949
And right now,
I'm enjoying my holiday.

637
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,610
A holiday?

638
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,059
Do you know why this is green?

639
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:35,690
That's because my brother...

640
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,659
worked so hard to earn this money
until his wrists turned green.

641
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,099
And a guy like that forced me...

642
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,130
to go on a holiday...

643
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:48,539
and told me to have some fun.

644
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,769
So I'm going to have
the time of my life.

645
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,639
I'm not going to care about
what others might think or feel...

646
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,710
and just do and say
whatever I want.

647
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:01,119
I'm going to sleep if I'm sleepy...

648
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,190
and wake up whenever I want to.

649
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,760
Go home safely.

650
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:13,599
I won't see you off.

651
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,179
Nam Hee, should we go to Hawaii?

652
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:37,489
What a joke.

653
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:39,860
What's wrong with her?

654
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,559
That's 1, 2, 3 zeros.

655
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,760
How about Jeju Island?

656
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,969
That must be the chicken.

657
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:09,519
Director Do?

658
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,269
I'm here to get interviewed
one more time.

659
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,309
I couldn't properly answer...

660
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:34,010
your question earlier
because I was too nervous.

661
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,610
That's a huge pity.

662
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,219
But Director Do,
you already failed the interview.

663
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:49,190
Can't you give me a second chance?

664
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,190
No.

665
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:53,630
Really? No?

666
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,760
Don't even get your hopes up.

667
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,469
What do you want me to do?

668
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:01,940
Having hope...

669
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,010
is the only thing I can do.

670
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:09,780
Gal Hee.

671
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,309
You're the only one I can see.

672
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:17,820
The faces of every single person
I know...

673
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:20,989
all disappeared from my head.

674
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:25,630
I can't even see my mom or Dae Ju.

675
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:29,559
But for some reason,

676
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,269
you're the only one I can see.

677
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,079
Let's take a look
at the first hotel!

678
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,610
You've all heard of it, right?

679
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,750
Here. Put it on top of this.

680
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,829
Jung Hee.

681
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:06,769
Is that why you were like that
at the hospital?

682
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:10,269
Apparently, it could get worse.

683
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,610
I might...

684
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:16,949
not ever get better.

685
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:20,550
I can't tell apart
those who are looking at me.

686
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:23,150
Are they laughing or crying?

687
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:26,619
Are they friend or foe?

688
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:29,659
That's why you are someone...

689
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:33,599
I desperately need.

690
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:37,500
Because I can't tell apart anything.

691
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,000
Spend that holiday of yours...

692
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,550
with me.

693
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,119
What's this?

694
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,380
(The Best Jokbal, Darn My Foot)

695
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,019
It's a bribe.

696
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,099
(The Best Jokbal, Darn My Foot)

697
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,909
You are someone...

698
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,619
I desperately need.

699
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,590
Unbelievable.

700
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:32,690
It's not like...

701
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,489
that would persuade me.

702
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:50,739
What are you two doing out here?

703
00:52:56,909 --> 00:52:57,949
What is it?

704
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,650
What?

705
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,389
You startled me!

706
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,619
- She got in.
- What?

707
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:07,989
Nam Hee got in!

708
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,000
Really? For real?

709
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:22,539
- Nam Hee did it!
- Gal Hee!

710
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,170
- Our Nam Hee did it.
- Jung Hee!

711
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,780
Did she get in?

712
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:40,190
Gal Hee,
will you pay for my tuition?

713
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:42,619
What?

714
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:47,230
Life always tests us.

715
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,030
I'll study hard...

716
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:51,630
and eradicate our lowly status.

717
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,800
I'll wash my life clean...

718
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:56,769
from being a slave and a lowlife.

719
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:01,010
I'll become the woman of power
that you've always wanted me to be.

720
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:03,449
And come back like a heroine.

721
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,179
Thank you, Gal Hee.

722
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:07,920
Thank you so much.

723
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,690
Jung Hee, gosh.

724
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:19,829
A life with breaks?

725
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,030
A life with free time?

726
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:25,570
That has never been allowed.

727
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:26,869
That's why...

728
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:28,239
We're sold out!

729
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:30,840
That's why our lives
have been tough.

730
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:33,409
The assistants of TnT Mobile...

731
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:35,679
weren't allowed even
the shortest breaks.

732
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:39,480
However, we now have
a waiting room of our own!

733
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:41,119
(Drivers' Waiting Room)

734
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:42,849
(One moment of patience may
ward off great disaster)

735
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:46,050
For the first time
since being founded...

736
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,719
If it weren't for Ms. Lee,

737
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:49,860
a waiting room would
never have been given...

738
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,960
to temporary employees like us.

739
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,760
She served both
Chairman Do and Director Gi...

740
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,530
and is the only full-time secretary
at this company.

741
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,570
Eul Wang Lee is her nickname
because she is...

742
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,369
the Queen of Subordinates.

743
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:05,170
Anyway, we have now put an end
to all those sorrows.

744
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:08,610
Gal Hee really wanted
to see this place finally open.

745
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:11,780
If she comes back, she'll be
solidifying her status as a minion.

746
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:14,250
Let's raise our glasses...

747
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,880
on this exciting day.

748
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:18,190
One moment of patience...

749
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:20,460
- may ward off great disaster.
- May ward off great disaster!

750
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:29,630
Director Do.

751
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,909
Dae Ju, is that you?

752
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,250
Who else would it be?

753
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,920
Stop playing jokes on me.

754
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,329
Let's meet at There tonight at 9pm.

755
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:02,030
I think I should tell you
what I was going to say that day.

756
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,570
Also, I left a gift for you
in your office.

757
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:12,710
- What?
- Get excited a little.

758
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,710
I'm sure you'll love it.

759
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,510
Good morning, Director Do!

760
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,849
You startled me.

761
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,119
So...

762
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,289
Does this mean you're back?

763
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:03,730
It is currently 12°C in Seoul.

764
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,800
The fine dust is at 20 micrograms
which is relatively low.

765
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,559
TnT Mobile's stock price...

766
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,269
rose 1.73 percent
in comparison to yesterday.

767
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:14,400
Blueberry yogurt and a cup
of flat white for your breakfast.

768
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:17,969
All media teams are scheduled
for a joint meeting at 2pm.

769
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:22,210
- Should we sign the contract first?
- No, we should shake hands.

770
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:24,650
Congratulations on
getting back to me.

771
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,530
He's here.

772
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,639
Sir,

773
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,010
take a look at this.

774
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,119
This man.

775
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,119
It's him, isn't it?

776
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,789
There sure is no one
to trust in this world.

777
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,869
Who is he?

778
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,710
He's your new driver.

779
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,750
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Do Min Ik.

780
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:34,949
It's nice to meet you too.

781
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:37,789
I'm Eun Jung Su.

782
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:42,659
Well, good luck
to the three of us then!

783
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,260
Go, go!

784
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,550
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

785
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:07,949
You'll go on a blind date.

786
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:09,750
What exactly do you look like?

787
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:12,719
I'm Veronica Park,
President of Cinepark.

788
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,519
75 percent of all murderers...

789
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:16,960
are the victims' acquaintances.

790
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,429
- Who are you?
- The police, sir.

791
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:20,530
On the 13th, 9pm, Kingdom Hotel.

792
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,500
I'm Veronica Park.

793
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,199
- I'm Gi Dae Ju of TnT Mobile.
- Gi Dae Ju?

794
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:26,769
Once I'm cured,

795
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:30,170
I will immediately
terminate our contract.
