1
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,950
I forgot how she looked.

2
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,320
Did she look like this?

3
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:51,359
Like this?

4
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,390
Or...

5
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,390
like this?

6
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,879
I wonder what she looks like.

7
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,930
I wanted to draw a face,
but I unconsciously drew a circle.

8
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:27,930
(Episode 4: I Wanted to Draw a Face,
but I Unconsciously Drew a Circle)

9
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,459
Nice to meet you.

10
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,730
Nice to meet you.

11
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,200
I am...

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,599
- I'm Veronica Park.
- Veronica Park.

13
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,359
Does she not like the food?

14
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,930
I can't lose points already.

15
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,129
My gosh.

16
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,069
Do you not like the food?

17
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:08,199
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,930
My stomach is all excited...

19
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:11,569
Pardon?

20
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:17,810
My stomach feels very comfortable.

21
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,639
It's what I eat all the time.

22
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,379
That's a relief.

23
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,620
I didn't know
what kind of wine you'd like.

24
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,750
I picked one
based on my own taste.

25
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,289
Armand de Brignac Blanc de Blancs.

26
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,889
You know very well.

27
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,560
Of course, I know.
I'm the one who ordered that.

28
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,759
It's quite affordable.

29
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,360
It's a 1,500-dollar wine.

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,599
And it has a very clean aftertaste.

31
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,669
I hope it's right.

32
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,969
I also enjoy it very often.

33
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,139
It's more like
I enjoyed ordering it often...

34
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:49,770
so you could drink it.

35
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,210
I see.

36
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,360
Should we clink glasses first?

37
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:11,759
Cheers to what?

38
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,629
Cheers to our first rendezvous.

39
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,000
"First rendezvous"?

40
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,009
She should've made a debut
as a girl group member.

41
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,379
I can't believe
she's stuck in an office.

42
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,620
Leave her be.

43
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:35,789
She's always quiet at work
because she walks on eggshells...

44
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:38,189
around her boss.
Imagine how stressed she must be.

45
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:51,800
Listen to me carefully, Ha Ni.

46
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,639
I don't want to get you involved
in anything.

47
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:57,310
So don't ever greet me
like you know me.

48
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:58,939
And regardless of
what I end up doing,

49
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,680
you must pretend
like you don't know anything.

50
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,750
Even if someone in this company
ends up dying.

51
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,120
No, no.

52
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,189
Hey, ladies!

53
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,329
Hey!

54
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,199
You said you'll be here in
15 minutes, but it took you 2 hours.

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,769
Gosh, I'm really sorry.

56
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,370
I had to take care of something.

57
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,269
By the way, where's Gal Hee?

58
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,779
She left after she got a phone call,
and we can't even reach her.

59
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:33,209
I'm worried that she might've left
without even paying.

60
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,050
You guys should be
more understanding.

61
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,420
I'm pretty sure she's busy
slaving away for her boss.

62
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,079
You should feel sorry for her.

63
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,790
I'm sorry, but can you
pick that up for me?

64
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,160
I'm sure you already know this,
but I never...

65
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,759
had to bend down in front of anyone
in my entire life.

66
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,470
The rumors were right.
She really is an annoying brat.

67
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,769
Yes, of course.
I'll pick it up for you.

68
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,639
Excuse me.

69
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,110
Thank you.

70
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,649
My goodness.

71
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,529
Can you wipe this off for me too?

72
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,899
I'm sure you already know this,
but I never...

73
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,730
had to do anything myself
during my entire life.

74
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,990
Are you okay now?

75
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,519
No way. Is this peanut?

76
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Spit it out.

77
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,790
Did you spit everything out?

78
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,060
You should rinse your mouth. Hurry.

79
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,060
Okay.

80
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,699
What... What's the matter?

81
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:32,829
It's peanut.

82
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,370
They said it'll be garlic sauce.
Why did they serve peanut sauce?

83
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,769
Is there sauce on your mouth?

84
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,680
Do you have a rash?
Are you burning up?

85
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,740
I'm okay, but you...

86
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:49,050
caught it with your hand.

87
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,689
I can't believe myself.

88
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,629
It's as if I'm destined to be
a minion...

89
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,589
regardless of
whatever situation I'm in.

90
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,899
Why did I catch the food
he was eating with my hand?

91
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,540
A conglomerate's daughter
would never do something like that.

92
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,040
Secretary Jeong.

93
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,810
You just had a meal
you'll never be able to afford.

94
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,879
Now, let's wrap things up
and call it a night...

95
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,220
before your boss begins
to get suspicious of you.

96
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,100
What was that?
Is she just being fake?

97
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,300
I can't believe she caught
what I was eating with her hand.

98
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,490
Are you okay?

99
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,360
No problem.

100
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,459
By the way, how did you know
that I'm allergic...

101
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,230
to peanuts?

102
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:13,529
What?

103
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,399
Your secretary.

104
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,509
Your secretary told me...

105
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,579
when I talked to her over the phone
regarding our rendezvous.

106
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:28,110
- Oh, Secretary Jeong?
- Yes.

107
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:31,180
Should we go now?

108
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,120
Wait. I'll ask them
to have your car ready.

109
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,750
- What's your license plate number?
- What?

110
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,490
Well, my car...

111
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,129
I do have a car.

112
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,559
But I thought I might have
a few drinks,

113
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,100
so I didn't drive here.

114
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,240
Don't you have a driver?

115
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,740
What? A driver?

116
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,610
Yes, I have one.

117
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:56,570
I do have a driver.

118
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,110
But I sent him on vacation.

119
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,210
He hasn't been able to rest
for a long time.

120
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,750
Then I shouldn't have told
my driver to leave.

121
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,450
Actually, this hotel provides
a limousine service.

122
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,450
No.

123
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,690
I didn't know that.

124
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,129
I'll just walk home.

125
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,929
- You're going to walk?
- Yes.

126
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:19,399
I heard it's going to rain soon.

127
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,799
Well, the thing is,
I must've eaten way too fast.

128
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,700
I feel a little bloated.

129
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,710
When will I ever get a chance
to walk...

130
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,379
if not today?

131
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,779
- Then I'll walk with you.
- What?

132
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:38,250
I was also feeling
a little bloated myself.

133
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,950
Let's go.

134
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,769
Why would you need
something like this?

135
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,340
When it comes to people like us,
our parents are our business cards.

136
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,779
- Who's your father?
- I don't know.

137
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,279
I never had a father.

138
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,220
My mom raised me all by herself.

139
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,120
Then who's your mother?

140
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,789
Back when she was alive,
she used to work at TnT Mobile...

141
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,250
as Chairman Do's secretary.

142
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,990
And she passed away
when I was a senior in high school.

143
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,629
Then your grandfather must've been
someone very impressive.

144
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:26,200
Yes, he was a very impressive man.

145
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,399
He was a farmer
who grew chili peppers,

146
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,470
and he managed to send
all his six children to college.

147
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:32,840
Chili peppers?

148
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,169
What's wrong?

149
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,409
Do you not like my business card?

150
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,840
Don't worry.

151
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,309
If your business card is lame,
I'll find something from your face.

152
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,580
If your face is lousy,
I'll find something from your body.

153
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,149
I manage to find out any charm
a man may hold no matter what.

154
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:47,750
I have such an amazing talent,
you see.

155
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,220
Still, I want you
to like me for my business card.

156
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,559
I turned out pretty well
growing up without a dad.

157
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,730
And I lived tenaciously
even after my mom died.

158
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,830
The country's overall household debt
is 140 million dollars,

159
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,399
but I'm free from debt
and have a great job.

160
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,529
Isn't my business card good enough?

161
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,970
Don't you think
President Sim Hae Yong should...

162
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,669
get some credit
for your business card?

163
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,340
He set me up with you
instead of his own nephew.

164
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:15,149
I guess it's a bigger deal
worth more than a designer bag.

165
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,450
("Is YK Mobile Getting
the Exclusive Run of Cinepark?")

166
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,620
Why don't you work on that?

167
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:27,960
Me?

168
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,429
If you want the Media divisions
to be combined successfully,

169
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,100
you'll have to make
some contribution.

170
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,909
This is the project proposal
for the exclusive run of Cinepark.

171
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,610
Too bad.

172
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,610
I don't meet people after six.

173
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,350
I only meet guys.

174
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,250
Then I'll visit you
before six sometime.

175
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,549
As a person.

176
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:55,850
Why don't we have
some drinks now instead?

177
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,220
As a guy.

178
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,120
- I can't.
- Why not?

179
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,490
I'm paying for this
with the company credit card.

180
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:05,659
I'm not supposed to drink
with the company's money.

181
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,269
Then I'll buy our drinks, baby.

182
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,070
Water is fine.

183
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,639
Don't you think
I'm doing this for a reason?

184
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,679
Don't you think...

185
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,649
you might ruin everything
by acting like that?

186
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,820
- I don't.
- Why not?

187
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,720
I heard you are quite unique,

188
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,259
but I believe you have
your own standards.

189
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,529
Even in a movie made with
a lot of money and good actors,

190
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,899
you sort out the flaws in the film.

191
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,330
And even in a low-budget movie
of an unknown director,

192
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,769
you find out
its strength and merits.

193
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,940
You're truly worth being called
the Master of Movie Success.

194
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:51,710
I almost grinned hearing that.

195
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:55,350
- Pardon?
- I don't believe in papers.

196
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,750
I only believe in money.

197
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:01,350
I'll read it. If it's trash,
I'll throw it out.

198
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,519
If it seems lucrative,
I'll give you a call.

199
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,120
All right then.

200
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:27,240
What's going on?
How much longer do I have to walk?

201
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,850
What if he walks to my place?

202
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:43,929
It's raining.

203
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,980
Why are you...

204
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,909
What?

205
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,659
Give me that. I'm a man.
I should hold it.

206
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,259
How's your stomach?

207
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,070
You said you were feeling bloated.
How do you feel now?

208
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,370
Maybe it's because I skipped lunch?

209
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,769
I often have indigestion
after dinner these days.

210
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,440
You skipped lunch? Why?

211
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,549
My secretary usually gets me lunch,

212
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:12,820
and I eat it in my office.

213
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:17,190
But she was out
during the lunch hour today.

214
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,519
Well...

215
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,460
You can't even have lunch
without your secretary?

216
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:27,399
You could go to the cafeteria
or restaurants in the neighborhood.

217
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,129
I know. But...

218
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:35,240
Eating lunch looking
at people's faces is...

219
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,240
I'm a little tired of it.

220
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,950
Oh, I see.

221
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,919
You should press here.

222
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,690
My mom used to do it
for indigestion when I was young.

223
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,490
Chairman Park Seok Ja did?

224
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,370
My mom is indeed a chairman.

225
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,940
So... Like this?

226
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,409
No. Look.

227
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,409
From inside. Press it hard.

228
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,419
My mom used to chant...

229
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,649
some weird spell doing this.

230
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:29,429
Go down. Go down.

231
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,559
It shall go down
as if there's oil in it.

232
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,970
Stop bothering my girl...

233
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,769
and go down immediately.

234
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:41,769
It came out!

235
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,169
Well... Excuse me.

236
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,779
I guess it's working.
Let me do it again.

237
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,289
I wonder...

238
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,160
what she looks like.

239
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,569
Why are you staring at me like that?

240
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,740
Well... Nothing.

241
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:23,680
You're just different
from what I expected.

242
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,789
I mean, it's raining now.

243
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,759
Shall we go now?

244
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,190
Taxi.

245
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,500
I'll take you home.

246
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,769
No, no.

247
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,900
I don't like to owe anyone.

248
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,119
Mr. Do Min Ik.

249
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,819
Yes?

250
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,589
It was...

251
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,220
nice meeting you.

252
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,289
And I'm sorry.

253
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:13,230
I'm the one who should apologize.

254
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,000
What did he say?

255
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,869
Chairman Park.

256
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,869
You're reaching the climax
without an intro again.

257
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:55,440
Aren't you supposed
to say hello to me first?

258
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,579
I just can't wait.
I don't care about the intro.

259
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:00,079
Saying hello, my foot.

260
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,680
You heard that
they met last night, right?

261
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,619
What did your daughter say?

262
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:13,019
Her nickname is Suction Pump.
I don't care what she says.

263
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,930
What matters is
what your son said.

264
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,369
Well... More than he thought,
your daughter was...

265
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,269
She was nice.

266
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,039
What?

267
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,099
It's okay, Jeong Gal Hee.

268
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:55,400
Just think that it was just
a novel and forget about it.

269
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,400
Just think that it was a dream.

270
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,140
Forget all about it.

271
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:01,609
Gosh.

272
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,539
Why did I do that?
I must've been crazy.

273
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,680
Really crazy!

274
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,220
How am I going to see his face?

275
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,119
I can't believe this. My gosh.

276
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,789
What do you want to forget?

277
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:21,490
Did you have a nightmare last night?

278
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,460
Why did you come so early?

279
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,630
You didn't have coffee yet, right?

280
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,529
I did.

281
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,240
Because you don't get me coffee
before office hours.

282
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,170
- What about your shoes?
- I polished them already.

283
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:40,539
You said you didn't take personal
orders that are not work-related.

284
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,549
Did you feed the fish?
Did you water the plants?

285
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:46,220
Please let me do something.

286
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,519
Well...

287
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:53,519
I think the light in my room
went out.

288
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,089
Okay. I will go buy a new one
right away.

289
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:03,970
Secretary Jeong.

290
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,170
Yes.

291
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:10,009
I know that you don't want
to see my face.

292
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:14,309
But I would like you
to look at my face when you work.

293
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,809
Okay.

294
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,549
Unfortunately,

295
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,720
you're the only one I can see.

296
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,990
Okay.

297
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:28,829
(Veronica Park)

298
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,890
See you!

299
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,200
Hello.

300
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,569
Hello.

301
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,039
It's me.

302
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:47,009
This reminds me of the old days.

303
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,250
If you had a fun night,

304
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,319
it's time to match our alibis.

305
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,390
I hope you did your share
for no consequences, right?

306
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,789
It's right up your alley.

307
00:21:58,819 --> 00:21:59,819
Well...

308
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,859
It looks like the appointment was
arranged by both your mothers.

309
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,170
If we told them
you did not show up at all,

310
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,799
it would have upset the chairman,

311
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:12,970
and my boss would have thought
he got stood up.

312
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,539
That's why I couldn't tell them so.

313
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,079
So?

314
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,710
So, I thought...

315
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,579
maybe I should ask
for my boss' understanding...

316
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,049
and tell them
that you met each other.

317
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,690
So you told them I was there.

318
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,890
Yes.

319
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:41,829
I told them
you actually met each other.

320
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,640
Hello?

321
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:53,440
Well done.

322
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,980
Then I should tell my family
the same.

323
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,250
Just give me...

324
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,819
that man's phone number.

325
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:01,819
What?

326
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,920
Why do you want
my boss' phone number?

327
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,259
I didn't mean your boss.

328
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,799
(Project Proposal, TnT Mobile)

329
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,140
Doesn't this place
remind you of the old days?

330
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:21,869
I used to come here on my payday.

331
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,279
Back when your mother and I worked
for Chairman Do Wan Bae.

332
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,150
I remember the time.

333
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:31,450
After my mother passed away,
I had no money to go study abroad.

334
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,319
But then Chairman Do paid
the tuition for me.

335
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,390
You and I came here, ordered a lot
of pork cutlets, and celebrated it.

336
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,990
I can't forget that day.

337
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,190
Because of you...

338
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,789
Because of me, what?

339
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:46,900
Because of you, I was so happy.

340
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,440
- Dae Ju.
- Yes, Eul Wang.

341
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,109
You know,

342
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,480
no matter what happens,
I'm on your side.

343
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,240
And no matter what happens,
you're on my side.

344
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,089
Why is this here?

345
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,460
Goodness.

346
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,799
I thought I lost it. Maybe I didn't.

347
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:32,779
(Romi, the Licking Dog)

348
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:37,809
But I lost it.

349
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,589
What happened?

350
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
You're back early.

351
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,390
Yes. Hey.

352
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,900
Why is this here?

353
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,400
What? The USB stick?

354
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,630
You gave it to me
and said I should watch it.

355
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,640
You said the dog looked
just like the dog we had.

356
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,039
Why?

357
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,309
Never mind.

358
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,579
Hey, let's not get distracted
by other things today.

359
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,180
I'd like to hear
your precious secret.

360
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,289
- Min Ik.
- Yes.

361
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:24,630
I'm quitting the company.

362
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,829
Why do you talk nonsense
with such a serious face?

363
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,900
I wanted to tell you first
before I hand in my resignation.

364
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,339
I'll be working
only until the next month.

365
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,710
Why?

366
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:44,579
Why?

367
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:47,180
The world is a big place.

368
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,250
I can go to the Maldives
and have a glass of mojito.

369
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,519
I can film a road movie
with a strange woman.

370
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,089
No, you can't.

371
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,470
Min Ik.

372
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,569
You have been with me
for over 20 years since we were 7.

373
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,109
You can't just hand in a resignation
without discussing it with me.

374
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,170
I won't let you.

375
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:13,740
I have been with you for 27 years
since we were 7.

376
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,680
Don't you think it's time for us
to go separate ways?

377
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,079
No. I need you.
I'm putting my foot down.

378
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,150
End of conversation. See you.

379
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:23,890
Until when do I have to stay
as your minion?

380
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,059
Excuse me?

381
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,400
Please let me go, Min Ik.

382
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
That's the only way you'll live.

383
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,970
The light is still out.

384
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,410
She said she would call
the technicians.

385
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,289
Yes, come in.

386
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,730
What brings you here?

387
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,339
You left this in the car.

388
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:48,299
Oh, right. Thank you.

389
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,279
Why did you not turn the light on?

390
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,720
I think the light went off.
It won't turn on.

391
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,119
You can leave now.

392
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,750
I can go home by myself.

393
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,059
Okay, then.

394
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:12,630
Thank you.

395
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:19,470
100 dollars, 110 dollars,
120 dollars...

396
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,470
Here's more.

397
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:29,549
I see you're charging me
the parking fee as well.

398
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,319
You're lucky we're not charging you
for the clothes...

399
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,819
and the hairdo we did for you.

400
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,789
I'm sorry about
what happened yesterday.

401
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,500
Let's go. Let's eat some jokbal
with this money.

402
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,569
I'll catch up with you.
I need to bring my office bag.

403
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,019
The car key.

404
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,079
Who are you?

405
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,859
Is that...

406
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,170
you?

407
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,740
It's you, isn't it?

408
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:36,509
How did you get in here?

409
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:51,849
- Who are you?
- No!

410
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,359
Secretary Jeong, this is the man.

411
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,599
This man is the man
who tried to kill me.

412
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,930
Sir, please put it back.

413
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:04,130
It's your driver.

414
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,700
What?

415
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,710
But...

416
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
This cap...

417
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,650
and the box cutter.

418
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,779
It's just a common box cutter.

419
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:21,150
Everyone has one
in their desk drawer.

420
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,150
But he is...

421
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:37,599
Are you okay?

422
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,599
I'm okay.

423
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,410
Did you get hurt?

424
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,509
But...

425
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,480
what were you doing...

426
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,579
in my room?

427
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,680
I said you could leave earlier.

428
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:56,119
Because of the light.

429
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,359
It looked like
the light was troubling you.

430
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:02,529
I know how to fix lights,

431
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,359
so I was trying to fix it.

432
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,529
But why did you
not answer me earlier?

433
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,339
Sir, it's blood!

434
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,809
It's blood!

435
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,089
- 9 times 9 equals?
- 81.

436
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,019
- 2 times 9 equals?
- 18!

437
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,960
Am I doing the CT scan?

438
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,960
You don't need a CT scan for
a tiny scratch from a box cutter.

439
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,730
You should know you're lucky
that we had an extra patient room.

440
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:44,170
Then give me some medications
and fix it.

441
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,710
I almost killed my driver.

442
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,740
Are you going to send me
some tofu...

443
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,180
when I go to a prison?

444
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,349
Do you still not see anyone?

445
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,750
I still can see...

446
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,390
only one person.

447
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,490
That's all I can see.

448
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,319
Take a good rest today.

449
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,230
Dr. Park finally arrived
from the United States,

450
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,000
so you can see him tomorrow
before you leave.

451
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,559
Make sure you have someone
to nurse you.

452
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
There comes the person.

453
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,000
Hi.

454
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,269
That's person who will nurse me.

455
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,339
You should ask the police
for help again.

456
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,910
You've become too sensitive because
you couldn't catch the criminal.

457
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,279
That's why this all happened.

458
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,549
I know.

459
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
Excuse me.

460
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,089
Mr. Eun.

461
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,890
How do you feel?

462
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:53,869
Well...

463
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:59,509
I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

464
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,579
It's okay.
I also didn't recognize you...

465
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:08,280
because it was dark.

466
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:13,119
Thank you for your understanding.

467
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,000
Then I wish you take a good rest.

468
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,500
Feel free to call me
whenever you need me.

469
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,360
I found it, boss.

470
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,599
Do you feel all right?

471
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,070
Yes.

472
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:06,079
There is a blanket over there.

473
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,239
- You can go there and...
- Oh, no.

474
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:11,280
It's so late already. I have to go.

475
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,750
Are you...

476
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:16,750
Are you leaving?

477
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,190
Of course you should go.

478
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,329
It's way past the time
you're supposed to leave.

479
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,869
Of course you should leave.

480
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:34,840
Secretary Jeong.

481
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,769
Yes, sir.

482
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:42,480
It's late. Take a taxi home.

483
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:45,650
It's okay, sir.
I have a long way to go.

484
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,079
Just do it.

485
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,619
- You don't have to worry about...
- Of course I'm worried about you.

486
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,559
Can't you see me?

487
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,989
Without you, I have no idea
if I'm talking to a human, a monkey,

488
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,090
a goblin, or a ghost.

489
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:05,769
Take a taxi home.

490
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,769
If something happens to you,

491
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,280
I will have no one...

492
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,510
beside me.

493
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,690
Jung Hee! Nam Hee!

494
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,630
I'm sorry.

495
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,929
I can explain why I'm late.

496
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,360
I'm sure something happened
to your boss.

497
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,929
And you lost track of time
while handling the situation.

498
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,099
Thank you.

499
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,739
Although my legs can't rest,
my mouth can rest...

500
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:43,869
thanks to you two.

501
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:50,010
Here you go.

502
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,210
What is it?

503
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,320
Since you're going abroad, I got you
a present. With a sim card in it,

504
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,289
you can use it
in foreign countries too.

505
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,260
Give me the old one
and take this.

506
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,389
Yes!

507
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:16,739
Gal Hee, don't you shed
a single tear drop.

508
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,010
Crying in the airport.

509
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:21,010
That's what people who haven't
been on an airplane do.

510
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:22,449
Nam Hee!

511
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,820
Go see the big world
I haven't seen.

512
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,880
Be the master, not the slave.

513
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,320
Be the upper class,
not the lower class.

514
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,690
You have to return home in glory
as a heroine.

515
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,389
Say bye to Mom.

516
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,199
Stop imagining things.

517
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,730
Mom is not here.

518
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,369
Just because we can't see her
doesn't mean she's not here.

519
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,969
Are you saying...

520
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:46,769
Mom, us, and everyone
doesn't exist to him?

521
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:54,639
Mom is always watching us
wherever we are.

522
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:58,610
So say bye to her before you leave.

523
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,829
I'm not good at saying goodbye.

524
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,300
Let's just say bye here.

525
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,869
Gal Hee, listen to me.

526
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:23,070
The people who have belittled you...

527
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,909
and harassed you.

528
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,980
I'm going to make them kneel down
in front of you at any cost.

529
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,750
So if you ever...

530
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,820
get disappointed by me,

531
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,590
please understand.

532
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,719
Please understand
that it was for all of our sakes.

533
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,630
Stop saying nonsense.

534
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,400
Just go.

535
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:48,900
Just go already.

536
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,079
She's there.

537
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,090
- Nam Hee.
- This way.

538
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,289
Take care.

539
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,500
Is everything all right?

540
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,070
I think I have an upset stomach.

541
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,070
Can I get a digestive?

542
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,539
I'll go ask.

543
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:29,610
When is your guardian coming?

544
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:31,510
I need to give this to her.

545
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,710
- I'll give it to her.
- Sure.

546
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:40,449
(Guardian pass)

547
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,789
Guardian...

548
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,760
If I do that,

549
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:51,860
will I truly become
a part of this family?

550
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,030
You will at least be
a part of her family.

551
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,570
Until when do I need to be
your minion?

552
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:04,409
(Guardian's Pass)

553
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,610
Go down. Go down.

554
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,309
It shall go down
as if there's oil in it.

555
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,579
Stop bothering my girl...

556
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,190
and go down immediately.

557
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:47,280
I wonder what she looks like.

558
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,800
This is so old.

559
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:11,099
I should've gotten
a new one for her sooner.

560
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,789
Give me that. I'm a man.
I should hold it.

561
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:37,760
I didn't know that.

562
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,800
I always thought
it was something I had to do.

563
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:55,139
It's raining.

564
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,449
I wonder if Director Do is
doing okay.

565
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:18,000
Do you think the PCA is the problem?

566
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,030
(PCA: Posterior cerebral artery)

567
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,940
It's hard to find a patient
with such severe symptoms...

568
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,010
of prosopagnosia in our country.

569
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:26,309
Yes, I think you're right.

570
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,880
I also treated a similar patient...

571
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,480
back when I worked in the States.

572
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,079
What happened to that patient?

573
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,320
He still has the same symptoms.

574
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,360
Then...

575
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:43,559
is there no way to get better?

576
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,099
We could try removing the clip.

577
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:48,760
If we remove the clip
and do a vascular bypass,

578
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,269
your prosopagnosia
might get better. But...

579
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:52,840
But?

580
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:56,309
But it might cause
other side-effects.

581
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:57,769
And even if we remove it,

582
00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:00,480
we can't guarantee
that you'll get better.

583
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:05,250
You know better than anyone...

584
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,280
about how dangerous
a brain surgery can be.

585
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:10,719
Would you open your skull just so
you could see people's faces again?

586
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,619
I'm not sure.

587
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:15,519
I wouldn't recommend it.

588
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:23,829
At this rate,

589
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,969
I'll end up forgetting my own face.

590
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,530
I'd like to cancel
a cell phone number.

591
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,599
Well...

592
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,739
I'm sorry. I'll call you back later.
Bye.

593
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:46,349
Come in.

594
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,420
Director Do, you're here.

595
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,719
Yes, I'm here.

596
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,829
Was everything okay yesterday?

597
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,530
Did Chief Director Sim
come visit you at night?

598
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,440
Oh, right. Can you find out...

599
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,409
the brand name of the bed they use
at the hospital?

600
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,880
It's been so long
since I slept so well.

601
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,579
I didn't even notice
if anyone visited me or not.

602
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,050
I guess I was worried for nothing.

603
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:26,920
Give me Veronica Park's number.

604
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,030
Why aren't you answering me?

605
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:34,329
Why do you want her number?

606
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,000
You told me that you're not
going to see her again.

607
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:42,969
Are you angry at me right now?

608
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:45,570
No, I mean... I heard rumors...

609
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,610
saying she has 10 cell phones.

610
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:50,150
It's really hard to get
her personal number.

611
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,110
Everyone calls her secretary, but...

612
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,420
Call her secretary.
I'll ask her myself.

613
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,889
0108246...

614
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:01,260
What? I thought you didn't know.

615
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,960
I said it's hard to get her number.
I never said I didn't know.

616
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:07,699
Here.

617
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,500
She probably won't pick up
even if you call her.

618
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:16,940
But I guess I should still tell you.

619
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:19,809
Okay.

620
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,880
No, it can't be.

621
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,820
Director Do...

622
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,590
isn't the type of guy
to call a woman first.

623
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,619
No.

624
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,429
Let's stay calm. I need to be calm.

625
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,369
It's okay.

626
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,469
I don't need to pick up.
I'll just ignore it.

627
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,679
(Missed call)

628
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,119
I hope he doesn't call again.

629
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,190
Oh, right. I can text him.

630
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,489
Yes, I should just leave him a text.
Let's text him.

631
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,670
Because of my busy schedule,

632
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:21,070
I won't be able to...

633
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:22,340
Hello?

634
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:27,539
Is this Veronica Park's number?

635
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:29,650
- Hello?
- Did I just answer his call?

636
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:36,420
"Sol".

637
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,690
Veronica Park speaking. Who is this?

638
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,219
Hello.

639
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,989
I'm Do Min Ik from TnT Mobile.
We met last time.

640
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,599
Oh, right. Do Min Ik.

641
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:52,730
Yes, that's right.
I'm not interrupting you, am I?

642
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:54,639
I was wondering...

643
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,909
if you're free tonight.

644
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,079
I actually have
a very important schedule tonight.

645
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,610
I'll be working until very late.

646
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,150
May I ask why you called?

647
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,250
Well,

648
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,349
I wanted to return your umbrella.

649
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:12,719
The yellow umbrella I took
when we met last time.

650
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,019
Oh, the umbrella.

651
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:19,929
I always throw my umbrellas away
after using them once.

652
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,199
Go to the nearest trash can
and just throw it away.

653
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,130
I understand what you mean,

654
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,829
but I don't think I should be
the one who throws it away.

655
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:29,769
If you're at work,
I'll drop by and give it to you.

656
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:35,679
No, no. You can't come to my office.

657
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,909
Then...

658
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,579
should we meet
in front of your house?

659
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:40,579
No, no.

660
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:42,920
That's going to be
even more difficult.

661
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,750
Then how about we meet at 6pm
at Kingdom Hotel once more?

662
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:52,989
Hello?

663
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,769
Yes. I'll see you there...

664
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,340
Did she get cut off?

665
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,239
What's the matter, Director Do?

666
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,380
Do you need anything?

667
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:16,349
Why are you turning
your back on me?

668
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,289
Are you being like this...

669
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:20,719
because you don't
want to see my face?

670
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:24,030
What are you talking about?

671
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,400
I guess the chair is broken.

672
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,860
It's not rotating.

673
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,030
This is a contract from SBC.

674
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,869
Have the legal team review it.

675
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:35,000
Okay.

676
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:42,579
What? Do you have
anything to tell me?

677
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,349
I didn't,

678
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:47,480
but I just got one.

679
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,420
I should...

680
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,889
take this afternoon off.

681
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,519
Doctor Park.

682
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,230
About the patient with prosopagnosia
you saw in the States.

683
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,090
I heard he once
recognized people's faces.

684
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,199
Oh, right.

685
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:03,829
The problem with that patient
was that the clip slipped...

686
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:05,429
and that reduced...

687
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,570
blood flow to the fusiform gyrus,

688
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,300
which is the face recognition part.

689
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:11,610
But when the blood pressure goes up,

690
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:14,710
blood flows into the part again.

691
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,980
So I think the function returned...

692
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,150
for a very short period of time.

693
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,179
Wait.

694
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,650
You're saying,
the patient can recognize faces...

695
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:23,849
if his blood pressure goes up?

696
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,219
Yes.

697
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:27,360
Can you tell me when it happened?

698
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,719
When did the patient
recognize faces?

699
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,329
I heard it happened three times.

700
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,800
The first time was
during his speech at graduation.

701
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:38,099
Blood pressure normally goes up...

702
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:39,400
when a person feels
nervous or excited.

703
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,239
The second time was...

704
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,210
when he stayed up
three nights working.

705
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,670
And the last one was...

706
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,679
Gosh.

707
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:48,909
When was it?

708
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:51,849
Why does this dress
have holes on it?

709
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:53,550
What do I do?

710
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,820
She's somewhat busy and anxious.

711
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,030
What's all the fuss?

712
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,460
You're so lucky that you can't see.

713
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,400
Your sister is doing
something stupid.

714
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,539
Hey.

715
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,369
I'm sorry.

716
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:22,909
What did you do?
Your skin is so moist.

717
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:24,880
It feels refreshing, right?

718
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:29,949
It's Nam Hee.

719
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:33,420
Hey, Nam Hee.
Did you arrive safely?

720
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:35,590
Of course.

721
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,429
The air in Pennsylvania is...

722
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,429
I'm sorry, Nam Hee.

723
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,199
I have to go out now.

724
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,429
- Okay.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

725
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:44,599
Okay. Call me.

726
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:45,730
Bye.

727
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:18,369
(President Sim Hae Yong)

728
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,949
Hello, Director Park.

729
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,250
What?

730
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,179
There's a rumor like that?

731
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,090
No, I've never heard that before.

732
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,519
I saw Director Do Min Ik
attack his driver.

733
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,489
Okay. I'll look into it
and get back to you.

734
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,769
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

735
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,539
Hi.

736
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:04,849
I had you arrive
at 6:05pm on purpose.

737
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:07,420
If you arrived before that,
you would've talked about work.

738
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,090
You didn't have to get me a ride.

739
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,489
I got strong legs
from my grandfather.

740
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,260
That's not the only thing I did.

741
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,199
I ordered some food and drinks.
Everything is ready.

742
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,269
You can't make an excuse saying...

743
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:27,440
that you can't buy me a drink today.

744
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,469
By the way, what is this?

745
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,539
It's filmed by a famous director.
It looks amazing, doesn't it?

746
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,679
This is what I do.

747
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:40,820
The more you're exposed,
the more you become attached.

748
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,849
People in this country are
used to cramming education.

749
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,860
I didn't tell you I went to
college in the States.

750
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,170
Did you read it?

751
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,329
No. I just opened the envelop.

752
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,809
I just open the envelop
after our first meeting.

753
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,840
I'll read the first page
after the second meeting.

754
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,679
And the second page after that.

755
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,110
- So this is...
- It has 30 pages.

756
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:16,550
Then we should meet
at least 30 times.

757
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:19,119
What do you think of my proposal?

758
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:21,590
Let's do that.

759
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:25,929
What? Why is it so easy?
It's less interesting this way.

760
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:29,199
Because we're not
going to meet 30 times.

761
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,969
Once you read the first page,
you will turn the page immediately.

762
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,300
You'll get curious.

763
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,170
I see your amazing grandfather
who raised chili peppers...

764
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,510
passed down a lot
of confidence to you as well.

765
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,510
We will see
if I get curious or not...

766
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,650
once I read the first page.

767
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,449
Look.

768
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,659
Your phone number.

769
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,590
I just deleted it.

770
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,960
From now on, if you want to
send me a project proposal,

771
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,829
you will have to call me yourself.

772
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:06,840
I was kind of caught off guard
on our first meeting.

773
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,099
But I'm the Master of Movie Success.

774
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:13,610
I'm not a woman
who calls a guy first.

775
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:17,679
Well... If you want,

776
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:21,849
I guess I can move onto
the second page immediately.

777
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,489
What do you think?

778
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:24,889
I don't think so.

779
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,650
Why not?

780
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:32,489
Secretary Lee, did you
check the message board?

781
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,599
Director Gi.

782
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,900
I'm sorry, but I have to
hang up the phone now.

783
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:38,869
Yes.

784
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:45,409
Why? Did your boss call you
to match alibis?

785
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:47,780
It was about work.

786
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,010
On May 6, Monday, where were you?

787
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,150
I went to...

788
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,480
my parent's house in Hwangcheon.

789
00:56:57,389 --> 00:57:00,460
Did you meet Director Gi Dae Ju...

790
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,590
that day?

791
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:07,000
Did you?

792
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:18,139
It's okay. I'll just
get my umbrella back...

793
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,670
and go home.

794
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,920
So, Mom,

795
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,820
please let it slide this once.

796
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,690
Today will be...

797
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:40,860
the last time.

798
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,599
I remember that.

799
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:51,940
The last moment when the patient
recognized people's faces.

800
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:54,340
When was it?

801
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:02,420
Min Ik.

802
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:07,590
Veronica Park?

803
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:09,719
Yes.

804
00:58:11,389 --> 00:58:12,389
But...

805
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,829
where's the umbrella?

806
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,869
I didn't bring it.

807
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:20,800
I wasn't going to bring it
in the first place.

808
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:28,409
Then why did you want to see me?

809
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,289
Because I have an indigestion.

810
00:58:38,989 --> 00:58:39,989
What?

811
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:45,030
When I think of you,

812
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:49,659
I have a funny feeling...

813
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,599
in my stomach.

814
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,840
I guess I have an indigestion.

815
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:09,980
The moment he met
someone he loved.

816
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,590
He said he saw
the woman's face clearly.

817
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,230
