1
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,590
Sometimes, one minute
can change everything.

2
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,810
Nice to meet you.

3
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:46,739
I'm Do Min Ik.

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,260
Nice to meet you. I'm Do Min Ik.

5
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,359
Nice to meet you.

6
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,230
I'm Eun Jung Su.

7
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,300
Isn't this...

8
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,400
that man?

9
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:21,550
Did you meet him?

10
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,250
I just said hi to him.

11
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,319
How was it?

12
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,449
Director Gi.

13
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,599
Then I'll see you later.

14
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,639
Who is it?

15
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,210
It's Min Ik's new driver.

16
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,340
Are you free this week?

17
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,080
I would like to make an appointment.

18
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,419
It's the case
I talked about the other day.

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,099
No way.

20
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,599
It can't be her.

21
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,900
No way. It can't be...

22
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,939
Ha Ni.

23
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,870
- What are you doing?
- Myung Jung.

24
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,479
Girls, come here.

25
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,180
When I came to work this morning,

26
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,490
I saw something red passing
in front of me like...

27
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,789
Are you saying that red thing was
Jeong Gal Hee?

28
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:42,759
If she came back, she's not
just tactless. She's brainless.

29
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,930
Swallows that went to Gangnam
can come back...

30
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,330
and the beggar from last year
can come back,

31
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,930
but Gal Hee can't come back.

32
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,840
Why would she work for someone
she was trying to kill?

33
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,550
This is my schedule for this week.

34
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,849
And this is the joint meeting plan.
Oh, and I changed my phone number.

35
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,620
- Save it.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,360
And for lunch...
You know La Pomme in Cheongdam.

37
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,990
Go order a truffle gnocchi to go
and bring it here.

38
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,300
And on your way back here,
stop by Yeonnam-dong and...

39
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,500
Wait.

40
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:34,779
Aren't you bending down?

41
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,279
No.

42
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,350
- Why not?
- "Tell me what you want".

43
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,819
That's what you said, right?

44
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,350
I...

45
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,819
"It will be reflected
in the contract".

46
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,029
You said this too.

47
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,829
- Look. I...
- And...

48
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:52,730
even though I made myself clear
that I didn't want it, you said,

49
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,100
"I can't see anything else,
but you".

50
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,870
You were being so desperate as well.

51
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,600
I wasn't being desperate.

52
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,810
"Jeong Gal Hee, you are..."

53
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,040
- "very..."
- Fine!

54
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,850
Fine. Tell me what you want.

55
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,879
(Jeong Gal Hee's demands
for the renewal of the contract)

56
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,389
"Clock in at 9am."

57
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,319
"Clock out at 8pm."

58
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,790
"No phone calls after work
unless necessary."

59
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,500
"No personal orders..."

60
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,100
"that are not work-related."

61
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:29,430
"One hour of lunch time
should be guaranteed."

62
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,470
"as well as a five-day workweek."

63
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:38,540
Since when did secretaries have
working hours?

64
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,680
You go home
when your boss goes home.

65
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,579
You work when your boss works.
Am I wrong?

66
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,920
I'm back as TnT Mobile's secretary,
Jeong Gal Hee.

67
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,860
I'm not back
as Do Min Ik's personal minion.

68
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:59,000
If you don't come on weekends,
they have to starve.

69
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,029
That's basically an animal abuse.

70
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,829
Do you know...

71
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,170
that I have skip my own meals
to feed the fish on weekends?

72
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,310
It's basically a human abuse.

73
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,279
Then you want to let them starve?

74
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,550
"Anyone can do the job".

75
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,019
"It doesn't have to be you".

76
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,019
That's what you said,

77
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,250
sir.

78
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,019
So...

79
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:27,089
anyone can do the job.

80
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,170
Well...

81
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,199
If you don't like my rules,

82
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,569
I'm willing to leave
without complaints.

83
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,649
Fine. Okay.

84
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,720
I'll accept the rules
under one condition.

85
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,850
Tell me.

86
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,860
Your boss is
not the kind of person...

87
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,730
who gives up.

88
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,589
A disease? Yes, I have one.

89
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,699
Although there's no cure for it,

90
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:07,470
I'm not going to suffer from it.
I will beat it.

91
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,800
I will get the consent from
all board members at all cost...

92
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,069
and be the president of TnT Mobile.

93
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:13,470
"Mobile Phones over TVs.
Mobile Phones Instead of Movies."

94
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,610
I'm going to complete
the content business...

95
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,040
my father couldn't complete
before he died.

96
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,310
So, you help me
as if your life is on the line.

97
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,779
No one has to know
that I have a disease.

98
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,319
Make people believe that I can see
every single wrinkle...

99
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,850
and every single hair
in their pores.

100
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,990
Do you get it?

101
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,790
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,959
- Is that it?
- No.

103
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,199
There's one more.

104
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,680
And it's...

105
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,910
very important.

106
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,319
What is it?

107
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,759
As soon as my disease is cured,

108
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,560
the contract between you and me...

109
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,370
will be terminated.

110
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,250
Darn it.

111
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,519
He just wanted me
to be a face minion after all.

112
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:38,320
Fine. I'm going to work
just as much as I get paid.

113
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,139
There are...

114
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,669
buses.

115
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,980
The sun is still in the sky.

116
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,019
There are people.

117
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:12,490
Mom, are you watching me?

118
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,360
Your daughter finally did it!

119
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,269
I can't believe I can go home
when others go home.

120
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,840
This is what you call happiness!

121
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,919
- Jeong Gal Hee?
- Jeong Gal Hee?

122
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,330
Yes, I know.

123
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,299
I'm sure you're all
very taken aback.

124
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,610
Knock, knock.
Is your brain still inside?

125
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,080
If it is still there,
please answer this question.

126
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,809
How did you end up
working for him again...

127
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,750
when you were
so determined to kill him?

128
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,049
What's with the fuss?

129
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,850
- Hello, Ms. Lee.
- You're here.

130
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,789
I called her.

131
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,059
Come sit down.

132
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:23,159
Ms. Lee, let me explain.

133
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:26,159
Working at a company
is all about earning money.

134
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,929
It's not your homeland.

135
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,429
Welcome back. I'm glad you're back.

136
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,399
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

137
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,039
I'll buy everything tonight.

138
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,750
What are they doing
near the company?

139
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,950
Who are they?

140
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,320
Ms. Lee, I'm really sorry.

141
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,789
But I think I need to go.

142
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:51,990
Gosh, where's the bill?
Where is it?

143
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,059
You should go. It seems urgent.
I'll buy tonight.

144
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,990
Okay, I'm sorry.

145
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,059
I'll make sure I treat you guys
drinks and karaoke...

146
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,200
until you all get wasted.

147
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,899
Gal Hee, can we go clubbing
instead of going to karaoke?

148
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,730
Yes, sure. I'm really sorry. Sorry!

149
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,940
- Don't forget!
- Okay.

150
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Club...

151
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,509
- Have you been to a club before?
- No.

152
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,840
Can't you see this?

153
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,509
I can't let you inside...

154
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,649
even if you guys are cops.

155
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,450
Sir, we're busy people.

156
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,690
Goodness, this is
an obstruction of justice.

157
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,320
- Excuse me! Hey!
- Miss.

158
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,960
- You know us, right?
- It's really Gal Hee.

159
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,629
You came to us with Mr. Do Min Ik...

160
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,230
Do Min Ik?

161
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,370
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,000
Can we... Can we talk outside?

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,370
Miss, where's Mr. Do Min Ik?

164
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,870
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

165
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,639
You're close with that girl
in the red cardigan, right?

166
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,649
I want you to find out
what Min Ik is up to these days.

167
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,350
Okay, sir.

168
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,159
I'm surprising you with gifts...

169
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,960
the entire day, aren't I?

170
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,169
What was the gift you sent me
this morning?

171
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,909
Was it Secretary Jeong?

172
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,580
Secretary Jeong is back?

173
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,950
I guess it wasn't her.

174
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,679
I spent a month's worth
of my living expenses...

175
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,549
because I didn't know
how I should tell you this.

176
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,549
But if Secretary Jeong is back,

177
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,289
I guess it's really the perfect day
for a bottle of champagne.

178
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,429
What's so important that you had
to spend that much money?

179
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:41,929
Do you need to ask me for a favor?

180
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,500
It's a confession.

181
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,669
Dae Ju?

182
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,440
11:53pm?

183
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,679
He was already there
when you arrived.

184
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,409
Then where did he go
without meeting you first?

185
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,889
I really don't want
to start a fuss...

186
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,490
about who's going to talk first.

187
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,220
So I'll just talk first.

188
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,759
Of course. Ladies always come first.

189
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,070
I got into an accident...

190
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,870
on the day we agreed to meet.

191
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,840
An accident?

192
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,110
I was waiting for you to come...

193
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,929
I can't see.

194
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,129
I can't tell
if he really didn't know...

195
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,399
or if he's just pretending.

196
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:54,440
But I'm sure he looks...

197
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:58,940
very worried right now.

198
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,620
Did you catch the culprit?

199
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,620
Did you see his face?

200
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,590
Yes, I saw his face.

201
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,860
But I haven't caught him yet.

202
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,029
You didn't get hurt, right?

203
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,899
Well, I did get hurt a little...

204
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,440
Wait.

205
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,250
- Who are you?
- Goodness.

206
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,149
You're both here.

207
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:42,220
Why are you holding something
so dangerous? We're the police.

208
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,429
Secretary Jeong?

209
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,440
This is why you're suspicious of me?

210
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,080
Most murder victims are killed
by people they already know.

211
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,320
And almost all of them
are close friends.

212
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,690
75 percent of all murderers
murder people they're acquainted to.

213
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,289
Detective.

214
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
If you're suspicious of me,
it's only right that I explain.

215
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:25,730
I'll tell you what happened.

216
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,600
I went there to meet him.

217
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,169
Yes, Secretary Lee.

218
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,340
Secretary Lee?

219
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,879
But something happened
to my secretary.

220
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,940
Secretary Lee.

221
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,009
So I had to leave.

222
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:46,419
I kept calling,
but Min Ik didn't answer.

223
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,649
I came back...

224
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,289
because I got worried
that something might've happened.

225
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,230
Excuse me.

226
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,299
I'm sorry,

227
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,940
but can I borrow your cell phone?

228
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,500
I need to make an urgent call,
but my phone's dead.

229
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:12,409
Thank you.

230
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,450
If I knew he was the culprit,

231
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,289
I would've taken a closer look.

232
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,960
Did you pay the taxi driver
with your credit card?

233
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,690
- I paid in cash.
- Cash?

234
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:34,769
Who uses cash these days?
Everyone uses credit cards.

235
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,100
That's why I always try
to pay them in cash.

236
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,899
Taxi drivers really like it
when they're given cash.

237
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,570
You're nice.

238
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,779
Write down your secretary's
phone number.

239
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,620
Must you meet her?

240
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,850
If we don't meet her,

241
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,590
how are you going to prove
your alibi to us?

242
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,700
Don't bother.

243
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Let's just call off
the investigation.

244
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,730
Director Do.

245
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,369
Are you kidding me?

246
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,509
You caused a huge fuss because
we couldn't catch the culprit.

247
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,440
And now, you suddenly want
to call off the investigation?

248
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,609
Are cops supposed
to follow your orders?

249
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,049
Do you think
I'm your personal secretary?

250
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,450
I also think we should call off
the investigation.

251
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,759
- What?
- The company will be voting...

252
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,759
for the next president soon.

253
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:35,390
Talks of cops and suspicions
of attempted murder...

254
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,130
will only make people spread
obnoxious rumors.

255
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,130
If the press also finds out
and starts writing articles,

256
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,470
things will get out of hand
very quickly.

257
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,799
Nothing's happened to him until now,
so I'm sure he'll be fine.

258
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,309
If 75 percent of murderers
are acquaintances,

259
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,309
that means the other 25 percent
are done by strangers.

260
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,549
This is crazy.

261
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,589
You need to be careful for a while,

262
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:04,150
so you should always ride a car
wherever you go.

263
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,890
I'm sorry, but please do me a favor.

264
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:08,690
Sure. Don't worry.

265
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,460
Oh, wait. How about...

266
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,859
you hire a personal bodyguard?

267
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:14,569
Actually, never mind.

268
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:17,369
That might make people wonder
if there's something going on.

269
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,210
Why are you here?

270
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,710
Pardon?

271
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,150
It's 11:50pm right now.

272
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,150
You were supposed to...

273
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,920
get off work almost four hours ago.

274
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,519
According to your terms,

275
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,650
you could've just given me
a phone call.

276
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,460
Why did you follow me
all the way here?

277
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,220
By any chance,

278
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,859
were you worried about me?

279
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,529
I wasn't worried about you.
It's just become a habit.

280
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,930
I'm not used to getting off work
at 8pm yet.

281
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,099
That's a great habit.
I hope you never fix it.

282
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:05,579
Did I...

283
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,819
tell you this?

284
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,819
What?

285
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,789
Thank you...

286
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,900
for coming back.

287
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,390
Rest your head on this.

288
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,849
I'm here.

289
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,920
I love you, as always.

290
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,119
Chief Director Sim.

291
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,900
You're here.

292
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,700
I heard your son is in trouble.

293
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:31,470
You didn't even say hello yet.

294
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:34,000
He's not in trouble.
He just made a mistake.

295
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:37,440
I'm quite familiar
with that subject.

296
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,680
When he didn't even
recognize his own mother,

297
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,380
there are two possibilities.

298
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,809
Alcohol or drugs.

299
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:50,390
Gosh, I must've shocked you.

300
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,059
I just came because I thought...

301
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,759
he'd make a good couple
with my daughter.

302
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,890
Your daughter?

303
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,170
I have a daughter
who's a crazy dork.

304
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:04,000
You know it, right?

305
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,769
A crazy dork?

306
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,710
She's just unique and special.

307
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,880
If you really mean it,

308
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,319
would you like to take her in?

309
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,619
Your daughter and my son?

310
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,160
You talked about the exclusive
run of Cinepark before.

311
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,829
Tell your son to give it a go.

312
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,900
If he captures my girl's heart,

313
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,069
I can give you something
more than the exclusive run.

314
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,809
He can take over...

315
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,609
all of Park Group.

316
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,589
I'm home.

317
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,230
You're here.

318
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:07,660
How do you feel today?

319
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,769
Do you recognize me?

320
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:17,170
I'm sorry. I was drunk that day.

321
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,220
If you want to play house,
do it right.

322
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:27,079
You can't let others see it.

323
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,589
You'll...

324
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,789
go on a blind date.

325
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,299
Have you seen her before?

326
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,140
Yes.

327
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,740
I see. She's quite famous.

328
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,839
You could've met her by chance.

329
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,279
Still, you don't seem surprised.

330
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:57,450
Am I supposed to be surprised?

331
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,549
You're just like your dad.

332
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:06,119
You know how to make use of women.

333
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:10,730
Who on earth is she?

334
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,930
Riding on her coattails,

335
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:17,170
you'll soon become the president.

336
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,099
And on your coattails,
I will get rid of your uncle...

337
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:23,170
and take over the whole company.

338
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,839
What do you think?
Do you think I'm bad?

339
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,349
If I do that,

340
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,349
will I truly become
a part of this family?

341
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,349
You will...

342
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,019
at least be a part of her family.

343
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,369
I don't need a woman...

344
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,700
to make it to
the president position,

345
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,440
but I'll see her.

346
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,440
If that's what it takes
to thank you...

347
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,750
for raising and feeding me.

348
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,299
A family?

349
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,329
That'd be nice.

350
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,569
And I like women too.

351
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,349
I just can't see it.

352
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:47,990
Who are you?

353
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,529
What do you look like?

354
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,809
President Park, it's ready.

355
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,190
Director Kim, you should
stick with Veronica Park...

356
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,329
and watch her lips.

357
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:24,190
- Her lips?
- Haven't you heard?

358
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,630
During the preview,
if she chuckles quietly,

359
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,799
the movie draws 1 million viewers.
If she grins, it draws 5 million.

360
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,200
Just like we had the psychic octopus
during the World Cup,

361
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:35,140
we have Veronica Park
in the film industry.

362
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,009
She's never wrong.

363
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,640
I dare you to make me grin.

364
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,880
I'm so glad that you're back.

365
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:20,049
By the way, when did we
ever meet on weekends?

366
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,420
That's because you stayed
in the office even on weekends.

367
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:30,059
Gal Hee. By the way,

368
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,059
about the police officers
who barged in the other day.

369
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,230
- What was going on?
- What?

370
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,539
Did Director Do get in
trouble or something?

371
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:41,599
A drinking problem?

372
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,440
Assault? Or...

373
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,279
sexual assault?

374
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,210
- My gosh!
- Why?

375
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,619
Is this where
you wanted to watch a movie?

376
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,250
Yes.

377
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,650
Here, Cinepark.

378
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,890
I never watch a movie
in this theater.

379
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,960
Bye.

380
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,730
What do you mean?

381
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,759
Half of the theaters in Seoul
are Cinepark theaters.

382
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,460
If you don't watch a movie in here,

383
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,700
you'll never get to watch one.

384
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,269
That's why I haven't seen
a movie since "Frozen".

385
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,769
Why do you not like this theater?

386
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,049
I used to work for this company.

387
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,980
Before I joined TnT.

388
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,130
Hey.

389
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,460
It really hurts.

390
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,430
Bok Soon.

391
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,569
Bok Soon, open your eyes.

392
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,640
We're almost home.

393
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,140
You mean the heiress of Park Group
who owns the film distributor,

394
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,809
the production company,
and the theaters?

395
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,750
Yes. The president of Cinepark,

396
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,450
Veronica Park.

397
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,750
I can't leave my sister alone!

398
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,589
Sir, please let go of me.

399
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,890
She's the crazy dork
in the film industry.

400
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,630
I can't leave her. Let me go!

401
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,359
Please.

402
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,240
Apologize to electricity.

403
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,309
Apologize to the employees
of KEPCO...

404
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:26,009
who spend all day in the electric
room wearing dust-free garments,

405
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:29,480
just to show a piece
of trash like this.

406
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,019
Apologize to the children
in Cambodia...

407
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,420
who can't study at night
due to the lack of electricity.

408
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,890
And apologize to Tesla and Edison
who devoted their lives...

409
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,829
to invent electricity,
for this rubbish film.

410
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,470
Apologize to them all.

411
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:52,140
Right now.

412
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,279
I heard her nickname
is Suction Pump.

413
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,579
She sucks in every guy she sees.

414
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,980
There was...

415
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,779
a guy who sold
rice cakes in the movie.

416
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,720
Get his number for me.

417
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,650
Yes, ma'am.

418
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:13,759
It was three years ago.

419
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,609
Gosh, why...

420
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:39,950
Do, re, mi, fa, sol, sol!

421
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,089
Hey, I'm on my way now.

422
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,490
I'll be there in a second. Awesome!

423
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,200
(Awesome)

424
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,740
I could handle
all types of hard work,

425
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,710
but I couldn't handle that.
So I quit.

426
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:08,480
I felt like my whole body was
burnt after working with her.

427
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:10,509
Compared to that,
my work now is just a sty.

428
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,680
Awesome!

429
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:22,529
Hi, President Park.

430
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,829
It's really you, Jeong Gal Hee.

431
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,640
How have you been?

432
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,210
I have been doing well.

433
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,039
It has been better
than when I worked here.

434
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,480
We had such fun back then.

435
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,880
Right?

436
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,319
You did an amazing job
as my avatar.

437
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,420
What are you doing these days?

438
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,289
I am...

439
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,690
looking for a new secretary.

440
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,789
No, thanks.

441
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:01,230
I'm working under a great boss.

442
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,700
It's going well.

443
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,039
Veronica Park speaking.

444
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:13,339
I have been waiting for your call.

445
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,410
Okay.

446
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,849
I'll be there on time.

447
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,690
Who is your great boss?

448
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,329
I'm working for Director Do Min Ik
at TnT Mobile.

449
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,329
Really?

450
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:36,269
We'll be seeing
each other often then.

451
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,200
See you.

452
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,779
I'm not going to...

453
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,349
see you often.

454
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,519
There we go.

455
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,819
There's one N missing.

456
00:31:58,859 --> 00:31:59,890
Excuse me?

457
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,519
P, e, n, n.

458
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:03,890
There are two Ns in "Pennsylvania".

459
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,869
- Maybe it's a typo.
- Do people still use snail mail?

460
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:11,470
Doesn't everyone use
e-mails these days?

461
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,369
That's not true.

462
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,170
Oh, my gosh!

463
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:20,839
Why is that in front of my eyes?
Why is it looking at me?

464
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,609
What's with the reaction?

465
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,819
Do you know her? Who is she?

466
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,680
"Who is she?" Can't you see it?

467
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:29,890
You can't see it.

468
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,089
It's Veronica Park.
The president of Cinepark.

469
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:36,789
She is?

470
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:41,160
Have you seen her?

471
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,730
No.

472
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,170
I have only heard about her.
I haven't met her.

473
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,569
If I knew it was her, I would have
said I would never meet her.

474
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,410
I also think...

475
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,009
- you should never meet each other.
- On the 13th.

476
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,849
At Kingdom Hotel, 9pm.

477
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,250
Are you going to meet her?

478
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,519
Unfortunately, your boss
always keeps his word...

479
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,450
no matter what.

480
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,460
But it has to be at 9pm.

481
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,059
That way, I don't have to go...

482
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,160
for round 2 and round 3
with this loud woman.

483
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,599
Darn it.

484
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,670
"Awesome".

485
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,349
Did you find it out?

486
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:38,450
Not yet.

487
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,400
As you know,
if I have to step down...

488
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,900
Going down.

489
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,400
If I'm no longer president,
your contract renewal will be...

490
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,339
Canceled.

491
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,440
It'll be canceled.

492
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,339
Please give me some time
until the end of this week.

493
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,380
I'll find it out at all costs.

494
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:03,650
163. 63.

495
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,349
175.

496
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:07,220
175.

497
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,889
180.

498
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,489
155.

499
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,719
155. 155.

500
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,929
153.

501
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,400
153.

502
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,869
168.

503
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,610
There we go. 160. 160.

504
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,969
168.

505
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,309
I'm leaving.

506
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,320
Okay.

507
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,019
160.

508
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,619
And...

509
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:51,829
What are you doing?

510
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,030
This?

511
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,929
They are heights of the employees.

512
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,000
If I know their heights,

513
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,340
I can roughly tell who they are
when I see them.

514
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:03,809
You're going to memorize
all of them?

515
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,480
Yes, I'm almost done.
Do you want to see?

516
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,210
Look.

517
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,750
The number of the employees
that are between 160 and 170...

518
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,949
is 23 in total.

519
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,119
It means General Manager Park
and Assistant Manager Kim...

520
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,860
are in this group.

521
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,920
Now I can put them
in two categories. Men and women.

522
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:24,429
Oh, right. Gal Hee, you're 168.

523
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,269
Give it to me.

524
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,400
What are you doing?

525
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,369
I'm drawing their hair.

526
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:39,039
General Manager Park has
permed hair.

527
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,449
Assistant Manager Kim has
a two-block hairstyle.

528
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,019
If you memorize their hairstyles,

529
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,250
it'll be easier to recognize them.

530
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,150
Right.

531
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:54,590
Does Assistant Manager Yuk
have long hair?

532
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,500
It looks like I can't go home,
as always.

533
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,269
Didn't Assistant Manager Yuk
have short hair?

534
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:06,139
Does she have short hair?
Did she get a haircut?

535
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,269
What about Manager Cha
in human resources?

536
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,639
Shiny.

537
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:16,710
I'm sure you can recognize him
right away.

538
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:19,780
Oh, right. Secretary Mo Ha Ni is...

539
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,409
Veronica Park's office.
How can I help you?

540
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:52,719
First of all, I would like to say...

541
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,590
I appreciate your hard work.

542
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:58,320
And please take care of your health.

543
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,989
This is Media One of TnT Mobile.

544
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,289
The director wants to
make an appointment...

545
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,829
with your president.

546
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,400
I started working yesterday, so
I haven't heard anything about it.

547
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,469
May I ask her first
and then get back to you?

548
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:13,269
Then could you ask her
if she can meet him...

549
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:15,170
at Kingdom Hotel on the 13th at 9pm?

550
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:17,010
(On the 13th at 9pm, Kingdom Hotel)

551
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,179
Hold on a second.

552
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:20,639
Hello, ma'am.

553
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,409
You got a phone call
from TnT Mobile.

554
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,949
I know. On the 13th at 9pm.

555
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,119
She says she knows about it.

556
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,119
She does?

557
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:39,260
Okay, then I'll make a reservation
under the name of TnT Mobile.

558
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,300
Okay. Bye.

559
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,670
How did she know?

560
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,570
Did Director Do call her himself?

561
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,070
Maybe it's your fate.

562
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,650
Fate?

563
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,280
Are you a doctor or a fortuneteller?

564
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,820
When is Dr. Park coming
from the United States?

565
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,489
What you're saying is
scientifically nonsense.

566
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,420
You said you can see
only one person's face clearly.

567
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,719
I know.

568
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,730
Is that completely nonsense?

569
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,329
It's completely nonsense.

570
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,960
The face recognition part
of your brain is damaged.

571
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,599
Then you shouldn't be able to
recognize any face.

572
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:19,239
You can't just recognize
one specific face.

573
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:21,599
Then why is this happening?

574
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,809
- Is she bald by any chance?
- No.

575
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:26,510
- Is there a huge mole on her face?
- No.

576
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,650
Then does she usually wear
really strong perfume...

577
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,449
like Chanel Number Five?

578
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:34,820
Or does she always wear
the same uniform?

579
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:39,659
She doesn't wear a uniform.

580
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,329
But does always wear...

581
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,530
the same outfit.

582
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,360
Then that might be it.

583
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,030
What?

584
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,630
She's imprinted on your mind.

585
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Imprinted?

586
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:59,809
Everything about her including her
hairstyle, bag, clothes and so on...

587
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:02,280
could've gotten accumulated
in your mind...

588
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,010
which is what enables you
to recognize her.

589
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,019
Your eyes are not actually
seeing and recognizing her.

590
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:09,989
Your brain just imprinted her
in your mind.

591
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,190
"The person wearing that perfume
is her."

592
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,159
"The person who always wears red
is her."

593
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:18,030
It's just like how we instantly
think of Charlie Chaplin...

594
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,099
the moment we picture
a mustache in our heads.

595
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:36,980
Come to think of it,

596
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,480
she always wore a red cardigan...

597
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:42,250
throughout the entire time
she worked for me.

598
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,760
Hello, Director Do.

599
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,210
Director Do, what exactly
are you doing right now?

600
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,489
My goodness, what are you doing?

601
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:26,659
Secretary Jeong.

602
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,760
- Get undressed.
- Pardon?

603
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,139
Director... Director Do.

604
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:09,139
This... This is considered
as sexual harassment...

605
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,210
Then...

606
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,670
get dressed.

607
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,650
Here you go. Try this on.

608
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,280
Wear this.

609
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,820
Wear this too.

610
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,449
Here. Put this on.

611
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,389
Yes, take off your glasses.

612
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,820
Take off your shoes as well.

613
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,929
Put these on.

614
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:34,460
And let your hair down.

615
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:36,630
I'll give you three minutes.

616
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,099
Tell me when you're ready, okay?

617
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,980
It's so tough
to work as a secretary.

618
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,730
I'm all done. You can come in.

619
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:32,920
Secretary Jeong.

620
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,369
What... What's wrong?
Do you feel sick?

621
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,239
Yes, I feel sick.

622
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:24,110
I feel really sick.

623
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,880
Destiny, my foot.

624
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,480
Secretary Jeong.

625
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,550
About your employment contract...

626
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,449
- You haven't...
- Oh, this?

627
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,789
I got worried that you might
suddenly go back on your word.

628
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,159
So I got it notarized.

629
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,389
Ta-da.

630
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:55,070
You're good. Good job.

631
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,309
Please don't do this.

632
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,110
I'm crying way more than
when my mom passed away.

633
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,579
Yes, that's right.

634
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,050
Please make a reservation for 2
at 9pm under TnT Mobile.

635
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,460
- And please...
- I made myself clear...

636
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,360
that I'm not going to take
the pickled vegetables.

637
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:17,829
Don't get cheeky.
You're going to eat nothing else...

638
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:19,260
but instant rice
and pickled vegetables.

639
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,559
Don't go around
eating whatever you want...

640
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,630
and then call Gal Hee for money.

641
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,329
Will you both be quiet?

642
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,940
Yes, I checked all the other menus.

643
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,539
But can you also tell me what
the amuse-bouche is going to be?

644
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,570
Amuse what?

645
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:34,809
As you already know,
the head chef decides...

646
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:36,880
on what to serve for
the amuse-bouche on the day of.

647
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,320
Yes, I know. But the thing is,
Director Do...

648
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,380
is allergic to peanuts.

649
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,750
Then can you just make sure
they don't serve anything...

650
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,420
with peanuts that day?

651
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,190
Okay, thank you. Bye.

652
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:54,500
Do you even know
what an amuse-whatever is?

653
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,230
No, I don't.

654
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,739
And I won't ever get to learn
what it is.

655
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,400
Why not? We can always buy
and eat it.

656
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:05,110
It's not something you can buy.

657
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,309
An amuse-bouche...

658
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:09,650
isn't something you can order.

659
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,510
It's something the chefs
serve you...

660
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,320
to show you a glimpse
on how good their food is...

661
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,789
when you're having French cuisine.

662
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:20,590
In other words, it's something you
can have only when you order...

663
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,760
the most expensive meal
at a top-class restaurant...

664
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,989
with top-class chefs.

665
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,130
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

666
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,329
I'm crying because of this.

667
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,469
Nam Hee, I hope you study abroad...

668
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:38,039
and become someone
who gets to eat amuse-bouches...

669
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:41,380
instead of becoming someone like me
who doesn't even know what it is.

670
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,050
Okay?

671
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,980
Gosh, you're being so sad.

672
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,519
Not everyone can be
the top student of their class.

673
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,989
Just eat it, you brat.

674
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:53,190
Don't call me a brat.

675
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,860
Why do you keep throwing them?

676
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,230
- I'm just trying to put them there.
- Just peel this.

677
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,789
Gosh, stop it.

678
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,199
I heard you'll be taking
the girls clubbing tonight.

679
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,670
That place is pretty expensive.

680
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:05,630
It's only right
that I treat them big.

681
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:08,170
They held a goodbye party for me
when I got fired.

682
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:10,769
But...

683
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:14,139
something happened
to my secretary.

684
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,480
So I had to leave.

685
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:21,750
- Ms. Lee.
- Yes?

686
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,949
What did you do on the day
of my goodbye party?

687
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,219
What?

688
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:30,289
Se Young told me
that you'll be joining us,

689
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:31,590
but you didn't come.

690
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,670
Oh, right. I was planning
on joining you guys,

691
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,230
but my mom suddenly got sick,

692
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,469
so I had to go to my hometown.
I'm sorry.

693
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:43,409
Your hometown?
The place where your mom's living?

694
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:44,409
Yes.

695
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,239
Director Gi said he left...

696
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,250
because something happened
to Ms. Lee.

697
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:55,250
But Ms. Lee was at her hometown?

698
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:03,789
I noticed that you go home early
these days.

699
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:09,260
I tamed my boss.

700
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,599
I get off work at 8pm these days.

701
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,800
And I don't come to work
on weekends.

702
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,469
I even get to spend a full hour
for lunch.

703
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:18,639
Are you sure you tamed him?

704
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,679
It seems like you're the one
who got tamed.

705
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,980
It's supposed to be like that.

706
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,480
You're not supposed to work
on weekends,

707
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,050
and it's normal
not to work overtime.

708
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,420
Seeing that you're really excited
about getting what you deserve...

709
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:31,320
only shows that you're the one
who got tamed,

710
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,519
rather than being the one
who tamed your boss.

711
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,889
Your boss is very talented.

712
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,530
You're only getting
what you deserve,

713
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,829
but he made it seem like
he did you a favor.

714
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,929
He made it seem like it's a gift
when it's something natural.

715
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:47,170
He made you become happy about
what you're entitled to receive.

716
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,750
She speaks in a high tone.

717
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,750
Her clothes are flashy,
and she wears high heels.

718
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:06,889
Do you think that will be enough...

719
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,730
to recognize her
even without seeing her face?

720
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,059
I told her secretary
that the reservation...

721
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,869
will be made under TnT Mobile.

722
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:20,900
I think you'll be fine
as long as you find the right table.

723
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,210
"I think"?

724
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,210
You know who Veronica Park is.

725
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:34,449
She has the power
to control the film industry.

726
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,590
I may not see her again after today,

727
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,650
but I can never have her
find out about my weakness.

728
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:40,489
You don't understand.

729
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:47,400
I didn't know there are people
you are afraid of.

730
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:54,800
I thought you treated everyone
in the world like me.

731
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,469
What?

732
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:00,139
Nothing.

733
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:06,179
You better hurry.

734
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,849
There's a demonstration
around Gwanghwamun Plaza.

735
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,750
The traffic is really bad.

736
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:13,960
Good luck.

737
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,190
What's wrong with her?

738
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,940
- Let's go.
- Gosh.

739
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,840
I'm sorry I'm late.

740
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,369
- Hey!
- Gal Hee!

741
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,239
You startled me. What's wrong?

742
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,409
Are you going to dig up sweet
potatoes or pick mugwort?

743
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,480
Are you going to a club
looking like that?

744
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:43,619
I took off my glasses
and put in contact lenses.

745
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:49,829
You said you'd treat us until we
get wasted, and you're just waste.

746
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:52,630
You should take off the cardigan,
not the glasses.

747
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,130
Is it that bad?

748
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:57,469
- Gosh, I feel dizzy.
- Myung Jung.

749
00:49:57,469 --> 00:50:00,239
I have clothes in that shopping bag.
Let her put something on.

750
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:02,699
Darn it.

751
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,309
Now I even have to dress her?

752
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,780
Just take it off.
I can't see how you look.

753
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,449
- Let's get rid of that waste.
- Please.

754
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,159
Sir. I'm sorry,

755
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,730
but we are running late.

756
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,500
- Is that it?
- Yes.

757
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,000
Just drop me off here.

758
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,369
I'll run instead.

759
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,989
- I know.
- That's what I'm saying.

760
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:04,500
That's enough.

761
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,929
Don't stop me.

762
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,869
This isn't about you anymore.

763
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:10,340
This is a battle between
me and your eyebrows.

764
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,210
This is strange.
It feels somewhat fulfilling.

765
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,349
Why do I have to put
earrings on her?

766
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:24,219
Did he get there?

767
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:25,920
There's a lot of traffic.

768
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,280
(Secretary Jeong)

769
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,110
Why isn't he answering?

770
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:59,550
This is TnT Mobile.
Did President Park leave?

771
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,619
She should be there by now.

772
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,690
She had something
in Samseong-dong,

773
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,989
so she went directly
to the Princess Hotel.

774
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:07,630
Princess...

775
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:08,900
Hey!

776
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:10,969
What? Princess Hotel?

777
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:14,000
I told you they are meeting
at the Kingdom Hotel.

778
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,909
I know. That's what I heard.

779
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:18,969
But President Park says
it's the Princess Hotel.

780
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:20,539
Darn it.

781
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:24,610
- Gal Hee!
- Jeong Gal Hee!

782
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:40,300
Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Park.

783
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,670
Nice to meet you too.

784
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:47,670
I'm Gi Dae Ju from TnT Mobile.

785
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:49,239
Gi Dae Ju?

786
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,079
What is going on?

787
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,820
I was going to ask that question.

788
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,750
Why are you at the Princess Hotel?

789
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,750
I told you to go
to the Kingdom Hotel.

790
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,659
You'll get a call from TnT Mobile.

791
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,300
Make sure
to behave yourself this time.

792
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,099
Okay?

793
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:26,510
Men are always welcome.

794
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,909
Do Min Ik.

795
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,019
Veronica Park speaking.

796
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:40,789
President Park, this is
Sim Hae Yong from TnT Mobile.

797
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,389
I have been waiting for your call.

798
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,590
You have?

799
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:49,659
I'd like to set you up
with a guy I care for.

800
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:58,409
What about at the Princess Hotel
at 9pm on the 13th?

801
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:01,480
Okay. I'll be there on time.

802
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,820
Who is your great boss?

803
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:12,619
I'm working for Director Do Min Ik
at TnT Mobile.

804
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:18,030
Now I see what's going on.

805
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,059
I guess there was a mix up.

806
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,730
I'll go to Director Do...

807
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,900
and tell him
you're running a little late.

808
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,929
No.

809
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,500
If you make a mistake...

810
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,840
and get all tangled up,
just tango on.

811
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:34,809
"If you're tangled up,
just tango on".

812
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,210
You know it, right?
That's my favorite movie line.

813
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:40,519
Why are you saying all that?

814
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,090
I think now is the time.

815
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,590
I just got tangled up,

816
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:50,989
but I guess I'm going to
have some fun dancing.

817
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,199
Let's take care of
our own issues. See you.

818
00:54:57,929 --> 00:54:59,900
President Park? Hello?

819
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,980
I just hate those two.

820
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,750
Gosh, he told me to have...

821
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:17,949
everything prepared thoroughly.

822
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,860
I should go there...

823
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:23,159
and tell him the truth.

824
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,289
Okay. That will do.

825
00:55:33,269 --> 00:55:36,469
Excuse me, sir.
If your date is coming late,

826
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:39,170
would you like some bread
and amuse-bouche first?

827
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:43,409
- Yes, please.
- All right.

828
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,519
I'm so sorry.

829
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:52,789
I just got off work.

830
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:55,119
I'll be in 10 minutes
if I take a taxi.

831
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,690
Don't leave.

832
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:00,900
I have a lot to ask Gal Hee tonight.

833
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:03,599
Jung Su?

834
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:10,239
Jung Su.

835
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,409
What are you doing here?

836
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,880
You can't be here.

837
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:01,519
I've been waiting.

838
00:57:04,059 --> 00:57:05,130
What?

839
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:16,300
Sometimes, one minute
can change everything.

840
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:40,329
At that instant, I wanted to sit...

841
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:42,360
on the chair he pulled up.

842
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:46,570
Here's today's amuse-bouche.

843
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:56,480
And I got curious about
the taste of the amuse-bouche...

844
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,849
that I'll never have
a chance to taste.

845
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,179
And...

846
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,559
I wanted know...

847
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:16,260
how he treats women...

848
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,829
other than me.

849
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,309
My apologies. I should have
introduced myself first.

850
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,679
Nice to meet you.

851
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,889
I'm Do Min Ik.

852
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,019
It has been great working with you.

853
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,230
That was...

854
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:53,469
the one minute
that changed my whole life.

855
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:01,679
Awesome! Nice to meet you.

856
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:03,980
I'm Veronica Park.

857
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:26,469
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

858
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:29,639
Why are you staring at me like that?

859
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:33,239
You're different
from what I imagined.

860
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:36,110
Could you get me
Veronica Park's phone number?

861
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:38,480
Give me that man's phone number.

862
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,920
I found him.

863
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:45,849
Who are you? Are you the person?

864
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:46,920
No!
