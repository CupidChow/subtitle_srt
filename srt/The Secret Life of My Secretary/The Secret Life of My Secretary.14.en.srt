1
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,210
Are you sure you just need one day?

2
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,049
Pardon me?

3
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,750
After working
as my secretary until tomorrow,

4
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,219
will you really leave
with no regrets?

5
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,530
Yes. If you let me do that...

6
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:59,759
I...

7
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,299
still hate you.

8
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,939
I'm still upset about
what you've done to me.

9
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,909
But there's no one
I can recognize...

10
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,319
without your help.

11
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,400
So...

12
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,700
tomorrow,

13
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,280
put this on...

14
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,750
and come to work.

15
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,620
Thank you.

16
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,920
Thank you, sir.

17
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,159
Director Do is currently suffering
from a severe illness.

18
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,439
(Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just.)

19
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,180
Where is my name?

20
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,849
(Gi Dae Ju)

21
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,449
There it is.

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,219
"May 2004"?

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,289
That's the year
my mother passed away.

24
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,159
"Aromi".

25
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,530
"Pennsylvania".

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,500
"46,000 dollars"?

27
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,759
(Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just.)

28
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,930
It's you, isn't it?

29
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,699
So you saw it.

30
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,669
Why did you do this?

31
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,270
I said, why did you do this?

32
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,939
Do you know who made your mom die?

33
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,060
What brings you here?

34
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,330
Hey, I'm going to work.

35
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,530
Gal Hee, it seems like
we have a guest.

36
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,569
But she's not saying anything.

37
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,500
Why don't you show
our guest room...

38
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,139
to our VIP guest?

39
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,240
So she's crashing at our place?

40
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,879
I'm not sure who you are,
but you're welcome to use this room.

41
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:03,580
My sister is in Pennsylvania now,
so the room is empty.

42
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,680
You know,

43
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,550
there's a very famous school called
the University of Pennsylvania.

44
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,949
And my sister studies there.

45
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,490
You heard him.

46
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:17,459
Our sister is in Pennsylvania,

47
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,230
so you can use that room.

48
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,740
See you.

49
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,509
By the way, how do you know Gal Hee?

50
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:29,639
Are you her friend from school?

51
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,310
Given that she let you crash here,
you two must be close like family.

52
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,279
How have you been doing?

53
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,259
You don't look well.

54
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:51,259
I deserve to be sick, but you don't.

55
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,269
Good morning, sir.

56
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:17,120
I prepared blueberry yogurt and
flat white for your breakfast...

57
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
I already had breakfast.

58
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:20,889
Today's stock price
of TnT Mobile is...

59
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:21,959
I checked that already.

60
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,199
You got...

61
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,399
the cast removed.

62
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,639
Yes.

63
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,399
I'm totally well today,

64
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,009
so ask me anything you want.

65
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,639
I would like to check out
the meeting room.

66
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,410
Okay, sir. I will check on that.

67
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,980
Your mother is here.
I'll be outside.

68
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,569
Is she still sticking around here?

69
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,300
What brings you
all the way to the office?

70
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,939
Today is a big day.

71
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,639
What matters is the board meeting.

72
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,680
The stockholders' meeting is
just for show.

73
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,709
This is technically
the president election.

74
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,949
You messed up by letting a girl go,

75
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,449
but I'm sure you can nail it
at the board meeting.

76
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,420
I want to eat something, Mom.

77
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,259
After the surgery I had
when I was seven,

78
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,589
you made me samgyetang.

79
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,829
The board meeting is definitely
going to be successful.

80
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,029
So please make me...

81
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,970
samgyetang as a present.

82
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,350
He's so gorgeous.

83
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:55,949
What are you doing, Jeong Gal Hee?

84
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,420
You promised
you will not see him as a man.

85
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:04,100
You're just a temporary secretary
who will work for just today.

86
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,699
Get it together and focus on work.

87
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,029
If something happens to him today,

88
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,970
it's going to mess up everything.

89
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,740
Hey!

90
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,310
- Jeong Gal Hee.
- Jeong Gal Hee.

91
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,149
Nice to see you again, Gal Hee.

92
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,750
I'm so glad to see you and...

93
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,519
it almost feels like having chicken
after recovering from enteritis.

94
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,360
Today, after the board meeting,
let's go eat jokbal together.

95
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,689
We have so many things
we want to ask you.

96
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,899
- Ask you.
- Ask you.

97
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,529
Sure. I guess I could use...

98
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,240
some drinks tonight.

99
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,639
Right. Have you heard the news?

100
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,009
Director Gi submitted
his resignation.

101
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,439
Really? Why?

102
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,850
It didn't seem to have been
accepted though.

103
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,779
I overheard my boss talking
to President Sim yesterday.

104
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,420
He said something about referring it
to the disciplinary committee.

105
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:10,389
Goodness.

106
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,629
Why did you ask us
to dress up like this?

107
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,500
This doesn't make us look alike.
We look so different.

108
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,540
The truth is...

109
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,680
You know what?

110
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,879
Watching the preview
spoils the movie.

111
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:33,419
The movie is about to start anyway.

112
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,889
Why don't you watch it
with your own eyes?

113
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,389
Let's go.

114
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,299
I marked on all the pages of the
directors that are coming today.

115
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,899
So you should probably
double check on that.

116
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,830
What do you think?

117
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,529
About what, sir?

118
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,940
Do you think...

119
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:55,740
I'm qualified to be
the president of this company?

120
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:05,620
Of course. I think you're
more qualified than anyone else.

121
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:08,019
But I can't even recognize
people's faces,

122
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,919
and memorize all these things.

123
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,389
I will have to lead the company...

124
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,730
with this disability.

125
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,070
When my brother started
to become blind,

126
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,899
my mom said this.

127
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,009
"Jung Hee, why are you crying?"

128
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,179
Mom.

129
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,649
Am I a disabled person?

130
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,549
When I was hanging out
with my friends,

131
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,549
some lady came to us...

132
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,590
and told the kids that
they shouldn't hang out with me.

133
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,929
She said I'm a disabled person.

134
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,169
She's right, Jung Hee.
You're a disabled person.

135
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,600
But...

136
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,039
we are all disabled.

137
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,539
During my entire life,

138
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,480
I've never met...

139
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,179
a perfectly normal person.

140
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,889
In my opinion, the woman that told
the kids to not play with you...

141
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,360
isn't perfect either.

142
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,629
So from now on,

143
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,460
whenever someone makes fun of you,

144
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:27,730
you should be the one
embracing their flaws.

145
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,070
Because they're pitiful people...

146
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,669
who aren't even aware
of their flaws.

147
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,720
So if anyone says
you don't deserve...

148
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,490
to be the president
because of your illness,

149
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:51,789
that person will only be proving
that he or she is unworthy.

150
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,659
After all, no one's perfect
in this world.

151
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,230
You worked hard.

152
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,500
Director Yang. Director Choi.
Long time no see.

153
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,610
I should get going now.

154
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,509
I'll be waiting outside
until it's over,

155
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:16,009
so if you need my help,
just send me a signal.

156
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,779
A signal? What kind of signal?

157
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,620
Well, let's see. How about this?

158
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,690
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

159
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,789
Or maybe something like this.

160
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,490
Is this too big?

161
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,929
It's okay. I won't need your help.

162
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,559
Well, if it's anything urgent,

163
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,700
just wink at me.

164
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:36,899
Wink?

165
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,240
Even if I send you a signal,

166
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,470
how would you even know
what's going on?

167
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,840
Plus, it's just a wink.
It's not a text or a phone call.

168
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,409
I'll know.

169
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,450
If anything happens to you,

170
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,379
I'm able to figure it out
whatever it may be.

171
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,620
So don't hesitate
and just send me a signal.

172
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,309
Then the tuition you told me
that was from the chairman...

173
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,340
That money was
from selling the fish?

174
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,480
Why didn't you tell me?

175
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,279
You should've told me!

176
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,080
When your mom passed away,

177
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,620
I promised her one thing.

178
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,789
I promised her that I'll do
everything I can to protect you.

179
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,789
Your mom may have been treated...

180
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:40,730
way poorly than a fish at work,
but I promised...

181
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:44,470
that I'll make you become
the owner of this company.

182
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,710
But you handed in a resignation
letter without even telling me?

183
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:19,740
President Park?

184
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,610
Who do you think you are...

185
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,080
to wake me up from my spring dream?

186
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,549
Awesome.

187
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,120
Dae Ju, it's you.

188
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,259
I feel as if I'm Choonhyang
right now.

189
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,129
I can't believe...

190
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,600
you came to see me
in broad daylight.

191
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,830
I told you that I resigned.

192
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,700
Are you okay with
dating a jobless boyfriend?

193
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,740
It's time to make use
of your rich girlfriend.

194
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,169
You can constantly take my money,
but I'll still be rich.

195
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,279
How is it that you never try
to take even a cent of my money?

196
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:05,320
I'm actually going through
something right now.

197
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,590
But I knew I'd be able to smile
if I saw you.

198
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,450
Wait.

199
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,490
If you're jobless,
that means you have no money,

200
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,529
but you have all the time
in the world.

201
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,269
Over there.

202
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,809
There's an empty house
built for filming purposes...

203
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,110
over there in that secluded area
with no one around.

204
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,779
Would you like to go there
with me for a while?

205
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,919
I think I'll be able...

206
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:43,220
to make you very happy there.

207
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
I actually wanted to go
somewhere quiet to talk to you.

208
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,429
I love having
a jobless boyfriend. Let's go.

209
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,269
Where's Director Lee
and Director Park?

210
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,710
The board meeting is
going to start soon.

211
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,120
I'd like to show you an interesting
show before the meeting begins.

212
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,019
(Conference Room)

213
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,690
Okay, everyone. Come over here.

214
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,529
Please stand in two lines.

215
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:26,129
Stand here in 2 lines,
and go inside in 1 line.

216
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,570
Keep a straight face,
and stand up straight.

217
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,200
Be quiet. Keep a straight face.

218
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,639
Come inside.

219
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,379
Okay, everyone. Stand in one line.

220
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,659
What was that?

221
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,259
No way.

222
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:10,740
Director Do, let me ask you
a question.

223
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,379
Out of all these people,
can you tell me...

224
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:15,779
who Director Park is?

225
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,149
He winked.

226
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,360
Okay, I got it.

227
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,490
Gosh, it's code blue.
What should I do?

228
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,599
Gal Hee, let's think.

229
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,130
The fact that Director Park
and Director Lee...

230
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,900
went inside with a bunch of guys
wearing the exact same suit...

231
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,670
means someone found out
about Director Do's illness.

232
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,839
What if Director Do fails
to recognize them?

233
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:24,309
No, he memorized
and practiced so many times.

234
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,720
I'm sure he'll recognize them.

235
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,250
But even so,

236
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,559
a few directors might still
turn their backs on him. My gosh.

237
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:38,259
What can I do to help Director Do?

238
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,700
Have you heard the news?

239
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,670
Director Gi submitted
his resignation.

240
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,240
It didn't seem to have been
accepted though.

241
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,039
I overheard my boss talking
to President Sim yesterday.

242
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,710
He said something about referring it
to the disciplinary committee.

243
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,819
President Park.

244
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,130
I said I wanted to discuss
something with you.

245
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,859
I didn't say I was going to take
my shirt off.

246
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:12,559
You can go ahead and talk.
I'm listening.

247
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,329
(Secretary Jeong)

248
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:16,799
Jeong Gal Hee, you little brat.

249
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,700
I'm going to sue you
for obstruction of business!

250
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:21,099
Yes, Secretary Jeong.

251
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,339
What?

252
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:26,480
I think President Sim
didn't file your resignation yet...

253
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,279
because he's planning to make you
get disciplined.

254
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,619
I'm really sorry for
asking you this in this situation.

255
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,349
But can you please come
and help Director Do?

256
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,589
Please, Director Gi.

257
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,500
If you don't come to vote,

258
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,799
I don't think...

259
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,769
Director Do will win the election.

260
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,549
I feel bad for you who's taken
care of me since I was seven.

261
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,150
So I didn't want to tell you this.

262
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,519
I...

263
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,890
can't see your face.

264
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,019
Do you know who made your mom die?

265
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,059
What's wrong?

266
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:19,430
I'm a little hesitant.

267
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What?

268
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,299
I feel like I've done
more than enough.

269
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,369
What more do I need to do?

270
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,710
Mr. Chastity.

271
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,480
Hesitating in this kind
of situation...

272
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,150
is the same thing as serving
an appetizer with no steak.

273
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,319
It's like making someone eat
pickled radishes...

274
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,650
without any jajangmyeon.

275
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,119
2, 3, 4, 5.

276
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,630
There are so many buttons
I still need to unbutton.

277
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,160
But what do you mean
you've done enough?

278
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,759
No, that's not what I meant.

279
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,029
Do you think I don't know
what it means...

280
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,029
when someone says
"I've done enough"?

281
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,900
What do you mean?

282
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:01,869
It means they did everything they
could to the best of their ability.

283
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:02,910
No.

284
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:05,240
It's just a nicer way to say...

285
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,779
that you don't want to try anymore.

286
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,619
If you tried your best for someone,

287
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,950
you wouldn't say
that you've done enough.

288
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,289
You would say that
you'll do everything you can.

289
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,059
Then...

290
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,130
shall we start doing...

291
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,539
everything we can again?

292
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,700
I should get going.

293
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,269
What?

294
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,579
You're right about that.

295
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,009
The fact that I don't want to do it
can't be an excuse.

296
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:45,819
And Min Ik really
needs me right now.

297
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,119
Were you talking about Do Min Ik?

298
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,789
I'm sorry. I'll give you a call.

299
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,400
Why did I had to say
the right things at the right time?

300
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,069
Secretary Jeong.

301
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,410
Even if I hurry,
it will take some time.

302
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,980
- Hop on.
- What?

303
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,789
It'll take you more than 30 minutes
to walk to your car from here.

304
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:23,849
Just get on.

305
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,190
Promise me one thing though.

306
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:34,059
Next time we meet, we will
hang out like adults.

307
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll do everything I can.

308
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:38,769
Great.

309
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,369
Among the people in here,

310
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,180
which one is Director Park?

311
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,690
Why? You don't know?

312
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:04,859
You've worked hard.

313
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,900
- This notebook is new.
- Right.

314
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,240
I will keep a record
of people's faces from now on.

315
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,910
A record?

316
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,180
If I keep a record of people
I meet every day like a diary,

317
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,349
I guess...

318
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,789
it will help me understand
and recognize them better.

319
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,990
Actually, it's been a few days.

320
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,029
Who did you meet today?

321
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:38,059
The first person I met today...

322
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,700
was you, Jeong Gal Hee.

323
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,769
See?

324
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,200
Today Secretary Jeong
is wearing a red cardigan...

325
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,710
with some cute flyaway hair...

326
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,980
that she always has.

327
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,250
Next is Director Park
and Director Oh.

328
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,210
I realized something
keeping this record.

329
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,119
Director Oh rubs
his nose like this...

330
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,589
when he feels awkward.

331
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,789
And Director Park adjusts...

332
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,490
his glasses like this.

333
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,930
You're right. He does that.

334
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,450
This is strange. Why can't you
point out Director Park?

335
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:33,450
All I have to do, is tell you that?

336
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:40,119
The fourth from the left.

337
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,759
He's Director Park.

338
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,059
And...

339
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,470
the one on the far right
is Director Lee.

340
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,099
Do you need more?

341
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,779
The one sitting at the far right
of this table is Director Choi.

342
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,809
Next, there's Director Woo.

343
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,680
I heard you were on a diet.
I guess you've lost some weight.

344
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:14,359
And there are Director Yang,
Director Kwak, and Director Kim.

345
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,759
And the one sitting next to me...

346
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:20,259
is Chief Director Sim Hae Ra.

347
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,869
President Sim,
what was this show about?

348
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:29,369
You really don't have any problems?

349
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:36,849
Look.

350
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,279
This is from Sangmo Hospital's
Neurosurgery last month.

351
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,849
Why did you see the doctor?

352
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:45,160
I clearly heard...

353
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,890
that you're suffering from
serious prosopagnosia.

354
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,859
What are you talking about?

355
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,900
That's not true, is it?

356
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,000
President Sim must've been mistaken.

357
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,140
Director Do?

358
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,940
I think you're
more qualified than anyone.

359
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,980
After all, no one's perfect
in this world.

360
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,750
President Sim...

361
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,690
is right.

362
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,130
"Anyone who is suffering from
a mental or physical disorder..."

363
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,829
"and isn't capable of
performing their duty..."

364
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,240
"cannot be elected as president."

365
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,440
You all know it, right?

366
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:44,049
I'm sorry that
I didn't tell you sooner.

367
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,519
Those who believe my illness
is a reason for disqualification...

368
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,049
according to the articles
of incorporation...

369
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,720
may vote for Candidate Sim Hae Yong.

370
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,119
Min Ik!

371
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,329
But I don't agree...

372
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:03,500
on taking my illness as a reason...

373
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,940
for disqualification.

374
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,240
I've memorized and studied hard.

375
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,339
And now I can recognize who you
all are.

376
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,579
This illness actually helped me...

377
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,950
to develop the qualifications
of a president.

378
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,789
If I could read
your facial expressions,

379
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:26,559
I might have tried to
cover it up with a lie.

380
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:28,890
But I can't...

381
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,430
even study your face.

382
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,329
So all I can do is tell the truth.

383
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,839
I'm almost done. Look.

384
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,210
There are 23 employees who are
between 160 and 170.

385
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,680
It means General Manager Park...

386
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,839
If I were...

387
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,950
still called as the mind-reader,

388
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,819
I wouldn't have paid attention
to every employee.

389
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:58,890
If I could still do
everything on my own,

390
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,559
I wouldn't have listened
carefully to others.

391
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,789
The one who tells the truth,

392
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,529
pays attention to his employees,

393
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,900
and listens carefully to others
around him...

394
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,900
deserves to be
the president, I believe.

395
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,869
Today, someone...

396
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:20,680
told me this.

397
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:24,549
That everyone has
their own disabilities.

398
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,589
I can't say I'm a
perfect human being now.

399
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,759
But if you allow me,

400
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,930
I will consult with and count on
the directors for what I lack...

401
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,329
to perform my duties
as the president.

402
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,049
It's almost over now.

403
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,880
Is he even coming?

404
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:11,759
All right then. Let's take
a show of hands now.

405
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:15,029
I'll abstain from voting.

406
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,369
Director Choi.

407
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,009
Director Do just lost one vote.

408
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:28,210
Anyone who gets more than five votes
will be the president-elect.

409
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:31,609
President Sim, would you
like to go first then?

410
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,130
That's five.

411
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,269
- Secretary Jeong.
- Please hurry.

412
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,779
Why am I being
Jeong Gal Hee's minion?

413
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,519
I think it's over. Shall we go to
a rice soup restaurant near here?

414
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,990
That's Director Do's
least favorite place.

415
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,160
We should still take a show
of hands for the other candidate.

416
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,259
That's the rule.

417
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,900
Those who want Director Do
to be the president-elect,

418
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
please raise your hand.

419
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,519
Director Gi.

420
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:47,359
It's not over, is it?

421
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,430
Director Gi. I thought
you handed in your resignation.

422
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,359
I did. But...

423
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:55,630
President Sim didn't
accept it yet...

424
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,230
to refer me
to the disciplinary committee.

425
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:00,700
That makes me to still be
the director just yet.

426
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:07,279
Then, we have 10 directors
including Director Gi.

427
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,650
If Do Min Ik gets five votes,
it's a tie with Sim Hae Yong.

428
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,450
Then there will be a revote at
the board meeting two weeks later.

429
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,519
Am I right?

430
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,160
Director Gi Dae Ju?

431
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,569
As the president-elect of
TnT Mobile, I think Director Do...

432
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,210
is qualified.

433
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,869
Why do you always...

434
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,170
have to shame me like that?

435
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,240
You always make me
feel like I owe you.

436
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
Min Ik.

437
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,509
On the way here,

438
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,019
I made a resolution.

439
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,720
No matter what,

440
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,160
I will not hate you.

441
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:30,559
Later if you ever feel like
you hate me,

442
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,630
please cut me some slack just once.

443
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,430
What are you talking about?

444
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm fine.

445
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,769
You should thank Secretary Jeong,
not me.

446
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:44,609
If it weren't for Secretary Jeong,

447
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,779
I wouldn't have even known
this was happening to you.

448
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,900
You did a good job today, sir.

449
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,099
Well, I guess.

450
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:46,769
It would have been nicer
if it worked out at one go,

451
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,509
but you have one more chance now.

452
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,779
Next time, let's focus on convincing
Director Choi, who abstained...

453
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,519
I'm probably talking too much.

454
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,190
This is your schedule
for this month.

455
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,700
And this is the handover document.

456
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:21,700
One of the moss balls was ill,
so I separated it.

457
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,710
It can happen when it's hot,

458
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,680
so put some ice in the water
for the next few days.

459
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,880
And please pat it once in a while
when you have some free time.

460
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,109
It helps it to recover faster.

461
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,990
I should get going now.

462
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,859
I'm sorry I betrayed your trust
and hurt you.

463
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,599
Thank you for hiring me as your
secretary even for just one day.

464
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:07,579
Hey.

465
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,489
Yes, sir.

466
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,699
Thank you for today.

467
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:33,909
You're welcome.

468
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,409
You did a great job too.

469
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,210
(The Best Jokbal, Darn My Foot)

470
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,750
Okay. Pour me some drink.

471
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,929
I think I can't stay sober tonight.

472
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,469
Of course. I will pour you some.

473
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:40,340
All right. It's time for a pop quiz.

474
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,050
A quiz? All of a sudden?

475
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,650
The first question is for Gal Hee.

476
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,090
What's the color
of your boss' socks today?

477
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,190
Gray.

478
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,519
Then what time did your boss
come to work today?

479
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,019
8:37am.

480
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:58,860
Did you see a strange file
in his office...

481
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
or see him contacting
the audit department?

482
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,670
Audit department?

483
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,380
I didn't hear anything about it.

484
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,519
- Ms. Lee.
- Ms. Lee.

485
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

486
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,989
Gal Hee says she didn't see
Director Do...

487
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,889
contacting the audit department
or anything else.

488
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:34,260
How did the board meeting go today?

489
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,369
Director Do and President Sim
are tied,

490
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:41,400
so there will be a revote
in two weeks.

491
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,369
What? President Sim didn't win?

492
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,840
Why? Did you want President Sim...

493
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,250
to win?

494
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,480
No, that's not what I meant.

495
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,570
The moon is bright.

496
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,039
So...

497
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,510
This crazy man has come
to a conclusion.

498
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,650
It's you, Jeong Gal Hee.

499
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,550
I wonder if the crazy man...

500
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,019
is looking at it too.

501
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,110
And please pat it once in a while
when you have some free time.

502
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,579
It helps it to recover faster.

503
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,210
Will this really...

504
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,809
help it recover?

505
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
Here you go.

506
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:36,250
Get better.

507
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,719
Get better.

508
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:01,909
Seeing that it stinks...

509
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:04,480
it must be a bribe.

510
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
It's a present.

511
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,449
Thank you for everything.

512
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,420
My sister caught me acting,

513
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,719
so I think I'll have to start
studying again.

514
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,389
- Let's go.
- Where?

515
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:21,260
I'd like to meet your sister
who seems to think...

516
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,869
acting is inferior...

517
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:25,469
to studying.

518
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,780
Gal Hee? It's you again?

519
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,480
President Park, why are you here
with my younger sister?

520
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,420
I'm kind of indebted to her.

521
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,389
You really are a nuisance.

522
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:44,949
Do you think...

523
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,920
she's the only nuisance in my life?

524
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:48,559
I don't get...

525
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:50,730
why I have to bribe you...

526
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,159
and be so caught up in
taking care of you sisters.

527
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,170
I'm sorry, President Park.

528
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,500
How did things go with your boss?

529
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,210
I want you to let Nam Hee act again.

530
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,280
No.

531
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,050
I'm going to make her succeed
by studying hard.

532
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,949
What did your father do?

533
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:18,449
He worked at a construction site.

534
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,460
What about your mother?

535
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,960
She delivered food at Dongdaemun.

536
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,219
That's strange.

537
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:25,230
How did they manage to give birth
to girls like you?

538
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,329
- What about us?
- What about us?

539
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,630
You sisters are really great
at acting.

540
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,469
Gal Hee, do you think it's easy
to fool your boss...

541
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:34,699
for months like you?

542
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,840
What? Is someone here?

543
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,340
He's our brother.

544
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,449
Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Park.

545
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,320
Nice to meet you.
I'm Jeong Jung Hee.

546
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:56,090
The show's at 11pm tonight.

547
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:58,960
Please come to the show
with Gal Hee.

548
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,429
Thank you for inviting me.

549
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:05,969
But as you can see, I'm blind.

550
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:09,039
That's exactly why you should come.

551
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,380
You'll be able to hear
how clearly Nam Hee delivers...

552
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,679
her lines than anyone.

553
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:34,929
Thank you for hiring me as your
secretary even for just one day.

554
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,780
Where's your room?

555
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:52,380
This is my room.

556
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:53,980
And your living room?

557
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:55,480
This is also my living room.

558
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,590
What about your kitchen?

559
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:02,159
It's here.

560
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,630
This is how big
my second-floor bathroom is.

561
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,869
We don't necessarily need...

562
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,739
that much space
to do what adults do.

563
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,579
Gosh, you're right.

564
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:30,719
Come to think of it,
the more cramped, the better.

565
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,559
Did I tell you this?

566
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,900
Today, I ate ginseng, wild ginseng,

567
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,730
and red ginseng all at once.

568
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,269
Brace yourself.

569
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,840
I'm going to be merciless today.

570
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,780
All I want is to unbutton
your second button.

571
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,050
Is that too much to ask for?

572
00:42:57,849 --> 00:42:59,079
Who is it this time?

573
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:01,420
Hey, Min Ik.

574
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,349
Where are you?

575
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,289
If you're free, how about
we grab lunch together?

576
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,519
Why all of a sudden?

577
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,130
Where's Secretary Jeong?
Did she go somewhere?

578
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:12,360
What?

579
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,000
Oh, right.

580
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:17,969
Well...

581
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,940
I don't know where she is.

582
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,139
Hungry Theater,
Street 36, Daehak-ro.

583
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,440
Who is this?

584
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,679
Nice to meet you.
I'm the original Veronica Park.

585
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:32,480
Gal Hee's going to be there
starting from 11am today.

586
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,480
So stop bothering my boyfriend
and go have lunch with Gal Hee.

587
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:42,389
Hello? Hello?

588
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,159
What was that?

589
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,369
Come to think of it,

590
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:53,300
I sent her home on an empty stomach
yesterday after work.

591
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:56,840
The least I should do
is to treat her to a meal...

592
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,480
before I say goodbye to her.

593
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,280
Hello, can I make
a lunch reservation?

594
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,789
Yes, what kind of champagnes
do you have?

595
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,960
Gi Dae Ju's name
is the only real name on the list.

596
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,429
Busted.

597
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:18,659
But all the others are encrypted,

598
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,230
so it's not easy to find out
who they are.

599
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,869
The most recent expenditure was...

600
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,099
the Drivers' Waiting Room,
so I asked them to search the place.

601
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,639
Don't tell Director Do about
what you found for the time being.

602
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,739
And call me
as soon as you find anything new.

603
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,179
Yes, sir.

604
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:49,219
I handed in my resignation letter
like I promised.

605
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,760
What?

606
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,800
"Request replica for
Wang Choong Choong's painting"?

607
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,769
You even stole and sold my painting?

608
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:03,010
Paying for Mr. Eun's hospital bills
was more important...

609
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,539
than that painting of yours.

610
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:07,139
Plus, that painting was a bribe you
received from Taeman Company...

611
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:09,409
in return for having signed
a business deal with them.

612
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,750
This is exactly why
we need to renew...

613
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,090
calendars and secretaries
every year.

614
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:32,170
Goodness, gracious.

615
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:34,239
I spent the money on making
the Drivers' Waiting Room,

616
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,369
paying for industrial accidents,
bonuses, and overtime payments.

617
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:38,510
The money was used for the welfare
of our dispatched workers.

618
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:41,610
I never laid hands on the company's
money other than black money.

619
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,320
You want me to save you
even after what you did?

620
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,219
If this is about money,

621
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:54,719
I'll give you every single penny
I have to compensate for it.

622
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,289
If that's not enough,
you can go ahead and sue me.

623
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,630
Why would I sue you?

624
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,559
I should thank you.

625
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,929
I actually needed something
to put on a show.

626
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:06,969
And...

627
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,070
you happened to have given me
something very amazing.

628
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:12,170
You promised, President Sim.

629
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,909
I didn't become the president,
so the promise is no longer valid.

630
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:20,349
I need to punish these thieves...

631
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:23,820
to make at least a few directors
come back to me.

632
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:26,690
If you do anything
to harm the dispatched workers,

633
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,360
I won't stand still.

634
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:29,789
You're scary.

635
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:34,230
Okay, then. Let's see who wins.

636
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,300
Good luck.

637
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,070
Just to be sure,
you should prepare...

638
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:47,309
the medical certificate
and employment contract.

639
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,480
And give me the number
of all the drivers...

640
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,150
who got unfairly dismissed
by President Sim.

641
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,780
Okay.

642
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,050
Don't worry too much.

643
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:56,750
You know...

644
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,320
that the ledger doesn't only
contain what we spent.

645
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,789
It also contains all the dirty money
that they received.

646
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,630
If President Sim causes trouble,

647
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,599
I'll reveal all the dirty money
the directors received...

648
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,829
and all the bribes they gave
to politicians so far.

649
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,909
I'm sorry...

650
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,110
how things ended up
turning out this way.

651
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,250
What are you talking about?

652
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:25,280
I'm the one...

653
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:28,280
who's responsible.

654
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:35,260
Let me know
if you need anything else.

655
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,860
I need to meet someone...

656
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:44,429
before things get any worse.

657
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,190
Why are you wearing a suit
in this heat?

658
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,230
We already don't have a mother.

659
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,789
I don't want people to make fun of
her because she has a blind brother.

660
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,400
Gal Hee, you're also
putting makeup on, right?

661
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,239
I'm really not in the mood
to doll myself up,

662
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:23,210
but I'm doing my best.

663
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,409
Just make sure you hear
how well Nam Hee speaks her lines.

664
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,590
What's this?

665
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,920
I told you to wear something nice.
Why are you wearing this?

666
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,260
You're right.

667
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,500
I don't need to wear this anymore.

668
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,230
Why did I put this on?

669
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:51,730
Hurry up.

670
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,199
Come on.

671
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,010
What's wrong?

672
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,179
I totally forgot.

673
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:05,309
What?

674
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:08,250
Jeong Gal Hee went to the theater
with her brother,

675
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,989
but Do Min Ik can't recognize faces.

676
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,820
Right. What about that?

677
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,389
Nothing.

678
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,460
If you make a mistake and get
all tangled up, just tango on.

679
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,800
Something good might happen.

680
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:41,780
Secretary Jeong.

681
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:45,519
What?

682
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,489
Who is he?

683
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
It begins now.

684
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:08,340
- This is exciting.
- It's so nice.

685
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,250
- I like it even if it's spoiled.
- Even the spoiled ones are good.

686
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,610
If you'll throw it out...

687
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,849
It's fun, isn't it?

688
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,320
- They are good.
- Who is he?

689
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,719
The beggars who came last year...

690
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,059
The beggars are dancing around.

691
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:26,659
Nam Hee isn't up yet?

692
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,900
What are they whispering about?

693
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,340
He even holds her hand?

694
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:36,909
Gal Hee, I'm so nervous.

695
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:39,780
Don't be nervous. It's okay.

696
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,650
- Gosh, why are you...
- Get me some of it.

697
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,119
- You always eat it alone.
- I'm sorry, but this is good.

698
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,280
Jung Hee, Nam Hee's out.

699
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,190
Darn it!

700
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,190
She's cute.

701
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:04,869
Jung Hee, let's get out now.

702
00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:08,170
I feel bad for others because
we have to keep whispering.

703
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,510
Let's go.

704
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,510
Let go of her!

705
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:14,340
Bend down.

706
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:17,409
Come on.

707
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,349
We're supposed to share everything.
And eat together.

708
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,750
- Come on and get over here.
- I don't want to!

709
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,119
Where are they going?

710
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:38,300
She always wore loafers
when she was with me.

711
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,469
But she's wearing heels now.

712
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:43,039
She even put on a flowered
dress to look pretty.

713
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:48,639
Why are they walking arm-in-arm
when it's so hot?

714
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,719
We should buy some flowers.

715
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,880
That's a good idea.

716
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,719
I'll take the cheapest one here.

717
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:08,460
Here's your bouquet.

718
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,699
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

719
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:17,369
He even bought flowers?

720
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:19,980
Am I the only one who's hot?

721
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,739
Can we get some ice cream?

722
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:25,309
Let's wait for Nam Hee
while eating some ice cream.

723
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:26,880
Ice cream?

724
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,630
She could just get him some tissue.
Why is she wiping it with her hand?

725
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,000
Why is it so hot today?

726
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,739
You're sweating a lot.

727
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:54,639
Raise your arm.

728
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,909
Where is she touching now?

729
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,860
- Do you like it?
- Do you like it?

730
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,219
Jinx, I said it first.

731
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:09,559
Hello?

732
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,360
This is the restaurant.

733
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,559
I'm calling as you're
late for your reservation.

734
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,929
Well... The thing is...

735
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:25,909
Where did they go?

736
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,539
How could she do things she's done
for me to someone else so easily?

737
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,309
He's shorter than me,
and his face...

738
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,780
Does his face look better than mine?

739
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:07,650
Is your date not coming?

740
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,389
Why? You don't think she will?

741
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,489
No, I didn't mean it that way.

742
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,159
She's coming.

743
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,760
I'll make sure...

744
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:21,429
to make her come back to me.

745
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:29,469
It's Director Do.

746
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:31,840
Why is he calling you
when you're out?

747
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:36,179
Why is he calling?
What's the matter?

748
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:39,010
Jung Hee, I'm so nervous.

749
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,619
Isn't it obvious? If he
asks you to come to work,

750
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,250
just say no.

751
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,289
Hello, Director Do.

752
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:53,159
Where are you now?

753
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,429
I'm out for something. Why?

754
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,699
I'll send you the address
of a restaurant now.

755
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,440
Come over here.

756
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,139
- Now?
- Why? You can't?

757
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,340
Tell him you can't come.

758
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,210
You can't?

759
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,780
Well...

760
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,519
I don't think
I can go there right away.

761
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,320
Come.

762
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:17,750
Pardon?

763
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:20,889
I won't budge until you come here.

764
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,429
Come over here...

765
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,030
right away.

766
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:32,500
Gal Hee. Jung Hee.

767
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:38,309
Nam Hee. I enjoyed it.
Take good care of him.

768
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:42,880
- Gal Hee!
- Gal Hee!

769
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:27,659
Director Do.

770
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:53,349
Why did you want to see me?

771
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:56,679
Well... It's...

772
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:02,360
I...

773
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,530
Actually...

774
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,860
After firing you like that,

775
00:57:10,269 --> 00:57:12,699
I thought I wouldn't be able to
get over you by staying here.

776
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,170
So I thought about
all sorts of weird things...

777
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:18,409
like going to Cuba
and learning salsa.

778
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,840
When you left after working
one extra day,

779
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,280
I regretted...

780
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:26,820
not stopping you.

781
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:29,820
I was too heart-broken
by your absence...

782
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,550
and couldn't rejoice at
how the board meeting went well.

783
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,119
That's why I couldn't even go
to my office.

784
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:40,059
But was it easy...

785
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,130
for you...

786
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,900
to get over me?

787
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,309
When I asked you to put
that cardigan again,

788
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,909
I was saying that
I wanted to see you that much.

789
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,280
And when I fired you...

790
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,119
I was saying...

791
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:10,329
how much I loved you.

792
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,670
What...

793
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,900
did you just say?

794
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:28,639
Did you say...

795
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,980
that you love me?

796
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:38,690
Say that again.

797
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:45,190
Is it love?

798
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:52,329
I love you.

799
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:06,380
You don't need to feel
anxious at all anymore.

800
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,150
It's all over.

801
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,619
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

802
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:46,289
I would like to introduce
myself again.

803
00:59:46,289 --> 00:59:47,860
My name is Jeong Gal Hee.

804
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,260
I'm working for a great boss,
who accepts me warts and all.

805
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,289
I'm Do Min Ik.

806
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:54,500
I'm a man crazily in love with you.

807
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,800
This must have been
the only option...

808
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,469
the secretaries had.

809
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,000
I'm trying to make a plan...

810
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,440
and I need your help.
