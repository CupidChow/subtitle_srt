1
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,579
What is it?

2
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,020
Why do I have to pretend to be you?

3
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,119
Wait.

4
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,189
President Park! President Park!

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,630
I will make your boss...

6
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,799
president.

7
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,109
What?

8
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,609
Wasn't it your ultimate goal?

9
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,280
To make your boss president.

10
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,420
If you successfully carry out
the mission of playing me,

11
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,219
at the presidential election
of TnT Mobile,

12
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:32,299
I will readily give
my 100,000 votes to your boss.

13
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,719
I know I sound crazy.

14
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,129
I don't know
if I can describe how I feel.

15
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,599
It's true that
I liked Veronica Park.

16
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,599
It's also true that
I tried to kiss you.

17
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,240
I liked both you and her,

18
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,840
which made me feel like
a disgusting and stupid person.

19
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,909
I hated myself.

20
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,849
Still,

21
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,949
I thought choosing Veronica Park
was the right thing to do.

22
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:27,990
She's the woman...

23
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:31,189
I fell in love first.

24
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,490
But...

25
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,259
while running here, I realized...

26
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,430
why I fell in love with her...

27
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,270
in the beginning.

28
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,310
It's because she was like you.

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,479
The way she massaged my hand
was like you.

30
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,020
How she loved the coffee from
a convenience store was like you.

31
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,490
Her lips smiling at me...

32
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,000
was like you too.

33
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,370
So...

34
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,439
This crazy man has come
to a conclusion.

35
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,080
It's you, Jeong Gal Hee.

36
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,270
You're not saying anything.

37
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,740
It makes me nervous.

38
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,150
You know that I can't see
your face or facial expression,

39
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,949
right?

40
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,219
Sir.

41
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,689
I'm sorry,

42
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,789
but could you give me...

43
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,199
some time to think?

44
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,670
Of course you need some time.

45
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,769
Yesterday, I created a scene,

46
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,709
saying I couldn't get over
President Park and everything.

47
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,779
And now, here I am, saying all this.
I understand you're confused.

48
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,920
Take your time.

49
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:44,560
Go back in and take some rest.

50
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,439
So...

51
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,740
is your brother coming?

52
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,540
It'll take 2 days and 1 night
for him to get here.

53
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,680
I didn't even tell him
I got injured.

54
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,420
He just thinks
I'm working late today.

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,750
So you're going to be here alone
with a broken arm?

56
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,519
I can leave the hospital tomorrow.

57
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,389
I'll just wash up briefly
and go to bed.

58
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,579
Sir, I'm really okay.

59
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,750
You can't wash up
with the broken arm.

60
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:44,879
Give me your hand.

61
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,250
Give me your hand.

62
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,699
Then, if you don't mind...

63
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,910
How do I wash your hand?

64
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,250
"Six steps for proper handwashing".

65
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,420
"Step one. Put your palms
together and rub them."

66
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,730
Wait.

67
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,069
You're not going to follow
all six steps, are you?

68
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,040
Can't you see?

69
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,470
It says, "If you don't
wash your hands,"

70
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,279
"you'll have 260,000 more germs
in just 3 hours."

71
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,209
Step two. "Grasp your hands
together and rub them."

72
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,389
Can you please do it faster?

73
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,259
Let's move on to step three.

74
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,959
"Rub the palm of one hand
with the back of your other hand."

75
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,129
The back of your hand?

76
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,829
The hospital may seem clean,
but it's filled with germs.

77
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,399
On top of that, fine dust is
a really serious issue these days.

78
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,970
So it's very important for us
to wash our hands.

79
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,480
Step four. "Rub your thumb..."

80
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,480
"with the palm of your other hand."

81
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,550
Step five.
"Clasp your fingers together..."

82
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,860
"and rub them together thoroughly."

83
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,540
Hey.

84
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,410
I know I failed to gain your trust.

85
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,850
So even if you tell me
that you don't like me,

86
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,589
I won't have much to say to that.

87
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,160
No.

88
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
Don't say you don't like me.

89
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,029
I'll give you as much time
as you need.

90
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:12,699
Director Do.

91
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,300
Let's talk about that later.

92
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,399
I know there's nothing I can do
if you decide...

93
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,240
to reject me.

94
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,579
No.

95
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,110
Don't reject me.

96
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,480
You're...

97
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,120
a very positive person.

98
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,960
Right?

99
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,929
Step six isn't necessary,
so you can go now.

100
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,470
I think you already killed
all the germs.

101
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Here.

102
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,879
I noticed people do this
when they hurt their arms.

103
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,179
(Veronica Park)

104
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,460
I wonder if something happened.

105
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,830
6421.

106
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,399
The phone is turned off. You will be
directed to voicemail.

107
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,000
- Please leave a message...
- Why is his phone turned off?

108
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,269
No way.

109
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,340
He can't still be waiting for me.

110
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:05,509
Ok Soon.

111
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,450
Please let me change my name!

112
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,850
Are you okay?

113
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,759
I injured my neck,
so that means I'm fine.

114
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,789
What?

115
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,289
I will never have to bow
in front of anyone.

116
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,730
So now that it's in place,
it actually suits me.

117
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,429
And it somehow feels stable...

118
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,100
That's my bag, right?

119
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,740
Oh, right.

120
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,600
Secretary Park told me
to give it to you.

121
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,039
Your phone kept ringing inside.

122
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,480
(Gi Dae Ju)

123
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,309
Is everything okay?

124
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:46,250
Please contact me when you can.
I'll be waiting.

125
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,789
Now that you've checked
that I'm okay, you should go home.

126
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,059
Hey, Ok Soon. Ok Soon...

127
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,419
Hey!

128
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,370
Dae Ju.

129
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,009
Did you get hurt?

130
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,519
Why are you still waiting here?

131
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,980
What happened?

132
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,320
I was involved in a car accident.

133
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,889
But it's nothing serious.

134
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,490
The doctor said I'll be fine
if I wear this for a couple of days.

135
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,759
Anyway,

136
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,029
from now on, if anyone doesn't
show up after five hours,

137
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,370
just curse them and leave.

138
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,600
Don't wait until they show up.

139
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,940
You're the one who should've
taken some rest...

140
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,309
if you got hurt...

141
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,039
regardless of whether
someone's waiting for you or not.

142
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,779
You're so foolishly nice.

143
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,850
Don't ever come
running like this again.

144
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,950
Weren't you supposed
to tell me today...

145
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,320
if you're going to choose me
or Min Ik?

146
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,320
What should I do?

147
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,460
I'm really having a hard time...

148
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,029
deciding on whom I should choose.

149
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:36,690
I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry up.

150
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,429
It bothers me
that I can't talk to my friend.

151
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,470
And it also bothers me
that this keeps happening...

152
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,299
every time we meet.

153
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,210
Okay, fine.

154
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,309
Then let's see.

155
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,919
I don't think it's Do Min Ik.

156
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,759
No.

157
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,269
You're not the one either.

158
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,470
Bye, then.

159
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:18,740
I'm... I'm not the one?

160
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,440
Are you leaving right now?

161
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,909
I told you, didn't I?

162
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,309
I always say "hello",
but I never say "goodbye".

163
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,950
This is absurd.

164
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,519
I thought you had feelings for me.

165
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,990
Was I mistaken?

166
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,120
I admire...

167
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,330
the fact that you don't get
intimidated by me.

168
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,100
And I like how you foolishly
waited for me for five hours.

169
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,139
And more importantly, I respect you
for having grown up so well...

170
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,570
even when you grew up
with no parents.

171
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,240
But there's just one thing
that bothers me.

172
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,110
What's that?

173
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,309
You're too chaste.

174
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:06,279
Then you'll like
everything about me now.

175
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,519
Ms. Lee, how much longer
do we need to wait?

176
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,230
Is Gal Hee really coming?

177
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,799
Ms. Lee, I don't think I can make it
to the gathering...

178
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,029
because I got into a car accident.

179
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:58,000
I didn't get badly injured,
so you don't need to worry.

180
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,470
I'll call you back tomorrow.

181
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,970
She got into an accident
on her way here.

182
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,039
What?

183
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,639
Fortunately, she didn't get
badly injured.

184
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,980
I really wanted to make Gal Hee
join our group today.

185
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,250
Why? Is there something wrong?

186
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,230
To be honest, there's something...

187
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,899
I need to tell you guys.

188
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:35,070
How am I going to tell her?

189
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,909
Gal Hee.

190
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,120
Here you are.

191
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,620
Did your boss leave?

192
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:56,490
I have something to tell you,
President Park.

193
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,759
Do you need money?

194
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:02,169
I told you that I'll pay
for your hospital fee.

195
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,529
Director Do...

196
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,370
told me that he likes me,

197
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,409
not Veronica Park.

198
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:12,539
He told me that he likes me,
Jeong Gal Hee!

199
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:21,220
My neck...

200
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,590
Why am I happy about this?

201
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,389
Thank you for being happy for me.

202
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,389
To be honest,
this is the first time...

203
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,600
someone ever told me
that they like me.

204
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,470
How did it feel? Did it feel nice?
Were you happy?

205
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,429
"The reason I fell for
Veronica Park was..."

206
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,470
"because she was like you."

207
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,000
As he said that,

208
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:44,840
I wasn't even sure
if I hurt my arm or my heart.

209
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,080
My heart kept pounding.

210
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,879
I felt nauseated...

211
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,980
and dizzy.

212
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:52,980
Me too.

213
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,149
He said,
"You will like everything now."

214
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,690
And like a salmon that
goes up a river, into my mouth...

215
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,230
What?

216
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,359
I'll write the rest of it
in my diary.

217
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,029
Just continue.

218
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,900
So...

219
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,140
I decided.

220
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,769
You said you'd make
Director Do the president.

221
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,309
I refuse the offer.

222
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,079
You don't want him
to be president?

223
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,109
Of course I do.

224
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:23,750
But I believe...

225
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,680
Director Do will be able...

226
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,950
to become president
without help from anyone.

227
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,119
What if...

228
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,990
he doesn't forgive you?

229
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,160
Even if he doesn't,

230
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,200
I think I should
tell him the truth...

231
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,269
and apologize first.

232
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,140
Okay.

233
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,549
Good luck.

234
00:17:58,819 --> 00:17:59,980
Thank you.

235
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,450
Thank you, President Park.

236
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:07,319
Can I talk to Director Do
tomorrow then?

237
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,490
Let's do this.

238
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,700
I'll dump him first.

239
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:17,130
- You will?
- We had a deal.

240
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,339
Once I start a serious
relationship with Dae Ju,

241
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:25,609
I will end things with your boss.

242
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,480
Are you going to be okay?

243
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:30,980
Tomorrow evening at six.

244
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,450
After I, Veronica Park, have it out
with Ms. Park Seok Ja,

245
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,619
you, Veronica Park,

246
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:41,829
will tell him the truth.

247
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,799
Okay?

248
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,559
Okay.

249
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:51,869
Let's meet again alive.

250
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:53,799
Okay.

251
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,180
I should've told you sooner,

252
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,480
but I couldn't do it because...

253
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,019
Right.

254
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,559
Because I came to like him.

255
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,730
I should be honest.

256
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,930
Before I knew it,

257
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,400
I came to like you.

258
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,009
It's Director Do.

259
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:37,180
I haven't told him yet.
Is it okay to answer it now?

260
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,599
Hello?

261
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,630
Hey. Well... Were you sleeping?

262
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,269
Not yet.

263
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,140
What's the matter?

264
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,640
Well...

265
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,210
I've been
in the hospital alone before.

266
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,150
I know the place makes you...

267
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:20,259
feel lonely and melancholy at night.

268
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,160
So I thought I should have
a talk with you.

269
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,730
I'm not...

270
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:29,299
used to things like this though.

271
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,670
If you don't like
talking on the phone,

272
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,869
I can come over to see you.
What do you think?

273
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:37,910
No.

274
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,480
No?

275
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,210
Well... Actually,

276
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,720
I didn't mean to go there for real.

277
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:49,990
I was just saying that.

278
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,289
- Director Do.
- Yes?

279
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,000
Director Do.

280
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,269
What?

281
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,210
So it wasn't a lie, was it?

282
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,539
You like me, not President Park.

283
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,049
And you called me
so I don't feel lonely.

284
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,019
Is the whole thing true?

285
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,480
Why?

286
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,890
Do you think I'm lying?

287
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:27,089
Yes. It feels like a lie.

288
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,759
I've spent all my life
worrying about...

289
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,700
and taking care of others.

290
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,000
Having someone like me
and care about me.

291
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,670
I'm not used to it.

292
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,680
From now on,
I'll do the whole thing.

293
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,549
I'll care about you,

294
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,720
and like you.

295
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,450
Oh, right. I'll make coffee for you.

296
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,259
Now that you say it,

297
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,130
I feel so nervous.

298
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:06,029
Well...

299
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,269
I should go to sleep then.

300
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,369
You should sleep too.

301
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay.

302
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,539
Take good care of yourself.
Rest well.

303
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:20,640
Why is she feeling nervous?

304
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,480
Is she worried if I'd go
back to Veronica Park?

305
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,150
All right. I should
break up with her first.

306
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,059
(Are you feeling okay?
I have something to tell you.)

307
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,089
(Can I see you
for a moment tomorrow?)

308
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,319
Are you feeling okay?

309
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,220
I have something to tell you.

310
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,720
Can I see you for a moment tomorrow?

311
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,859
He will be really shocked.

312
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,670
I heard you came by.

313
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,609
I'll leave the hospital tomorrow.
What about Seoul Park at eight?

314
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,839
I have something to tell you too.

315
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,140
So Ms. Lee's plan was...

316
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,980
to have Gal Hee join us.

317
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:03,250
But Gal Hee's not coming to work.
What do we do now?

318
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,980
Why did she get hurt just now?

319
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,720
It would've been nice if she could
tell us how Director Do is doing.

320
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,950
Excuse me.

321
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,490
Gosh, I'm startled.

322
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,859
Director Do.

323
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:20,660
Would you please tell me
how to make coffee?

324
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:21,930
- Pardon?
- What?

325
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,799
Why do you want to know that?

326
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,900
Once Gal Hee comes back,
she will do it for you.

327
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,140
Secretary Jeong...

328
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,339
isn't here to make some coffee.

329
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,470
Well... I just mean...

330
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,039
But why are you yelling at me?

331
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,750
Secretary Jeong hurt her arm.

332
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,319
She needs to get enough rest.

333
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,819
And I think a man
in his mid 30s should know...

334
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:44,119
how to make his own coffee.

335
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,160
And sometimes,

336
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,289
I might want to serve
coffee to someone.

337
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,460
I'll teach you.

338
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
This way.

339
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:58,769
Turn on the power first.

340
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,470
Once it blinks...

341
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,569
What is Ms. Lee going to do now?

342
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,279
I hope she has a plan.

343
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,180
I'm so sorry...

344
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:16,220
about my daughter.

345
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,890
Is something wrong?

346
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,890
You barely came
to see me these days.

347
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,789
Something didn't feel right,

348
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,700
so I told Min Ik
to meet President Park.

349
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,200
What did he say? Did they meet?

350
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:31,000
I haven't heard from him since then.

351
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,779
Ms. Sim. Would you have
dinner with me tonight?

352
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,140
Dinner?

353
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,130
Yes, Mom.

354
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,829
If you don't have any plan tonight,

355
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,369
will you have dinner with me?

356
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,869
What?

357
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,170
Only you and me?

358
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,140
Why? You don't want it?

359
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,210
I just think this is the first time.

360
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,880
I have a plan tonight though.

361
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,880
I guess I can stop by.
I'll see you there.

362
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,059
If you hear a scream,
come inside in three seconds.

363
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,329
And have an ambulance ready
in front of the hotel.

364
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,700
Yes, ma'am.

365
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,319
Did you call me to show
how much you can drink?

366
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,319
You said we'd be eating together.
What are you doing?

367
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,930
You'd better have a glass of it
in advance.

368
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,869
In about 10 minutes,

369
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,339
you will feel like drinking anyway.

370
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:17,970
If you don't want to have a broken
body part in about 15 minutes,

371
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,279
you'd better stop it.

372
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,509
Mother.

373
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,849
I, Veronica Park,

374
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,190
will make a big announcement now.

375
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,089
I, Veronica Park...

376
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:33,289
What?

377
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,690
I, Veronica Park, am...

378
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,269
- seeing another man...
- Hello.

379
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:46,000
Oh, my. Hi.

380
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,099
Oh, no.

381
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,940
Ms. Sim.

382
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,440
What brings you here?

383
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,809
I'm spending some time
with my son,

384
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,250
and I heard you were here.

385
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:02,319
I heard you were injured.
Are you okay, President Park?

386
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,319
President Park?

387
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,329
What are you doing?
Say hello to her.

388
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:10,390
Right.

389
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,500
Hello.

390
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,869
Hello, President Park.

391
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,599
Hello.

392
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,470
Come take a seat.

393
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,109
If you were going
to eat with your son anyway,

394
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:28,339
we might as well eat all together.

395
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:29,549
Shall we?

396
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,380
I...

397
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,220
I actually have something to say
to President Park.

398
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,890
Could you please excuse us...

399
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,319
for a moment?

400
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:44,890
Oh, my. Did she cause some
trouble again?

401
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,359
No, it's not her. It's me...

402
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,500
You brat. What did you do?

403
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,970
Why are you shushing him?

404
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,539
Excuse me. No matter what it takes,

405
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,839
I'm going to do something
about either 1 of the 2.

406
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,849
If she made trouble
like the last time,

407
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:05,549
I will give her a good scolding.

408
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:09,190
If she didn't,
I will set the wedding date.

409
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,920
So if you want to say something,
you should say it here.

410
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:18,730
Your food is ready.

411
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,460
Good.

412
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,400
Come on, Chairwoman Park.

413
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,839
President Park doesn't make trouble.

414
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,940
Please calm down.

415
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:31,470
It's out first time
to spend some time together.

416
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,410
How about we take a seat
and have some food first?

417
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,190
Hi, Nam Hee. I just wired the money.

418
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,589
Hey, it's okay to be
a few days late.

419
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,099
You don't have to be so punctual.
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

420
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,130
I sent some extra this month,

421
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,000
so eat some steaks.
You're in the States after all.

422
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:03,539
And make sure to stay healthy.

423
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,380
I think you're the one
who should eat well.

424
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,480
What's wrong with your voice?

425
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,180
Did something happen?

426
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,849
Hey, Nam Hee. Come mop here.

427
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,150
I'm sorry.
I have to go to the class.

428
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,789
Sure. I'll call you later then.

429
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,160
I'm coming.

430
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:25,660
Hello.

431
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:28,670
How do you want to cut your hair?

432
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:32,000
I just want it to look neat.

433
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,869
I have
an important appointment today.

434
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:36,410
Please wait here for a second.

435
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:40,839
Mom.

436
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,279
This will be the last time
I look like this.

437
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,720
What if...

438
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,160
Director Do doesn't forgive me?

439
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,130
Gal Hee.

440
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,660
You can't run away to a paradise.

441
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,500
You know it
because you've been there.

442
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,670
You know how miserable it was...

443
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,109
to live as a different woman.

444
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,009
Tell him about your feelings
just as you prepared.

445
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,720
Then...

446
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,880
he will understand.

447
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,000
She's so talkative...

448
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,339
that she already started talking
before she babbled.

449
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,309
But why are you so silent now?

450
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:52,380
I'm sick.

451
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,119
Is it serious?

452
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,019
You had a car accident
on the way to the concert to see me.

453
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:01,559
It made me feel bad.

454
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,589
Concert?

455
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,930
Secretary Park said you were
on the way to a preview.

456
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,299
I was going to go to the concert...

457
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:11,269
Did you lose your voice?

458
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:15,170
Do you want me
to make a hole for you?

459
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,549
I was going to go
to the concert first...

460
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,349
and then to the preview.

461
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,220
President Park's voice sounds weird
today. It must be the injury.

462
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,769
Code blue. Your boss is now...

463
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,799
Mother.

464
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,940
Do you want me to...

465
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:52,680
crush your fingers too?

466
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,849
You're eating with elders here.
Have some respect.

467
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,619
All business people are like that.

468
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:02,119
Where did it go?

469
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,450
Let me try calling you.

470
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:11,329
Don't do it. Don't do it.

471
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,799
It won't ring.

472
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,440
Stop it.

473
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:28,140
Director Do, don't bother.

474
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,420
You don't have to, Mother.

475
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:35,019
I think I put it on mute.

476
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,690
9013...

477
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,829
Isn't your phone number 9013?

478
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,299
No, it's 8618.

479
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,099
You know...

480
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:57,440
I have more phones than fingers,
don't you?

481
00:33:57,809 --> 00:33:58,980
What are you talking about?

482
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,180
I have all your numbers.

483
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,079
Look.
Ok Soon 1, Ok Soon 2, Ok Soon 3...

484
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,250
Mother.

485
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,090
Let him eat first.

486
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,429
Eat this and try this too.

487
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:26,469
Please help yourself.

488
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,579
It has peanuts on it.

489
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,809
Yes. Don't you like peanuts?

490
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,920
Oh, no!

491
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,619
Did you spit out everything? Here.

492
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:43,849
Rinse your mouth. Hurry up.

493
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,619
Why...

494
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,989
Peanuts!

495
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,400
Well...

496
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,960
Awesome.

497
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:24,659
It looks like you love peanuts.

498
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,349
Oh, my. Min Ik!

499
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,780
Why did he storm out?
That was so rude of him.

500
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,250
Follow him.

501
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,570
Min Ik, are you okay?

502
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:17,449
Min Ik.

503
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:21,519
Do you have an upset stomach?

504
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,650
What's wrong with you
all of a sudden?

505
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,719
Hey.

506
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:27,960
I think we need to talk.

507
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,989
What if I do have an upset stomach?

508
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,090
What?

509
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:32,460
What will you do if I tell you
that I have an upset stomach?

510
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,860
What are you talking about?

511
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,599
I actually have an ambulance
waiting in front of the hotel.

512
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,199
Would you like to go
to the hospital?

513
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,550
Can you massage my hand?

514
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,610
What?

515
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,530
Like this?

516
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,400
Go down. Go down.

517
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,840
It shall go down
as if there's oil in it.

518
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,769
Stop bothering my girl
and go down immediately.

519
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,210
Who are you?

520
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,690
Well...

521
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,619
The thing is...

522
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,599
(Veronica Park)

523
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,309
I'm sorry I couldn't pick up.

524
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,550
I'm in front of the carousel.

525
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,949
Where are you?

526
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,550
So you're telling me...

527
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,449
that you're...

528
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,260
in front of the carousel?

529
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:11,559
Min Ik, please hear me out first.

530
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:12,559
No.

531
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,829
I'll...

532
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,000
be right there.

533
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,679
Min Ik. Min Ik.

534
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,949
My gosh, what am I going to do?

535
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:34,019
(Director Do, I'm really sorry.)

536
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:36,389
"I didn't intend on lying to you
from the very beginning."

537
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:40,260
"But I unintentionally
ended up falling for you."

538
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,760
"And I wanted to keep seeing you."

539
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,360
"I wanted to keep seeing you."

540
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:57,670
Let's not get nervous.
Let's just take it slow.

541
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:02,139
Let's just do as I practiced
and tell him how I truly feel.

542
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:05,949
Director Do.

543
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,429
Your neck...

544
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:22,429
Did you eat peanuts?

545
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,699
My gosh.

546
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,099
Are you really...

547
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:30,409
Veronica Park?

548
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,130
How did you know
that I'm allergic to peanuts?

549
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,130
Your secretary.

550
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,239
Your secretary told me.

551
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:06,579
I thought you were Veronica Park
for a second.

552
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,380
It's me, Secretary Jeong.

553
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,880
What if I'm also lying to you?

554
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,019
What if it turns out
that I'm hiding something from you?

555
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,989
This Band-Aid isn't
very common, is it?

556
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,130
Number 99?
This belongs to Veronica Park.

557
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,670
What's this doing here?

558
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,869
Secretary Jeong.

559
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,210
Is that you?

560
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,980
Director Do, let me explain.

561
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:47,250
It's not you, right?

562
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,489
It can't be you.

563
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,420
I met that woman so many times.

564
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,360
So all those times
I spent with her,

565
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,230
you were actually lying to me?

566
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:10,539
That can't be true.

567
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:13,880
That's impossible.

568
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,880
I'm sorry, Director Do.

569
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,420
I'm sorry.

570
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,389
Why?

571
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,590
Why did you do that?

572
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,199
Why did you do that to me?

573
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,369
I never meant to deceive you.

574
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:41,039
President Park was late.

575
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:45,010
And the food at the restaurant
looked so delicious.

576
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,380
At first, it was just a joke.

577
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,409
A joke?

578
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,659
This illness I have
is devastating to me.

579
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:05,829
But you thought of it as a chance
to joke around with me?

580
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,429
No, that's not what I meant.

581
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,329
I'm sorry.

582
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:16,139
I'm sorry, Director Do.

583
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,210
It must've been fun.

584
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:22,480
What?

585
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,309
Since your boss can't see
people's faces,

586
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,679
you were a secretary by day...

587
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,150
but was able to become a totally
different person at night.

588
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,619
You were able to witness
your swell-headed boss...

589
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,760
get excited...

590
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,929
and become desperate for love.

591
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,400
I can only imagine how fun
it must've been for you to see me...

592
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,869
hopelessly fall in love.

593
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,440
No, that's not true.

594
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:51,039
It wasn't fun at all.

595
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,139
I didn't even know any of this,
so I even got a CT scan...

596
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:54,639
because I thought I was crazy.

597
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,210
And I even resented my late father
for a while.

598
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,420
I told you why I had a hard time
trusting my secretaries.

599
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,590
And I even told you
that I won't ever...

600
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,320
be able to trust anyone
if you also ended up deceiving me.

601
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:12,329
How could you do this to me?

602
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,800
I'm sorry.

603
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,269
I'm sorry.

604
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,010
Director Do.

605
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,280
Let go of me.

606
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,889
I told you to let go.

607
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,130
I know you hate me right now.

608
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:53,139
And I know I made a mistake.

609
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,010
Eat this before you sleep.

610
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:29,039
What is the matter with you?

611
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,510
You suddenly left
while you were eating.

612
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,210
And I couldn't even get
ahold of you.

613
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,909
And why did President Park say
she doesn't want to get married?

614
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,110
Are you not listening to me?

615
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,510
Min Ik!

616
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,280
Min Ik!

617
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,880
How did it go? Did you tell him?

618
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,519
Did he forgive you?

619
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:26,719
I didn't say anything.

620
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,659
As I saw...

621
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,260
Director Do's angry face,

622
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:42,599
I was so scared, terrified,
and sorry.

623
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:47,909
All the words I prepared
just vanished into air.

624
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,010
"I'm sorry."

625
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:54,719
"It's all my fault."

626
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:57,949
That's all I could say.

627
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:02,789
You practiced it
all through the night.

628
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:08,300
He got hurt even more than when he
found out he can't recognize faces.

629
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,199
But I...

630
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:19,880
didn't even think about
how it'd feel like...

631
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,010
to be deceived by someone like me.

632
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,250
I was...

633
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,389
just flattered to hear
that he likes me.

634
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:35,619
I just felt on top of the world.

635
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:52,239
I wanted to help him,
but I only broke his heart.

636
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,050
What do I do, Mom?

637
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:02,250
What am I going to do now?

638
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,289
Mr. Do Min Ik.

639
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,869
Does he have prosopagnosia or what?

640
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,969
I'm a cop.

641
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,940
- Police?
- Okay.

642
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,510
What are you doing here?

643
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:02,840
Did you find Eun Jung Su?

644
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:06,010
No. We're here to find Gi Dae Ju,
not Eun Jung Su.

645
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:07,219
Dae Ju?

646
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:12,619
Yes, Boss. There's something
I need to report to you.

647
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:22,159
- Mr. Eun.
- We checked the CCTV footage...

648
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,269
from the crosswalk and the
convenience store just in case.

649
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,670
The person Eun Jung Su met
right before he disappeared was...

650
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:31,969
Gi Dae Ju.

651
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:41,949
Why? Are you going to say that
we're suspecting a wrong person?

652
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:44,949
Dae Ju?

653
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:47,019
11:53pm?

654
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:50,659
He was already there
when you arrived.

655
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:54,030
Are you for or against it?

656
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,199
I'm for it.

657
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,400
(Pennsylvania, Gi Dae Ju)

658
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,469
Dae Ju?

659
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,269
Why is Dae Ju's name in this file?

660
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,250
Mr. Do Min Ik.

661
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,349
Where is Gi Dae Ju now?

662
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:20,119
Well... I'm sorry,

663
00:50:20,389 --> 00:50:23,730
but can I talk to him first?

664
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,909
Why are you staring at me like that?
I feel shy.

665
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:47,780
All right.

666
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,150
I thought we should
settle the girl problem here.

667
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:53,159
Eun Jung Su.

668
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:55,460
What?

669
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,860
How do you know him?

670
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,199
Why are you talking about him
all of a sudden?

671
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:03,199
I asked how you know him.

672
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,300
I thought I should tell you this.

673
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:10,710
You heard it
from President Sim, right?

674
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,010
That Mr. Eun was his driver.

675
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,210
What?

676
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,579
The thing is...

677
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,780
I should find a new driver.

678
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:20,849
That's good.

679
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:24,250
I heard my former driver's
father passed away.

680
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,659
So I'm going to the funeral.
I'll find one there.

681
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,489
Do you remember that?

682
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:31,690
You asked me to find a new driver
for you saying it's urgent.

683
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,690
Mr. Park.

684
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:36,030
Do you know any driver
who can start working right away?

685
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,269
Director Do Min Ik
needs a new driver.

686
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,840
I don't know. Would there be anyone?

687
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,780
Everyone I know is employed now.

688
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,079
Well...

689
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,550
I met Mr. Eun that day
at the funeral.

690
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,190
He once woke me up and asked me to
pick him up in the dead of the night

691
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,230
You know your uncle.
He fires people so easily.

692
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,960
I heard he got fired
for an unfair reason.

693
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,329
He said he was looking for a job.

694
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:11,630
It's not easy to find a new job.

695
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,900
Director Do Min Ik of our company
is looking for a driver.

696
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:16,840
Would you mind working for him?

697
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,409
I'd be grateful to work for him.

698
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,039
But...

699
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,280
can you please not tell him...

700
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,219
that I was President Sim's driver?

701
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:30,150
They are family.

702
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:34,019
He might be uncomfortable hiring me.

703
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:35,960
That's why
I couldn't tell you sooner.

704
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,590
When we ran into each other at work,

705
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,500
we just exchanged greetings.

706
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,630
Did you meet him?

707
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,300
I just said hi to him.

708
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:46,000
So what about Mr. Eun?

709
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:48,000
Is that it?

710
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,670
Should there be something else?

711
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,409
The day you went to the funeral.

712
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,480
Why did you meet him
at the convenience store?

713
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,449
Do you shadow me or what?

714
00:52:57,449 --> 00:52:59,250
Just answer the question.

715
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:02,679
We just happened to meet.

716
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,320
I went to buy some socks,
and I met everyone there.

717
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,889
Director Choi,
Assistant Manager Park,

718
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:09,420
and other employees who came
to buy some cigarettes.

719
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,690
Does it make you upset?

720
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,800
You really don't know?

721
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,630
On the day I had the accident there,

722
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:19,000
the one who stabbed me there...

723
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,570
was Eun Jung Su.

724
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,510
What are you talking about?
That's ridiculous.

725
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,679
You had the accident
even before I met Mr. Eun.

726
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,150
Then Mr. Eun tried to kill you,
met me at the funeral,

727
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:36,349
and got a job as your driver?

728
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:38,550
Do you think it makes sense?

729
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:40,059
What if...

730
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,929
it's not that you met him
at the funeral for the first time?

731
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:45,360
What?

732
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,659
What if it is that you've
known him the whole time?

733
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,000
I told you.

734
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,230
I just borrowed the phone that day.

735
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,269
Thank you.

736
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:57,170
It was so dark that
I could barely see his face.

737
00:53:58,639 --> 00:53:59,809
So...

738
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,880
are you...

739
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:04,980
suspecting me now?

740
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,690
Is that why you called the police?

741
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:19,389
Gosh.

742
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:22,829
Come to think of it, there's
one thing I lied to you about.

743
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:26,230
When you were seven,
on your birthday...

744
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:29,800
Here. Take it.

745
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:32,769
I'm sick of it now.

746
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,010
Really?

747
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,250
I wasn't sick of it at all.

748
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,949
I wanted to play with it every day.

749
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,119
But you seemed to like it.

750
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:47,989
I lied that I was sick of it
because you seemed to want it.

751
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:52,460
I had no idea you'd treat me
like this over 20 years later.

752
00:54:58,869 --> 00:54:59,900
Mr. Gi Dae Ju.

753
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:02,099
May I take you
to the police station?

754
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,269
Okay.

755
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:38,809
My gift is always
too good for you, right?

756
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:40,340
(Exclusive Run Contract of
TnT Mobile and Cinepark)

757
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,579
With this, you will make
the president with no problem.

758
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:49,280
Now that I've completed my mission,
I'll hand in my resignation today.

759
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:51,050
Salute.

760
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,380
Hello, Boss.

761
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:01,889
Hello, sir.

762
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,239
Have you taken your medication?

763
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,110
Just in case,

764
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,070
I scheduled an appointment
with Dr. Gu.

765
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:30,079
I'm sorry, sir.

766
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,349
I'm so sorry.

767
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,090
I don't know what else to say.

768
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:40,500
I understand how you feel
better than anyone and...

769
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,239
Do you know what it is like...

770
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:51,539
to not be able to see others' faces?

771
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,610
It feels like seeing
a sign called human turning off.

772
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,179
You can't see what you have to see.

773
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,050
You can't read...

774
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:08,219
what you have to read.

775
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:13,659
It makes you doubt
your friend you trusted.

776
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,400
It makes you believe people
who try to harm me.

777
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Sometimes,

778
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:23,909
I'm not even sure who I am.

779
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:29,039
To me...

780
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,210
To me...

781
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:38,090
Jeong Gal Hee, you were...

782
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,389
the only person.

783
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,570
Once the trust between the boss
and the secretary breaks,

784
00:58:58,139 --> 00:58:59,940
you know what happens.

785
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,579
Jeong Gal Hee.

786
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:11,590
You're fired.

787
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:44,349
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

788
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:46,590
Sir, it's me. Secretary Jeong.

789
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,789
Don't you know what "fired" means?

790
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:51,630
You should leave.
There's no place for you here.

791
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,000
I want you to know this one thing.

792
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,630
She was so happy when you confessed
your feelings to her.

793
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:58,699
What is this?

794
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:01,039
Find all the secretaries
related to this. I'll fire them all.

795
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:04,239
Director Do Min Ik is suffering
from a serious illness.
