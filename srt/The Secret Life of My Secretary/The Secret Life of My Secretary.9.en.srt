1
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,679
70 dollars for a full body massage,
and 50 dollars for only the feet.

2
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,820
I'm Korean.

3
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,469
(Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just.)

4
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,650
Don't move.

5
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,359
Whenever I came home, there was
always something on the floor.

6
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,329
So I got suspicious.

7
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,209
It's a box cutter.

8
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,340
I didn't want to use a weapon
like a gentleman though.

9
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,420
Have you heard of this expression?

10
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,349
"A blind man is reckless."

11
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,019
I'm that blind man.

12
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,930
How did you know the laptop was
the only valuable thing here?

13
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,439
No!

14
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,810
No! Not the laptop!

15
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:26,349
Blood.

16
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,590
Sir, could you just take my eyes
instead of the laptop?

17
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,259
I'm just a blind man.

18
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,830
I can't buy a laptop to my family,

19
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,689
but at least I shouldn't
let it be stolen, sir!

20
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,569
Hi-Fi.

21
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,199
Yes, did you call me?

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,870
Can you...

23
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,800
No!

24
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,469
Make a call to Jeong Gal...

25
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,310
"Jeong Gal" is not found
in your contact list.

26
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,909
It's not "Jeong Gal".
It's "Jeong Gal Hee"!

27
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:58,479
I'm afraid I have a hearing problem.

28
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,389
Could you say it more clearly?

29
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,490
No...

30
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,159
Call the police!

31
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,490
I will dial the number.

32
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,229
Be careful...

33
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,060
Police emergencies. Hello?

34
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,000
Hello? Please say something.

35
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,699
Hello? Are you okay?

36
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,099
We've got your address.
We'll be right there.

37
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,539
Hey!

38
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,930
I must have lost my mind.

39
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:49,870
What's wrong with me?

40
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,240
I'll tell him everything
when I go to work tomorrow morning.

41
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,210
Please give me one day.

42
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,180
Where should I start...

43
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,780
and how should I tell him?

44
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,919
Why is there a police car here?

45
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,860
What is going on here?

46
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,060
Sir.

47
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,970
What is this?

48
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,300
There's cash right here...

49
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,240
and he just left without taking it.

50
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,939
He didn't touch anything
in the rooms.

51
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,180
Then he was trying to steal...

52
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,910
just this laptop?

53
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,949
I remember you. From TnT Mobile.

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,449
Do you live here?

55
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,019
Yes. What's the matter?

56
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,290
There was a thief.

57
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,629
A thief?

58
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,829
Where is my brother, Jung Hee?

59
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,100
He was taken to the hospital
by ambulance.

60
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,970
He said he was trying to
protect his sister's laptop.

61
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,370
Jung Hee!

62
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,509
There you are.
Would you like a glass of juice?

63
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,910
- Jung Hee?
- Can I have some crackers?

64
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,350
Okay.

65
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,149
You idiot.

66
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,519
Why did you have to hurt yourself
for this dumb laptop?

67
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,060
Did you just hear that?

68
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,459
Human always comes first.
That's humanism.

69
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,000
I saved your laptop's life.

70
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,970
Do you have any idea
how much a VIP room costs?

71
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:38,379
This laptop doesn't even turn on.

72
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,279
Do you have any idea how much
the hospital bills will be?

73
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,550
Darn capitalism.

74
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,319
Is there a room with six beds?

75
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,589
I'm sorry. This is the only room
we have left.

76
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,089
Is he hurt badly?

77
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,560
He said he bled a lot,

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,899
but it turned out he mistook
grape juice for blood.

79
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,899
I got flustered at the moment.

80
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,629
His little toe is slightly cracked,
so we got it splinted.

81
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,899
But his doctor said
he didn't need to wear a cast...

82
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,870
and he could leave tomorrow.

83
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,750
The painting is crooked.

84
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,550
Or is it not?

85
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,649
Hey. Come gather around.

86
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,360
Didn't Gal Hee say,

87
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,189
"Min Ik"...

88
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,230
that day?

89
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,560
- Did you hear that too?
- Yes.

90
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,730
I thought I misheard it
because we were busy.

91
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,600
Come to think of it,
it's really strange.

92
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,740
I have never seen her
wear such an outfit to the office.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,639
Even when we went to a club,

94
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,410
she put on that fuzzy red cardigan.

95
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,879
It's Gal Hee!

96
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,319
Gal Hee, hi.

97
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,790
Myung Jung.

98
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,860
Did you feed the fish?

99
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,019
Yes.

100
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,930
Are you working on
the scrap papers again?

101
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,029
- Yes.
- Hey, Gal Hee.

102
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,100
Yes?

103
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,040
If you ever came to the office
with a vivid red lipstick on,

104
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,740
what would be the reason?

105
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,370
That will never happen.

106
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,839
Then...

107
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,550
What about if you took your
glasses off and wore contacts?

108
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,550
That will never happen either.

109
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:28,120
Then what about if you
ever call your boss, "Min Ik"?

110
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,089
That will never happen.

111
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,829
Are you asking this...

112
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,769
because you saw
something yesterday...

113
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:44,000
in the office?

114
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,540
- No!
- No!

115
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,610
- Hey.
- Come on!

116
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,970
- We weren't even in the office.
- Don't be ridiculous.

117
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,410
We weren't here, right?

118
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,680
Yes, sir. I'm on my way!

119
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,569
How am I going to face him?

120
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,680
(Director, Do Min Ik)

121
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,949
Don't get nervous.
Let's just act normal.

122
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,819
I'm the same Secretary Jeong
as I was yesterday.

123
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,200
Hello, Director Do.

124
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,830
You're late.

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,970
I'm sorry.
Something happened at my house.

126
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,509
You didn't eat breakfast, did you?

127
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,779
Here's a blueberry yogurt
and a flat white.

128
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,289
And I bought some sushi takeout...

129
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:11,789
from Kingdom Hotel,
so you can have it for lunch...

130
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,220
You must really not want
to look at me...

131
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,159
judging by how you
turned your head like that.

132
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,789
No, it's just that I feel like
I'm coming down with a cold.

133
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,330
Your pebbles are over there.

134
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,070
Thank you.

135
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,409
Are you okay?

136
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:06,409
Why?

137
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,779
Are you hoping that there'd be
something wrong?

138
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,850
No, I mean...

139
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,879
If you're okay, then that's fine.

140
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,919
Something happened.

141
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,659
I broke up...

142
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:22,090
with Veronica Park.

143
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,529
- What about you?
- Pardon?

144
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:30,740
That date you had...

145
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,970
at the dry sauna
who kept sleeping all day.

146
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:38,409
I also broke up with him.

147
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,350
Like you said,
he wasn't that great of a guy.

148
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,450
Good job.

149
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,220
- By any chance, Director Do.
- Yes?

150
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:56,159
If you feel a little down...

151
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,000
and need a buddy
to eat or drink with,

152
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,600
you can always ask me.

153
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,409
I'll go running to you
regardless of...

154
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,909
where I am or what I'm doing.

155
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,610
Why are you suddenly being so nice?
It's making me feel nervous.

156
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,320
Because once I tell Director Gi
about what happened,

157
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,120
this might be the end for us.

158
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,730
I don't need an eating
or drinking buddy,

159
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,529
so go and do your work.

160
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Okay.

161
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,669
I'll hurry up
and get my laptop fixed first.

162
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,450
Why did you suddenly want
to meet me at the office?

163
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,149
I found out that there was
a misunderstanding.

164
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,620
- Director Gi?
- I thought you were behind...

165
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,830
Veronica Park's 100,000 shares,
but I guess it was someone else.

166
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,259
This.

167
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
You know what this is right?

168
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,500
(Sangmo Hospital,
Department of Neurology)

169
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,169
"Department of Neurology"?

170
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,610
Is Min Ik ill?

171
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,279
My gosh, I almost fell for that.

172
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,149
Your acting is good enough to win an
award at the Cannes Film Festival.

173
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:28,149
You and Min Ik know everything
about each other.

174
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,250
How can you not know this?

175
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:36,629
But then again, it doesn't matter
whether you're acting or not.

176
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,070
Just find out
the name of Min Ik's illness.

177
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,870
If I can use that
to get rid of that punk,

178
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,440
I'll integrate the Media Department
and let you have it all.

179
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,250
My gosh.

180
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,250
(Director Gi Dae Ju)

181
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,259
Hello? Director Gi?

182
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,070
He told me that I can't tell anyone
about his illness.

183
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,980
Just find out
the name of Min Ik's illness.

184
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:32,220
If I tell him the truth, that will
put Director Do in danger.

185
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,750
Secretary Jeong.

186
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,789
Yes?

187
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:41,429
By any chance, did Min Ik fail
to recognize me that day...

188
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,159
because he's sick?

189
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,159
No.

190
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,460
He was drunk.

191
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,799
What do you mean?

192
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,600
He never drinks more than
a glass of champagne.

193
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,639
Yes, I know.

194
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,269
You're right. But...

195
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:00,480
What do I need to say
to make him believe me?

196
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,250
What should I say?

197
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,450
- I like Director Do.
- What?

198
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,049
To be honest,

199
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,460
I met up with him that day
to confess my feelings for him.

200
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,730
You saw my outfit, right?
It was different from usual.

201
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:21,129
But when I actually met him,

202
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,330
I couldn't bring myself
to say anything.

203
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,340
That's why he got drunk?

204
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,809
Yes, we both kept
pouring drinks for each other...

205
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:32,509
and ended up
drinking two bottles of soju.

206
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,549
So he eventually got drunk...

207
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:38,220
and couldn't remember
a single thing about that night.

208
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,779
He couldn't remember
my confession...

209
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:44,320
and the fact that we went
to the theater to sober up.

210
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,330
Can you please keep it a secret?

211
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,500
He actually likes someone.

212
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,200
So I felt relieved...

213
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,870
when I heard that he couldn't
remember anything.

214
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,840
If he finds out that I confessed
my feelings for him,

215
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:09,879
he'll obviously feel uncomfortable
working with me.

216
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:13,820
But I still want to remain
by his side.

217
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,289
Do you like Min Ik that much?

218
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,129
I want to protect him.

219
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,500
If I can't do that as his woman,

220
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,429
I want to do that as his secretary.

221
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,870
Secretary Jeong.

222
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,570
Yes, Director Gi.

223
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:36,970
If Min Ik ever happens...

224
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,480
to become ill,

225
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,580
you must tell me no matter what.

226
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,049
You and I are the only people...

227
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,779
that can help him
in this entire company.

228
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,950
Okay, sir.

229
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,490
By the way,

230
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,929
can I also ask you a question?

231
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,029
What's your relationship...

232
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,399
with President Park of Cinepark?

233
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,639
I met up with her for work.

234
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,710
President Sim introduced me to her
so we could talk about...

235
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,250
our company's exclusive rights
to Cinepark's contents.

236
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,750
Was that all?

237
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,690
Yes.

238
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,129
Gosh, I hope I did the right thing.

239
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,899
But why did they watch
a late-night movie together...

240
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:37,629
if they met up for work?

241
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,710
Gosh, I can't get a grasp
of what's going on.

242
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,679
Director Do, where are you going?

243
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:47,279
Cancel all my schedule for today.

244
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,110
Everything? Why all of a sudden?

245
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,450
Just cancel them all.

246
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,549
You should also go home.

247
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:04,829
What if he fails to recognize people
while he walks around alone?

248
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,170
Should I go after him?

249
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,210
Hey.

250
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,210
This place is...

251
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:00,220
Gosh, it's so delicious.

252
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,269
It's not delicious at all.

253
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:29,279
What?

254
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,380
He pretended to be fine.

255
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,500
It's been hours.

256
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,000
He hasn't had anything
since morning.

257
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,230
Gosh, what if he passes out?

258
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,069
(Chocolate pie)

259
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,500
Who are you?

260
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,849
No, thanks. You can eat it.

261
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,160
I'm okay.

262
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,660
Is she mute?

263
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,240
Okay, ma'am.

264
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,009
Thank you for the food.

265
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:54,589
What a weird lady.

266
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,430
Is it okay to eat something
from a stranger?

267
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,680
Why would she even watch me eat?

268
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,240
Eat it.

269
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,960
He ate it.

270
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,859
What's with her?

271
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,170
Come to think of it,

272
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,839
all I've had since morning
was a cup of coffee.

273
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,319
My gosh, what?

274
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,289
Hello, Director Do.

275
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,000
Hey, where are you?

276
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,869
Well... I'm home.

277
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:13,500
That's good. This morning,
you said you'd be my...

278
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,809
drinking and eating buddy
whenever I want.

279
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,809
Is it still valid?

280
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:20,579
Sure.

281
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,809
I happen to be in your neighborhood.

282
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,380
Can you cook for me?

283
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,690
What?

284
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,420
You know...

285
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,390
you cooked white rice for me
at the hotel before.

286
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,559
I want to eat it.

287
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,500
I don't think you can, right?

288
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,400
Actually, I can cook it for you.

289
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,970
Then...

290
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,809
come to my place as late as you can.

291
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:56,480
Make sure to come
as late as possible.

292
00:22:57,549 --> 00:22:58,549
Okay.

293
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,049
Why today of all days?

294
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,259
He's here already.

295
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,630
Flowers?

296
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:52,069
This is my first time
to get flowers from someone.

297
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,400
Don't get me wrong.

298
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,440
It's just wrong to visit
someone's place empty-handed.

299
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,240
And the flower shop was the only...

300
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,509
store that was open
in the neighborhood.

301
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,920
The supermarket is closed already?

302
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,420
Can I come in?

303
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,789
Yes. But...

304
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,859
the house is a little messy.

305
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,269
It's very messy.

306
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,269
Is this how you live?

307
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,440
Actually, a thief
broke in yesterday.

308
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,670
- What?
- Nothing's stolen though.

309
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:32,779
I mean, there's nothing to steal.

310
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,380
Still, the kitchen is fine.

311
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:37,349
Let's go to the kitchen. This way.

312
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,720
Okay.

313
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
This way.

314
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,529
It's delicious.

315
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,309
I got you your favorite foods.

316
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,069
Why did you want to eat this?

317
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,740
No reason.

318
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,680
I just thought of that day.

319
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,480
The white rice you cooked for me
before the stockholders' meeting.

320
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,220
Try this.

321
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,730
I made it myself.

322
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,369
I guess you've lived here
for a long time.

323
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Yes.

324
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,410
My older brother is blind.

325
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:42,180
It's not easy for him
to get used to a new place.

326
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:46,549
Fortunately, we met a good landlord
and have lived here for 10 years...

327
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:47,750
raising the rents regularly.

328
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,819
How is he a good landlord
when he raises the rents regularly?

329
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:53,720
I can say he's a good landlord.

330
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,690
Many others asked us to move out
saying the house price would fall...

331
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,789
because he's disabled.

332
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:02,599
You have a lot of people...

333
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,440
to take care of.

334
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,009
Do you have more rice?

335
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,980
Yes. Sure.

336
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,650
It's good, isn't it?

337
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,750
Did you make this too?

338
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,849
Of course. I made them all.

339
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,519
I'm a pretty good cook.

340
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,190
You're so mean.

341
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,359
Fine.

342
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,799
One more time?

343
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,900
Okay.

344
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,380
You're here.

345
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:04,490
I went to your office
and heard you were here.

346
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,000
This time,

347
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,799
I found this in my bag.

348
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,569
Gosh, it was in your bag?

349
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,470
I had no idea.

350
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,980
Is he one of the guys
who caught your eye?

351
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:24,349
One of the actors who caught my eye.

352
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,079
And you have to be in bed
when you talk to actors?

353
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,920
Awesome.

354
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,890
Are you...

355
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,259
being jealous?

356
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:35,890
I'm asking a question.

357
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,430
He gets happy when I
tell him his pay.

358
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,740
But what should I do
to make you happy?

359
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,009
The bathroom set
came out pretty well.

360
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,079
And the office looks good too.

361
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,309
Which one do you...

362
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:58,450
prefer?

363
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,829
Have I done something
to deserve to get shot?

364
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,690
Hands in the air.

365
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,299
You're the one who said
you were a bad person...

366
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:16,230
and turned yourself in.

367
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,440
You're not going to date me anyway.

368
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,740
Does it matter if I'm a bad guy?

369
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,470
Of course it does.

370
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,880
Bad guys are so attractive.

371
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,880
When it comes to being naughty,

372
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,250
I deserve this too.

373
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,589
Who knows?

374
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,690
If you're just as bad as me,

375
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,490
I might take you, Gi Dae Ju,

376
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,990
seriously.

377
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,630
I have a wife,

378
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,599
but I got swayed by another person.
That's infidelity.

379
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,839
I'm going to quit.

380
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,539
I turned a blind eye to
an obvious danger. That's aiding.

381
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,009
Does it answer your question?

382
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,619
Well, that makes you...

383
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,619
deserve a handcuff too.

384
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,299
You can't unlock it?

385
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,329
Oh, my! What should we do?

386
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,769
Secretary Kim! Secretary Kim!
The key!

387
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,789
Did you do this on purpose too?

388
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:47,789
It was a mistake.

389
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,430
As soon as I see the prop team,
I will fire all of them.

390
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,059
Who told them to make
such well-crafted handcuffs?

391
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,670
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

392
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,869
I'm hungry too.

393
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,210
I want to go to the restroom too.

394
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,309
Ma'am.

395
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,480
Why don't you eat this at least?

396
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,880
The prop team is on their way now
from Namyangju,

397
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,380
but the traffic doesn't seem good.

398
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,720
Yes. Where are you?

399
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,450
No, that's not where I meant.

400
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,160
You said you were hungry.

401
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,400
I'm the president of Cinepark,

402
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,730
Veronica Park.

403
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,470
The Korean movie industry is
in the palm of my hands.

404
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:38,539
I can't eat such food in a jail!

405
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Then I will eat some.

406
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:16,609
Here you go.

407
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
It's delicious.

408
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,900
I want that too.

409
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:41,039
The stuffed cucumbers.

410
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,250
Why are you smiling?

411
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,119
I'm sorry if I offended you.

412
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,450
Sometimes, you're like a baby.

413
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:57,619
A baby?

414
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,660
Baby, as in, baby?

415
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
Yes.

416
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:05,599
It looks like the National Institute
of Korean Language...

417
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,000
has changed the definition
of the word, "baby".

418
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:11,200
A demon, the ultimate evil,

419
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,900
the weirdo, or crazy witch.

420
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,440
Those are the words people use
when they call me.

421
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,579
Babies are evil.

422
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
But...

423
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,849
they cry not because they're bad.

424
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:25,180
They cry
because they don't feel well.

425
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,720
They don't put on a fake smile.
They smile when they're happy.

426
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,519
So I find babies lovely.

427
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,769
If you really need to go to
the restroom, I can come with you.

428
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,839
- What?
- I'll be standing at the door.

429
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,769
You just need to stretch
your arm a bit...

430
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,009
while you take care of the business.

431
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,039
- It's not totally impossible...
- Hey!

432
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,910
I...

433
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:00,920
I'm the president of Cinepark,
Veronica Park!

434
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:09,289
Hey.

435
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,829
It would be nice...

436
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,500
if you could at least
close your ears.

437
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,940
As you probably know, I can't...

438
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,940
close my ears...
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

439
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,809
I can't close my ears
when my arms are stretched.

440
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:27,480
And I can't stretch my arm
when I'm closing my ears.

441
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,750
So this is
what they call humiliation.

442
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,160
Fine.

443
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,500
Even if I, Veronica Park,

444
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,099
end up wetting myself,

445
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,470
I will try to hold it in
until I can't.

446
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:58,339
Until the East Sea's water runs dry

447
00:33:58,339 --> 00:33:59,710
What are you doing?

448
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:03,450
I will sing as loud as possible
so I can't hear anything.

449
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:06,319
Now, I want you to focus
on your business in there.

450
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,989
I'll focus on
my patriotism out here.

451
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,320
Until the East Sea's water runs dry

452
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,329
And until Mt. Baekdu is worn away

453
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,570
May the deities protect

454
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:27,199
And preserve our country

455
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,039
So...

456
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,780
Are you...

457
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,650
sleeping alone tonight?

458
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,320
Yes, I guess.

459
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,989
Aren't you scared?

460
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,860
You have to sleep alone
in a house where a thief broke in.

461
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,559
I have been through
even more scary things.

462
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,300
Do you...

463
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,030
want me to stay with you?

464
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:00,570
What?

465
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,409
No, thanks.

466
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,110
You didn't get much sleep last
night, so you should go home.

467
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,050
Right.

468
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,719
I'm your boss, so I guess it's
a bit weird if I sleepover.

469
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,320
You'll probably feel uncomfortable.

470
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:23,630
Thank you for the food.

471
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,389
I'll get going.

472
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,269
He's really leaving.

473
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,079
I wish he'd ask one more time.

474
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,710
Are you sure you don't need me?

475
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,420
Don't you come here.
I will kill you.

476
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,889
I have never been treated so well
in my whole life.

477
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,760
Well, it's just that
I'm a bit scared...

478
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,289
to sleep alone. So...

479
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,230
Hey, your sister is a woman...

480
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,059
too.

481
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,929
I have to go.

482
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,090
Sir! Oh, my gosh.

483
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,920
I'm sorry.

484
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,329
Why are you here?

485
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:36,670
It's been more than two hours
since you left.

486
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,340
By any chance, were you trying
to protect me like a guard dog...

487
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,010
because you got worried
that I might get scared alone?

488
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,639
"Like a dog"? You called me a dog?

489
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,510
No, that's not what I meant.

490
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,420
Yes, it's been a while since I came
to a small town like this.

491
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,420
The air was fresh, and
the night sky was filled with stars.

492
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,219
So I was just taking my dog-walk.
You human being, can go back home.

493
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,719
And don't mind me, the dog!

494
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,659
Well...

495
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:09,969
Then are you going to continue
to stay here?

496
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:15,469
Would...

497
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,079
Would you like to go inside?

498
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,420
I'm not sure if you'll be able
to sleep here.

499
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,659
Wouldn't you be better off
sleeping in my brother's room?

500
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:35,630
In order to guard the house
like a guard dog,

501
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,860
I should sleep in the living room.

502
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,500
I can't sleep inside.

503
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,269
Don't mind me.
You should go inside and sleep.

504
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,170
- Hey, Director Do.
- Yes?

505
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,500
Can I ask you something?

506
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,780
What?

507
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,550
Director Gi is...

508
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,320
your best friend, isn't he?

509
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,920
But why are you hiding your illness
from him?

510
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,760
I'm not hiding it.

511
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:08,719
Even you, my secretary,

512
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,960
keeps wanting to quit
because it's so hard to work for me.

513
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,300
He's the only friend I have.

514
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,559
How bothered would he be
if he finds out that I'm ill?

515
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,800
Dae Ju is so foolishly nice.

516
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,139
Ever since we were seven,
he'd carry me to the hospital...

517
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:23,039
even in the middle of a test
if he heard that I'm sick.

518
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,110
If I tell a guy like him
about my illness,

519
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,780
it'll only end up burdening him.
It's not that I want to hide it.

520
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,050
What?

521
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,730
It's nothing.

522
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:47,429
Anyway, I don't think you should
tell anyone about your illness...

523
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,269
until the final election
of the next company president.

524
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,099
You can't afford to make
any mistakes,

525
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:56,409
so always take me with you
wherever you go.

526
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,210
Does that mean...

527
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,110
you're not going to quit?

528
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:05,250
Sleep tight.

529
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:09,019
Don't go.

530
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,659
Secretary Jeong.

531
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,829
What should I do?

532
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,699
Right now...

533
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,969
Ever since a while ago...

534
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:28,900
No.

535
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:31,769
Throughout the entire day,

536
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,909
I kept wanting to call that woman.

537
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,380
Are you not over her yet?

538
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,079
I want to call her right now...

539
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,260
and tell her...

540
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,429
that I miss her,

541
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,059
that I want to meet her,
and that I want to hug her.

542
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,500
But I already promised her...

543
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,539
that I'll forget about her...

544
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,940
after today.

545
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:16,150
So...

546
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,590
can you please hold my hand...

547
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,130
so that I can pass the night...

548
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,670
without doing anything stupid?

549
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,340
Can you hold my hand as well?

550
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,949
Why do you need me to do that?

551
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:48,250
Because I also felt the same way.

552
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,159
I wondered all day...

553
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,860
if he'd eaten...

554
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:01,429
and whether I might've
hurt him or not.

555
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,440
I was worried about him all day.

556
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,539
I wanted to be next to him.

557
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,980
But...

558
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,480
I decided to forget about him,
so I should.

559
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,880
Let's both try to forget.

560
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,489
Hold on tight.

561
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,829
Don't even think about
calling that guy...

562
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,269
who did nothing but sleep all day.

563
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,300
By the way,

564
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,710
aren't you going to help me
fall asleep as well?

565
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
What?

566
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:55,050
You didn't have a problem
singing a lullaby for that guy.

567
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:58,550
Are you serious?

568
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,159
I just...

569
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:04,090
want to fall asleep...

570
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,300
without thinking about anything.

571
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,800
Please put me to bed.

572
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:23,980
Then lie down over here.

573
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:46,369
This is what my mom
used to sing to me.

574
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:50,239
I'm not sure if I'll be able
to remember it very well.

575
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,550
Goodnight, my baby

576
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:04,920
My cute baby

577
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:09,829
Beautiful roses

578
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:14,530
Have bloomed around you

579
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,269
Goodnight, my baby

580
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,170
Rest throughout the night

581
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,440
And when the morning comes

582
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,889
- Secretary Jeong?
- Director Do?

583
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,699
It's 9am!

584
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,239
- Let go of my hand.
- Hand? Gosh!

585
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,610
Gosh, let's be calm.

586
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,510
- Secretary Jeong.
- I'm sorry,

587
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,909
but can you please come to my house?

588
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,539
My goodness.

589
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,150
- My pants! Where are my pants?
- I don't know!

590
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,480
- Director Do!
- Where are they?

591
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,679
My pants.

592
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,920
Oh, okay. Where are my socks?

593
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,019
- Your socks?
- Gosh, my socks!

594
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,219
Your socks are over here.

595
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,059
Secretary Jeong,
where are the towels?

596
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,570
They're in the cabinet.

597
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:40,380
Why does she have this?

598
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:47,789
Director Do, can you come outside?

599
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,260
Oh, okay.

600
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:54,130
Secretary Jeong.

601
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,530
What?

602
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,769
Look at this.

603
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,960
Should I drive you to the office?

604
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,960
No, let's go to Yeongdeungpo
Police Station.

605
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,159
The police station?

606
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,599
- You brought it, right?
- Yes.

607
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:34,940
Will this be okay?

608
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:43,809
- Sir.
- Hey.

609
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,550
I looked into it, and it's not
an ordinary box cutter.

610
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:49,690
Then what is it?

611
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:52,219
It's an auto escape tool.

612
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,920
- An auto escape tool?
- Yes. Look at this.

613
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,889
This part right here is used
to cut the seat belt.

614
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:58,860
And this on the other side
is used as a hammer.

615
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,730
It's used to shatter the car window
during emergency situations.

616
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,500
Is this the box cutter you saw
on the day of your accident?

617
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:06,900
Yes, I'm sure of it.

618
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,369
Ordinary people normally wouldn't
carry this around.

619
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,739
Drivers and repairmen might
carry these around,

620
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,179
but others would rarely find this
useful enough to carry around.

621
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,650
Come to think of it, I also saw
that somewhere else.

622
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:25,590
The new driver had it with him.

623
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:31,329
Back then, I thought it was just
an ordinary box cutter.

624
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:32,829
No way.

625
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,059
Why? Do you think he's the culprit?

626
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,139
You said you remember
the culprit's face.

627
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:45,110
Let's think. The suspect revealed
his face to the victim.

628
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,639
And he's back as your driver?

629
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,179
How cheeky is he?

630
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,280
I want to hire him.

631
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,780
We will figure it out once we
have the fingerprints identified.

632
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,820
- Here.
- Okay.

633
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,090
Are there any important documents
in your laptop?

634
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:06,429
Like customers' personal information
or company confidential.

635
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,329
I don't have such things.

636
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,269
All I have is Director Do's schedule
and work materials.

637
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,539
Oh, right. There was
one strange file though.

638
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,409
- What is it?
- It was...

639
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:21,739
On the day of the incident,

640
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:25,409
you picked up a USB stick
from Director Gi Dae Ju's office.

641
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,820
Gi Dae Ju? There you go.

642
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,920
Oh boy. I thought he was
as slippery as an eel.

643
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,659
- And this is it.
- I told you he was strange.

644
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,219
What about Dae Ju?

645
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,659
All his alibis on that day
were incongruous,

646
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:39,960
so he came to receive
investigation again.

647
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,969
What's the file
you're talking about?

648
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,800
I have a copy of it.
I'll find it and get it to you.

649
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:51,940
It's not here.

650
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:55,409
- It's not there?
- This is strange.

651
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,079
I'm sure I put it in here.

652
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:03,820
Didn't you say
something was written in the file?

653
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,460
"Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just."

654
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:10,989
"Humans is unfair..."

655
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,960
(Humans is unfair...)

656
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,969
(Humans are unfair,
but the deities are just.)

657
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:21,340
"Humans are unfair,
but the deities are just."

658
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:23,840
"It's Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's
famous quote..."

659
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,769
"that means justice will
prevail in the end."

660
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,139
"We should never forget..."

661
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,409
"that those who do injustice
will eventually..."

662
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,150
"be brought to justice"?

663
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,050
What do you think it means?

664
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,789
I should've taken my laptop
to repair immediately.

665
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,760
(It's Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's
famous quote...)

666
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:44,429
File? What file?

667
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:49,000
"Humans are unfair,
but the deities are just."

668
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:53,199
Hey, the deities are
not just at all.

669
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:58,369
I've got my good looks
and high intelligence all together.

670
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:05,079
Why are you staring
at me so sharply?

671
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:08,380
I've never seen
or created such a file.

672
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:14,389
Then why was that USB
in your office?

673
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,690
I don't know.

674
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,230
Is the file important?

675
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:29,869
I can't see his face,
but I have to believe him.

676
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,440
If I don't,

677
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,750
no one in this world
would believe him.

678
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,389
Stop drinking.

679
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,119
You might make
a drunk mistake again.

680
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:51,460
When did I make a drunk mistake?

681
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,260
By the way,

682
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:56,800
about the woman you like.

683
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,139
Are you still seeing her?

684
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:04,570
I don't think...

685
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:09,480
it will end in the past perfect.

686
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:13,820
We can't do this then.

687
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,750
I guess I should set
Secretary Jeong with someone.

688
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,090
- No.
- Why not?

689
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:20,719
No. I just don't like it.

690
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:23,230
Why can't she date anyone
when you're seeing someone?

691
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:30,130
She has a crush on someone...

692
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,800
and she can't even sleep at night.

693
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,539
And who do you think he is?

694
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,940
Use your brain.

695
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:41,780
There's a guy. He's a scumbag.

696
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:45,710
By the way,

697
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:49,949
did you decide not to quit...

698
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,820
because of me?

699
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,159
I'm preparing a gift for you.

700
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:02,559
Once it's ready, I'll
make a beautiful exit.

701
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,869
All you need to do
is get a handkerchief.

702
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,750
Director Park?

703
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,280
I just took my only suit
to the cleaners.

704
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:26,619
You go first. I'll pick up
my suit and be there.

705
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,130
What do you...

706
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,860
think of my face?

707
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:46,340
My mother told me I should
try to be honest all the time.

708
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:49,110
Okay. Be honest.

709
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,920
Your eyes are filled with desire.

710
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,789
Your cheeks are full of greed.

711
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:01,489
And your lips look so wicked...

712
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:03,360
that I want to slap you on the...

713
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,329
I'm sorry.

714
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,030
I'm supposed to
be in good terms with you,

715
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,130
so I tried putting it
somewhat nicely.

716
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:16,400
I agree.

717
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:19,510
But the thing is...

718
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,679
Even so, he called me...

719
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:25,679
a baby.

720
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:30,489
There's a guy who says
I'm like a baby.

721
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:33,090
Can I trust him?

722
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,260
Try to believe in a cult instead.

723
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,860
Did you call me
just to ask a question like that?

724
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,929
Baby's phone ringing.

725
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:43,000
Is it phone number one?

726
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:46,030
It's phone number 10.

727
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,170
Director Park Hyun Chul
lost his mother?

728
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,809
Wait.

729
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:57,809
Director Park?

730
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,820
It means all the employees
of the company will come.

731
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:05,590
And it also means
my baby is coming too.

732
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:09,619
I should go to
the department store first.

733
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,230
Why?

734
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,159
To buy...

735
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,199
the world's sexiest mourning dress.

736
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,010
Why? Do you think he's the culprit?

737
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,320
Director Do, what about your suit?

738
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:39,420
Secretary Jeong will bring it.

739
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:43,429
- 100 dollars.
- 200 dollars.

740
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,429
300 dollars.

741
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,960
Well done today.

742
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,900
- Well done.
- Well done.

743
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,030
That's a lot.

744
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,539
It's a lie that
the company has no money.

745
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,940
I know.

746
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:00,210
Even the condolence money
from directors is that huge.

747
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:03,980
By the way, how come there's
no notice these days?

748
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,980
It's been a while since
we got together last time.

749
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,119
I've been busy.

750
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:14,820
There will be a notice soon.
Wait a little more, guys.

751
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:17,760
- Shall we go now?
- Wait, Ms. Lee.

752
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,530
Gal Hee will be there too.

753
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,300
Aren't you going to tell her?

754
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,599
Right.

755
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,599
She should know
what we're up to now.

756
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:36,579
Chief Director Sim, I'm here.

757
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,849
You're not here yet? Where are you?

758
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,119
You're here already?
I'm coming in now.

759
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,099
Stay calm.

760
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:02,039
Secretary Jeong will be here soon.

761
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:06,469
Director Do.

762
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,679
It's me, Secretary Jeong.

763
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:14,980
Change your clothes first.

764
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,329
What? Something's wrong?

765
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,000
Something's stuck inside.

766
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,599
Why is it you again?

767
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:12,239
What?

768
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,739
What's wrong with my blood pressure?

769
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,119
I can see.

770
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,059
When I'm with Secretary Jeong,

771
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,099
I can see faces again.

772
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,300
Sir, are you having
the blood pressure problem again?

773
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,809
Dr. Gu said my blood pressure
would rapidly go up...

774
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:49,809
when I'm nervous or excited.

775
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:52,980
That's why when I exercise hard
or drink alcohol,

776
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:54,949
or...

777
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,489
Or what?

778
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:02,420
When he saw a woman he loved,
he could clearly see her face.

779
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:04,289
Or...

780
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,429
Or...

781
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:10,000
But when I was with her,
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

782
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,800
Why does my blood pressure go up
only when I'm with you?

783
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,269
At the door.

784
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,269
It's President Sim Hae Yong.

785
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:32,019
What's up?

786
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:39,159
My poor uncle.

787
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,630
Look at your dark circles,

788
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,000
your rough skin,

789
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,599
and all those rashes
next to your nose.

790
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:50,639
Did you not go to the restroom?

791
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:53,539
You're good.

792
00:58:09,389 --> 00:58:11,090
- Yes, Ha Ni.
- Jung Su.

793
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,559
I think you should be
hiding for now.

794
00:58:14,059 --> 00:58:15,099
What?

795
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,170
It's here.

796
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,760
Secretary Jeong,
could you wait here for a second?

797
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:49,630
Sir, where are you...

798
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:11,420
Hey.

799
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:15,360
Mr. Do Min Ik?

800
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,260
Who are you?

801
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:21,360
Nice to meet you.
I'm Veronica Park.

802
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,119
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

803
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:46,519
It was definitely him.

804
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:47,989
I think I should disappear
from the company.

805
00:59:47,989 --> 00:59:50,090
- You...
- I just met a woman.

806
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,860
Nice to meet you.
I'm Veronica Park.

807
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,630
Does your boss have problem
seeing people's faces?

808
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,630
The girl you like is Veronica Park?

809
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,369
I want to be with you.

810
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:02,670
From now on, you're going to be
the real Veronica.
