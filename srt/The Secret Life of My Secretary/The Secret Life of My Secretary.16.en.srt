1
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,189
- Does it taste good?
- Yes.

2
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,159
I think this is much more tastier...

3
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,659
than amuse-bouche.

4
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,159
My tongue is melting,
and my throat is excited.

5
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,929
My stomach is happy.

6
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,770
Then have some more.

7
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,370
By the way, how did you convince
President Sim?

8
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:11,480
We starved for days,
but he never even budged.

9
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,680
Let's finish this first.

10
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:22,349
You're eating porridge.

11
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,219
Hello, sir.

12
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,060
I talked to Eul Wang
over the phone.

13
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,760
And I just met Dae Ju.

14
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,670
And I filed your resignation
like you asked me to.

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,170
Thanks, Uncle Hae Yong.

16
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,799
I should be the one thanking you.

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,569
Everything will be easy
from now on...

18
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,939
now that you've decided to give up
on becoming the president.

19
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,290
What's that supposed to mean?

20
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,290
You gave up
on becoming the president?

21
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:08,500
That crazy punk.

22
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:12,039
You gave up...

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,610
on becoming the president
just so you could feed me?

24
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,710
Let's talk after you finish
eating this.

25
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,680
No, I don't want to eat!

26
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,319
Who says you could give up
on becoming the president?

27
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,949
Who says you could yield
that position to him?

28
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,919
You can be angry at me.

29
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,759
But have another bite first.

30
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,810
Sir.

31
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Director Do isn't going to give up
on becoming the president,

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,680
so please forget about it.

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,050
- Stop it.
- No.

34
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,759
I don't care if I faint or die.

35
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,789
I'll go on a hunger strike again,
so forget about what he said.

36
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:07,930
Secretary Jeong.

37
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,400
What's with the sudden romance
in this dreary office?

38
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,199
But I'm sorry to say...

39
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,430
I prefer genres with a big twist
that include...

40
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,039
betrayal and conspiracies.

41
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,509
It's like I had indigestion
for 30 years because of you,

42
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:26,909
but it's all finally...

43
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,680
Going down.

44
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,849
Why did you do that?

45
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,590
Who told you to do this?

46
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,090
I wouldn't have been able
to come this far...

47
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,060
if it weren't for you anyway.

48
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,530
What kind of a boss are you?

49
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,199
You should be using your secretary
to become the president.

50
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,199
What kind of a boss...

51
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,909
gives up on becoming the president
because of his secretary?

52
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,810
I didn't give up
because of my secretary.

53
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,050
I gave up because of you.

54
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,819
Being loved is no fun.

55
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,819
Being loved isn't any good.
It's only making me feel upset.

56
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,789
President Sim is the one who made
Mr. Eun turn out that way...

57
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,160
and forced the secretaries
to sign illegal contracts.

58
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:20,160
How could you let a guy like him
become the president?

59
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,209
Do you really think
I wouldn't have thought that far?

60
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,949
President Sim, did you hear?

61
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:41,319
I was at the meeting room earlier...

62
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,290
My goodness, thank you
for congratulating me beforehand.

63
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,420
You must've heard that Min Ik
decided not to run for president.

64
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,930
Well, yes. I know about that.

65
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,500
But a new candidate applied
just before the deadline.

66
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:53,629
What do you mean?

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,920
(TnT Mobile President)

68
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,389
You want me to apply
for the presidency?

69
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,290
You should do it.

70
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,129
What? I already handed in
my resignation letter.

71
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,699
And my name is
on the disciplinary committee list.

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,170
You wouldn't have resigned
if it weren't for me.

73
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,230
And I'll do whatever I can...

74
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,370
to prevent you
from getting disciplined.

75
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,639
Here. It's the exclusive contract
you gave me.

76
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,310
I haven't used this yet. So...

77
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,009
- Min Ik.
- Dae Ju.

78
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,819
All you need is six votes.

79
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,990
You've already secured two votes
which is ours.

80
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,860
If Do Min Ik gets five votes,
it's a tie with Sim Hae Yong.

81
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,529
Then there will be a revote at
the board meeting two weeks later.

82
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:59,600
- My mom won't vote for you.
- Am I right?

83
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,470
But she won't vote
for Uncle Hae Yong either.

84
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:03,199
So she'll withdraw.

85
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,310
Those who want Director Do
to be the president-elect,

86
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:08,910
please raise your hand.

87
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,410
Director Kim and Director Yang...

88
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,879
won't ever vote for my uncle.

89
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,120
They've been supporting my dad
ever since he was alive.

90
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,189
I'll abstain from voting.

91
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,350
Director Choi.

92
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,519
Director Choi only withdrew
because of my illness.

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,389
There was never a time
when he didn't vote for me.

94
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,329
So he'll come around if I tell him
that I'll be supporting you.

95
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:31,660
That's already five votes.

96
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,459
Now, the variables are...

97
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,399
Director Kwak and Director Woo
who are always very fickle.

98
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,600
But they're always for whatever
that makes them money.

99
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,610
So I'm sure at least one of them...

100
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,740
will get swayed by this contract.

101
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,439
Why are you...

102
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,449
trying so hard to make me
become the president?

103
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,649
I'm doing this to repay
for your mother's death.

104
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:55,420
That's a plausible reason.

105
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,319
And I kind of think you might do
a better job than me.

106
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,759
That's my hidden intention.

107
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,430
President Sim.

108
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,769
You haven't gotten rid of him yet?

109
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,639
That punk is unbelievable.

110
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,050
My gosh, are you guys on your way
to have rice soup again?

111
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
We just had brunch...

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,449
with Director Kwak.

113
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,250
- Didn't we?
- Yes.

114
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,689
He seemed very interested...

115
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,490
in what we had.

116
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,060
We're planning to meet
Director Woo tomorrow, aren't we?

117
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,300
Yes, that's right.

118
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,240
I hope you're all nice
to Director Gi.

119
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,540
I'll see you at the board meeting.

120
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:50,310
Today's really hot outside.
You guys should have cold noodles...

121
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,540
instead of rice soup.

122
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,149
I hope you guys enjoy your meals.

123
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,819
My gosh, darn it.

124
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,310
Hey.

125
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,579
What's with that attitude?

126
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,279
I don't know.

127
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,779
Maybe I'm upset that someone else
is going to become the president.

128
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,559
Dae Ju will do a good job.

129
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,129
The secretaries are right.

130
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,960
Other people can be the president
other than the owner's family.

131
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,899
Unlike other company owners,
Dae Ju never started at the top.

132
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,070
He got to where he is now
by working hard from the bottom.

133
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:55,370
So he'll understand the employees
better than anyone.

134
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,740
Right?

135
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,779
But still...

136
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,779
It would've been nice if you had
discussed it with me beforehand.

137
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,720
Did you see that?

138
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,529
Hey.

139
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,500
When did it come back?

140
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,200
It was really cool.

141
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,529
It actually got better
once I kept stroking it.

142
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,539
To be honest,

143
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,110
I'm also a little upset
about the entire situation.

144
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,080
So how about you stroke me?

145
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,850
Then I think I'll be able to feel
a whole lot better.

146
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,279
That's weird.

147
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,750
I'm getting better.

148
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,450
I'm all better.

149
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,429
How do I look?

150
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:31,970
Are you serious?

151
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,639
You should be asking your boyfriend,
not me.

152
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,269
I'm showing it to you first...

153
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,710
before I show my boyfriend.

154
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,610
I don't want him to find out...

155
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:45,480
that I'm even thinking about...

156
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,250
marrying him.

157
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:50,190
But I think...

158
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,820
it's a bit too sexy.
Don't you agree?

159
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:57,029
Do you think it'll be better
to look modest and innocent...

160
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:59,429
when I'm standing next to Dae Ju?

161
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,399
My sister would look
so pretty in this.

162
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,970
Can I take one?

163
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,509
- Is your sister getting married?
- I guess she will.

164
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:11,809
With Director Do Min Ik?

165
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,879
He recently went on a trip with my
family, and we slept together there.

166
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,980
What's so great about her
that she always goes ahead of me?

167
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,720
I'll take this one.

168
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,820
Hey, do you even know
how much it is?

169
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,330
It's the only Vera Wang's dress
in this country.

170
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,629
Then you can buy one more
in another country.

171
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,159
Can't you afford to do that?

172
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,870
Of course I can.

173
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,470
Don't you dare underestimate me,
Veronica Park.

174
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Here. Take them.

175
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:46,580
There are only one pair of them
in this country.

176
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,279
I can buy some more
in another country.

177
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,419
You gave up getting married
and becoming the president.

178
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,919
How long do I have to
put up with you?

179
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,590
It's not that
I won't become the president.

180
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,000
Having been through
the issues about the secretaries,

181
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,299
I realized that I was so ignorant
of corporate management.

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,840
When I feel that
I'm fully qualified,

183
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,110
I'll try it again.

184
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:17,309
That's not how you play house.

185
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,440
It's just over if one of you quits.

186
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,450
You don't get it?
I'm telling you to move out.

187
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,320
Can I...

188
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,690
stay here?

189
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,090
What?

190
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,929
If you don't like it,
I won't have a choice.

191
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,330
But I want to pester you
for the last time.

192
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,440
I've never done it
for the past 27 years.

193
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,210
I just wish you'd listen for once.

194
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,379
I...

195
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,879
want to stay here.

196
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,950
If you're okay with it.

197
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,169
How does she look? Is she pretty?

198
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,809
How pretty is she?

199
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,240
Maybe that's because
I was on hunger strike.

200
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,779
I guess I lost some weight.

201
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,480
I don't think I look so bad.

202
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,049
Are you sure this is
one of the props for a film?

203
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:36,320
It looks quite expensive.

204
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,759
Actually, I got it
from Veronica Park's office.

205
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,460
- Hey!
- Gosh, I'm startled.

206
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:42,830
What?

207
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,129
Take it off immediately. Now.

208
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,730
Gosh.

209
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,899
Secretary Jeong?

210
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,610
My gosh.

211
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,340
Secretary Jeong, is it you?

212
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,049
I told you to lock up the door.

213
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:10,450
Well... The thing is...

214
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,720
Hello, my brother-in-law.

215
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,460
Who's your brother-in-law?

216
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,899
If someone who buys me beef
isn't my brother-in-law,

217
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,529
who in this world would be?

218
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,570
By the way,

219
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,039
what are you doing here?

220
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,269
Well...

221
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,610
I guess my mom wants
to be alone tonight.

222
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,710
So I got out.

223
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,809
You can sleep over.

224
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,919
I'll go get changed then.

225
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,179
Don't take it off yet.

226
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,720
Please take a picture of us.

227
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,120
We can do that later.

228
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,309
Please make sure our mom,
dad, and the family motto...

229
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,580
will be in the photo.

230
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,649
Okay.

231
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,990
1, 2, and 3.

232
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,129
I'll go get changed then.

233
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,500
Wait.

234
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,629
Well...

235
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,909
Please take a picture of us.

236
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,539
Okay.

237
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,929
All right. Here we go.

238
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:01,200
1, 2, and 3.

239
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,139
One more time.

240
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:10,240
1, 2, and 3.

241
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,179
Secretary Jeong.

242
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,950
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

243
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,759
This dress.

244
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,159
Did you get it
hoping to get married with me?

245
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,700
No, Director Do. It's not like that.

246
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:34,159
Nam Hee...

247
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,200
What? Does that mean
you don't want to marry me?

248
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,799
No, that's not what I meant.

249
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,440
Then it means you want to marry me.

250
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:45,480
Well... That's not it though.

251
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,850
I want to be alone tonight.
Will you get out of my room?

252
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,019
Hey, don't be like that.

253
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,759
Just tell me.

254
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,960
I can't. I'm asleep.

255
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:16,039
Goodnight.

256
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,730
Director Do.

257
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,029
Do you mind...

258
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,799
if Gal Hee walks down the aisle
on my arm?

259
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,970
Pardon?

260
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,569
She grew up without parents,

261
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:51,069
but I want her
to get married feeling happy.

262
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:01,049
Of course I don't mind.

263
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,319
But...

264
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,930
I'm not sure if I deserve to
want something like that.

265
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,900
What do you mean?

266
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:18,640
Even though you are blind,

267
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,039
you always looks confident.

268
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,970
I always wondered...

269
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,910
how you could live like that.

270
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,109
Before my mom passed away,
she told me two things.

271
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,319
One moment of patience...
00:18:10.01

272
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,359
Don't neglect what you have...

273
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,089
hanging up on...

274
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,529
what you already lost.

275
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,509
Mother.

276
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,579
(One month later)

277
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:06,279
We should go somewhere.
You should hurry.

278
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,289
My goodness.

279
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,160
Where on earth are we going?

280
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,359
Are we going to
an amusement park or what?

281
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,230
Gosh.

282
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,329
We're going to someplace
more thrilling.

283
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,569
What is going on?

284
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,440
Hello. I'm the 15th president,

285
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,710
Gi Dae Ju.

286
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,950
(The 15th Presidential Inauguration
TnT Mobile)

287
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,799
With the consistent growth
in IPTV subscribers,

288
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,839
I promise we will develop
our own contents...

289
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,809
and see an increase
in the value of our stocks...

290
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,009
through collaboration with internal
and external production companies.

291
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,420
And according to the revised
integrated broadcasting act,

292
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,549
we will develop
contents competitiveness...

293
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:16,089
and become one of the biggest
contents mobile company.

294
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,190
Director Park.

295
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,319
Are you interested in going to Cuba?

296
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,390
Cuba?

297
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,559
We can get in
an old car in Havana...

298
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,359
and drive by the Malecon Beach.

299
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:30,230
And we will get ourselves
some nice mojitos.

300
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:32,140
Mojitos?

301
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,670
Actually I'm feeling
unwell these days.

302
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,740
Maybe we should go there
and learn how to dance salsa.

303
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,710
People before performance.
Love before competition.

304
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,380
With the new slogan of TnT Mobile,

305
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,950
we will make a company
where everyone wants to work for.

306
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,250
Thank you.

307
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,160
Please give President Gi Dae Ju
a round of applause.

308
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,660
This is it for the 15th presidential
inauguration of TnT Mobile.

309
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:05,200
- What do I do?
- What?

310
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,069
I was going to turn the company
over to you in three years.

311
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:09,970
But while standing on the stage,

312
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:12,880
I learned how sweet power is.

313
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,109
Shut it.

314
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,779
After three years, no matter
what happens, I will take you down.

315
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:19,019
You'd better polish the path
until then.

316
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:20,980
So when I finally become
the president,

317
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,319
I can walk on a nice path.

318
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:36,970
President Gi Dae Ju.

319
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,579
Look, Mother.

320
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,809
That man is my man.

321
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,089
He doesn't look that bad
with a suit on.

322
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,589
So are you accepting him?

323
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:01,319
He's just a figurehead that
will serve for only three years.

324
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:05,529
Hello, Ma'am.

325
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,069
Listen to me.

326
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,670
A boss must marry a boss
to make another boss.

327
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,069
Don't spoil the boss' blood
with other lame blood.

328
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:26,880
What do we do?

329
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,089
It seems like it's not going to be
easy to convince her.

330
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:33,359
I have a good idea.

331
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,430
We...

332
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:37,690
should get old.

333
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,430
Get old?

334
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,230
Do you know what rich families
are the most scared of?

335
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:46,599
Having no descendant.

336
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:51,140
If we just hang in there
until the last moment,

337
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,380
there will be nothing
my mother can do.

338
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,910
Then your background won't matter.

339
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,880
She will just want me
to marry anyone.

340
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,119
That doesn't sound like a bad idea.

341
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,759
- President Gi.
- Yes.

342
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,029
This is from Ms. Lee Eul Wang.

343
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:11,230
Lee Eul Wang?

344
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,069
Who is that woman?

345
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,039
Thank you for letting me
keep the promise I made...

346
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,880
with your mom, Dae Ju.

347
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,079
And please make this place
a good company, President Gi.

348
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,859
You didn't have to come
all the way here.

349
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,390
I felt bad that I was staying
in comfort while you're not.

350
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Eun.

351
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,430
I heard from other drivers that...

352
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,799
you also...

353
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,710
had a hard time.

354
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,710
How are you?

355
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:05,279
I'm just thinking about
a lot of things these days.

356
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,119
I'm thinking of establishing
a story fund.

357
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,690
I would like to bring
workers like you...

358
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,900
whose lives are at risk and don't
get any compensations to public...

359
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:22,269
and receive donations and help them.

360
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,599
I wanted to send some money
to your commissary account,

361
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,539
but it was full already.

362
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,569
Well...

363
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:35,380
I think Director Do sent me
some money.

364
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:42,190
If you ever get to see him,
please pass this on to him.

365
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,960
If he doesn't mind,

366
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,029
I would like to see him
on the day I'm released...

367
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,460
and thank him.

368
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,670
So this is the sushi.

369
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,579
The sushi at reasonable price.

370
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,049
I bought it to celebrate that I have
become the president. Enjoy.

371
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,509
Thank you.

372
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,819
Why are you doing that?

373
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:17,650
You should kick that habit.

374
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,759
The bad habit that you always put
others before you.

375
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,230
And who gave me the habit?

376
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,190
Give it to me. Let me do it.

377
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,559
Why are you doing that?

378
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,329
Give it to me. I'll do it.

379
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,500
What in the world?

380
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,369
Why are you making my President Gi
do such chores?

381
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Give it to me.

382
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:37,140
I'll do it.

383
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:47,319
And for my President Gi,

384
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,690
I prepared this.

385
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:51,720
Surprise.

386
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,960
Awesome.

387
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,430
Oh, right.

388
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,359
I kept a bottle of champagne
on the first floor. Secretary Kim...

389
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,539
Right. My secretary quit again.

390
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:06,799
I'll go.

391
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,710
Sit. Don't do anything.

392
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,869
I'll go.

393
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,640
Why would you run
such an errand?

394
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,579
Stay here. I'll go.

395
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,809
Stop!

396
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,079
President Gi,
I don't want you to waste...

397
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,920
your beautiful legs
on such an errand.

398
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,490
Save them for later.

399
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,029
Everybody, sit down.

400
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,000
I, Veronica Park,

401
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:35,500
will go myself.

402
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,599
Oh, no!

403
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,670
Secretary Jeong!

404
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,250
Are you sure you want to sew it up?

405
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,789
What else do I do?

406
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,589
Without this, you won't be able
to recognize me.

407
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,299
Let's just throw it away.

408
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,930
What do you mean by,
"throw it away"?

409
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,970
The weather is getting warm
these days.

410
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,200
You can't be wearing
that cardigan forever.

411
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,170
Let's just throw it away.

412
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,940
No!

413
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,690
How do I look?

414
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,460
Can you see my face?

415
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,039
What about this?

416
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:51,210
What should I do?

417
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,779
I tried them all,
but none of them work.

418
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:58,079
Secretary Jeong, calm down.

419
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,819
We'll put something on you...

420
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:01,890
that helps me recognize you for now.

421
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,190
Well...

422
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,220
Earrings. What about earrings?

423
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:11,390
The earrings you used to put on
when you were playing Veronica.

424
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:13,430
Oh, those.

425
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:15,569
I threw them away this morning.

426
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:18,130
You threw them away?

427
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,339
Whenever I see them,

428
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,670
I'm reminded of the time
I lied to you.

429
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,069
They were fake anyway.

430
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,039
They are not fake.

431
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,480
They looked real, right?
They were only five dollars.

432
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,920
They're not five dollars.

433
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,220
They are five dollars.

434
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,519
They are not fake. They are real.

435
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,289
They are not 5 dollars.
They are 5,000 dollars.

436
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,730
What?

437
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,799
5,000?

438
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:00,509
You should have told me that
they were 5,000 dollars.

439
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,480
What kind of man
keeps a secret so well?

440
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,150
This is not ours.

441
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,289
This isn't either.

442
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,559
Why are you so diligent, cleaner?

443
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,859
I'll buy you a new one. Don't worry.

444
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,599
The new one will not be the same.

445
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:24,930
This means you already had feelings
for me when you got me the earrings.

446
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,940
But I had no idea.

447
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,069
Now the cardigan is ruined
and the earrings are thrown away.

448
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,440
What do we do now?

449
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,220
Number 245. Ms. Jeong Nam Hee.

450
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,730
- Yes.
- Come on in.

451
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,529
Gal Hee. I will get in this time...

452
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,839
and make you proud.

453
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:06,339
What should I do now?

454
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,579
You're the ones who ruined
the cardigan.

455
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:10,210
What do you want me to do?

456
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:13,549
Without the cardigan, how am I
supposed to recognize her?

457
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,990
Then make something else
a token of your relationship.

458
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,619
A token?

459
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,920
You wouldn't have recognized
her red cardigan as her...

460
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,730
from the beginning.

461
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,890
Watching her in the cardigan,

462
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,029
your brain imprinted
the image of her...

463
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:27,460
as a woman in the cardigan.

464
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,599
Make a new token that will imprint
her image in your brain.

465
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,000
You might not recognize her
at first,

466
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
but as time passes,
you will be able to recognize her.

467
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,509
That's it. I have a meeting.

468
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,710
What?

469
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:45,450
- My gosh, stop it.
- Come on. Wait.

470
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,450
Tell me what you were going to say
about Dr. Park's patient.

471
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:50,619
Was he able to see
people's faces again?

472
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,759
You were very doubtful
about medical technology that day.

473
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:57,430
What's wrong?
Are you suddenly curious...

474
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,460
now that your girlfriend
started eating again?

475
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:02,170
Well... Tell me what happened.
Was he able to see again?

476
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:05,869
Recently,

477
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,200
he succeeded in
seeing people's faces two times.

478
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,369
When was that?

479
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,579
The first time was
when he cooked steak.

480
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,180
What? What does that mean?

481
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,380
Does that mean I need to cook steak?

482
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:21,380
No, that's just how
blood pressure works.

483
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,650
You can't force it to go up,

484
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,390
and you can't practice anything
to be able to see again.

485
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,859
He couldn't see people's faces
even when he rode a rollercoaster...

486
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:29,829
or got into a car accident.

487
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:32,660
But he could suddenly see
when he was cooking steak.

488
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:35,900
- What?
- So who knows?

489
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,130
You might also...

490
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,599
get lucky like him one day.

491
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,039
And here's the next one.

492
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:49,210
I think this might work
with you as well.

493
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
What is it?

494
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,319
Think about it.

495
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,490
When a man and a woman are together,

496
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,589
what makes their blood pressure
suddenly go up...

497
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,559
and get extremely excited?

498
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,130
Excited?

499
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:13,539
Dr. Gu, you're talking at a hospital
in broad daylight.

500
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,640
Haven't you done it yet?

501
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,180
You haven't even had
a deep conversation...

502
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:22,150
with your girlfriend yet?

503
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,049
Deep?

504
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,180
Deep.

505
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,190
What are you talking about?

506
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,589
What are you telling me to do?

507
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:36,730
- Dr. Gu.
- What? Hey.

508
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,700
Whatever. I'm going to go.

509
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,400
My gosh, look at him leaving again.

510
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,200
What? What's wrong?

511
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,599
I was trying to tell him
that another patient succeeded in...

512
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,170
seeing people's faces again
when he proposed.

513
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,140
But forget it.

514
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,279
He'll come again when he needs me.
Let's go.

515
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,450
Okay.

516
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,930
Here's your coffee.

517
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:17,630
Haven't you done it yet?

518
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,970
Thanks.

519
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,680
Why are you looking at me like that?

520
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,710
What are you talking about?

521
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,980
I can't even see you.

522
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,019
That's so hot.

523
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,349
You should've been careful.
It's really hot.

524
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:55,940
Are you okay now?

525
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,740
Go away. Get away from me.

526
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:00,710
Why?

527
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,279
Didn't it work?

528
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,049
Then...

529
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,049
should I stroke your hair?

530
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,289
Gosh, don't do that. It's okay.

531
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,199
Don't blow air on me
or stroke my hair.

532
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,699
My gosh, why is the office so hot?

533
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:27,340
I turned on the AC.

534
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,610
Gosh, forget it.

535
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,110
Let's get off work now.
I'll take you home.

536
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,659
The food will be ready soon,
so wait a little bit.

537
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,460
I don't need to eat.

538
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,570
Can I have some water?

539
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:58,130
Why is my throat so dry?

540
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,769
Okay, I'll be right there.

541
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,019
I'm sorry.

542
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,019
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

543
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,860
It's all wet. Take off your pants.

544
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,039
- Take them off?
- Take off your pants.

545
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:37,469
Take them off. Take off your pants.

546
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,710
I'll quickly dry them for you.

547
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,659
You're the one...

548
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,460
who told me to take them off.

549
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,630
What?

550
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,139
I was...

551
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,480
trying hard to hold back.

552
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,849
But you're the one
who told me to take them off.

553
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,059
Director Do,
that's not what I meant.

554
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,519
I was really...

555
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,389
I was...

556
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,059
seriously...

557
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,929
trying hard to hold back.

558
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:14,039
What time is it?

559
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,309
Everyone!

560
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,050
- Gal Hee!
- Gal Hee!

561
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,260
What have you guys been up to?

562
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,659
What would a jobless woman do?

563
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:43,400
I stayed at home
and watched TV all day.

564
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,400
But we might no longer be jobless.

565
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,769
If we get hired, we'll get paid
for vacation and receive a bonus.

566
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,710
I heard we'll even get paid
for the traditional holidays.

567
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,079
On top of that, they'll be
giving priority to people...

568
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,679
who've worked at TnT Mobile before
as dispatched workers.

569
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,079
I almost cried...

570
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,250
on my way to the office today.

571
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,119
I'll be interviewing for a job
at a company I got fired from.

572
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,989
I hope the four of us
will all get hired.

573
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,659
Everyone.

574
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,360
Full-time employees.

575
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,900
Do you know who made this possible?

576
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,210
It's all thanks to my boss,
Director Do Min Ik.

577
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,840
Don't take his side
just because he's your boyfriend.

578
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,179
It's not thanks to your boss.
It's all thanks to President Gi.

579
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:33,349
My gosh, I really wasn't
going to brag about this.

580
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:35,820
- Number 248. Ms. Gu Myung Jung.
- Yes?

581
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,949
Please come inside.

582
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:41,389
I'll see you guys.

583
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,590
- Good luck.
- Let's do this.

584
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,360
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

585
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,449
I just finished my interview.

586
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,820
Did you do well?

587
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:18,030
You should've told President Gi
to use his old office.

588
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:20,460
Why did you give him
a whole new one?

589
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,500
Did you fail the interview?

590
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,269
Do you think your secretary is
that incompetent?

591
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,469
Then why are you so angry?

592
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,710
The secretaries think...

593
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,780
President Gi is the one who decided
to hire them as full-time employees.

594
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,179
Why does that even matter?

595
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:40,780
Here. Take this.

596
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,349
Don't throw things at me.

597
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,420
I'm very angry
at a lot of things right now.

598
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,090
This too.

599
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,559
I told you not to throw stuff.

600
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,130
And here's another one.

601
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,369
Stop throwing stuff at me!

602
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,139
What's this?

603
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:11,179
Open it.

604
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,360
Director Do.

605
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,110
Dr. Gu says we need
our own new token.

606
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,550
And I thought...

607
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,980
this would work.

608
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,949
Is it that you're...

609
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:54,559
proposing to me?

610
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,360
I want to...

611
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,269
be your coat of confidence.

612
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,679
Whatever you go through in life,

613
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,449
you won't get discouraged
having me around.

614
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,789
I'd like to put this
on your finger now,

615
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,860
but I'll give you time to think.

616
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,159
One day...

617
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,800
when I see this ring on your finger,

618
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,869
I'll take it...

619
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,840
as a yes.

620
00:41:57,789 --> 00:41:58,820
It's so pretty.

621
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,960
Do you like it?

622
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,889
Of course I do.

623
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,400
When are you going to put it on?

624
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:10,000
It's a secret.

625
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,070
I'm here to say goodbye.

626
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:21,480
What?

627
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:28,480
I will stop coming to see you.

628
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:32,349
Why?

629
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,360
Why?

630
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,800
Now you have someone...

631
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,329
to turn to instead of me.

632
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:50,639
So stop missing your dead mother
and live life with someone alive.

633
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,679
That's how people live.

634
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,050
Mom.

635
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,619
I'll leave at ease...

636
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,019
looking at your smiling face.

637
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,960
Live well and be happy.

638
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:14,900
Sweetheart.

639
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,650
The laundry room is in the basement.

640
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,619
I'd like to have breakfast
30 minutes earlier for now.

641
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:49,869
You said there are only
two family members.

642
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,769
Your brother who's in Cuba and...

643
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,150
He's my son.

644
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:13,719
What are you doing?
Say hello to her.

645
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,159
Hello. I'm Do Min Ik.

646
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,969
He's allergic to peanuts.

647
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,010
He'll be the president soon.
Be careful about what he eats.

648
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,440
Yes, ma'am.

649
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,340
You didn't see my study yet.

650
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,409
This way.

651
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:01,900
Is she wearing the ring?

652
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,570
I hope she is.

653
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,510
I'm sure she is.

654
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,320
Hello, Director Do.

655
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,219
I'll be leaving this office.

656
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,829
Why would you clean it up?

657
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:27,760
Right. I'm so upset
that you'll leave this office.

658
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,300
What am I doing now?

659
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,869
- It's not there.
- Pardon?

660
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,969
What? Nothing.

661
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,050
There's a hole in the glove.
My hand is all wet.

662
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,280
Director Do, I'll go wash my hands.

663
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,829
Why did she not take the glove off?

664
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,070
She's here.

665
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,550
What are you doing?

666
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:19,920
Hey.

667
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,949
That was so close.

668
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:26,460
The meeting with SBC at 5pm.
You didn't forget it, did you?

669
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,619
I know that.

670
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,429
What do you want to eat?
Sushi? Naengmyeon?

671
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:40,699
You didn't forget...

672
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:43,670
we're having dinner
together tonight, right?

673
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,539
You've kept your hand...

674
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:49,440
in your pocket the whole time.

675
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,219
Don't you think it's not
the right thing to do...

676
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,219
in front of your boss?

677
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:00,719
Happy now?

678
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,030
Well...

679
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,570
Just to be sure.

680
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,940
If you are hesitating...

681
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,869
because I can't
recognize your face...

682
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:20,039
Am I hesitating?

683
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,480
The woman over there.

684
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:32,960
She has beautiful eyes
and a prominent nose.

685
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,360
Her skin is like a gift
from the Almighty.

686
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,559
You know I can't see it.

687
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,500
I know. Isn't that great?

688
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,300
My man can't see women like her.

689
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:52,010
You know what? Here and here.

690
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:55,980
I've got some
wrinkles and freckles...

691
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,809
since we first met.

692
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,719
I can't see it.

693
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,420
Yes!

694
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,050
So you will only remember...

695
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,920
my prettiest face.

696
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:11,429
And I will see you grow old.

697
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:18,900
I'll see you in the restaurant
at the intersection at 6pm.

698
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,769
I should go to the broadcasting
company to make the contract.

699
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:24,239
- I'll see you there.
- Okay.

700
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,710
Let's have dinner together
at our place next time.

701
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,449
We'd be flattered to be invited.

702
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,219
Shall we go have some tea?

703
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,849
Sure.

704
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:37,449
Hey.

705
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:40,559
Secretary Jeong is waiting.
And I need to go to my office.

706
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:43,130
- Okay. Go ahead.
- All right.

707
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,460
Good luck.

708
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,119
What?

709
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,389
It stopped?

710
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:26,230
Control room.

711
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,239
The elevator just stopped.

712
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,940
All right.

713
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:42,320
Once he arrives,
I'll present this...

714
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,150
and propose to him again.

715
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:51,730
And...

716
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,699
I'll ask him to put this
on my finger.

717
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,639
No.

718
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:09,949
If I'm wearing
this ring when he arrives,

719
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:12,480
he'll feel happier?

720
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:27,659
What?

721
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,699
Darn it.

722
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:35,699
It's not working. Why now?

723
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,909
Excuse me.

724
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,579
Excuse me,

725
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,050
but could you speed up please?

726
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:49,920
It's almost over.
Please wait a little longer.

727
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,989
What is taking him so long?

728
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,699
Awesome!

729
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:13,210
Long time no see, Gal Hee.

730
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:16,480
Sir, did you already
sign the contract?

731
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,380
Where is Director Do?

732
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,780
You haven't met him yet?

733
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,519
He left first, saying he doesn't
want to keep you waiting.

734
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,559
Oh, right. He said
he would stop by the office.

735
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,000
The person you have reached
is not available.

736
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:36,260
Maybe something happened to him.

737
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:40,000
Sir, could you please excuse me?

738
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,070
I will go to the office now.
Could you please watch this?

739
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,610
Hey!

740
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,309
Are you enslaving me again?

741
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:03,059
Why are you doing this to me?

742
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,400
Secretary Jeong is waiting for me.

743
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,199
Darn it.

744
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,909
Are you okay, sir?

745
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:24,179
Gosh.

746
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,590
What?

747
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,199
I can see them.

748
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,230
Excuse me?

749
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,599
Are you all right?

750
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,039
Wait.

751
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,679
But...

752
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,489
Why, all of a sudden?

753
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:11,489
No, that's just how
blood pressure works.

754
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,699
So who knows?

755
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,300
You might also
get lucky like him one day.

756
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:24,670
- Thank you!
- Sure.

757
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:27,480
Oh, my. Thank you.

758
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:29,639
Thank you.

759
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:57,909
It's Director Do.

760
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,280
Yes, sir.

761
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:03,239
Hey, where are you now?

762
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:06,780
I couldn't reach you,
so I came back to the office.

763
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,219
Did something happen to you?

764
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,949
I see. Then...

765
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:14,159
I'll go back to the office now.

766
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,489
But I'm leaving now.

767
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,800
Don't. It'll be faster
if I come to you.

768
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,230
So just stay in the office.

769
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,639
But I left something
in the restaurant.

770
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:27,900
Secretary Jeong.

771
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:30,940
I'm not sure how much time
I have left now.

772
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,409
If not now, I don't know
when this moment will come back.

773
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:37,510
If I don't see you now,
I will regret it for life.

774
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:39,179
So please go back to the office.

775
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,420
I don't have time to explain.

776
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,590
Okay. I'll go back now.

777
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,329
Where are you?

778
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,429
I'm in front of the elevator.

779
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
But you're not here.

780
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:01,639
I'm on the first floor.

781
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:03,369
Do you want me to go back
to the office?

782
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:04,369
No.

783
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:06,809
Then...

784
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,679
Rooftop. Come to the rooftop.

785
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,380
Okay.

786
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,280
Sir.

787
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:53,380
Why did you want to meet me here?

788
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,309
You can see my face now, can't you?

789
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,320
You're pretty.

790
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:31,519
Am I?

791
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,920
Yes.

792
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:37,090
Your eyes are pretty.

793
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:39,929
Your nose is pretty.

794
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:43,630
Your lips are...

795
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:46,030
pretty too.

796
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,539
You're so pretty.

797
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,639
This is nice.

798
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,809
It's nice that you can see my face.

799
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:02,219
There is a thing...

800
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,949
I wanted to do so badly...

801
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:08,059
when I get to see your face.

802
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:55,400
We had miraculous moments
every once in a while.

803
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:57,570
Whenever that happened,

804
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:01,440
no matter where she was,
the man would go to her,

805
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,679
stare at her for a long time,

806
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,619
and kiss her for a long time,

807
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:14,619
appreciating the short moment.

808
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,559
So he can remember her face...

809
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,559
until the day he can see her again.

810
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:26,469
(Thank you for watching The Secret
Life of My Secretary. We love you!)

811
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,070
In 1, 2, 3.

812
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,369
- The Secret Life of My Secretary!
- The Secret Life of My Secretary!

813
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:02,539
- Thank you for watching our show!
- Thank you for watching our show!

814
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:03,769
What a mess!
