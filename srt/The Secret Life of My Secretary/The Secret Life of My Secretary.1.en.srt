(The Best Saver Award)

2
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,880
When she was a little girl,
her family motto was...

3
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,390
"One moment of patience may
ward off great disaster."

4
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,859
Awesome!

5
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,020
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

6
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,259
She thought
it was an amazing family motto.

7
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:01,270
Back then, she truly had no idea.

8
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,939
That her mother's great patience
never paid off...

9
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,409
until she died of a serious injury.

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,840
Gal Hui.

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,810
Our...

12
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,950
family motto...

13
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,349
Okay. I'll make sure to follow it.

14
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,849
Take it down...

15
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,920
What did you say?

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,689
Now I'm about to die,

17
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,859
I realized it.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,799
One moment of patience...

19
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,659
- Yes?
- One moment of patience...

20
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,769
What about it?

21
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:41,340
The 19-year-old girl, Jung Gal Hui,
never got to hear...

22
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,040
- how her mother's last words ended.
- Mom!

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,549
You can't just leave us like this!

24
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,680
"One moment of patience" and what?

25
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,620
What did you want to say
after "one moment of patience"?

26
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,290
(10 years later)

27
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,129
They're pretty.

28
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,030
But...

29
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:15,069
they're a bit modest
to be bought with this card.

30
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,979
Can I take a look
at some other designs?

31
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,250
Okay.

32
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,849
I wonder if it began already.

33
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,889
Sparkly eyes, sparkly nose

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,560
And sparkly ears

35
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,300
Where is he hiding?

36
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,949
Even if he's competent,
he's still too young.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,849
We can't give authority
to a guy like that.

38
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,919
(TnT Mobile,
Director Kim Oh Chan)

39
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,050
Don't you agree, President Sim?

40
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,889
Look at those widened eyes
and expanded nostrils.

41
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,259
He may sound a little harsh,
but I still approve of him.

42
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,699
You need to stop asking me about
the reappointment of my position.

43
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,129
The two things I hate the most...

44
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,039
are gang fights and family feuds.

45
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,639
(TnT Mobile,
President Sim Hae Yong)

46
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,210
Hey, there's Min Ik.

47
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,680
"I will get reappointed
as the president."

48
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,689
Gosh, Uncle Hae Yong.

49
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,020
His face already says it all.

50
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,830
Goodness, Director Do.

51
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,930
There's been an eight percent
increase in new members last year.

52
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,539
To be honest, when you launched
the IPTV service,

53
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,909
nobody expected that new members
would join our mobile service...

54
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,909
just so they could watch that.

55
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,639
If I'm so good,

56
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,280
why are you trying to vote
for my uncle?

57
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,280
What? Me?

58
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,780
Your smile came a little later
than your words.

59
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,250
Do you have some other plan in mind?

60
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,020
My goodness, stop it.

61
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,060
Gosh, I got it right again.

62
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,389
But let me tell you something.

63
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,629
It's okay to vote for my uncle.

64
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,829
- The other two here...
- Do Min Ik.

65
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,069
Let's add him and make that three.

66
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,610
The three of them are
on my side anyway.

67
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,120
The rehearsal's almost over.

68
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,649
You know I hate crowded places.

69
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,959
You may carry on badmouthing me.

70
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:48,829
I'll excuse myself, then.

71
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:58,670
He makes me feel bare naked
every time I run into him.

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,870
He remembers people's faces
after only a single encounter.

73
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:04,240
And he can read people's minds
just by looking at their faces.

74
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,910
It's no wonder they call him...

75
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,480
not only Director Do,
but as Director Mind-Reader too.

76
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,480
Director Do.
Guys, come over here for a second.

77
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,420
Good job.
They'll be on the show today.

78
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,949
Starting from here,
this is Seul Gi...

79
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,720
Seul Gi, Ji Wook, Gyu Min,
Woo Young, Hyun Ah,

80
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,029
Jun Hui, Moon Ho, Hyun Soo,
Se Young, and Da Young.

81
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,399
Gosh, you know all our names.

82
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,470
We'll start the opening rehearsal.

83
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,839
Now that Director Do is here,
he should come up on stage.

84
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,939
Sir, you should go.

85
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,250
How did the company owner's son
become so quick-witted?

86
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:43,750
I mean, why would he even have
to care about what others think?

87
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,519
My goodness.

88
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,189
He's totally camouflaged
to the background.

89
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,819
What are we going to do?

90
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,329
The Video Team just left
for another event.

91
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,589
What?

92
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,329
Is there anyone in the PR Team
who knows how to adjust videos?

93
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,899
The reporters will be here
in five minutes!

94
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,310
Don't you think Director Do
is being way too calm?

95
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:11,110
If I were him,
I'd get really nervous.

96
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,310
Why would he get nervous?

97
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,980
The person who's nervous right now
is probably someone else.

98
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:22,990
Code blue!

99
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,089
Are you talking about Jung Gal Hui?

100
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,689
Don't call her by her name.
She's called Minion.

101
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,990
No one in our company
calls her by her name.

102
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,129
I'm sure she's busy doing stuff for
the director even in this moment.

103
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,800
Do you know why she only wears
platform shoes?

104
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,740
Her boss calls her every 10 minutes.

105
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,810
And if she wears heels,
she can't run fast enough.

106
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,110
And don't get me started
on the huge bag she carries around.

107
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,579
Razors, socks, an umbrella,
and slippers.

108
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,850
She carries around everything
her boss might ask for.

109
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,050
I don't know if this is true or not.

110
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,149
But I heard she even went to his
civil defense training for him.

111
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,490
My name is Do Min Ik.

112
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,790
(Health Promotion Center)

113
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,290
I heard she even took
a urinalysis on his behalf.

114
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,860
In other words, if she was born
during the Age of Discovery,

115
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,660
she would've been working
on a sugar plantation.

116
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,329
And if she was born during
the Joseon Dynasty,

117
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:09,430
she would've been born a slave.

118
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,639
She's here. I hear her footsteps.

119
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,879
I'm sorry, you guys.
My boss is looking for me.

120
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,579
I heard you even come to work
during the weekend to feed his fish.

121
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,550
Yes, I'm grateful that he trusts me
with stuff like that.

122
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,829
I heard you even drive for him
because his driver quit.

123
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,360
I'm grateful that he trusts me
with his life.

124
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,569
Us, secretaries are
being referred to as minions...

125
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,170
because you keep doing everything
you're asked to do.

126
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,370
I'm sorry to say this, Se Young.

127
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,339
But you can take care
of your own dignity.

128
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,910
I buried my dignity
along with my mom's ashes.

129
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,779
So it never got to see any light
after the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

130
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:59,980
He pays me the most among
all the people I've worked for.

131
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,889
And I'll do anything
to get paid that much.

132
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,490
So will you please let me go?

133
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,990
I hate making my boss wait.

134
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,360
Doesn't Director Do fire
his secretaries after a year?

135
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,860
- Really?
- Why?

136
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,329
Jung Gal Hui's been working
for him for almost a year now.

137
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,449
Secretary Jung.

138
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,980
Yes, Director Do.

139
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,860
You're late.

140
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,460
Yes, that's because
if you want to change your suit,

141
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,659
you need to change your tie.

142
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,659
And if you change your tie,
you need to wear different shoes.

143
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,769
Why do I need
to go through all this?

144
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,529
I checked two times...

145
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,200
with the Video Team
that they'll be using...

146
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,139
a yellow background.

147
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,539
But you didn't check three times.

148
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,610
I was busy buying a gift
for your mother.

149
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,850
You weren't even prepared for this?

150
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,379
I mean, why do all the suits
in your size...

151
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,950
need to be out of stock
on a day like today?

152
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:10,519
And you had no countermeasures?

153
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,830
I'm sorry, sir. It was my mistake.

154
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,620
And instead of adding
the contents on TV,

155
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,750
I think it'd be better to add them
in mobile phones...

156
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
since you said you're also going
to add movies to the service.

157
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:47,929
Shoes.

158
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,559
Okay.

159
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,629
You can use my head
to keep balance.

160
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:05,539
I will now introduce to you
Director Do of TnT Mobile.

161
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,779
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage...

162
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,179
Director Do Min Ik of TnT Mobile.

163
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,919
(Director Do Min Ik)

164
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,919
Hello, everyone.

165
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:17,690
I'm Do Min Ik of TnT Mobile.

166
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,759
TnT Mobile started out...

167
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,500
by producing our own contents
for children.

168
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,269
But instead of stopping there,

169
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,000
we will continue to produce
our own contents...

170
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,669
so we can overcome the limits
of IPTV.

171
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,870
Therefore...

172
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,509
(Mobile Phones over TVs,
Mobile Phones Instead of Movies)

173
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,379
- "Mobile Phones over TVs".
- Mobile Phones over TVs.

174
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,509
- "Mobile Phones Instead of Movies".
- Mobile Phones Instead of Movies.

175
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,350
In order not to devalue our slogan,

176
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,980
we will continue to do our best
to provide...

177
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,320
- high quality contents.
- Maybe I should've put a pause.

178
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,090
TnT Mobile is...

179
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,320
It's excellent.

180
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,090
Director Gi.

181
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,990
Why aren't you on stage?

182
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,129
He's doing great on his own.

183
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:01,870
But you worked on it together.

184
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,370
Min Ik never wears coats...

185
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,940
because he always comes to work
and goes home...

186
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,100
straight from
the basement parking lot.

187
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:08,809
That's right.

188
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,240
You can't wear a coat either...

189
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:13,279
because your boss doesn't
wear a coat.

190
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,250
But it's too cold
not to wear a coat.

191
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,879
And that's why you always wear that.

192
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,549
That red cardigan is for both
outdoors and indoors.

193
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,519
Director Gi, you just saw
right through me.

194
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,389
How did you know that?

195
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,629
Before Min Ik got himself
a secretary,

196
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,169
he used to call my name
instead of yours.

197
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,399
I once even slept with my shoes on
back when we were students,

198
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,940
so I could run over to him
when he called my name.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,970
I even once drew my eyebrows
before going to sleep.

200
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,009
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

201
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:49,179
But...

202
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,250
don't try too hard.

203
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,190
Always being at his beck and call...

204
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,820
doesn't guarantee acknowledgment.

205
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,389
Please look forward
to what we have to offer...

206
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,500
through our IPTV service.

207
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,629
Thank you.

208
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,470
(One moment of patience may
ward off great disaster)

209
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,269
You're wrong, Mom.

210
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,740
I still believe that
patience and hard work...

211
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:20,179
will get me acknowledged.

212
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:22,549
- Right?
- Hey.

213
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,250
It's here.

214
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,019
It's the admission letter
that Nam Hui would receive...

215
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,990
if she got into
Pennsylvania University.

216
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,120
Really?

217
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,929
What does it say? Did she get in?

218
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,830
Do they want her over there?

219
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,669
"Dongboseong,
famous for its spicy jjajangmyeon."

220
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,070
"Trade 30 coupons
for a free dish of yangjangpi."

221
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,879
Where's the bus to Crazy Land?

222
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,679
I'd go there myself...

223
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,509
if I can finally get you to see.

224
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,120
What's so bad about it though?

225
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,389
It's not like
we can afford her tuition.

226
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:04,820
I'll make it work no matter what.
That school...

227
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,559
is the one Boss graduated.

228
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,559
I'm going to make sure Nam Hui
walk the path my boss did.

229
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,399
Instead of being stuck
backstage like me,

230
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,940
she'll spread her wings
and be in the spotlight.

231
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,009
Who'll pay for it though?

232
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,350
(Human Resources)

233
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,620
Human Resources...

234
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,690
already sent your renewal contract
to Director Do.

235
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,259
Is that so?

236
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:40,620
You know though, right?

237
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,860
He never keeps the same secretary
for more than a year.

238
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,230
Right.

239
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,240
Hold on. There was an exception.

240
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,899
Really? Who was it?

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,210
I think it was his first secretary.

242
00:13:56,409 --> 00:14:00,340
She worked for him
for 3 years from 2013.

243
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,809
Isn't this
Director Do's handwriting?

244
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
(Requesting parlay
into full-time position)

245
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,379
Yes, it is.

246
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,519
He tried to get her
a permanent position.

247
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,029
That means I have a shot too.

248
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,210
It's Romi, the licking dog...

249
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,570
and super innocent Ah Young.

250
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
I guess I'll be kept up all night.

251
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,259
What's that?

252
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,759
It's the announcement
for the sports event.

253
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,529
I have one for your team too.

254
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,230
(TnT Mobile 43rd Sports Event)

255
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:01,139
- You can't make it, right?
- I won't.

256
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,379
I wouldn't compete in this thing
just to win a mere rice cooker.

257
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,320
Why is she cutting across
the grounds like that?

258
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,220
Who?

259
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,350
Secretary Jung.

260
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,620
She's down there?

261
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:23,659
She's by the banner
surrounded by kids...

262
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,360
not being able to move.

263
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,740
Do you have good vision
or can you just focus well?

264
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,639
How can you recognize her
in that crowd?

265
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,110
How can you not when she's been
looking like that for a year?

266
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,710
I feel like I'll still hear
her voice if I ever go deaf...

267
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,379
and recognize her
even if I ever go blind.

268
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,860
Then renew her contract.

269
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,429
No one knows you
better than she does.

270
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,429
You know very well...

271
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,799
what the secretary
who knew me the best...

272
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,139
did to me.

273
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,059
Human Resources...

274
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,399
already sent your renewal contract
to Director Do.

275
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,629
Director Do, is that...

276
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:39,799
a document you received?

277
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,009
Yes, I was given this.

278
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,179
We'll forget about it though.

279
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:51,879
What?

280
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,649
You should take the time...

281
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,850
to recharge your energy.

282
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,720
No, that's not necessary.

283
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,629
I don't need a break.

284
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,059
You don't want a break?

285
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,829
No.

286
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,000
No matter how hard the work is,
I'd still rather work here.

287
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,470
If you let me, I'll do my best...

288
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,470
to serve you any way I can.

289
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,680
I'll learn 100
from a single lesson...

290
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,839
and learn a million from 2 lessons.

291
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,680
I'll run and run...

292
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,150
until my tongue turns white
and my armpits are sweaty.

293
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,680
What...

294
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:30,789
There's...

295
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,390
no need to be
this passionate about it.

296
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,529
Well, if that's what
you desperately want,

297
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,170
I'll think about it.

298
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,269
Thank you. Thank you, Director. Do.

299
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,140
- You're dismissed.
- Thank you.

300
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,509
Thank you.

301
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,950
Please enjoy your meal. Thank you!

302
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,849
He said he'd think about it.

303
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,589
What did his former secretary do...

304
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,619
to have him put in a request
for a full-time job?

305
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,059
It was the deepest cry of
desperation I've seen in 10 years.

306
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,859
Why is she obsessed over
a sports event?

307
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,769
Director Do has arrived.

308
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,309
Director Do!

309
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,950
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

310
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,069
Blood...

311
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,309
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Blood...

312
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:02,109
Should I buy some ointment?

313
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,849
- Taxi!
- Where are you going?

314
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,819
Taxi!

315
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,519
Taxi!

316
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,430
Why am I ruining my chances?

317
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,799
Where is he going though?

318
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,970
Please take a look at me.

319
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:29,069
My head doesn't feel right.

320
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,609
- 2 times 8.
- 16.

321
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,009
- 8 times 7.
- 56.

322
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,309
- It's 54.
- No, 56!

323
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:34,380
You're fine.

324
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,349
Gosh, please check me out.

325
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,579
It wasn't just a soft little bang.
It was hard!

326
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,089
I hit my head really hard.

327
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,390
Darn it.

328
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,059
The surgery took place
over 20 years ago.

329
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,700
You're the one
who told me to be careful.

330
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,130
You said to avoid crowded places,

331
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,099
so I've never gone shopping before.

332
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:58,769
I'm never to be out of breath,
so I don't run.

333
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:00,539
I'm so worried
about hurting myself...

334
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,839
that I haven't participated
in any sports events.

335
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,740
That means you can take
100 of these, so come back to me...

336
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,250
when you actually injure yourself.

337
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,309
- You're serious, right?
- Stop pestering me and go.

338
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,680
- You sure?
- Leave.

339
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,880
- Are you sure?
- Leave.

340
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,420
- You sure?
- Leave!

341
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,299
It's me.

342
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,349
(I'm sorry for alarming you.
Please drink this before bed!)

343
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,329
I'm sorry for alarming you.

344
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,900
Please drink this before bed!

345
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,569
This was unnecessary.

346
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,069
(Personal Contract)

347
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,109

(Director Do Min Ik)

353
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,150
All right. Could you
introduce yourself please?

354
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:32,890
Yes.

355
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,190
My mother named me
Jung Gal Hui,

356
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,160
hoping I can become
a classy and neat person.

357
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,619
Take the meat out of the freezer
for the soup.

358
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:06,059
I'll do the rest when I'm back,
so don't touch anything else.

359
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,529
And don't skip class, top student.

360
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,059
Do you really have to attend
the sports event...

361
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:12,299
on the anniversary of
our mother's death?

362
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:14,529
A renewal of the contract is
on the line.

363
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,170
I want to show my loyalty
to my boss for one last time.

364
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,500
Don't skip class.

365
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,140
Flame...

366
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,210
shot!

367
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,049
Nice, sir!

368
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,690
We're in their team
only when they need us.

369
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,859
When they don't,
secretaries are never included.

370
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,359
No one is asking us to join.

371
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,000
It happens all the time.

372
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,269
The labor union won't
let us join either...

373
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,299
because we're outsourced workers.

374
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,839
And whenever there's a rumor,

375
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,400
the executives suspect
the secretaries first.

376
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,970
If you want to badmouth your boss,
do it after you die.

377
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,809
- Hello, Ms. Eul Wang Lee.
- Hello, Ms. Eul Wang Lee.

378
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,680
Could you please not call me
Eul Wang Lee in front of people?

379
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:07,250
Okay. Ms. Lee Eul Wang.

380
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:08,890
- One more time!
- One more time!

381
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,220
What are you doing?

382
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:16,289
I'm going to play the game,
"Piggyback Ride with Your Boss".

383
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,359
- You're carrying the director?
- Yes.

384
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,200
Hey, Director Mind-Reader is
not coming.

385
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,400
He's not?

386
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,240
Including last year and
the year before, he has never come.

387
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:33,680
He's here.

388
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,579
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

389
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,549
He's coming here.

390
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,759
- Go!
- Let's go!

391
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,630
- Run, run!
- Run, run!

392
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,299
Are you really Do Min Ik, in person?

393
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,769
- Yes!
- Let's do it!

394
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,970
It's hot, crowded,

395
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,609
and full of danger here.

396
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:06,579
You could bump into someone, fall,
or get hurt. And yet you're here?

397
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,509
I know.

398
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,920
Why do I want to do this
of all things?

399
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,880
- Don't quit!
- Let's go!

400
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,920
- Yes!
- Let's go!

401
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,589
- Go, go!
- Good job!

402
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:24,730
You're here, sir.

403
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,730
I am here. Because of you.

404
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,069
I thought about it. And...

405
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,539
Now, let's start
the piggyback game...

406
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,910
to test how intimate you are
with your boss!

407
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,980
The participants may now
carry your partner on your back...

408
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:48,420
Hop on.

409
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,250
Pardon?

410
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,160
How could I hop on you?

411
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,390
Just hop on.

412
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:06,400
But...

413
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,269
You wanted to do this so badly?

414
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:37,900
I did?

415
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,039
Ready!

416
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:47,339
Jung Gal Hui! Jung Gal Hui!

417
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,680
Do Min Ik?

418
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:55,119
Is he...

419
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:56,920
running now?

420
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,559
Come on.

421
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,559
Sir, I'm almost getting it.

422
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,259
There you go.

423
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,339
- I got it.
- Good.

424
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,140
Director Do Min Ik from Media One
and Secretary Jung Gal Hui wins!

425
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,440
Director Do!

426
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,380
Sir! We won first place!

427
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:56,650
Yes!

428
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,079
We won first place!

429
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:10,029
We won first place.

430
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,759
Are you happy now?

431
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,529
What?

432
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,970
I give the best salary
at the beginning...

433
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,440
and at the end,

434
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,900
I give the best present.

435
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:23,910
That's the way I do it.

436
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,309
It has been great working with you.

437
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,359
Today's winner is
Management Support Department.

438
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,529
Congratulations.

439
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:47,029
A 50-dollar gift voucher will be
given to each member of the team.

440
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,329
Lastly, we're going to
draw a lucky person.

441
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,670
You said you would think about it.

442
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,509
You said you would think about it
because I wanted it so badly.

443
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,039
I did? When?

444
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,180
Well, if that's what
you desperately want,

445
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,450
I'll think about it.

446
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,349
Did you think that was...

447
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,660
Are you smiling while firing me?

448
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,299
It was a one-year contract
in the first place.

449
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,299
It means I'm not going to see you
for more than a year.

450
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,970
It could mean that you'll continue
to see me after a year.

451
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,809
It looks like you haven't heard
the rumor...

452
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:32,309
that I change my secretary
every year.

453
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,109
I heard about it,
but I thought it might not be true.

454
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,210
Why did you expect that?

455
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:41,150
There was a secretary
who worked for three years.

456
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:44,549
And you even tried to promote her
to a permanent worker.

457
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,019
You...

458
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,390
How much do you know about me?

459
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,259
So I...

460
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,230
I thought I could be like her
if I worked hard enough.

461
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,829
Anyone can do this job.

462
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,970
It doesn't have to be you.

463
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,769
Sir.

464
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,140
Don't blame me
for your expectations.

465
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,680
Expectations are...

466
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,250
nothing but a false hope.

467
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,049
But this is the only thing I can do.

468
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,089
You're the one
that does the assessment...

469
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:22,930
and you're the one
that renews the contract.

470
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,359
All I can do is to hope.

471
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:32,869
Others belittled me,
calling me "Minion",

472
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,839
but I wanted to help you.

473
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,269
Your needs were my priority.

474
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,609
I skipped meals,
but feed your fish properly.

475
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,279
I skipped the anniversary
of my mother's death,

476
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,579
but shopped a birthday present
for your mother.

477
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:50,420
My bag is full of your things.

478
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,019
My scheduler is
full of your schedules.

479
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,460
And...

480
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,460
And I'm not allowed to have hopes?

481
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:07,099
Who will be the last lucky person?

482
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:09,670
Who is going to win...

483
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,980
the amazing multifunctional
rice cooker?

484
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,980
Secretary Jung Gal Hui
from Media One! Congratulations!

485
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:21,450
Congratulations!

486
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,289
I want it!

487
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:24,319
Congratulations.

491
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,690
Delicious rice is ready.

492
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:12,900
The steam will be released.

493
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,900
Please stir the rice well.

494
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,769
Your rice is ready.

495
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,410
I hate that rice cooker!

496
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,220
No matter how hard the work is,
I'd still rather work here.

497
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,759
If you let me, I'll do my best...

498
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,690
to serve you any way I can.

499
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:50,769
I counted my chickens
before they were hatched.

500
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,900
I digested the rice
before it was cooked. Gosh!

501
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,069
What should I do with my life?

502
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,339
I don't see anything ahead.

503
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,579
- You too?
- What?

504
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:05,950
Is that why you didn't go to work?

505
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,319
What?

506
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,289
Well...

507
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,800
Yes, Sir.

508
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,300
I heard you were fired,
and it looks like it's true.

509
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,639
Come to the office later.

510
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,070
We should have a farewell party
with all the other secretaries.

511
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:34,980
You want me to take
a day off today...

512
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,010
and come tomorrow?

513
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,250
Okay, Sir.

514
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,630
Let me see.

515
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,960

(Item)

519
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,780
(The online advertising market size
in 2019 is 4.7 billion dollars.)

520
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,179
Excellent.

521
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,250
Excuse me?

522
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,789
Director Do.

523
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,489
He always does excellent jobs,
which makes me feel jealous.

524
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,059
I know.

525
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,659
The exclusive contract on dramas...

526
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,869
and the children's content
he launched is well received too.

527
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,099
That's why people say
Media Two should be...

528
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,840
half as good as Media One...

529
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:36,710
I'm sorry.

530
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,110
You don't have to be sorry.

531
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,739
I know how competent Min Ik is.

532
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,050
I'm sure Media Two will
make an achievement soon.

533
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,820
I hope so.

534
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,880
By the way...

535
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,289
You don't have to use honorifics
to me when we're alone.

Director Gi!

540
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:17,449
I thought you were alone.

541
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,320
He's the rising star of our company.

542
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:23,150
Director Gi Dae Ju.
I'm sure you all know him.

543
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:28,690
Of course I do. He's become
the inside director recently.

544
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,960
By the way,

545
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,699
isn't he Director Do's good friend?

546
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:36,230
Come on.
President Sim called him here.

547
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,170
I'm sure he will take care of it.

548
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,900
Come on in. Have a seat.

549
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,099
Come in.

550
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,739
This meeting is
going to decide everything.

551
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,210
You know President Sim will be
reappointed, right?

552
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,110
Of course I do.

553
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,519
But Director Do is
too outstanding these days.

554
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:57,690
Why would you talk about work
so much over such great food?

555
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,219
Enough.

556
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,719
Let's let Director Gi eat.

558

Try this.

559
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,900
Once you taste the head,

560
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,039
you can never eat the tail.

561
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:15,969
Why?

562
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,610
The head tastes...

563
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,079
very sweet.

Maybe he's away for a second.

Where could it be?

579

Gosh, I told him
it was confidential.

580

You were not just a jacket.
You were my skin.

for everything.

649
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,559
Mom.

650
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,070
What did you want to say
after "one moment of patience"?

651
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,269
I'm an idiot.

652
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,210
This was it.

653
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,449
I can't believe I never knew this.

654
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,800
Darn it.

655
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,130
- Let's go!
- Where?

656
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,000
To kill that jerk.

657
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:34,800
Are we going?

658
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,940
Are we really going?

659
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:41,239
Are you watching me, Mom?

660
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,849
I'll follow your will...

661
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,449
and kill that jerk tonight!

662
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,320
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

663
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,090
Let's go!

664
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,570
You're here.

665
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:39,369
Well...

666
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,340
Excuse me.

667
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:44,710
Who are you?

668
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,079
I think you're at the wrong place.

669
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:51,550
This is a private boat.

670
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:57,619
What?

671
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:02,960
Who are you?

672
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,059
What are you...

673
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,760
What the... You jerk.

674
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,659
Aren't you guys a little cold?

675
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,329
Are you also cold?

676
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,099
I think I also have
an upset stomach.

677
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,110
What are you saying?
We came all the way here.

678
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,550
I need to make a reservation
at a golf club tomorrow at dawn.

679
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:38,349
My mom bought sundae
and wants me to come home.

680
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,320
You traitors.

681
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,289
Just go! Go!

682
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,300
You should go too. What are you
going to do all by yourself?

683
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,929
No, I'm not going to go. I can't go!

684
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,670
I'm going to fulfill my mom's will
no matter what.

685
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,769
I'm going to kill that jerk!

686
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:57,940
Give me that.

687
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:08,420
Do you think she'll be okay?

688
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,849
I don't know.

689
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:12,719
Where are we?

690
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,590
Hey, call a cab.

691
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,360
- Gosh, it's freezing.
- Goodness.

692
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,630
- It's so cold.
- My gosh.

693
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:22,960
Who are you?

694
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:27,769
That's a knife... Are you...

695
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:30,869
going to kill me with that?

696
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,300
Secretary Jung!

697
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,840
Yes, Director Do.

698
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:06,309
Gosh, I can't believe myself.

699
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,980
I can't believe
I'm even hearing stuff now.

700
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,780
Yes, let's kill him.

701
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:17,750
I need to kill him to stop
hearing his voice in my head...

702
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,619
- Secretary Jung!
- Yes, Director Do.

703
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,489
What?

704
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:26,400
- Help!
- Is this for real?

705
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,329
Secretary Jung, help!

706
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,300
Help me!

707
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:33,469
Director Do?

708
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,019
Don't kill me. I'm sorry.

709
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:36,730
- Are you all right?
- Don't come any closer.

710
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,190
He...

711
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:04,989
He looks familiar.

712
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,800
What?

713
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:08,329
I mean...

714
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,349
Mom, you're angry.

715
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,019
What did you want
for your birthday again?

716
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,550
What if...

717
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:03,550
A boat.

718
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,219
We'll know when he wakes up.

719
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:07,260
Will he be all right?

720
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:23,139
Min Ik, how do you feel?

721
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,010
Who are you?

722
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,739
What do you mean? It's me, Dr. Gu.

723
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:36,550
You have the wrong person.

724
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:42,690
Gosh, it hurts.

725
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,969
Sangmo Hospital?

726
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:58,840
There's a Dr. Gu Seok Chan here,
right?

727
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,880
Please call him for me.

728
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:06,750
(Gu Seok Chan)

729
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:13,789
Wait.

730
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,530
Where did the other guy go...

731
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:21,500
and why are you wearing
Dr. Gu's gown?

732
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,869
Do you not recognize me?

733
00:54:24,769 --> 00:54:25,869
Hey!

734
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,840
People call me mind reader...

735
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,269
because I read through them
just by looking at their faces.

736
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:36,010
Why would I not recognize Dr. Gu
who I've known for 20 years?

737
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:38,510
- 9 times 9.
- 81.

738
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,980
- 4 times 7.
- 28.

739
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,150
That's how Dr. Gu tests me.

740
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,260
Min Ik,

741
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,030
who do I look like...

742
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,030
in your eyes?

743
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,070
What do you guys take me for?

744
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:00,739
Unbelievable.

745
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:03,769
I'm the one who saved him.

746
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,980
I did the saving, not the stabbing!

747
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:10,510
We already have witness statements.

748
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,119
You mentioned your mother's will...

749
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:15,920
and threatened to kill him.

750
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,349
What?

751
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:21,190
Unbelievable.

752
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:23,360
Just how nutty is this woman?

753
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:26,289
I see a man, of course!

754
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,300
Do you think
that I'm blind or something?

755
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,449
This must be a dream.

756
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:51,989
Yes, of course it is.

757
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:55,590
Since that's the case,
I'll go back to sleep.

758
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,159
Sleep will fix everything.

759
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,000
What?

760
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:06,030
That hurt.

761
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:08,739
Then is this for real?

762
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,380
I think I should get going.

763
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,349
I have business to take care of.

764
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:26,489
All these faces are making me...

765
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,820
- You can't.
- Let go!

766
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,099
Min Ik!

767
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,510
From domestic to
international borders,

768
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:48,010
an emergency warning
was widely announced.

769
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:52,010
The fine dust mixed with thick fogs
has been causing a blurry vision...

770
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,519
throughout the whole city of Seoul,

771
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:55,250
allowing only a
short-distance range of view.

772
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,820
Starting last weekend
in Beijing, China...

773
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,260
What on earth...

774
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,530
Fusiform gyrus.

775
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,800
There must be an issue
with his facial recognition.

776
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,309
All these people...

777
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:27,019
Doctor, please help me.

778
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:29,550
I...

779
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:32,619
The faces keep changing.

780
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:34,489
Do you have dementia too?

781
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,369
I must get out of here.

782
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:53,340
I must.

783
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:14,230
I feel like I'll still hear
her voice if I ever go deaf...

784
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,900
and recognize her
even if I ever go blind.

785
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:22,840
Secretary Jung.

786
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,880
You made a full recovery
while I was suspected for murder?

787
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,719
I don't care what happens this time.

788
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:36,519
There's no way I'm saving you again!

789
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:38,019
Darn it!

790
00:58:57,369 --> 00:58:58,539
Secretary Jung.

791
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,610
Help...

792
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,510
Save me, please.

793
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:08,449
What?

794
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,199
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

795
00:59:29,769 --> 00:59:32,309
From now on,
you'll always be by my side.

796
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,710
Why did you come back for me?

797
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,780
Why are you rehiring me
after firing me?

798
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,880
Don't get your hopes up.

799
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,920
Who do you think you are?

800
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,480
Jung Gal Hui.
You're the only one I see.

801
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:47,389
Did you decide
to finally change your mind?

802
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:48,690
Please hurry up and find him.

803
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,289
I must see the guy...

804
00:59:50,289 --> 00:59:51,760
who did this to me.

805
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,400
Director Do's colleague
and best friend?

806
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,659
Dae Ju?
