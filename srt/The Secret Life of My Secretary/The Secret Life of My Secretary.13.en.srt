1
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,310
Once the trust between the boss
and the secretary breaks,

2
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,810
you know what happens.

3
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,179
Jeong Gal Hee.

4
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:49,250
You're fired.

5
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,829
Have I ever told you...

6
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,840
why I helped you?

7
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,480
Do you know about arowana?

8
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,280
I do. Very well.

9
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,019
They say it brings luck whatsoever.

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,849
It's from my late father.

11
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,319
There was a person who cherished
fish more than his secretary.

12
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,629
How many times did I tell you?

13
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,400
I said I'm going to give this fish
to Min Ik,

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,159
so you need to treat it well!

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,599
- Sorry, sir.
- Sorry, sir.

16
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,670
Do whatever it takes
to keep it alive.

17
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,640
If it dies, you two will die too.

18
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,099
Go cure it!

19
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,980
Goodness.

20
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,980
(Chairman of TnT Mobile, Do Wan Bae)

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,109
Yes, sir. We're now on our way.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,849
Yes, at the junction...

23
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:57,790
Hey.

24
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,099
Do whatever it takes
to keep it alive.

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,930
If it dies, you two will die too.

26
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,340
Oh, no!

27
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,150
His secretary died to save a fish,

28
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:28,919
but the company didn't even
count it as an industrial accident.

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,159
Because if it was reported
as an industrial accident,

30
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,360
it would reveal how he
made her work during off-hours...

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,159
and received a fish that was worth
100,000 dollars under the table.

32
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,300
So I replaced the fish...

33
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,770
with another fish
that was worth 10,000 dollars.

34
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,310
- And with the money...
- Eul Wang.

35
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,680
Where did you get this money?

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,180
I paid for her son's tuition,

37
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,409
since she never received
any compensation.

38
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,979
That's when I formed
a society called Euldoguk.

39
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,819
We took dirty money
from those in power...

40
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,289
and returned the money to those
who were treated unfairly.

41
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,430
- No.
- We replaced the paintings...

42
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,129
they received as bribery
with replicas.

43
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,460
And we collected large amounts
of condolence money...

44
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,930
that goes against the anti-graft law
to raise a fund.

45
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,699
We, the dispatched workers
of TnT Mobile...

46
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,270
were never even able to take
a short break.

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,810
But we finally succeeded in making
a waiting room for us!

48
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,270
Every single penny we gathered...

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,479
was used to improve the treatment
of our dispatched employees.

50
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,409
That's how we were able to make
a waiting room for the drivers.

51
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:32,580
- So what? My gosh.
- That's why I couldn't ignore it...

52
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,719
- I'll call you back.
- when I first heard your story.

53
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,849
Just hang up for now.

54
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,560
My gosh, darn it.

55
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,759
Hey.

56
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,770
How many times have I told you
not to eat in the car?

57
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,229
No, sir. I never eat in the car...

58
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,039
because I know you don't like it.

59
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,539
Then what's this smell?

60
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,840
Maybe it's coming from the heater.

61
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,810
Are you kidding me? Hey, you fool.

62
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,250
Do you think I can't differentiate
the smell of food and the heater?

63
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:04,280
Do you think I'm an idiot
or something? Hey!

64
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,520
Hey!

65
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:08,719
Hey! Hey!

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,639
(Eun Jung Su, Hanguk Hospital)

67
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,470
What do you mean?

68
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,670
Why won't the company file this
as an industrial accident?

69
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,509
President Sim is throwing a fit...

70
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,779
saying he's going to sue you
for attempted murder.

71
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,850
I just got a call
from the service center,

72
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,810
and apparently he said you purposely
caused the accident...

73
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,819
to take revenge on him
for hurting your neck.

74
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,050
What?

75
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:42,750
Then who's...

76
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,389
Who's going to pay for
my injured knee?

77
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:48,959
Hello? Hello?

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,410
Mr. Eun Jung Su?

79
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,379
Who are you?

80
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,810
I'm Lee Eul Wang. I'm here because
Secretary Mo told me about you.

81
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,759
Euldoguk filed your accident
as an industrial accident,

82
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,430
and it's a total of 10,610 dollars
that's worth six months of your pay.

83
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:24,829
I don't know...

84
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,629
if I'm allowed to take this money.

85
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,769
Take it.

86
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,839
This is why I made this organization
in the first place.

87
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,310
Then in return for taking this,
let me be of help...

88
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,449
to Euldoguk in any way.

89
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,980
I'm not sure.

90
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,819
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

91
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,189
Then can you be in charge
of our ledger?

92
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,189
I feel uneasy about keeping it
in the company.

93
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,360
Of course. Whatever you need, Boss.

94
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,500
"Boss"?

95
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,000
This is an auto escape knife.

96
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,410
I always kept it with me
ever since I began...

97
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,480
working as a driver
at the age of 20.

98
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,879
I wanted to keep myself safe...

99
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,180
just in case anything happened
in the car.

100
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:19,350
One boss pulled on my hair
because he didn't like...

101
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,050
how I always followed
the traffic signals.

102
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,220
And one boss...

103
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,420
threw a cigarette butt at me...

104
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,459
because I yielded the way
to another car.

105
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,589
I want to have a boss
whom I can respect,

106
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,259
not just someone who's high in rank.

107
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,199
Ha Ni said she'll leave the ledger
in the office.

108
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,209
Just wait here a little bit.

109
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,420
Did she go somewhere?

110
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,629
Where's the USB?

111
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,870
My gosh, I told him
that this is confidential.

112
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,350
Yes, Boss.

113
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,620
I think Director Do has the ledger.

114
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,850
We can't let him see the file.

115
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:05,089
Didn't you say you heard
where he's headed?

116
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,430
I think he's going meet Dae Ju
at the Han River.

117
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:10,930
Then please make sure Director Gi
doesn't make it there.

118
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,430
I'll retrieve the ledger.

119
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,329
Hey, you're here.

120
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Who...

121
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,639
If only...

122
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,639
Who are you?

123
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,540
If only I didn't insist on
going there to find the ledger.

124
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,509
I'd like to turn myself in.

125
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,679
What?

126
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,350
I wanted to be of help,

127
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,019
but I only ended up
making things worse.

128
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,990
Now that Director Do
saw the ledger,

129
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,159
it's only a matter of time
before he finds out about Euldoguk.

130
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,929
I'll just turn myself in...

131
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,330
and say I'm responsible
for both the ledger...

132
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,899
and the accident that happened
to Director Do.

133
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:50,940
No.

134
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,769
The company and President Sim are
the ones who should get punished.

135
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,139
Why should you get punished instead?

136
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,580
But what if...

137
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,350
everyone in Euldoguk ends up
getting fired?

138
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,320
Director Do...

139
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,330
has trouble seeing people's faces
because of me.

140
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,629
How is that your fault?

141
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:21,230
It's his father's fault for only
hiring dispatched workers...

142
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,029
to cut down the company's
personnel expense.

143
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,940
And it's also President Sim's fault
for treating his driver...

144
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,409
like a slave.

145
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,679
I'll make sure nothing happens
to Euldoguk.

146
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,080
Mr. Eun, go somewhere nice
and get some rest for a few days.

147
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,889
I'll call you as soon as I'm done
dealing with the situation.

148
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,460
We'll get in an old car in Havana...

149
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,460
and drive by the Malecon Beach.

150
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,269
Then we'll go to a salsa club...

151
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,399
and get ourselves some nice mojitos.

152
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,139
(Sangmo Hospital)

153
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,240
Why do you suddenly want to go
to Cuba?

154
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,279
If you must go,
take your girlfriend with you.

155
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,379
Were you not listening to me?

156
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:12,519
I spent the past hour telling you
about my sad love story.

157
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:15,019
The two women I was in love with...

158
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,950
ended up being the same woman.

159
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,519
So you want me to leave my patients
behind and go to Cuba with you?

160
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,059
Then whom do you suggest I go with?

161
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,230
My secretary lied to me.

162
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,399
I doubted my friend.
And as for my family...

163
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,470
Well...

164
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,100
I never had one to begin with.

165
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,399
Let me see.

166
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:35,169
I can't go to Cuba with you,
but I can take a look at your neck.

167
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:38,139
By the way,

168
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,750
if the two women you were in love
ended up being the same woman,

169
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,509
isn't that a good thing?

170
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,919
A good thing?

171
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,519
You know that's not the point!

172
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,759
I'm sure she had a good reason.

173
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,529
Whose side are you on?

174
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,129
My goodness. Okay, fine.

175
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,230
My gosh, that darn wench!
What a horrible witch!

176
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,570
How nasty of her!
Are you happy now?

177
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,840
But I guess you didn't forget
to take your medicine.

178
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,110
Thanks to that,
it didn't get any worse.

179
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,940
Otherwise, you would've ended up
in a severe condition.

180
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,649
Whatever. I'm going to go.

181
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,009
I have other places to go too!

182
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,230
I can't believe...

183
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,429
I have no other place to go
other than here.

184
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,590
Here. You can have it.

185
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,330
I got sick of it.

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,070
Yes, Mr. Park.

187
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,509
What about Mr. Eun's hometown number
or any other contacts?

188
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,740
Okay.

189
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,879
If you get a hold of him,
please let me know.

190
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Okay, bye.

191
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,120
Who is it?

192
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:53,909
I heard what happened
at the police station.

193
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,980
But when I first met Mr. Eun,
he didn't seem like a bad guy.

194
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,820
Dae Ju, since you already handed in
your resignation letter,

195
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,750
how about we go to Cuba
and learn how to dance salsa?

196
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,960
Why would you go to Cuba?

197
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,830
You have three days left until
the election. You don't know that?

198
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,929
I don't know.

199
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,600
President, my foot.

200
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,929
And you said you saw
the suspect's face.

201
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,669
Then how could you not recognize
the man who stabbed you...

202
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,000
when he came back as your driver?

203
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,299
The thing is...

204
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,750
I got hurt a little.

205
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,610
You got hurt?

206
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:33,220
That day I had an accident
at the boat.

207
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,990
I hurt my head that day.

208
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,559
Apparently, the clip they put
in my head during the surgery...

209
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,129
slipped or something.

210
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,360
What?

211
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,029
You said you were fine.

212
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,799
- Dae Ju.
- Yes?

213
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:57,940
Dae Ju.

214
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,539
What?

215
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,309
I...

216
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,750
can't see...

217
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:11,990
your face.

218
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:15,529
What?

219
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,460
Your eyes,

220
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,659
nose,

221
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,740
and mouth.

222
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,039
I can't see any of them.

223
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:29,809
Maybe...

224
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:32,980
Probably...

225
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:36,980
I'll have to live this way
for the rest of my life.

226
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,590
I feel bad for you who's taken
care of me since I was seven.

227
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,860
So I...

228
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,129
didn't want to tell you this.

229
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,659
Min Ik.

230
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,269
You know what?

231
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,039
If you can't see people's faces,

232
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,980
you can't see their hearts as well.

233
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,149
I can't tell...

234
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,759
what face they're making or
what they're thinking about.

235
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,769
I'm sorry, Dae Ju.

236
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:35,740
But...

237
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,009
I couldn't ask for more
from you.

238
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,360
Shall we go out?

239
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,039
Why aren't you coming?

240
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:16,080
Are you coming late today?

241
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:22,190
Why aren't you showing up today?

242
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,990
Jeong Gal Hee.

243
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,860
You're fired.

244
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,870
Jeong Gal Hee?

245
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:45,379
Why are you still up?

246
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,980
Jung Hee.

247
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,580
This is strange.

248
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,450
Mom is not coming.

249
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,629
I guess Mom hates me now.

250
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,829
I think she hates me
because I'm a bad person.

251
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,539
What do I do now?

252
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,109
What's wrong? Did something happen?

253
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,579
If I go back to him tomorrow...

254
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,680
and apologize for what I've done,

255
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,049
will he forgive me?

256
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,119
I guess no one wants to see me.

257
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,390
Who wouldn't want to see you?

258
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,559
You have me. I want to see you,
but I probably can't forever.

259
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,970
Who wouldn't want to see
such a precious face?

260
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,359
(One moment of patience may
ward off great disaster)

261
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,869
As of today,

262
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,640
I announce
the dissolution of Euldoguk.

263
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,170
What?

264
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,140
Why all of a sudden, Ms. Lee?

265
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,140
Is it because
Director Do got the ledger?

266
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,650
We will have to wait
and watch how it goes,

267
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:31,650
but now that Mr. Eun is
running from the police,

268
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:34,849
it's about time Director Do
will make a move.

269
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,549
Still,

270
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,220
you know what we've been
through for Euldoguk.

271
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,259
Like I promised
when you joined us,

272
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:46,559
I'll take full responsibility
in the case when we get caught.

273
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,099
So if something happens
in the company,

274
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:54,069
state that you had nothing
to do with me.

275
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,980
State that Euldoguk was also
run all by myself.

276
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,829
Hey.

277
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,730
Didn't you say this to me before?

278
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,069
That we should
settle a girl problem.

279
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,240
Next time.

280
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,210
I don't want to break your heart
when your head is already hurt.

281
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,849
I told you.
Since I can't see your face,

282
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,509
I might easily misunderstand you.

283
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,750
Gosh, what is it?

284
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,390
Veronica Park.

285
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:49,690
- What?
- I like her too.

286
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,200
Gosh, you competent rascal.

287
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,769
I wondered how you got
the contract with Cinepark.

288
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:04,140
Hey, do you think this is funny?

289
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,740
So...

290
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,710
it's true
that I liked Veronica Park.

291
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,349
But it turns out...

292
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,650
she was just a stranger.

293
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,690
What are you talking about?

294
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,460
It's a long story.

295
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,289
Can't you be more creative
with your pitiful act?

296
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,259
Do you really need
some props like this?

297
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,000
Your neck cast is finally off.

298
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,470
I'm...

299
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,839
wearing a waist support instead.

300
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,309
I couldn't stretch my back until
yesterday because of my mom.

301
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:19,579
And I finally became able to
straighten myself this morning.

302
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,549
What did Chairwoman Park say?

303
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,190
When she heard about Director Gi.

304
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,619
She kept hitting me,
so I don't remember well.

305
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:31,599
But forfeiture of property,
severance of mom-daughter relations,

306
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:33,799
and bloodlust.

307
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,569
I think...

308
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,299
I heard things like that.

309
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,509
What did your boss say?

310
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,940
I got fired.

311
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,980
It's good that
he didn't file a suit.

312
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,220
What am I supposed to do?

313
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,819
I was thinking about
going back to him...

314
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:57,589
and asking for forgiveness.

315
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:01,019
You've seen a lot of rich people
abusing their power on TV.

316
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,460
Did you ever see them
forgive someone...

317
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,230
after receiving a genuine apology?

318
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,329
But I can't just sit back
and do nothing.

319
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,670
Of course you have to do something.

320
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,769
When I got hit by my mom,
I kept shouting and groaning.

321
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,440
She will feel better only when
I make some reactions.

322
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,609
What should I do then?

323
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,650
When you can't think of anything,

324
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,990
the best cure is...

325
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:34,759
What?

326
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,029
First, you should eat
something really expensive.

327
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,430
- Eat something?
- Yes.

328
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:46,369
Something that makes you say,
"This tiny dish is this expensive?"

329
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,509
"This place must be insane!"

330
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:52,180
Something so expensive
that makes you feel like that.

331
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,710
Then you should buy pretty things
that are totally useless.

332
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,720
And watch some comedy shows
that make you giggle.

333
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,359
It has to be so funny to the point
it makes you feel bad...

334
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,359
for laughing so much
even when you got fired.

335
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,170
Then you will definitely
come up with an idea...

336
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,640
on what you should do.

337
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,910
Good luck.

338
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:29,980
See you.

339
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,420
(This area is under surveillance.)

340
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,609
Hello.

341
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,349
Did you just ask me...

342
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:05,049
who I am?

343
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,500
Nice to meet you.

344
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,329
I'm the original Veronica Park.

345
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,769
Hi.

346
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,009
Why did you want to see me?

347
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,480
Well...

348
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,390
I couldn't just sit and watch her
being in misery.

349
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,490
I suppose she has been
staying in bed this whole time...

350
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,519
because her room smelled like
a stable.

351
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:51,599
And she must've cried the whole day
because her eyes were all swollen.

352
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,200
She looked miserable.

353
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:58,970
If you're done talking,
please excuse me.

354
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,440
I told her to do it.

355
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,339
She's the one who started it,

356
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:06,140
but I'm the one
who made her keep doing it.

357
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,180
She wanted to tell you the truth
even if it'd put her life at risk.

358
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:16,019
I'm the one who stopped her,
saying I will make you a president.

359
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,119
Why did you do that?

360
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,690
That was the only way...

361
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:28,029
I could meet Dae Ju.

362
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,730
If she never started
in the first place,

363
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,339
she wouldn't have had to
let you use her.

364
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:35,410
She did all that
because she liked you so much.

365
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,140
I understand that you're angry,

366
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,279
and it's your decision
whether you forgive her or fire her.

367
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,319
But I think you should know
this one thing.

368
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,549
When you confessed
your feelings to her,

369
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,390
she was so happy.

370
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:57,029
She said she even felt sick.

371
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:00,200
Because her heart pounded so much.

372
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,799
She said she got her arm injured,

373
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,299
but felt like she had
her heart injured.

374
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,460
You said you quit. Why do you keep
coming to the office?

375
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,970
I forgot to tell Secretary Lee
about it.

376
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,299
I have to tell her
before my resignation gets accepted.

377
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,609
She doesn't seem to be
in a good mood these days.

378
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:51,150
Remember the file I've found
from your room?

379
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,049
It bothered me that
it had your name on it,

380
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,819
so I couldn't ask anyone yet.

381
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,589
If you don't mind,

382
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:00,720
I would like to send it
to the audit department.

383
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,089
Okay.

384
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,630
Send me the file too.
I will have a look.

385
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Okay.

386
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:11,569
About Secretary Jeong...

387
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,670
You're not cutting her off
for good, are you?

388
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,440
Why would I see her again?

389
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,410
You can't see people's faces.

390
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,480
How will you prepare
for the board meeting?

391
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,809
I can do it by myself.

392
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,250
Min Ik.

393
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,589
I saw it.

394
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:31,920
Saw what?

395
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:35,390
I have less than an hour left...

396
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,029
until the time we promised
to spend together is over.

397
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,559
Her face when she said she'd like
to be with you for just one hour.

398
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's something
I can never get again.

399
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,410
And this isn't how
I want to spend the time left.

400
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:55,009
Do you like Min Ik that much?

401
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:58,519
Her face when she said she'd like
to be your secretary at least.

402
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,079
I want to protect him.

403
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,490
If I can't be his woman,

404
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,220
I want to be at least his secretary.

405
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:10,130
Perhaps, Secretary Jeong
has been telling you that...

406
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:12,599
that she wants
to tell you the truth...

407
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,799
and that she likes you.

408
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,869
But you failed see her message.

409
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,369
I should go home.

410
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,140
You're nagging a lot.

411
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,740
That's what it is like
to like someone.

412
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,250
Even if that person you like
let you down or hurt you once,

413
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,619
you can still forgive that person.

414
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,059
Forgive her.

415
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,589
Just like she gave you
another chance...

416
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,759
when you fired her.

417
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,339
I'm home.

418
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,710
How can you lead a company when
you can't even win a woman's heart?

419
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:06,349
I met Chairwoman Park today and
I couldn't believe what she said.

420
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,720
Do you know whom Veronica is seeing?

421
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,160
Don't bother Dae Ju because of that.

422
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:13,890
Please.

423
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:17,829
How could you let someone like him
steal your woman?

424
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,230
Mom.

425
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:25,240
I can't eat peanuts.

426
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:26,440
What?

427
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,940
I'm deadly allergic to peanuts.

428
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,670
You seemed to not know that
when we had lunch that day.

429
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,680
Why are you suddenly
talking about peanuts?

430
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,849
If it was so important,
you should have told me.

431
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:38,180
I did.

432
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,250
I passed out at the school picnic
when I was in elementary school...

433
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,390
because of that.

434
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,990
Dae Ju took me to the emergency room
when I was in high school...

435
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,289
because of that too.

436
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,630
Last year, when we had
a new housekeeper,

437
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,789
Secretary Jeong had to run
to our place with medicine.

438
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,000
It was all because of peanuts.

439
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:56,500
And every time it happened,

440
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:00,339
I told you about it.

441
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:04,170
Are you lecturing me
to become a better mother?

442
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,210
No.

443
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:08,109
You don't need to care about it,
as always.

444
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,450
Luckily, I have people around me
who take care of me...

445
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,849
and kept me alive.

446
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:14,880
But...

447
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,019
you're the one who always said...

448
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,859
if you're going to fake it,
fake it well.

449
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,359
It's okay for you
to not know my birthday.

450
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,500
But I think you should
at least know this.

451
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,029
I'm sorry I let you down.

452
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,740
Still,

453
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,779
I love you, Mom, as always.

454
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,230
I know you hate me,

455
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,200
but please take this
before you go to bed.

456
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,460
How can I forgive her when she
isn't even sending me one text,

457
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,660
saying that she's sorry?

458
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:45,279
I will cut it now.

459
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,819
It seems like people do this
when someone gets their arm injured.

460
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:05,329
- Wait, no.
- What?

461
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,930
I don't want to cut it.

462
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,230
This can't be cut no matter what.

463
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:13,869
Could you please cut down this part?

464
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,099
Sure.

465
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,019
Director Do...

466
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,519
He must be here
for the regular checkup.

467
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,720
Is he skipping his meals?

468
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,319
Why does he look so skinny?

469
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,660
The board meeting is tomorrow.

470
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,400
I wonder if he'll be able
to handle it by himself.

471
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,869
I'm sorry.

472
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:24,940
I'm sorry, Director Do.

473
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:46,430
First, you should eat
something really expensive.

474
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,740
Okay. Let's give it a try.

475
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,500
Hi, do you want to play with me?

476
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,869
You don't want to play
with me either, do you?

477
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,179
I'm such a horrible person,
aren't I?

478
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,150
What do you think I should do?

479
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,090
You don't know?

480
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,130
Do you think I can see
Director Do again?

481
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,099
Really? I can see him again?

482
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,780
Sir, I would like to buy that.

483
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,449
Here I come

484
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:14,550
Here I come

485
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,289
The beggar from last year
came back alive

486
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,659
There's an old saying that goes...

487
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:25,460
This is really funny.

488
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,530
Have some respect, you punk!

489
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
You...

490
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,550
Darn it.

491
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,190
Is this Pennsylvania?

492
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,329
I was sorry.

493
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,269
What?

494
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,440
You said I was the only one
who can change our social class...

495
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,469
and you had high hopes on me.

496
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:12,980
I couldn't say I got rejected.

497
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,280
That's your excuse?

498
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,650
I tried to tell you the truth,

499
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,449
but as time passed, I got scared.

500
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,219
I was afraid
you wouldn't forgive me.

501
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,559
You...

502
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,760
Who do you think is the person
that loves you the most?

503
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,699
I might not be the one
you love the most,

504
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,769
but your brother and I
love you the most.

505
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,139
Hiding is worse than lying.

506
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,880
Our family is just us three.

507
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,309
It's not like we will not see
each other for life.

508
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,820
Even if you were scared,
you should have come talked to me.

509
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,489
You can't just hide like this...

510
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,030
Nam Hee.

511
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,900
Could you say what I just said?

512
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,170
What?

513
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,730
Could you reiterate
what I just said to you?

514
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,869
Hiding is worse than lying.

515
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,539
I'm the person
that loves you the most.

516
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:23,849
It's not like we will not see
each other for life.

517
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:25,510
Right.

518
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:30,889
I shouldn't be hiding.

519
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:36,889
Even if I'm scared, I shouldn't
do this to someone who liked me.

520
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:42,030
And tomorrow is the most
important day in his life.

521
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:45,670
What are you talking about?

522
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,139
I'm sorry
I'm such a horrible sister.

523
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,510
I think I need to go
to the office now.

524
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,650
You pack everything
and come back home tomorrow.

525
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,949
Gal Hee.

526
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,349
Gal Hee!

527
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,030
House deed, submitted.

528
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,099
The quarterly report...

529
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,800
and stock report.

530
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:23,170
Should I contact the directors
in advance?

531
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,579
Sir.

532
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,519
It's me, Secretary Jeong.

533
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,559
Do you...

534
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:49,369
not know what "fired" means?

535
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:55,239
I know.

536
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:59,380
But I have something
I must tell you.

537
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,639
Three minutes...

538
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:06,349
No. Could you give me
just one minute to say it?

539
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
I want you to leave.

540
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,219
I have nothing to hear from you.

541
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,489
Then while you brew the coffee,

542
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,230
please hear me out.

543
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,869
At first,

544
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:04,610
I just wanted to sit on the chair
you pulled out for me.

545
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,210
You probably don't understand this,

546
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:12,920
but I have always been pulling out
chairs for others,

547
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,559
and I wanted to sit on a chair
that someone pulled out for me.

548
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:27,159
Although I think,
it wasn't just about the chair.

549
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,369
Because I was happy.

550
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,179
Being a woman to you made me happy.

551
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,710
The woman you loved...

552
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,019
was the fake me
and not the real me.

553
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,429
But you still loved me anyway.

554
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,469
I couldn't stop because those
moments made me so happy.

555
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,340
I'm sorry.

556
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
Are you done?

557
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:26,659
I know what I did was inexcusable...

558
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:28,659
and that you hate me.

559
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,860
What are you trying to say?

560
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,260
Tomorrow is...

561
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,670
the most important day in your life.

562
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:42,000
You have been working hard
for that one day.

563
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:48,780
As long as I don't put on
that cardigan,

564
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,820
you won't have to see my face,
the face you hate to see.

565
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:57,849
So could you just think I'm some
other secretary and let me help?

566
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:00,619
I won't ask you to
treat me as a woman.

567
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:02,960
I won't treat you as a man.

568
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,699
I just want to see you
winning the president position.

569
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:10,929
Then I will leave.

570
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,369
So please let me
be your secretary...

571
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,980
until tomorrow.

572
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:27,880
Do you remember I said...

573
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,719
that I will never be able
to trust anyone...

574
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,889
if you lie to me?

575
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,260
You should go.

576
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,429
You don't belong here anymore.

577
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,139
Then I'll be waiting outside.

578
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,869
Just call me
whenever you need anything.

579
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:10,260
Isn't it a bit too hot
to burn firewood in June?

580
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:15,530
It's kind of like
the Sunshine Policy.

581
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:18,599
Why did you do that?

582
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:22,909
Because that policy...

583
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,579
ended up making you
take your coat off.

584
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:27,739
I'm talking about Secretary Jeong.

585
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,949
I guess we won't be spending
a hot evening tonight.

586
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:34,920
You knew everything.

587
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,250
That's why you kept saying
we were in a love triangle...

588
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,619
when you had never even met
Min Ik before.

589
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:41,090
Yes, you're right.

590
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:44,929
It's true that I told her
to lie to him.

591
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,500
Brace yourself.

592
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,969
Tonight's going to be
a very harsh night.

593
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,739
Who is she?

594
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,050
I'm embarrassed to say this,
but she's my mother.

595
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,280
Hello, ma'am.

596
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,119
So you're telling me
that you canceled...

597
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,360
your wedding with Director Do...

598
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,889
because of this
cunning little guy...

599
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,800
named Gi Dae Ju
or whatever his name is?

600
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,860
Mother!

601
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:24,599
Let's be reasonable here
and not mess with a man's back.

602
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,699
I can bear with having scoliosis...

603
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,710
or a herniated disk.

604
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,409
But if you ever end up...

605
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,579
hurting this man's back,

606
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:41,019
I assure you
that I won't stand still.

607
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:42,280
What's wrong with you?

608
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,789
How could such a delicate
and soft woman like her...

609
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:46,389
do anything to hurt me?

610
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,630
Okay, then.
What does your father do?

611
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,730
Mother.

612
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,730
I already checked his background.

613
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,969
And you won't be satisfied...

614
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:03,869
with the answers
you're about to get.

615
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,840
You lied...

616
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,949
to both families and said
you were dating Do Min Ik...

617
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:14,349
as if you had two bodies.

618
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:18,320
But you ended up choosing a guy
whom I won't even be satisfied with?

619
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,619
Ma'am, I know I might seem
very lacking to you. But...

620
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:24,659
I'll give you exactly one month.

621
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,130
During that month, you can enjoy...

622
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,599
your passionate love with him
just like that firewood.

623
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,710
But let's marry someone
who fit each other's levels.

624
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,239
During that time,
I'll do whatever I can...

625
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:42,610
to convince Chief Director Sim
to change her mind.

626
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:58,630
I ended up showing you the ugly side
of a conglomerate family.

627
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,099
I guess it was because of me.

628
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,199
I'm the reason why you made
Secretary Jeong lie.

629
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:07,239
I'll do everything I can
to satisfy your mother.

630
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,710
Forget about satisfying my mother.

631
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,539
From now on, I want you to
focus on satisfying me.

632
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,679
After all, I have...

633
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:21,579
very high hopes for you, Dae Ju.

634
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:22,650
What do you mean?

635
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,590
I'm hoping you'll become...

636
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,130
a certain type of guy.

637
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,389
What type of guy?

638
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,530
A competent guy?

639
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,369
Then...

640
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,070
a diligent guy?

641
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,340
A wild guy.

642
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,519
You've shown me your capability...

643
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,949
at the movie premiere
the other night.

644
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,050
What do you say?

645
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:02,690
Would you like to show me more of
what you're capable of tonight?

646
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,829
Is that Secretary Jeong?

647
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,130
I told her to leave.
Why is she still there?

648
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,639
Hey, Director Kim.

649
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,449
Okay, I'll be right there.

650
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,460
Okay.

651
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,989
Don't worry too much.
I'll see you at the board meeting.

652
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,000
Okay, I look forward
to your support.

653
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,429
According to our research,
it's 3 against 3.

654
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,500
What about Director Kwak
and Director Yang?

655
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,559
They both haven't said anything.

656
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,670
I think they'll decide tomorrow.

657
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:55,170
But I really have no idea
what Director Gi is thinking.

658
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:58,739
President Sim, did you hear?

659
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,210
Director Park from Cinepark
just told me something.

660
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,679
Apparently, President Park already
signed for the exclusive rights.

661
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:06,820
What? What did you say?

662
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:10,250
Then why didn't Director Gi
say anything to President Sim?

663
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,920
Do... Do you think he gave it
to Director Do?

664
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:17,889
Darn it.

665
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,099
Wait...

666
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,130
That's why he handed in
a resignation letter?

667
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,039
There's no way
I'm going to file his resignation.

668
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,469
I'll frame him for leaking
confidential information...

669
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:29,670
or embezzlement,

670
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,309
and make the company
take disciplinary action on him...

671
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:34,179
so that he'll never be able to
get a job in this business again.

672
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,400
If he got the contract,
it should be here somewhere.

673
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:00,800
(Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just.)

674
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,840
What's this?

675
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:10,550
"Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just"?

676
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:13,719
Yes, President Sim.

677
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,650
I'm actually looking at the file
that I got from Director Do.

678
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,420
It turns out that someone
embezzled the company's money.

679
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,460
Who? Min Ik?

680
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,829
- No, Lee Eul Wang.
- Who's Lee Eul Wang?

681
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:27,159
Director Gi's secretary.

682
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,260
But what's interesting is...

683
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,429
she used the money to make
a waiting room for the drivers...

684
00:50:32,769 --> 00:50:34,539
and handle industrial accidents.

685
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:39,039
And it seems like a few other
secretaries were involved in this.

686
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,940
All I want is to catch a big fish.
I don't need a small fry.

687
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,849
See if Director Do received
any illegal money.

688
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:47,650
And investigate
all the associated secretaries...

689
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,849
so I can fire them all.

690
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,030
I'm Lee Eul Wang.

691
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,929
So you're the one...

692
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:06,130
who instigated everyone to steal.

693
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,840
I never instigated anyone.

694
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,539
I did everything on my own.

695
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:12,139
I already know...

696
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,010
that there are more people involved.

697
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:20,480
You can fire me or kill me.
Do whatever you want.

698
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,079
But the others didn't know
what they were doing.

699
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,690
They're just victims who were forced
to do what they were told.

700
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,960
I'm sorry.

701
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:33,090
Fishing isn't about
letting the fish go free.

702
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:35,659
It's all about catching fish...

703
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,800
and killing them whether it's
a big fish or a small fry.

704
00:51:40,469 --> 00:51:41,670
Watch carefully...

705
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,969
and see how your lives
will turn out.

706
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:51,409
You won't gain anything
from trying to stop me.

707
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,010
Then...

708
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,179
how about I catch you a big fish?

709
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,719
What?

710
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:02,320
If I catch a big fish for you
so you can become the president,

711
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,030
will you let the others go free?

712
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:07,800
How can you do something
that even I can't?

713
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,329
"Anyone who is suffering from
a mental or physical disorder..."

714
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:12,570
"and isn't capable of
performing their duty..."

715
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,670
"cannot be elected as president."

716
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:16,969
Director Do...

717
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,909
is currently suffering
from a severe illness.

718
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,480
Min Ik?

719
00:52:25,449 --> 00:52:26,679
What's his illness?

720
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:28,079
I want you to promise...

721
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,679
that you'll only fire me...

722
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,889
and won't do anything to the others.

723
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:40,400
Of course you should see it
before making any decision.

724
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,159
Okay.

725
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,599
I'll see you tomorrow,
Director Yang.

726
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,269
Bye.

727
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:53,909
I'll be doomed if I don't recognize
the directors' faces tomorrow.

728
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:59,480
I've been trying to memorize
it though. Where's my note?

729
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,329
Is it in the office?

730
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:13,050
She didn't even pack her stuff.

731
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,190
She should've taken this.

732
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:24,929
Right.

733
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,670
She won't even wear it
unless it's for me.

734
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:58,099
(I'm so sorry, Director Do. I didn't
mean to lie to you from the start.)

735
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:00,099
Perhaps,

736
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,840
Secretary Jeong has
been telling you...

737
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,309
that she wants
to tell you the truth...

738
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:07,579
and that she likes you.

739
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:09,679
She said she even felt sick.

740
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:12,010
Because her heart pounded so much.

741
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,480
She said she got her arm injured,

742
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,550
but felt like she had
her heart injured.

743
00:55:17,889 --> 00:55:21,119
Just call me
whenever you need anything.

744
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,719
Did she leave or not?

745
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,820
She's so annoying.

746
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,480
Director Do.

747
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,550
It's me, Secretary Jeong.

748
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,659
Do you need anything?

749
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:32,929
Well...

750
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,130
Where's my note?

751
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:39,099
- What note?
- You know...

752
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:43,070
the note I wrote about
the directors' faces in.

753
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:46,880
You left it in the office
the other day,

754
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,309
so I put it in the second drawer
of my desk.

755
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:53,750
Okay.

756
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:01,360
Do you want me to find it?

757
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,760
Or I could get you some snack.

758
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,400
If you're tired,
I can drive you home.

759
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:22,480
If you keep
being like this all night,

760
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:26,510
do you think I'll feel
sorry for you or something?

761
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,619
No.

762
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:31,690
I was...

763
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,360
just wondering if you would need
some urgent help like now.

764
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,500
Are you sure you just need one day?

765
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,309
Pardon me?

766
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,940
After working
as my secretary until tomorrow,

767
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,510
will you really leave
with no regrets?

768
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:00,949
Yes. If you let me do that...

769
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:07,119
I...

770
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:09,719
still hate you.

771
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,260
I'm still upset about
what you've done to me.

772
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:20,440
But there's no one
I can recognize...

773
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:25,610
without your help.

774
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:46,190
So...

775
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,599
tomorrow,

776
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,010
put this on...

777
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:03,440
and come to work.

778
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,050
Okay.

779
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:47,059
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

780
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:50,219
Do you think I deserve
to be the president of this company?

781
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,460
Do you know who made your mom die?

782
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,329
You should've told me.

783
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:57,030
You want me to save your life
after doing all this?

784
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:00,400
I can tell if you have any problem.

785
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,400
So just send me a signal.

786
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,469
Who's Director Park among them?
