1
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,649
She should've just come with me.

2
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:48,549
Public transportations will
soon stop running.

3
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,229
Mom.

4
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,769
You know...

5
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,170
that I didn't deceive him
on purpose, right?

6
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,209
Of course I do.

7
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:20,849
If I was alive,

8
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,620
I would have poured you
a glass of soju...

9
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,159
and played the tambourine
in a karaoke for you.

10
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,400
Your mom died too early
to do all that.

11
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,629
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:39,599
I'm making you worry
even after your death.

13
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,739
Worrying is what mothers do.

14
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:43,810
We worry about our children
even after we die.

15
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,750
By the way...

16
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,920
Maybe I'm actually
a very bad person.

17
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,189
I didn't mean to deceive him,

18
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,200
but maybe I did it on purpose.

19
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,169
What does that mean?

20
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,370
Actually,

21
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:16,879
I kind of enjoyed it.

22
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,180
I liked that he shared
his umbrella with me...

23
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,090
and I liked how he pursued me.

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,020
I knew...

25
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,060
he did all that...

26
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,400
not to Jeong Gal Hee, his minion,

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,300
but to Veronica Park,
the heir of Park Group.

28
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,169
Still, I liked it.

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,210
It may seem like little things,

30
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,520
but I would never be able to
receive such treatment...

31
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,090
for the rest of my life...

32
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:05,259
if I were just Secretary Jeong.

33
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,860
You should go home now.

34
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,199
You might catch a cold.

35
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,419
On the day of the incident,

36
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,689
you said you met your secretary...

37
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,629
and your secretary said...

38
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,560
she visited her mother
who was an hour away.

39
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,159
When did you meet her?

40
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,770
We got a very interesting...

41
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,669
CCTV footage.

42
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,439
Here you go.

43
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,879
Hwangcheon Villa. 12:10am.

44
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,680
17 minutes ago. Han River.

45
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,810
Secretary Lee Eul Wang was caught
on CCTV...

46
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,680
going to her mother's place.

47
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,250
And we even have
the security guard's testimony...

48
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,849
who claims to have witnessed her.

49
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,490
How could you have possibly met her?

50
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,719
I didn't say I met her.

51
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,460
I said I went to meet her.

52
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,430
When I talked to her on the phone,
Eul Wang's voice...

53
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:20,730
So you call her by her name?

54
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,129
Do I need to tell you
about her personal matters too?

55
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,769
Please, go ahead.

56
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,670
Yes, Secretary Lee.

57
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,180
- Secretary Lee?
- Turn left in 200m...

58
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,350
- at Hwangcheon Intersection.
- Secretary Lee?

59
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,649
It seemed like
there had been an accident.

60
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,819
She won't answer her phone,
so I was worried about her.

61
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,259
I took a taxi immediately
and went to Hwangcheon Intersection.

62
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,560
But when I was there...

63
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,129
Your secretary wasn't there, right?

64
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:53,670
- That's right.
- Oh, no. What a bummer.

65
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,730
We already checked
all the CCTV footages you were in.

66
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,170
From 9pm forward,

67
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,769
on the road from Seoul
to Hwangcheon Intersection,

68
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,379
not even a single taxi was caught
on the CCTV footages.

69
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,180
I guess that's possible.

70
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,449
The taxi driver took the wrong way.

71
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:13,279
I think it was called Owol-ri?

72
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,689
We went to Hwangcheon Intersection
from there.

73
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,560
Owol-ri?

74
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
There's actually another exit
before that.

75
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,430
You checked
all the CCTV footages, right?

76
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,930
From what I know,
there aren't CCTVs there...

77
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,230
because there's so little traffic.

78
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,199
I might not have given you
the answer you wanted,

79
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,269
but I believe I gave you
my honest answers.

80
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,740
May I go now?

81
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,019
Isn't it weird?

82
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,860
Usually, when something happens
to a boss,

83
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,319
his secretary looks for him.

84
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,629
But he insists something happened
to his secretary,

85
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,259
and he went to find her
in the middle of the night?

86
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,959
Traveling over an hour?

87
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,529
(President Sim Hae Yong)

88
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,160
I almost forgot after a few nights
of stay in the suite room.

89
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,389
Right.

90
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,759
This is where I belong.

91
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:02,759
(Employment Contract)

92
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,870
"The contract is terminated
whenever the employee wants."

93
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,779
It has always been my dream...

94
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
to sign a contract like this.

95
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,319
He should be meeting her...

96
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,689
by now.

97
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,540
What?

98
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,709
He hasn't reached me yet.

99
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,649
I might be late!

100
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,199
(Employment Contract)

101
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,509
She's coming. She's coming!

102
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,949
The heroine is back in the office
after two weeks.

103
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,110
She's going to be only successful
as the president's secretary.

104
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,980
TnT Mobile's rising sun.

105
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,519
Jeong Gal Hee!

106
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,259
But why does the heroine
look so terrible?

107
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,759
She's not a rising sun.
She looks somewhat pale.

108
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,169
(Director Do Min Ik)

109
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,350
Hello, sir.

110
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,120
You're late.

111
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,090
I believe you want to talk to me.

112
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,259
Yes, I do.

113
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,500
Where should we start?

114
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:34,350
Yesterday,

115
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,419
when I went to the restaurant...

116
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:44,720
Min Ik, what took you so long?

117
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,330
She was already gone.

118
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,460
So you failed to meet her?

119
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,600
She just left, saying she needs to
take care of something.

120
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,269
She said she would call you.

121
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:57,340
That must be her. Answer it.

122
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,669
Okay.

123
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,669
Hello.

124
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,179
Did you meet her?

125
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,649
The story is just about to
get interesting.

126
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:22,990
Hey, you're here.

127
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,259
Wait a minute.

128
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,929
Why was Dr. Gu there?

129
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,299
Why did you meet Dr. Gu
all of a sudden?

130
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,840
Seeing you all agitated...

131
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,679
is making me want to modify
the story to my advantage.

132
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,009
Can you please
just get to the point?

133
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,919
I need to go somewhere.

134
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:48,220
Think of it as a commercial break...

135
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:51,019
and wait for the rest of the story
with a blanket.

136
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,259
There's a huge twist to the story,

137
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,759
so it'll require a little courage
to listen to it.

138
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,340
Did he meet her or not?

139
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,980
I'm sure he didn't meet her.

140
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,379
If he did meet her, he wouldn't
keep beating around the bush...

141
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,379
because he would have
so many questions to ask.

142
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,789
Actually, no. He must've met her.

143
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,259
That's probably why he mentioned
that there's a twist.

144
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,669
What other twist would there be
to this story?

145
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,340
Do you have it? Where is it?

146
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,179
Is this it?

147
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,649
Gosh, I should've listened
to Dr. Park.

148
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,190
But I got drunk and ended up
telling you something unnecessary.

149
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,659
How can you call that unnecessary?

150
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,289
If my blood pressure goes up,

151
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,429
I'm able to see people's faces.

152
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,460
That's the biggest twist
I've ever heard...

153
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,029
during my days
as a prosopagnosia patient.

154
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,529
If your blood pressure goes up,
it temporarily supplies blood...

155
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,600
to your cerebral gyrus,
which helps with your blood flow.

156
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,370
Therefore, I only meant
that there's a high possibility.

157
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,940
But it's not guaranteed.

158
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,970
That's why I'm going to try.

159
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,740
From now on,
apart from when I'm asleep...

160
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,450
No, actually, even when I'm asleep,

161
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,149
I'm going to focus my energy
on increasing my blood pressure.

162
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,779
Your blood pressure isn't
some kind of a report card.

163
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,990
- You can't increase it by trying.
- What?

164
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,320
On top of that, you've never
even seen people's faces...

165
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,519
ever since the accident.

166
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,559
You're wrong.

167
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,200
I actually did.

168
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,500
You did?

169
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,669
During the stockholders' meeting,

170
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,580
I could suddenly see people's faces
very clearly...

171
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:55,279
as if I was focusing a camera
on them.

172
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,779
- And...
- And?

173
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,120
And...

174
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,460
I wonder...

175
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,029
if I actually saw her face that day.

176
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,330
I can see.

177
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,399
When? What were you doing?

178
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,830
Well, I didn't intend on it.

179
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,000
But I was doing this.

180
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,700
I was...

181
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,080
holding a woman like this.

182
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,179
- She must be the woman you like.
- What?

183
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,409
The prosopagnosia patient
that Dr. Park treated...

184
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,750
also could see properly...

185
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,519
when he met the woman he loved.

186
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,620
Let me explain.

187
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,190
When you're with someone you love,
your heart rate increases.

188
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,559
And when that happens, your blood
pressure naturally goes up as well.

189
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,299
I don't love her.

190
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,870
I'm sure it was just a dream.
It was a dream.

191
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,539
Where's the medicine?
Didn't you bring it?

192
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,279
It's too dangerous to take medicine.

193
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,379
If you want to increase the blood
pressure that flows to your brain,

194
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,919
you either need to take
a cardiac stimulant...

195
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,450
or get 3 to 4 liters of IV
injected into your body.

196
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,590
But if you do that, you might
experience side effects...

197
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,320
such as chest pains, headaches,
or heart failure.

198
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,600
What's this?

199
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,740
These are medical
compression stockings.

200
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,169
They're worn by patients
with spinal injury...

201
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,870
when they show signs
of orthostatic hypotension.

202
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,039
Are you telling me to wear this?

203
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,080
You told me to bring everything that
helps increasing blood pressure.

204
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,149
Everything!

205
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:39,450
Here. It's what you asked for.

206
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,090
I wrote every kind of situation that
could increase your blood pressure.

207
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,120
And this is...

208
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:45,190
a portable manometer.

209
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,100
By the way, who is it
that you want to see so badly...

210
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,700
by trying this hard?

211
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,840
There's someone I must see.

212
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,710
The moment my blood pressure
goes up,

213
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,279
I'm going to remember where I am...

214
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:08,879
and what I did,

215
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,649
and I'm going to meet that woman.

216
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,450
I just want to see her face...

217
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,490
for at least a couple of seconds.

218
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,929
Did I tell you this?

219
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,110
I'm a jerk worse than you think.

220
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,879
I forgot to tell you this, Dae Ju.

221
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:43,279
I'm the crazy wench
who catches jerks.

222
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,919
What brings you here?

223
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:50,919
What brings you here?

224
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,889
She and I are really close.

225
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,889
You should've called
before you came.

226
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,529
Why is it so loud outside?

227
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,559
You can't just enter like this...

228
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,330
I'm sorry.

229
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,539
But she kept causing a fuss
saying she's very close with you.

230
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,009
You have a nice office.

231
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,340
I found out that you, old lady...

232
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,679
I mean, I found out...

233
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,850
that you're a very famous person.

234
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,850
Hey, even the best movie directors
in the country...

235
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,820
bow their heads
as they enter my office...

236
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,559
because they're scared of me.

237
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,289
How dare you come in here
looking so confident?

238
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,169
What? Do you think I'll get angry?

239
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,710
I can just buy another one.

240
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,009
Really?

241
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,149
You're still fine, right?

242
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,850
Do you think I can't afford two?

243
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,220
Secretary Kim!

244
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,429
I want you to order
the exact same ones.

245
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,289
Right now!

246
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,660
Yes, President Park.

247
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,700
What should I do?
Should I kick her out?

248
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,069
No, leave her here.

249
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,539
If she does anything, I'll at least
be able to get angry at her.

250
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,769
Okay, President Park.

251
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,279
I came to ask you something.

252
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,549
What do I need to do
to become a star?

253
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,920
You don't even know
how to cut an onion.

254
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,589
But you want
the secret pasta recipe?

255
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,529
Isn't that all you do?

256
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,029
Awesome.

257
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,900
Did you live in New York?

258
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,400
You have an East Coast accent.

259
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,569
I took internet lectures.

260
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,579
I was always the top
or second top student in school.

261
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,339
But unfortunately,

262
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,480
I didn't get accepted to
the University of Pennsylvania.

263
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,410
What?

264
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,279
Then why don't just do
what you're good at...

265
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,789
instead of causing a fuss trying
to do something you're bad at?

266
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,519
There's no other way to increase
one's social status in Korea...

267
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,160
other than becoming a star.

268
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,630
Even if I succeed by studying hard,

269
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,799
I'll only end up slaving away
for conglomerates like you.

270
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,430
Can't you see...

271
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,740
that I'm the one slaving away
because of you?

272
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,539
I'm going to become a star
no matter what.

273
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:29,279
And when I do, I'm going to make
every single person...

274
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,319
that looked down
and harassed my sister...

275
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,450
get down on their knees...

276
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,650
in front of her.

277
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,019
It's a revenge?

278
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,660
I'm starting to get interested
since this is about getting revenge.

279
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,299
But before we do anything,

280
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,579
why don't you sit here
and use that thirst for revenge...

281
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,279
on writing this?

282
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,049
Think about every single person
who harassed...

283
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,750
your older sister.

284
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,849
Use your anger,
resentment, and frustration...

285
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:14,319
to your full capacity.

286
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:19,430
(Certification of Contents)

287
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,569
Secretary Jeong.

288
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,880
What? Where did she go?

289
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,210
I told her to wait.

290
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,349
(Director, Do Min Ik)

291
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,289
Did she sign the contract already?

292
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,190
This contract must've been
extremely marvelous to her...

293
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,630
seeing that she signed it already.

294
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,460
(I'm sorry)

295
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,700
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,369
You're here, Director Do.

297
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,049
"I'm sorry"?

298
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,990
Does this mean...

299
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,819
you're no longer
going to work with me?

300
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,789
Shouldn't that be right?

301
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Why?

302
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,400
Did someone say
they would pay you more than I do?

303
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,140
- What?
- Or...

304
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,309
is it because I'm a nuisance?

305
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,210
Well... It's...

306
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,109
He didn't see her.
I'm sure he didn't.

307
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:48,390
That's why he doesn't know
why I should quit.

308
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,890
Jeong Gal Hee, it's time.

309
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,559
Do it now.

310
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,589
You have to tell him the truth now.

311
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,630
Why? You can't bring yourself
to tell me the truth?

312
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,269
- No.
- No?

313
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:05,299
- What?
- No?

314
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,869
Fine.

315
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,279
I know I'm bad.

316
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,380
I'm really bad.

317
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,819
And I'm ill.

318
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,890
I understand your boss
is a nuisance to you.

319
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,890
We're a boss and a secretary.

320
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:31,859
An employer and an employee.

321
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,599
To tell the truth, that's...

322
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,569
what we are after all.

323
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,269
If you don't like your employer,

324
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,769
you should leave.

325
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:46,579
Secretary Jeong.

326
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,910
You're much wiser of a woman...

327
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,150
than I thought.

328
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,299
(I'm sorry.)

329
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,170
I bet you remember the day
we came here together.

330
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,380
I clearly remember it.

331
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,980
You said if I help you get rid
of Min Ik at the board meeting,

332
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:24,980
you will merge the media divisions
and give it to me.

333
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,559
But why would a player...

334
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,789
break his promise with his coach?

335
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,859
It wasn't a promise,

336
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,200
but an offer.

337
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,539
I didn't say I'd do it.

338
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,339
Who are you?

339
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,339
Between me and Do Min Ik,
which one do you work for?

340
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,250
Do I...

341
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,319
have to work for someone?

342
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,289
You're right.

343
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,829
You should have the guts to play
independently to be a better player.

344
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,069
Director Park wants
to switch players immediately,

345
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,269
but I don't share that opinion.

346
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,869
You just scored
an own goal by mistake,

347
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,880
but you're still a good striker.

348
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,150
Veronica Park is very thorough
about her work,

349
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,619
but she even risked her position
to support you.

350
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,549
Even though you scored an own goal,
I'm going to keep you in my team.

351
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,490
What do you mean?

352
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:42,029
Did Veronica Park
give up her position?

353
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,400
Running or cycling is effective
in increasing blood pressure.

354
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,400
When your blood pressure
is over 140,

355
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,910
the alarm goes off
from the manometer.

356
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,769
Your blood pressure is
considered high if it's 140 over 90.

357
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,460
Why?

358
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,089
You can't bring yourself
to tell me the truth?

359
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:16,529
No.

360
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:17,529
- No?
- What?

361
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:18,529
No?

362
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,529
No?

363
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,839
Does she think
I like being with her?

364
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,339
100?

365
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,640
I exercised so hard,
but it's only 100?

366
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,549
What should I do
to make it over 140?

367
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,190
"Drinking after exercise..."

368
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,359
"activates sympathetic nerves..."

369
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,490
"and raises blood pressure rapidly."

370
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,400
Drinking?

371
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,680
Why did I say no
right at that moment?

372
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:13,250
It would've been better
if he met her.

373
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:18,089
Why are things going so complicated?

374
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,690
Gosh, what's that?

375
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:26,700
What kind of man wears tights
to a place like this?

376
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,869
Secretary Jeong?

377
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:43,109
One jokbal set and soju please.

378
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,119
If you're uncomfortable,
I can leave.

379
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,619
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable
to see me here again,

380
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,630
when you already hate seeing me
at work?

381
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,130
That's not what I meant.

382
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,359
If that's not it,
don't worry about me...

383
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,099
and drink your soju.

384
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,470
I just came here
for a single purpose.

385
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,970
To drink soju.

386
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,470
By the way, why are you
drinking soju?

387
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,240
You usually drink
a glass of champagne.

388
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:16,509
Well...

389
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:20,279
And the way you're dressed
is a little strange.

390
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,289
Did they take my order or not?

391
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,019
Drink this first.

392
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,700
What is this? A manometer?

393
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:41,299
What are you doing?

394
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,470
Do you have
a blood pressure problem?

395
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,509
That's not it.

396
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,779
As soon as my disease is cured,

397
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,750
the contract between you and me...

398
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,559
will be terminated.

399
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:02,559
It means...

400
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:07,430
she will leave me as soon as
I become able to see people's faces.

401
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,730
It's not serious.

402
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:12,440
Dr. Gu told me to check
my blood pressure regularly.

403
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:15,539
I guess it's very serious then.

404
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,039
Is this the surprise you heard
from Dr. Gu yesterday?

405
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,950
If you guys are going to chat on,
you should share the table.

406
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,819
You two seem pretty close.

407
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,819
You're mistaken.

408
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:30,819
We're not close at all.

409
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,220
The thing is...

410
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,690
as of today,

411
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,329
we turned against each other.

412
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:15,670
I drank a lot. Gosh.

413
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,700
Is it broken?

414
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,269
I think you're the one
that's broken.

415
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,180
I am?

416
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,180
I'm not drunk.

417
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,180
Gosh.

418
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,109
Where's the kickstand?

419
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:32,279
No way.

420
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,349
I was right.

421
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:42,720
Secretary Jeong.

422
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:45,690
Call the police now.

423
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:47,259
Why?

424
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,829
You know why. Can't you see it?

425
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,930
Someone stole my bicycle handlebar.

426
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,440
Get off the bike.

427
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,710
Get off.

428
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,740
What?

429
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,160
I think you should hold me tightly.

430
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,900
You almost fell earlier.

431
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,329
I don't need to hold you tightly.

432
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,299
I'm all sobered up now.

433
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:33,339
So let's just keep going like this.

434
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,109
Then...

435
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,480
There's something
I couldn't tell you earlier.

436
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:42,509
I couldn't say it
while looking at your face.

437
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,619
I'll just say it now,
so please listen.

438
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,819
What is it?

439
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,220
Actually, I...

440
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,180
Are you okay?

441
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,089
Maybe I'm not sober yet.

442
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,220
My heart is racing...

443
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,160
and I have butterflies
in my stomach.

444
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,599
What's wrong with me?

445
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,309
Oh, my goodness.

446
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:57,390
Mother, are you attending
a meeting or something?

447
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:01,019
Yes, I am. Your wedding.

448
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,700
Mother.

449
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:11,730
I still don't know
that man very well.

450
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:14,400
You brat!

451
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:16,970
What do you mean by
you don't know that man?

452
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,779
One date should be enough
to get to know a person.

453
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,609
If you keep putting your spoon
in and out,

454
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,009
you will have no idea
if the soup is salty or bland!

455
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,150
Look at me.

456
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:34,559
You can't wear silk in summer
because it makes you sweat.

457
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,390
Before the flowers fall,

458
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,829
set the date!

459
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,440
This is driving me nuts.

460
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,140
It's Director Do.

461
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,390
I'll get going.

462
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,119
Have a good night.

463
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,529
Hey.

464
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,829
Didn't you say
you wanted to say something?

465
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:14,299
Oh, that.

466
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,140
I'll tell you when you're sober.

467
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,569
Good night.

468
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,119
Do you really have to leave?

469
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,660
Excuse me?

470
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,930
Can't you just...

471
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,460
stay with me?

472
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,170
Can't you do that?

473
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:59,579
You want me to stay with you?

474
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:07,720
Gosh.

475
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:13,389
I just had two bottles of soju,
and now I'm talking like a poet.

476
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,760
Now I'll talk professional,
so listen up.

477
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,099
Tell me what you want
and how much salary you want.

478
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,769
I'll take them into consideration.

479
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,000
So please reconsider
the contract renewal.

480
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:30,539
Until the president election,

481
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,380
I need someone
who can see faces for me.

482
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:44,050
Goodness.

483
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,460
Good night.

484
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,530
Who is it?

485
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,820
Hello.

486
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,389
I think I'm in front of
your place now.

487
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,019
Where?

488
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,030
The place is a little shabby.

489
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,539
So this is what "shabby" means.

490
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:39,079
This is amazing. I have only read
about shabby houses in books.

491
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,210
I have never seen one in real life.

492
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,409
You came all the way up here
in the middle of the night.

493
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,480
You must have something important
to talk about.

494
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:52,559
Let's break up.

495
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,690
Excuse me?

496
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,760
Let's end it.

497
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,500
The relationship
between your boss and me.

498
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,500
I would love to do that, but...

499
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,769
If I break up with him,

500
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,369
Ms. Park Seok Ja will kick my back
and bend my spine.

501
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,610
So tell your boss...

502
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,980
to tell Chief Director Sim Hae Ra
that he broke up with me.

503
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,480
I don't think he'll do that.

504
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:21,519
Why?

505
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,650
Because he likes you.

506
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:26,690
What?

507
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,099
I mean, his family thinks...

508
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:35,429
my boss likes you.

509
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,739
What a strange secretary you are.

510
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:44,110
Why do we have new scenarios
that weren't on our plan?

511
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,610
I'm sorry, ma'am.

512
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,309
I didn't know things would get
this complicated.

513
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,750
Then...

514
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,849
let's do this.

515
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,590
Let's tell them
that I'm seeing another man.

516
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,690
Another man?

517
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,860
Your boss loved me so much,

518
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,429
but I was already with another man.

519
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,230
If Chief Director Sim
finds out about this,

520
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:14,800
she'll be too proud...

521
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,610
to say the details to my mother.

522
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,309
A break up due to incompatible
personalities and busy schedules.

523
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,349
That would be a beautiful wrap.

524
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:29,349
What do you think of my scenario?

525
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,250
Ma'am,
it's not that kind of a problem.

526
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,719
Listen to me, Jeong Gal Hee.

527
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,860
In the scenario you wrote,
did Ms. Park Seok Ja...

528
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,789
buy a hanbok for wedding?

529
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,030
I think
we only have two options now.

530
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:44,969
Either we go with my scenario...

531
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,639
or your boss and I have a wedding.

532
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,139
"No."

533
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:58,409
"There should only be one person
by my boss."

534
00:37:58,909 --> 00:37:59,980
"It's Jeong Gal Hee."

535
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,989
"I'm the only person
he should be with."

536
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,920
Gosh, I was right again.

537
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,730
Let's fix this as soon as possible.

538
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:12,400
Otherwise, Ms. Park Seok Ja will...

539
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,300
start printing wedding invitations
next week.

540
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,280
Can't you just stay with me?

541
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,119
Can't you do that?

542
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,219
I would love to, but...

543
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:45,460
Then let's do this.

544
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,099
Let's tell them
that I'm seeing another man.

545
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:50,969
But...

546
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:53,539
I can't deceive him again.

547
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,250
I'll meet him and tell him
that I'm seeing someone else...

548
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,880
and that we should break up.

549
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,150
I just need to end it
once and for all.

550
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,849
Let's see.

551
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,190
(Boss)

552
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,400
(I have something to tell you.
Can we meet tomorrow?)

553
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,070
Press the button, Gal Hee.

554
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,539
If I end this crazy act,

555
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,239
I'll finally be able to go back
to my old life.

556
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:37,510
Gosh, if I do that,

557
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:42,420
I might not get to go on dates
with him,

558
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,420
but I'll still be able
to stay by his side...

559
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,119
as his secretary.

560
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,460
So please press the button.
Press it.

561
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,599
Gosh, I sent it!

562
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:59,269
I have something to tell you.

563
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:02,039
Can we meet tomorrow?

564
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:04,110
Tomorrow? Tomorrow?

565
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,780
Tomorrow? What should I do?

566
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,309
I haven't found a way to increase
my blood pressure yet.

567
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:18,389
I'll wear this bag.

568
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:21,389
And I'll wear these heels.

569
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,960
And as for earrings...

570
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:33,940
Oh, right. The copied file.

571
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,849
(ODG. xlsx)

572
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:52,150
This is an excel file.

573
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:55,260
Director Do never uses excel.

574
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,000
(Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just.)

575
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,599
"Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just."

576
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:05,429
Is that a typo?

577
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:08,369
It should be "Humans are unfair",
not "Humans is unfair".

578
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,480
How am I supposed to wear this?

579
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,960
- Hello.
- Hi.

580
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,900
What? What's this sound?

581
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,940
- You darn punk.
- Ma'am.

582
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,909
You're mistaken.

583
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,440
What you're seeing right now...

584
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,010
are for medical purposes.

585
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,420
If those stockings are
for medical purposes,

586
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,489
this right here is
for correctional purposes.

587
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,619
I should get rid of something
more disgusting...

588
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,719
before I clean the poop
in the bathroom.

589
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,190
Get out, you worthless
piece of poop.

590
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,230
Okay.

591
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,559
How could you think of doing this
at work?

592
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,199
And in broad daylight at that?

593
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,429
Get out. I said, get out.

594
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,599
- Okay.
- Get out of here.

595
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:48,940
- Ma'am, I'm a patient.
- You darn punk.

596
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,269
You're mistaken.

597
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:53,110
You look completely normal.
Do you have nothing better to do?

598
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,639
Ma'am, I'm telling you.
You're mistaken.

599
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,780
I saw everything
with my own two eyes.

600
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,289
Good morning.

601
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,690
You must be on your way...

602
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:11,559
to eat some gukbap,
just like you always do.

603
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,460
Oh, dear.

604
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,699
My gosh, what's he doing?

605
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,610
Director Do, let's go
to your office. Come on.

606
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,889
What did we just see?

607
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,260
Is this some kind of a strategy...

608
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,989
like the one he pulled
at the stockholders' meeting?

609
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,429
You should go without me.

610
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,739
"Medical compression stockings"?

611
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:07,280
"Relieves symptoms
due to varicose veins,"

612
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,590
"skin ulcers,
and deep vein thrombosis."

613
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,719
Is he sick again?

614
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,199
(Sangmo Hospital,
Department of Neurology)

615
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:25,670
"Sangmo Hospital,
Department of Neurology".

616
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:28,869
Bingo.

617
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,380
Excuse me.

618
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,449
I'm Director Do's secretary.

619
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,849
I'm sorry, but can you pass me...

620
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:47,420
Director Do's pants and shoes?

621
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,530
Just a second.

622
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,900
I barely managed to wear these,
but nothing's changed.

623
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:00,070
I have to see Veronica's face today.

624
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,909
Director Do, you're really weird
these days. Do you know that?

625
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,750
The company will be
electing the president soon.

626
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,750
Turn around.

627
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,550
My gosh.

628
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,519
Here are your pants.

629
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,059
If this is a personal hobby
of yours,

630
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,000
you should enjoy it at home.

631
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,469
This isn't a hobby.
They're for medical purposes!

632
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,369
They're not ordinary stockings.

633
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:33,369
They're compression stockings that
helps increase your blood pressure.

634
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,039
Is it that bad?

635
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:36,239
Turn around!

636
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:41,210
How am I supposed to take these off?

637
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,280
Well...

638
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,349
I can't take them off.

639
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,050
I'm sure you've had a lot
of experience taking them off.

640
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,920
I only dated women
who wore pants, okay?

641
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,929
What is this?

642
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,559
It won't work
if you take them off from the feet.

643
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,570
What?

644
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:06,739
You need to start from the waist
and roll them down.

645
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,510
- Roll them down?
- How should I say this?

646
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,469
It's like slipping out of your skin.

647
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,739
- Like slipping out of your skin.
- Gosh, that hurts.

648
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,349
Should I help you?

649
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:17,449
Turn around!

650
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,650
Don't look, and don't come near me!

651
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,679
Just stay there and talk, okay?

652
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:26,719
How are you going to take them off?

653
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,989
Wait.

654
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:31,989
Director Do.

655
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,699
Yes?

656
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,699
I think I found a way.

657
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,639
What?

658
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,610
Let's rip them.

659
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,320
Rip them?

660
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,179
Yes.

661
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,489
I'm not looking.

662
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,090
I have my back turned to you.

663
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,170
Excuse me for touching you.

664
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,869
What's wrong?

665
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:18,940
No, it's nothing.

666
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:20,739
Well...

667
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,079
I'm going to rip them now.

668
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:37,289
I'm okay.
You didn't need to drive me home.

669
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,530
You also have...

670
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,199
an appointment today.

671
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,599
I'm purposely driving you home...

672
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:46,940
before I go
to that important appointment.

673
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:50,340
So think again about the contract
I mentioned yesterday.

674
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,449
About the USB
I told you last time...

675
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:04,489
I actually found
a weird file inside.

676
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:08,059
Are you talking about
"Romi, the Licking Dog"...

677
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,690
and "super innocent Ah Yeong"?

678
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:14,300
It's not what you think.
It's not pornography.

679
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,429
There was a dog that looked really
similar to the dog we used to have,

680
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,329
so I was going to show it to Dae Ju.

681
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,840
It was an excel file.

682
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,139
And the content
was really weird too.

683
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:26,010
There were odd numbers on it
as if it was a ledger.

684
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,039
And it had a really weird title.

685
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,579
"Humans is unfair,
but the deities are just."

686
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,760
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

687
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:48,730
Yes. I'm fine.

688
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:51,900
It's folded.

689
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:55,570
It's okay. It's just a slight cut.

690
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:03,309
By the way, why is there
a file in my USB?

691
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,650
Maybe you got the wrong one.

692
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,579
The company handed them out
on the foundation day,

693
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:08,780
so there are a lot of them
that look the same.

694
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,690
I'm sure it was from your jacket
on the day of the accident.

695
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,260
Gosh, I told him it's confidential.

696
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,369
Then...

697
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,000
was the USB I picked up
in Dae Ju's office that day...

698
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,809
not mine, but Dae Ju's?

699
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,440
I copied the files into my USB
and put it in your drawer.

700
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,710
You should check it when you get
to your office tomorrow morning.

701
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:38,349
Okay.

702
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:43,949
I think there's something wrong
with the car. What should we do?

703
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:47,260
I should leave
the car with the mechanic.

704
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,130
We're almost there, right?

705
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,530
Well...

706
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,139
Director Do, you're...

707
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,170
not the kind of person
who would cling to a woman, right?

708
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:06,510
There's only one thing I cling to.

709
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:08,210
A chin-up bar.

710
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:15,550
That means you're not so hurt
when a woman...

711
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,750
breaks up with you, right?

712
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:21,289
I feel hurt only when
I get a cut like that.

713
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:26,289
That's a relief.

714
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,530
Oh, it's raining.

715
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:34,539
- Gosh.
- I think I had an umbrella in here.

716
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:37,239
- Let's go over there.
- Cover your head with this.

717
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,639
Cover yourself with this.

718
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,780
Come closer.

719
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:46,210
It's okay. You come closer.

720
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,340
Am I looking at...

721
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,610
your face now?

722
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,190
Gosh, what? Why does it
have to be now?

723
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:25,920
What?

724
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,519
It's not that I'm drunk...

725
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,659
or nervous. But why...

726
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:35,699
You're not even wearing
that cardigan now.

727
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,570
You have the blood
pressure problem again?

728
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:42,570
Stay here. I'll go buy an umbrella.

729
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:44,739
Don't go.

730
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:51,309
Stay here just for a minute.

731
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:56,719
- Still...
- I'm fine.

732
00:51:58,389 --> 00:51:59,860
Just look at me.

733
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,789
It's been a long time,

734
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,489
Secretary Jeong.

735
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:55,909
Does the blood pressure
affect your intelligence too?

736
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:58,250
We've been together the whole day.

737
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,489
By the way, you said
you have an appointment today.

738
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:15,900
I'm sorry,

739
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,630
but I can't walk you home now.
Take this.

740
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:21,869
No.

741
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,610
I'll use this instead.

742
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,260
Gosh.

743
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,670
Veronica Park speaking.

744
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,170
Hello, this is Do Min Ik.

745
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:57,340
I'm sorry, but I'd like
to meet you...

746
00:53:57,639 --> 00:53:59,510
somewhere else if you don't mind.

747
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,579
Now, I have...

748
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:04,780
a situation.

749
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:08,320
Okay. I'll see you later.

750
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:09,619
Bye.

751
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:15,719
Why would he want
to change the place?

752
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:24,869
This place is...

753
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:28,869
right there.

754
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:34,110
What? Does he want me
to come to the excavator?

755
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:50,360
Did something bad happen to you?

756
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:53,929
Did you read my mind?
How did you know that?

757
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,769
You were like this
when your mother passed away.

758
00:54:56,769 --> 00:54:58,170
You played video games all day.

759
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:03,170
Are you being like this...

760
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,440
because of the police?

761
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,050
It worked out well.

762
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,349
Don't worry about it.

763
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:19,050
Or...

764
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,019
is this about the woman
named Veronica Park?

765
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:29,059
How do you know Veronica Park?

766
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:39,769
This came to your office.

767
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:53,559
It's late. As always, thank you
for the side dishes you got me.

768
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:00,800
Please come to work tomorrow,
Director Gi Dae Ju.

769
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:17,550
(Certification of Contents)

770
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,449
"Certification of Contents"?

771
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,820
If addressee Gi Dae Ju fails
to discharge his obligation...

772
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,820
to have dinner with me,

773
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,059
it will be reported
to the authorities...

774
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:36,159
and all legal actions
will be taken against him.

775
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,019
We have a problem, Boss.

776
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,619
There's someone
who read the document.

777
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,289
And she...

778
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,659
remembers the exact phrase.

779
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,230
Jeong Gal Hee.

780
00:57:10,269 --> 00:57:13,070
Fortunately, she doesn't seem
to know what the numbers mean.

781
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:15,800
But once she figures out
what they are,

782
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,369
she won't let it slide.

783
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,840
Either scenario will happen.

784
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:25,710
One, she gets rid of us,

785
00:57:27,219 --> 00:57:28,380
or we...

786
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,320
get rid of her.

787
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,110
She's coming.

788
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:13,090
Will I see her face?

789
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,369
I bet I will.

790
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,510
I can see her.

791
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,159
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

792
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,829
Did he just look at me?

793
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:51,730
How could everything be the same?

794
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:52,769
Do you like me?

795
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:54,599
Don't you think it's unfair
for a woman who has everything...

796
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:55,769
to love someone?

797
00:58:55,769 --> 00:58:57,440
I was right.

798
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,670
I felt like
something was going to happen.

799
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,510
Why are you two here?
