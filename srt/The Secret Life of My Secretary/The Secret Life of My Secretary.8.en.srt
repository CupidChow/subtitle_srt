1
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:45,179
She's coming.

2
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,000
Will I see her face?

3
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:02,500
I bet I will.

4
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,769
I can see her.

5
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:16,680
What?

6
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,090
This is happening again.

7
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,319
Goodness.

8
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,900
Darn it.

9
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,840
What's wrong? Are you okay?

10
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:41,370
Yes.

11
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,439
Could you come over this way?

12
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,519
Was this how Secretary Jeong
was standing?

13
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,450
Was it like this?

14
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,290
Or was it more like this?

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,590
What are you doing?

16
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,400
What?

17
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,099
My apologies.

18
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,039
We haven't seen in a long time
and that was rude of me.

19
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:16,669
It's okay.

20
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,409
I was going to say
something disappointing to you too.

21
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,849
What? What do you mean?

22
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,150
I was going to just tell you over
the phone, but since our families...

23
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,650
are close, I didn't want to be rude.

24
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:33,629
I, Veronica Park,
is seeing another man.

25
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,099
So tell your mother,
Chief Director Sim Hae Ra,

26
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,129
that...

27
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:42,300
our relationship is over.
The end.

28
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:45,900
Now, if you'll excuse me.

29
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,870
Wait.

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,909
Who is this man?

31
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:51,580
Does he have a lot of money?

32
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,110
Is he competent?

33
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,050
Or is he better-looking than me?

34
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,919
To me, he is.

35
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,629
Bye then.

36
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,169
Well done. It went smoothly.

37
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,180
Hopefully I didn't hurt him a lot.

38
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,349
He was just standing there,
speechless.

39
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,819
Don't look back, Jeong Gal Hee.

40
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:40,990
If you look back now,

41
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,800
you will never be able to
go back to Director Do.

42
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,379
How about just one more day?

43
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,419
It will be more like
half a day at most.

44
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,319
From now on, for just 12 hours.

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
What?

46
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,560
Have an affair with me.

47
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,360
Mr. Do Min Ik.

48
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,060
From now on, for exactly 12 hours.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,370
If you don't change your mind...

50
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,970
within those hours,

51
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,069
I will let you go,
without resenting you or anything.

52
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,579
If you want,

53
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,350
I will forget
about our memories too.

54
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,920
As if...

55
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,889
we have never even met each other.

56
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:56,899
So you set a 12-hour timer?

57
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,699
What about her face?

58
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,709
You haven't seen her face at all?

59
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,470
I saw it.

60
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,040
Only her lips though.

61
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,149
I can't see more!

62
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,980
Drinking, cycling,
and even the stockings.

63
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,449
I have tried everything, but nothing
worked. What should I do?

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,819
Do you...

65
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,459
have to try more things?

66
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,639
Dr. Gu might be right.

67
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,680
I want to see her face
more than anything,

68
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,610
but just to see her face
for one minute,

69
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,579
I shouldn't waste my last chance
to see her...

70
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,779
by obsessing over my blood pressure.

71
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:55,689
I will just...

72
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,560
focus on loving and adoring her
while I can.

73
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,000
Then I might...

74
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,899
get lucky at some point
and be able to see her face.

75
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,709
Only 12 hours, Mom.

76
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,779
During the time,
I want to be a woman to him,

77
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,819
not a secretary. Can I do that?

78
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,250
After that, I will just move on.

79
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,360
As if...

80
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,629
we have never even met each other.

81
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,470
By the way...

82
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,670
what should we do
if we were to have an affair?

83
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,509
Wait.

84
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,410
It's folded.

85
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,620
It's okay. It's just a slight cut.

86
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,720
This is...

87
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,290
This band aid design is
not so common, isn't it?

88
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,029
It's the same one.

89
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:05,000
It's very common.

90
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,100
It's popular these days.

91
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,970
Wait.

92
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,139
This is?

93
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,040
But the finger that it's on...

94
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,339
and the way it's folded.
How can it be just like hers?

95
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,680
Well...

96
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:26,120
We should do at least something
like this to say we're in an affair.

97
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,120
Are you okay with it?

98
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,120
Yes, I'm okay.

99
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,660
But this is beating pretty loud.

100
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,370
Where should we go now?

101
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,939
Since we're going to be hanging out
the whole night,

102
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,610
I thought we would need a car.

103
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,449
So I asked my driver
to come back here.

104
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,480
Who?

105
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,120
There he is.

106
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,069
I want it to be just the two of us.

107
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,470
Okay.

108
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,279
Since we're having an affair,

109
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,579
I want it to be just the two of us.

110
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,920
Will that be okay?

111
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,889
Hey, Mr. Eun.

112
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:41,929
Something...

113
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,200
suddenly came up.

114
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,730
You can just go home for today.

115
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,139
Okay, sir. I'll see you tomorrow.

116
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:54,940
Okay, bye.

117
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,299
I'm already...

118
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,299
starting to get a little nervous.

119
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:25,470
Is there a place we can go
to ease my mind?

120
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:26,940
Tell me what you want to do.

121
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:30,509
You can use me to go to a place
you've never been with that guy.

122
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,740
Or you can ask me to do stuff
that he hasn't ever done for you.

123
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,909
If there's something you've always
wanted to do...

124
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,279
but never got around to it,

125
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:40,419
you're more than welcome
to use me.

126
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,090
Something I've never
been able to do?

127
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,190
I just thought of something.

128
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,090
Abusing my power.

129
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,669
Here you go.

130
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,379
Gosh, it's so delicious.

131
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,549
All you wanted to do was
to have someone make coffee for you?

132
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:16,149
If you want some really nice coffee,

133
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,360
we can go to a cafe
that's open for 24 hours.

134
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,460
No.

135
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,090
That's not the type of coffee...

136
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,899
I want to drink.

137
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,629
This is exactly what I wanted.

138
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,870
A cup of coffee
that's made by someone else...

139
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,639
with 2 spoons of sugar
and 1 spoon of ground coffee.

140
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:38,740
Sitting on a desk that was cleaned
by someone else...

141
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:41,649
while wearing a pair of heels
that was cleaned by someone else...

142
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:45,480
and drinking coffee
that was made by someone else.

143
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,350
I wanted to feel the joy
that you can get from that.

144
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,330
I feel like you would've been able
to enjoy that your entire life.

145
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,730
One can never get tired...

146
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,629
of abusing one's power.
Don't you know that?

147
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,470
If that's what you want,
we should get going.

148
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,620
No, we can't come here.

149
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,389
It seems like what you want
is to abuse your power...

150
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,960
at work.

151
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:32,129
And this is...

152
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,330
the best place to do that.

153
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,039
If I enter this place,

154
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,700
it'd be the same thing...

155
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,769
as risking myself to get hurt.

156
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,970
Why?

157
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,279
Are you worried
that people might recognize you?

158
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,519
Over there.

159
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:54,350
Do you see that over there?

160
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:58,320
I know a little bit
about this company.

161
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,759
If my secretary and I are
no longer in the office,

162
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,659
that means no one else
is in the office either.

163
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,769
I'm glad you know.

164
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
What?

165
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,870
No, it's nothing. Whatever the case,
I don't think this is a good idea.

166
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,639
Let's go.

167
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,080
Did you catch a cold?
Gosh, that's not good.

168
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,490
I got soaked in rain,
so my clothes are a bit wet.

169
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,659
Actually, I think my secretary left
an extra suit in my office.

170
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,759
Yes, you're right.

171
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:35,830
What?

172
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,330
I'm definitely sure that she did.

173
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,269
This is driving me crazy.

174
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,940
It's not like I can tell him
that it's in his office cabinet.

175
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,039
It's okay. I'm sure my suit
will eventually dry.

176
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,950
I think you should get changed.

177
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,019
But even so, this place is so...

178
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,429
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

179
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:10,029
But let me make one phone call.

180
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:11,500
Okay.

181
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,940
Be careful of the CCTV on your left.

182
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,769
Roger.

183
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,190
Let's go.

184
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,399
Gosh, that startled me.

185
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,799
What should we do? It's Gal Hee.

186
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,269
Gosh, answer it.

187
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,940
Gal... Gal Hee.

188
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
I'm... I'm home.

189
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,450
The others?

190
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,590
They... They all went home.

191
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:15,029
Does that mean
there's no one on the 37th floor?

192
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,389
Of course.

193
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,159
But why do you ask all of a sudden?

194
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,230
You're not planning on
coming back...

195
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,539
to the office, are you?

196
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,700
No, of course not!

197
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,679
I... I forgot to feed the fish.

198
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,950
I was going to ask
if you could do it for me.

199
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,850
But why are you stuttering so much?

200
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,720
You're not still in the office,
are you?

201
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,289
Of... Of course not.

202
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:51,230
Come on. I'm the only one who'd die
for starving a single meal.

203
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,929
The fish are still alive,
so don't worry.

204
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,330
See you tomorrow.

205
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Bye.

206
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,350
Come on out.

207
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,190
Okay.

208
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,870
Min Ik.

209
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,509
It's... It's Gal Hee.

210
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,909
What are we going to do?

211
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:41,850
Hide.

212
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,620
Where are you rushing off to?

213
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,730
What's that in the middle
of the corridor?

214
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,919
Awesome.

215
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,320
This is why I love the law.

216
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,929
It makes anyone come running over...

217
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:30,929
whether it's a bad person
or a crazy person.

218
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,029
Do you like me?

219
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,240
Well, don't you think
it'd be unfair...

220
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,340
for a woman like me
who has money, rich parents,

221
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,909
honor, and amazing looks
to also have the privilege...

222
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:47,509
to fall in love?

223
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,049
I just tend to have fun...

224
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:52,980
with whomever catches my attention.

225
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,080
I yield love...

226
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,320
to ordinary people
who are in dear need of it.

227
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,159
And by doing so, I'm practicing
the life of a noblesse oblige.

228
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,330
Did that answer your question?

229
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,460
You risked your presidency
for a guy you don't even like.

230
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,599
Is that also your way of practicing
your life of a noblesse oblige?

231
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,170
That's more like my way
of showing my confidence.

232
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,670
I came to a conclusion
that I'll be able...

233
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,140
to get reappointed without the help
of President Sim's shares.

234
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,349
I'm sorry if I misunderstood you.

235
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,650
I could understand that you'd be
considerate enough to do me a favor.

236
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,450
I also understand you enjoying this
meal in exchange with your shares.

237
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,519
But risking your presidency...

238
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,589
seemed like too much of a risk
to think of it as a game.

239
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,190
For someone like me,

240
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,289
the only way I could understand that
was to wonder if you liked me.

241
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,769
The bigger the stake,
the more exciting it gets.

242
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,150
If you're done, we should get going.

243
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,660
What are you doing?

244
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,130
Are you just going to leave?

245
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,940
To be honest, I felt very uneasy
thinking that you might...

246
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,400
lose your position because of me.

247
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,569
But thankfully,
that won't be the case.

248
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,880
I think I should say goodbye here.

249
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,009
Say goodbye?

250
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,150
We should start
hanging out together now.

251
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,910
I don't hang out with women.

252
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,349
Look who's Mr. Chastity.

253
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,950
Why are you so chaste?

254
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,119
This bike. I've used it
since I was in high school.

255
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,160
And this backpack.
I've had it since I was in college.

256
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:45,859
I only buy things that I can use
for more than 10 years.

257
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:49,930
And I only meet with women whom I'll
keep in touch, even after I die.

258
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:52,299
Does that mean...

259
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,140
you at least saw me as a woman?

260
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:58,539
Yes.

261
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:04,920
I thought you were
an incredible woman.

262
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,950
Some try to use people
to remain in their position.

263
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,519
But you risked your position
to support me.

264
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,329
If I get to run a company,
I want to be a president like you.

265
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,430
If I date someone,

266
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,400
I want to meet a woman like you.

267
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,369
Then we should have more fun.

268
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,170
I just want to know you better.

269
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:29,569
It doesn't mean
I want to hang out with you.

270
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,609
Guys usually love it
when I hang out with them,

271
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:35,450
splurging all my money with them.

272
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,609
I didn't tell you about this yet,

273
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,420
but I'm going to leave
the company next month.

274
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:43,619
Still, I'd like you to review
my project proposal.

275
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,359
I always say hi, but never say bye.

276
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,089
If you insist on leaving,
go on your own.

277
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,200
Thank you for everything.

278
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:08,750
I'm going to stay...

279
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,779
in my office all night!

280
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,559
The thing has arrived, Ms. Lee.

281
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,569
What took you so long?

282
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,900
Did something happen
on your way back?

283
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,069
The thing is...

284
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,019
Min Ik, hurry.

285
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,410
On my way back, I saw Gal Hee...

286
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,079
Nothing happened, Ms. Lee.
Please don't worry.

287
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,210
Are you serious?

288
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,720
Are you going to check this?

289
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,059
No. Yes.

290
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,329
You don't have to worry about it.

291
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,250
From up here,

292
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,380
everything seems so small.

293
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:55,690
Thanks to you,
I found it right away.

294
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,160
By the way, how did you know
it'd be there?

295
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,799
It was in the right place.

296
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:11,539
Please have a seat here.

297
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,170
What?

298
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:45,039
What are you doing?

299
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:49,470
Sitting on a desk that was cleaned
by someone else.

300
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,910
Being covered in a blanket...

301
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,049
someone else tucked you in.

302
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,559
And wearing heels cleaned by
someone else.

303
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,799
That's what you wanted, right?

304
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:22,440
I don't like...

305
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,210
how you're doing
this to someone else.

306
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,809
Someone else?

307
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,980
I'm doing this for you.

308
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,289
But this isn't really...

309
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,519
who I am.

310
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,369
What do you like about him?

311
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,910
I didn't like him
from the beginning.

312
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,980
But...

313
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,380
I saw something from him.

314
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,750
Even when he was about to collapse,

315
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:11,190
he got through it
without caving in.

316
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,460
As you know, I, Veronica Park,

317
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,799
have grown up in
a bountiful surrounding,

318
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,069
so I don't know much
about difficulties in life.

319
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,569
But someone told me this.

320
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,170
When you have a hard time,
what raises you up is...

321
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,039
not money or connections,

322
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:34,480
but good people.

323
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,589
I want to stay with him...

324
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:48,559
because he seems
to have everything,

325
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,700
but good people.

326
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:58,099
Gosh.

327
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,009
I'm so jealous of him.

328
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:13,380
Now that I'm here,
I should feed the arowana.

329
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:17,619
It looks so hungry.

330
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,920
Do you know anything about arowana?

331
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:25,230
I know very much about them.

332
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,029
I heard they bring good luck.

333
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,799
Someone I know values this fish...

334
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,509
more than his secretary.

335
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:37,940
My father left it to me.

336
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:43,150
He said his business went well
after he got this fish.

337
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,279
That's why he treasured it
when he was alive.

338
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:47,950
You know it.

339
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,690
None of my family is
related to me by blood.

340
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,220
What?

341
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,690
What?

342
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,930
I guess my mother
didn't tell you that.

343
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
They set us up for marriage,

344
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,410
so I thought
she already told you about it.

345
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,980
I'm not Chief Director
Sim Hae Ra's...

346
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,450
real son.

347
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,759
Are you disappointed?

348
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,190
Gosh, no.

349
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,789
It's not like that.

350
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,000
Then...

351
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,240
who's your real mom?

352
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,509
I came here when I was seven,
so I don't remember much about her.

353
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:48,579
But I heard I was born out of
wedlock like a cuckoo chick.

354
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,279
I'm guessing that...

355
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:56,019
my mother was
one of the women my father dated.

356
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,759
I'm sorry.

357
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,059
I just thought you cherished it
because it's an expensive fish.

358
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,329
Shall we feed the fish first?

359
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:08,500
No.

360
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,240
That's not how you abuse your power.

361
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,579
You stay here. I'll go find it.

362
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,759
I can see you very well from here.

363
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,640
Did he...

364
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,309
ever look at me like this
at least once?

365
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,650
(Call Planning Department 2.)

366
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,420
(Make sure to wash the cardigan
on Saturday afternoon.)

367
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,460
Secretary Jeong,
you didn't have to work this hard.

368
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,079
Yes, Boss.

369
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,009
Did you check the message?

370
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,180
No.

371
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:32,779
I think it'd be better
to take care of that first.

372
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,759
It's quite cold at night.

373
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,859
I think we should go
somewhere inside.

374
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,130
It's 2am now.

375
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,500
Where can we warm our bodies...

376
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,869
and rest at this time of day?

377
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,349
You're not asking me
to go to that place, are you?

378
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,390
It seems like...

379
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,859
everyone wears the same outfit here.

380
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,799
I thought you wanted to
go to a sauna.

381
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:24,369
Of course everyone wears
the same outfit here.

382
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,869
Oh, right. He doesn't recognize
people in the same outfits.

383
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,269
Let me tie your hair.

384
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,319
99. All I need to remember is 99.

385
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,230
I'm done.

386
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm suddenly feeling thirsty.

387
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,529
Let me go get something to drink.

388
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,539
What?

389
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,980
Gosh.

390
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:20,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

391
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,289
Let's see. What should I buy?

392
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,029
Please give me a second.

393
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,299
I think I definitely know that face.

394
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,609
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

395
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:45,109
Oh, right. It's the secretary.

396
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:50,049
Goodness.
You should have been more careful.

397
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,559
- I'm sorry.
- Do Min Ik.

398
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:56,660
Do you know me?

399
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,460
It's me. Your doctor, Gu Seok Chan.

400
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,869
What? What are you doing here?

401
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,299
There will be a surgery at night,

402
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,769
so I came here to take a nap.

403
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,769
By the way, didn't you say you could
recognize your secretary's face?

404
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,509
Yes, I did. Why?

405
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,650
When you said
you set a 12-hour timer,

406
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,549
were you talking about
your secretary?

407
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:20,319
I just saw her
buying things at the snack bar.

408
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,019
Secretary Jeong was?

409
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
If you want to pay,
you need to give me your key.

410
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,089
Oh, right. Hang on a second.

411
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,160
Here you are.

412
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,799
See? She's right there.

413
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:44,109
Okay. I'll be right back.

414
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,650
I wanted to see the girl
you are so madly in love with.

415
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,380
I have a surgery to perform now.

416
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,049
As soon as the timer goes off,
tell me how it went, okay?

417
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,349
- Okay.
- Bye.

418
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:10,970
Why is he coming this way?

419
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:14,099
- Min Ik...
- Secretary Jeong?

420
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,940
Did he just recognize me?

421
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:19,839
You're Secretary Jeong, right?

422
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,940
What should I say?

423
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,549
How did he know?

424
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:25,849
How strange.

425
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,380
Dr. Gu said...

426
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,119
she's Secretary Jeong.

427
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,549
Hello, sir.

428
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,029
Did you just try to pretend
you didn't see me?

429
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,900
Because I can't recognize you
in these outfits?

430
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,769
Come on. That's not it.

431
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:45,130
They say wearing glasses in sauna
can damage the lenses,

432
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,799
so I took off my glasses and...

433
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,339
What are you doing here
at this time? Who are you with?

434
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:51,640
- Of course I'm alone...
- No, you're not.

435
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,079
You have two bottles of sikhye.

436
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:56,980
I wanted to come here alone,

437
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,349
- but then someone wanted to join.
- Who is it?

438
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,950
Is it a man?

439
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:06,160
Well, yes.

440
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:08,190
I'm kind of seeing him.

441
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,670
Do you see the man over there?

442
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,230
Over there.

443
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,500
As you can see, he's deeply asleep.

444
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,940
So I don't think
I can introduce him to you.

445
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:28,309
I hope you enjoy the sauna.

446
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,579
Well, then.

447
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,019
Number 99. This is...

448
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,259
Veronica Park's key.

449
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:45,289
What? He memorized
the number on the key?

450
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,329
Why is this on your wrist?

451
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,000
Well...

452
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,640
- I met her.
- What?

453
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,509
I just met her...

454
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:59,180
and she gave her key to me. She said
she would like to buy me this.

455
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,480
I was wondering whom she was with,
and now I know it was you.

456
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,680
Where is she now then?

457
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:11,519
She said she was going to
the ladies' room.

458
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,230
She's over there. Behind the corner.

459
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:18,489
- Behind the corner?
- Over there, behind the corner.

460
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,230
She's going into
the medicinal herb room now.

461
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,630
You'd better follow her.

462
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,530
Oh, right.

463
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,340
Please give her this
when you see her.

464
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,969
Bye.

465
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,900
Gosh, it's hot.

466
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,210
Min Ik.

467
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,050
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

468
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,219
You said you'd get something
to drink, but you were here.

469
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,420
Awesome.

470
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,519
The pure energy of these crystals...

471
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,059
are quenching my dry throat.

472
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,389
I just met my secretary and...

473
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,960
I know.

474
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:28,429
I also just found out...

475
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:31,530
that your secretary
was Jeong Gal Hee.

476
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,800
I see. Here you go.

477
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:35,400
Thanks.

478
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,079
By the way, could you wait here
for a second?

479
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,480
I need to talk to my secretary.

480
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,510
No!

481
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,420
I think...

482
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:53,090
you can talk to her...

483
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,559
tomorrow in the office.
Don't you think?

484
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,429
I'm sorry.

485
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:00,130
Please wait here.
It won't take long.

486
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,539
Darn it.

487
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,739
He still has more to talk about?

488
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,989
- Were you looking for me?
- Goodness.

489
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,789
It's me. Secretary Jeong.

490
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,269
How did you know
I was looking for you?

491
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:39,969
You always look for me, sir.

492
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:43,239
Is there something
you want to talk about?

493
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,739
Where...

494
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:48,409
Where can you buy pebbles?

495
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:49,510
Why do you want to buy pebbles
all of a sudden?

496
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,320
Even if you go home right now,
it'll be at least 4am or 5am.

497
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,389
If you buy pebbles
on your way to work,

498
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:58,090
it'll affect your
work performance tomorrow.

499
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,789
So send me the location...

500
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:01,519
of where I can buy them via text.

501
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,690
I'll buy them
on my way to work tomorrow.

502
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,829
Did you have to ask me that
right now?

503
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,429
By the way, don't you think
the guy you're seeing...

504
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,369
is sleeping a bit too much?

505
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:17,269
- Hey, wake up. Hey.
- My gosh.

506
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:24,079
Why would you wake him up?
He's sleeping.

507
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,519
He's the one who's sleeping all day
after bringing a girl here.

508
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:29,420
Do you seriously think
I'm the bad guy for waking him up?

509
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,949
Why are you so angry at me?

510
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:35,260
Can't you see that he's asleep
because he's tired?

511
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,760
My gosh, you should go now.
Go on. Get going.

512
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:39,900
My goodness.

513
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,329
Make sure he takes you home.

514
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,769
Don't end up going home
all by yourself...

515
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:48,099
because you're too sorry
to wake him up.

516
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:51,369
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

517
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:58,909
Let's not get confused, Gal Hee.

518
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,179
Right now, you're back
to being Veronica Park.

519
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,489
Do, re, mi, fa, sol

520
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,190
Sol

521
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,860
Awesome! Awesome!

522
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,929
Okay.

523
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,780
Did you meet your secretary?

524
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,610
Yes.

525
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,619
But why the long face?

526
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:37,090
Did she make a mistake?

527
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,059
No, that's not it.

528
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,429
Well...

529
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,090
She just hates me so much.

530
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,429
She hates you?

531
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,369
Yes.

532
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:52,269
I like you.

533
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:57,110
I recently gave her a contract
so we could renew it.

534
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:58,809
But she refused to sign it.

535
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,139
She keeps wanting to quit.

536
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,920
I want to stay.

537
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,050
Hey, Director Do.

538
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,929
I know Gal Hee better than anyone.

539
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,500
I don't think she trying to leave...

540
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,670
because she hates you.

541
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,769
It's probably because
she hates herself.

542
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,840
When you leave someone,

543
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:33,340
it's sometimes because
you hate yourself,

544
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,239
not because you hate that person.

545
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,449
You want to stay, but the only
choice you have is to run away.

546
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,889
And although you like someone,

547
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:47,489
the only choice you have
is to hate that person.

548
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,559
There are times
when people feel that way.

549
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,130
So why don't you...

550
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,599
just try to understand her a little?

551
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:02,539
I'm sure Gal Hee is...

552
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,340
feeling very sorry towards you.

553
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,409
I wonder why...

554
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:13,880
people spread those horrible rumors
about you.

555
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,250
You're so considerate...

556
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,860
and warm-hearted.

557
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:26,030
Gosh, my eyelids feel so heavy.

558
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,170
I ran around way too much.

559
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,710
Here.

560
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,480
You can take a nap.

561
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,289
I'm Veronica Park.

562
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:57,130
Do you seriously think I'd sleep...

563
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,989
in a shabby place like this?

564
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:39,300
Her legs.

565
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,599
Her arms.

566
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,739
And her hair.

567
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,639
I can see everything.

568
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:48,840
But I still can't see her face.

569
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,619
Please let me see her face
for just 10 seconds.

570
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,349
Just 10 seconds.

571
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:12,869
70 dollars for a full body massage,
and 50 dollars for only the feet.

572
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,969
I'm Korean.

573
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:33,590
No one's here. I wonder if it's
because it's a late-night movie.

574
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:34,820
Awesome.

575
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:37,090
I knew no one would be here.

576
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:39,900
Someone I know who works at Cinepark
would be...

577
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,559
with a guy at this hour.

578
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,670
She wouldn't be here at work.

579
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,739
It's been years
since I watched a movie.

580
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,550
Don't tell me...

581
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,920
he hasn't opened his bag yet.

582
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,329
He seems like a guy who rarely opens
his heart as well as his bag.

583
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,590
You should go now.

584
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,360
You'll see the sunrise at this rate.

585
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,900
You're so bad with that.

586
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,010
You were good at writing
the certification of contents,

587
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,710
so I thought you'd be good
with your hands.

588
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:27,440
Give me that.

589
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:34,480
By the way, you're always making me
do stuff for a guy.

590
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,719
When are you going to teach me
how to act?

591
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,619
At this rate, I won't ever
get to earn money for my sister.

592
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,820
In order to be a good actress,

593
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:44,789
you need to know about life.

594
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:48,699
If you work for me
for just three months,

595
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:52,599
you'll be able to learn everything
about life very quickly...

596
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,300
You just got it on my skin.

597
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:55,670
I'm sorry.

598
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:58,670
My gosh.

599
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,210
Did I just...

600
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:04,280
apologize to you?

601
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,619
If you can't do it, just stay still.
Now, I have to do it all over again.

602
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,420
Why does it feel like I'm the one
who's learning about life?

603
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,360
If that guy comes,
tell him to come downstairs.

604
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,699
I'll be...

605
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,099
watching a movie
in the movie theater.

606
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:38,610
Pine... Neck... Cu...

607
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,050
Pan...

608
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:41,650
Pan...

609
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:46,860
- Ku... Panku... Ca...
- What?

610
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,989
- Panclocks.
- Pancakes.

611
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:51,889
No way.

612
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,599
- Pancakes.
- Pancah...

613
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,110
You can have some breakfast,

614
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,949
and I'll help teach you
some of the words.

615
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,349
- Okay.
- All right.

616
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:17,849
I opened my bag before I headed off
to work out at dawn.

617
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,059
And I found...

618
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:23,090
this in my bag.

619
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,929
Oh, that's where it was.

620
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:27,429
I looked for it everywhere.

621
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,500
You did it on purpose.

622
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:32,900
It was by accident.

623
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,880
Don't you already have a lot of guys
you can fool around with?

624
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,750
I stayed up all night,

625
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,550
so my eyelids are
succumbing to gravity.

626
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:52,250
Let's check the facts
a little later.

627
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,920
Meanwhile, may I borrow this
for a while?

628
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:01,530
What's wrong?

629
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,630
Are you worried
that my head might be heavy?

630
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,800
I'm worried
that my heart will flutter.

631
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,539
If I start having feelings
for someone who's so incredible,

632
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,940
I don't think
I'll be able to handle it.

633
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,360
Are you happy now, Mr. Chastity?

634
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:41,599
Offer bread to those who are hungry.

635
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,909
And offer a shoulder
to those who are sleepy.

636
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:47,710
That's what my grandpa taught me.

637
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,809
I love your grandpa.

638
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,019
Come to think of it,
you didn't tell me this.

639
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:00,760
About what made you...

640
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,690
become a jerk.

641
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:16,210
(Directed by Peter Segal)

642
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:40,059
What are you guys doing here?

643
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:42,969
Do you know him?

644
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,869
What?

645
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,239
Get out.

646
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:54,909
What's going on?

647
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:58,849
Can't you hear me?
Just get out of here.

648
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,420
I'll wait outside.

649
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,730
My premonition never goes wrong.

650
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,000
I knew...

651
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:23,239
something would happen today.

652
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:25,969
What on earth is going on?

653
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,710
It's all my fault.

654
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,519
Maybe I was hoping
this would happen.

655
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,889
I couldn't deal with it myself,

656
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:40,360
so I needed someone to punish me.

657
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,099
But can you please let this slide
for only one day?

658
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:52,730
I have less than an hour left...

659
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,340
until the time we promised
to spend together is over.

660
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,010
It's something
I can never get again.

661
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:11,420
And this isn't how
I want to spend the time left.

662
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,389
I'll tell him everything
when I go to work tomorrow morning.

663
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,199
Please give me one day.

664
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,460
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

665
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,099
Who was the guy?

666
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,269
I'm Veronica Park.

667
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:02,639
I know a lot of guys out there.

668
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:08,340
Did they fight?
Why did he make her cry?

669
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:21,190
Are you...

670
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:24,989
crying now?

671
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,199
Well...

672
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,630
The movie was so sad.

673
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:33,670
Gosh, it was so heartbreaking.

674
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,940
The movie was...

675
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,280
a comedy...

676
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:43,579
I guess you have
your own interpretation.

677
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,380
Stay here.

678
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,619
I'll get you some tissues.

679
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:51,050
Don't go.

680
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,800
I want to spend
the last few seconds...

681
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,800
with you.

682
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,369
Do you see me smiling?

683
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:50,710
We have 39 minutes left.

684
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,780
Do you want to go to
watch the sunrise?

685
00:51:58,219 --> 00:51:59,289
Yes.

686
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:19,570
I guess your feelings for him...

687
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:22,539
haven't changed, right?

688
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,980
I'm sorry, Min Ik.

689
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,550
You made the right choice.

690
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,519
You said this.

691
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:35,719
When you leave someone,

692
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:38,730
it's sometimes because
you hate yourself,

693
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,900
not because you hate that person.

694
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,070
To be honest,

695
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:50,610
I can't see your face.

696
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,280
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you this sooner.

697
00:52:57,449 --> 00:53:01,150
I recently got a disease called
prosopagnosia from an accident.

698
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,820
I can't recognize people's faces.

699
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,989
But I really wanted...

700
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,130
to see your face.

701
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:21,099
I guess...

702
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,670
I haven't been a good guy.

703
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,809
There was no gift from above.

704
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,719
I believe the person you chose...

705
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,650
is someone who is happy
when you smile...

706
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,219
and can console you when you cry.

707
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,360
He is like that, isn't he?

708
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,269
Let's not talk about him.

709
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,570
Can we talk about something else?

710
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:02,539
We have 10 minutes left.

711
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,719
Tell me if there's anything
you want to do in 10 minutes.

712
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,420
I'll do anything you want.

713
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:15,320
You wouldn't want to hear it.

714
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,690
I want to hear it.

715
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,599
It's better not to know it.

716
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,300
I want to know.

717
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,070
A kiss.

718
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,610
A kiss?

719
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:42,280
Before I get over my disease,
I won't date any woman...

720
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,389
or fall in love with anyone.

721
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:50,090
That makes you
the last woman I liked.

722
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,099
And I want to...

723
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,000
have the last kiss of my life...

724
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:00,139
with someone I really like.

725
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:05,170
That, I just can't...

726
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:09,539
I know.

727
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,619
It's not something you can do.

728
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,960
I guess...

729
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,030
the time is up.

730
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:37,309
The past 12 hours
I spent with you,

731
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:40,679
was the happiest time
I have ever spent...

732
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,150
in my whole life.

733
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,250
All right then.

734
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,630
Do it.

735
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,210
Mom.

736
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,619
I thought it wouldn't be
so bad to die young...

737
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,389
since it's the only way
I can see you again.

738
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,219
But now,

739
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,489
I don't think I will ever be able
to see you again.

740
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,670
I might not be able to go up
to where you are.

741
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,800
I'm sorry.

742
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:43,000
I'm sorry, Mom.

743
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:08,500
Kissing...

744
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,469
is not a big deal to me at all.

745
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,130
A bit lower.

746
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,239
A bit lower.

747
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:24,300
(Thank you for your cameo
appearance, Choi Woo Hyun!)

748
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:34,809
(The Secret Life of My Secretary)

749
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:38,179
Veronica Park and I broke up.

750
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,619
I like you, sir.

751
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:42,380
Oh, well.

752
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:44,489
I should set Secretary Jeong
with someone.

753
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:45,489
You can't.

754
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:48,519
Are you sleeping alone tonight?

755
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,829
Do you want me to stay with you?
