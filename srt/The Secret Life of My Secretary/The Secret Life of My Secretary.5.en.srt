1
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:41,880
You don't know men.

2
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,880
Don't you know men?

3
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,250
Do you really think I called you
just because I had indigestion?

4
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,299
If I say, "I was reminded of you
while walking nearby this area",

5
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,239
that means I wanted to see you.

6
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,379
If I say, "I was just wondering
what you were doing",

7
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,040
that means I was dying to know
what you were doing.

8
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,879
Saying I have indigestion...

9
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,980
is also one of those talks.

10
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:19,579
Haven't you heard about the rumors?

11
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,790
I'm promiscuous, nasty, and...

12
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,590
I don't buy rumors.

13
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,689
When I get upset,
I can be very rude...

14
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:26,790
I don't care.

15
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,260
Whenever I date guys,
all kinds of drama happen...

16
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,299
That means I have a chance too.

17
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,299
Oh my goodness.

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
No.

19
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,040
I can give a chance to any guy,

20
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,640
but you.

21
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:46,709
I don't want to.

22
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,180
Any guy but me?

23
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,150
Yes. Any guy but you.

24
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,689
I believe I made myself clear.

25
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,799
I'll go.

26
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,550
(Gi Dae Ju)

27
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,849
If you're going to say
you want to quit, just hang up.

28
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,590
I don't want to be dumped
twice in one day...

29
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,620
What?

30
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,659
I beat a person?
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,259
What? On the intranet?

32
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,830
- "The intranet"?
- Okay. Bye.

33
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,210
I saw Director Do Min Ik
attack his driver.

34
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,009
What? When did this person see it?

35
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,120
There will be the board meeting
tomorrow. I have to stop this.

36
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,819
(I saw Director Do Min Ik
attack his driver.)

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,020
Why is he standing like that?

38
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,800
Gosh.

39
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:29,409
Hey.

40
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,889
Let me help you.

41
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,289
What?

42
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,530
I'm not sure
if this is the right thing to do.

43
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,729
Korea's movie industry is
in the hands of my company.

44
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,370
Of course I've been through
problems like this.

45
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,370
We should find the person
who posted it as soon as possible,

46
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,569
explain what happened,
and ask to delete the post.

47
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,509
Before all the employees see it
tomorrow morning.

48
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,180
What if...

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,780
I really hit a person?

50
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:05,949
But you didn't.

51
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,919
Do you trust me?

52
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,129
Well.

53
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,430
I still feel like...

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,800
you don't actually hate me.

55
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,709
This is the place.

56
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,279
Right. This is the place.

57
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,459
Hello.

58
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,019
Is he coming at all?

59
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,779
Yes.

60
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:16,149
I heard he went to
one of his relatives' funeral.

61
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,189
He should be back any minute.

62
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,600
I have conflicting thoughts.

63
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,839
It's cold, so I want you to go home.

64
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:35,240
But at the same time, I want you
to be with me despite the coldness.

65
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,920
If I leave, you're going to
call your secretary anyway.

66
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,790
Same difference. Whatever.

67
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,350
My secretary?

68
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,290
Korean bosses need to fix...

69
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,129
their feeble mentality,
calling their secretaries first...

70
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,860
whenever something happens.

71
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,930
I didn't mean to call my secretary.

72
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,629
Why not?

73
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,839
Well...

74
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,769
I want her to take a rest.

75
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,480
She took the afternoon off earlier.

76
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,579
Maybe she was meeting someone.

77
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,709
She looked so excited.

78
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,180
It's you, buster.

79
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,350
Even if she comes here,

80
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,689
all she can do is
disgracing herself for me.

81
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,189
To make things worse,
I'm already a little...

82
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm a little different compared
to other bosses.

83
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,529
I'm sure that's already enough...

84
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,899
to make her get exhausted at work.

85
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,069
I don't want to call her
at this hour...

86
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:38,899
just so she could take care
of something like this.

87
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,339
I'm not going to call her.

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,980
It is a little cold.

89
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,230
Mother birds apparently
cover their baby birds...

90
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,069
with their own body
to protect them from the cold.

91
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,339
That will never happen.

92
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,879
Penguins that live
in the Antarctic...

93
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,680
stick together like this...

94
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,379
to maintain their body temperature.

95
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,389
Why do you keep
mentioning what animals do?

96
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,490
Can't you come up with something
that's more fit for humans?

97
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:35,589
Then...

98
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,740
If you cover your fingers
and make them warm,

99
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,810
your capillaries expand,

100
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,379
and it helps
with your blood circulation.

101
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,220
Apparently, that's what
you need to do...

102
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,149
when you're lost in the mountains.

103
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,889
How does it feel?

104
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,860
I think I'm getting a little hot.

105
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,970
What's taking him so long?

106
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,549
That's the guy...

107
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,190
that was on the intranet.

108
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,960
Will you be able to handle it
on your own?

109
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,169
I should get going now.

110
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:51,740
Yes, of course.
I should handle it on my own.

111
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,139
Thank you so much for today.

112
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,379
Will we be able to meet again?

113
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,480
No.

114
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,450
- No?
- No.

115
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,649
Okay.

116
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,769
Are you serious?

117
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,440
Of course, I'm serious.

118
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,740
I asked if he met a woman,
and he said yes.

119
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,970
I asked if it was Veronica,

120
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,379
and he said yes again.

121
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,149
Well, he did seem a little tired.

122
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,019
But my son is very healthy...

123
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,789
Then I'm guessing my daughter
and your son...

124
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:47,429
will soon be able to hit things off.

125
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,690
My goodness.

126
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,000
What's wrong?

127
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,200
Are you sure things are going well?

128
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,899
Did you sleep well, Mother?

129
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,940
I'm fine, thank you.

130
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,269
Just a second.

131
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,809
It seems like you didn't get
any sleep.

132
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:13,179
What in the world is that dropping
down all the way to your chest?

133
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,190
Are those dark circles?

134
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,019
While we're talking about that,

135
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,220
if you're not very busy,

136
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:22,129
can you please
tie my hands together?

137
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,200
These darn hands...

138
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:26,960
keep trying to call him.

139
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,870
I think it'd be best to tie them up.

140
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,570
That darn punk...

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,610
He must know how to play
hard to get with a woman.

142
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,080
Hello?

143
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,950
- Mother!
- Yes?

144
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,250
Can you also pull out my eyeballs?

145
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,879
My eyes keep wanting
to look at my cell phone.

146
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,720
Can you just take them with you?

147
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:52,919
Okay, okay.

148
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,259
Mother!

149
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,399
No.

150
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,159
Stop it.

151
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,529
Wait.

152
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,370
Listen to me carefully.

153
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,769
From this moment on,
he shouldn't call her at all.

154
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,909
What happens when someone...

155
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:14,509
coats the insides of their mouth
with sweet candy...

156
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,110
and spits it out all of a sudden?

157
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,779
It will make her
extremely desperate,

158
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,950
and she will be left
wanting more of it.

159
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,759
It'll be as if there's
an enoki mushroom...

160
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,929
growing inside her heart.

161
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,399
Okay, I understand.

162
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:48,850
I'll see you at the board meeting.

163
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,679
And focus on work instead of dating
for the time being.

164
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,919
Okay, Mom. I'll see you later.

165
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,029
Gosh, you used to be
nothing but this big.

166
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,700
But you've grown so big.

167
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
And now, you even know
how to ruin someone's plan.

168
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,470
What's that supposed to mean?

169
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,539
You've been waiting here all along
just because of that?

170
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,379
There's a misunderstanding
to what you witnessed.

171
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,279
If you can't believe me,

172
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,649
I'll give you
my driver's phone number.

173
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,850
You can ask him yourself.

174
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,559
No, I'll delete the post.

175
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:33,690
Really?

176
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,059
The thing is,

177
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,059
right after I posted that,

178
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:41,870
I got a call saying my uncle
passed away.

179
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,200
And I couldn't help
but feel uneasy about it.

180
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,470
This is why people
shouldn't do bad things.

181
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:51,809
Was it you?

182
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,679
Ma'am, can I have some more soup?

183
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,149
Sure.

184
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,340
Hey!

185
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,370
My goodness!

186
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,409
What is wrong with you?

187
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:27,750
What are you doing
to my pure armpits?

188
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,019
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.

189
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,850
I... I didn't get
enough sleep last night.

190
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,889
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

191
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,789
Oh, gosh. Excuse me.

192
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:41,360
Excuse me. Please let me through.

193
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,230
Please... Please show me some mercy.

194
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,870
My gosh.

195
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,399
Gosh, what did he do to his armpits?

196
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,139
I keep washing them,
but they still smell like whelks.

197
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,779
My hands are about to rot.

198
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,049
You look very refreshed today.

199
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,519
Hello, Director Do.

200
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,549
You must've gotten good sleep
seeing that your face is glowing.

201
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,789
I know you can't see.

202
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:13,159
Do you even know...

203
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,230
what happened
to your boss overnight?

204
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,529
It was so cold and dark.

205
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:19,230
And I could see the morning dew...

206
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,230
Did something happen?

207
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,399
Forget it.

208
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:24,899
It's fine as long as you slept well.

209
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,169
You know
what day it is today, right?

210
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,950
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

211
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,970
A guy with curly hair
who's about 172cm to 173cm tall.

212
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,309
Director Lee?

213
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,240
- That's correct.
- Nice.

214
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,110
A guy with slicked back hair
who's about 176cm to 177cm tall.

215
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,929
Hello, Director Kim.

216
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,759
Why are you waiting outside?

217
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,299
Gosh, you're always the one
supporting me.

218
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,629
I'm just sorry
that I can't do more for you.

219
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,370
That's Director Park,
and that's Director Woo.

220
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:41,250
If you keep this up, no one will
know that you have prosopagnosia.

221
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,750
I can't be satisfied
just because I know who's whom.

222
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:46,019
- I can't see their faces.
- Their faces?

223
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,350
A board meeting is all about
being quick-witted.

224
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:49,889
Come to think of it,

225
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:53,320
Director Kim and Director Park...

226
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
both look a little stern.

227
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,559
Director Park.

228
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:01,070
Why do you look so serious?

229
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:03,070
I heard your mother
got hospitalized.

230
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:04,299
Is she not doing well?

231
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,169
Gosh, no wonder he's
Director Mind-Reader.

232
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,179
Let's talk inside.

233
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,750
We have 8 votes against 3...

234
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,220
which means we'll be signing
the patent licensing deal...

235
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
with YK Ventures.

236
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,929
Now that the meeting is over,

237
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:30,590
may I treat you to lunch?

238
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,759
Hang on.

239
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,860
Have a seat.

240
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,070
Why?

241
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,100
Did we order some
boxed lunch over here?

242
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,899
The thing is,

243
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,909
I got a video this morning.

244
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,480
I got it too.

245
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,679
Me too.

246
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,009
- Me too.
- I got it too.

247
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,220
I did too.

248
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,220
What video are you talking about?

249
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,740
What is this?

250
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,940
Min Ik.

251
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,039
What is going on?

252
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,410
I guess he had a reason.

253
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,309
Is that right?

254
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,049
Well... There was
a misunderstanding.

255
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,519
I know.

256
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,259
Whether it was drugs or alcohol,
there must've been a reason.

257
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:34,259
Director Park.

258
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,190
Anyway, it's true
that there was an assault.

259
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,630
All the directors
got the video already.

260
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,069
It's a matter of time
before the media finds out.

261
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,369
Of all people, why did you
assault your driver?

262
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,569
The power trip issue is
very sensitive these days.

263
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,269
It might lead to a boycott campaign.

264
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,309
Why would you say that?

265
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,380
Assault is an offense
unpunishable over objection.

266
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,750
He won't be prosecuted...

267
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,150
unless the victim
demands punishment.

268
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,519
You were a prosecutor, Director Lee.

269
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,349
What? I mean,

270
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,420
this isn't about punishment.

271
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,559
The company's image is at stake.

272
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:11,329
If you want it to go away quietly,
you should resign for now.

273
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:12,430
"Resign"?

274
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,130
You guys have done a great job
covering up your own mistakes.

275
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,869
And now you're
telling me to resign...

276
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,339
under the pretext
of the company's dignity?

277
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:22,839
Then what?

278
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,539
Do you want to hold a
stockholders' meeting?

279
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,680
What are you guys doing?

280
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,849
You guys got him to resign
with some tricks three years ago.

281
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:31,250
Do you think it will work again?

282
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,019
It'd be better to keep this quiet.

283
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,119
Are the rest of you...

284
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:38,119
with Director Park?

285
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,470
Are you...

286
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,509
with him?

287
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:04,880
I can't see...

288
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,690
who and how many of them
are on my side.

289
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,390
I can't see anything.

290
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,599
What? Why is it taking so long?

291
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,799
Let's take a show of hands then.

292
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,240
"A show of hands"?

293
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,710
Then we can decide immediately.

294
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:31,880
Gosh.

295
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,380
Do you really have to do this?

296
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,349
My goodness.

297
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:41,519
It's not like this is an election
for class presidents.

298
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,819
6. I need at least
6 people on my side.

299
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,119
Mom will take my side anyway.

300
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:49,059
Those two are always on my side.

301
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,660
Director Lee. I thought
I could win him over.

302
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,529
Either he or Director Kim
would raise his hand.

303
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,940
And Dae Ju is definitely on my side.
So I've got five.

304
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,509
Which means it can be six.

305
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,279
If you don't like it,
just go ahead and resign.

306
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,509
I'll take a show of hands.

307
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,109
Min Ik.

308
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,819
Chairman. Let's continue.

309
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,990
Okay. I guess
we have no other choice.

310
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,519
Let's continue then.

311
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:22,329
If 6 out of 11 directors here
raise their hands,

312
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:24,190
it will be passed.

313
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,630
Director Woo, you go first.

314
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Director Lee.

315
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:11,809
They're five.

316
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,210
So it's rejected, right?

317
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,250
Wait.

318
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,410
We have one person left.

319
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,150
Are you for...

320
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,390
or against it?

321
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:34,900
Director Gi Dae Ju.

322
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,180
I'm for it.

323
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,460
Secretary Jeong, will you
give us a minute?

324
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,789
Yes, Director Gi.

325
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:25,519
What is going on?

326
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,880
Even a story
with a lot of reversal...

327
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,319
should have some probability.

328
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,819
You said you'd quit two days ago.

329
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,759
But you kicked me
out of the board today?

330
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:37,759
Let's take this
to the stockholders' meeting.

331
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,660
What?

332
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,670
If you don't resign voluntarily,

333
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,869
they'd do anything
to drag you down...

334
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,369
until a new president is elected.
Don't you get it?

335
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,680
What if it doesn't work
at the stockholders' meeting?

336
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
Why wouldn't it?

337
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,980
It's not like you're ill.

338
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:01,150
They could do it three years ago
because you were sick,

339
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,349
but you're just fine now.

340
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,089
One third of stockholders
must attend the meeting.

341
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,059
It's highly likely that
the meeting will be cancelled.

342
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,490
We have only two months
left before the election.

343
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,759
If it is cancelled, we can't
call another meeting in time.

344
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,400
Even if a stockholders' meeting
takes place,

345
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,039
it might get rejected. Then the
board won't be able to do anything.

346
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:27,079
If you cared for me that much,
let me ask you something.

347
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,119
Why did you say you'd quit?

348
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,019
Why?

349
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,039
Well...

350
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:02,680
I went to the police
station yesterday.

351
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,720
You went there after all.

352
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,420
What did you tell them?

353
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,890
I told them the truth.

354
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,589
Yes, Director Gi.

355
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,200
- I'll be a little late tomorrow.
- Hwangcheon intersection.

356
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,200
Turn left at the intersection.

357
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,230
Something urgent came up,
so I went to my mom's that night.

358
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,440
And I didn't see you that night.

359
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,279
I heard it, Boss.

360
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,089
I'm sorry. I'll look into it again.

361
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,259
So they took a show of hands.

362
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,759
And six of them raised their hands.

363
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,799
So what's happening?

364
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,200
It's obvious.

365
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,869
If he gets dismissed
at the stockholders' meeting,

366
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,099
there's no way...

367
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:58,900
he'll be the president.

368
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,609
Most of them resign voluntarily
before it happens, though.

369
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,640
Ms. Lee.

370
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

371
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,220
Ms. Lee, I'm sorry.

372
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,619
But I should get going now.
Please excuse me.

373
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,660
Where is she running to
so hurriedly?

374
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,329
Did you not hear it?

375
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,529
The video of Director Do
assaulting his driver...

376
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:26,599
is going around.

377
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,740
There's a video?

378
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,170
- Fire him immediately.
- Mom.

379
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:38,539
You saw Dae Ju raise his hand
at the meeting.

380
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,380
You've always recklessly
believed in people too much.

381
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:45,750
How can you still trust people
after what happened three years ago?

382
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:49,549
(3 years ago)

383
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:50,990
Gloripen capsule.

384
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,390
How did you get my prescription?

385
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,829
Do you know
what this medicine is for?

386
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,799
It's to treat degenerative
psychogenic syndromes...

387
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,470
due to a cerebral vascular defect.

388
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,400
This equals to having
dementia or brain disease...

389
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,269
as side effects later on.

390
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,039
His mind still comes and goes?

391
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,170
I thought he was fully recovered.

392
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,009
A person with dementia
can't run this company.

393
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:15,650
What's going on?
He has a problem with his brain?

394
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:18,380
I said you're fine.
Why do you keep coming to me?

395
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,619
I need you to check thoroughly
to see if I'm really fine.

396
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,589
I told you. The president election
is just around the corner.

397
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,220
If you're so worried,

398
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,430
why don't you try this?

399
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:30,589
What is it?

400
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:33,730
It's a kind of brain enhancer. It's
basically a nutritional supplement.

401
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,430
This is exactly what anxious
students ask when they have exams.

402
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,839
I knew you were going to give
something to me.

403
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,140
(Prescription)

404
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,750
Secretary Lee...

405
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,750
(President Sim Hae Yong)

406
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,880
It's been over 10 years since
I've officially fully recovered.

407
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:55,819
My doctor prescribed the medicine
for just in case.

408
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:57,490
"One who is physically
or mentally challenged..."

409
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,890
"and therefore prevented
from doing one's duty..."

410
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:02,059
"can't be elected as president."

411
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:05,660
You know this is written on our
articles of incorporation, right?

412
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,369
How could you not know...
your own secretary...

413
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:11,970
was with them? You idiot.

414
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,869
You even tried to promote her
to a permanent employee.

415
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,069
People would do anything for
some stash of money.

416
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,549
It's more like,

417
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,619
those who have money
manipulate other people with money.

418
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,819
Ma'am, you don't have to prepare
my dinner.

419
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,730
I haven't eaten,

420
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:41,599
but I'm full, again.

421
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:49,710
I'm going to this mountain
cuckoo, cuckoo

422
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,470
I'm going to this mountain

423
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,539
Resign before
the stockholders' meeting.

424
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,250
I'll think about it.

425
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,380
Just resign.

426
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,380
Before you humiliate yourself
with the critical video evidence.

427
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,950
Including Gi Dae Ju, your driver,
and your secretary,

428
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:05,059
dismiss everyone near you.

429
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,059
Since when you, as a secretary,

430
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,000
were allowed to come to
your boss' place and call him out?

431
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,670
Are you going to resign?

432
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,509
Don't resign.

433
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,809
Are orders...

434
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,880
supposed to be given
from secretaries to their bosses?

435
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:06,480
Shouldn't it be
the other way around?

436
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,789
Let's switch our positions
just for today.

437
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,690
I need to give an order to you.

438
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,430
Please don't resign, sir.

439
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,289
If I resign from the board,

440
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,529
of course I can't be the president,

441
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,829
but it doesn't mean
I can't keep my current position.

442
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,539
Therefore, your contract will stay.

443
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:28,670
Do you think I'm doing this
for the contract?

444
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,710
You're not?

445
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:36,579
I found it cool.

446
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,490
When you dared to swallow
your pride, came to me,

447
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:45,690
and asked me to come back.

448
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,630
When you said you wouldn't be
defeated by your disease,

449
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,630
even if there's no cure for it.

450
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,339
When you memorized all employees'
heights and hairstyles...

451
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,009
and then welcomed
the directors without any problem.

452
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,680
What are you doing?
You're flattering me.

453
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,220
When my boss gets flattered,
I get flattered.

454
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,759
When my boss gets depressed,

455
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,430
I get down too.
That happens to be my job.

456
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,160
Don't give up.

457
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Keep running
until you can be the president.

458
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,170
I'll help you.

459
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,869
By making my boss cool,

460
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,140
I can make myself cool too.

461
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:48,349
Let's wait for him.

462
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:50,019
It won't be easy for him
to bring it up.

463
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:53,220
I'm so hungry. I'm starving.

464
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,589
- Darn it.
- Good grief.

465
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:18,819
About resignation...

466
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:22,150
Good. You should just say it now.

467
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,720
You made the right decision.

468
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,160
Let's wrap it up now.

469
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,430
How about seolleongtang for brunch?

470
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,460
I'm not resigning.

471
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:31,890
What?

472
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,769
Do Min Ik, why...

473
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,200
My uncle has always been
my role model.

474
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,000
Just like three years ago,

475
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,839
he never gives up. He has
always been doing his utmost.

476
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:48,710
And as a young man, I shouldn't be
discouraged by such a minor issue.

477
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,680
Besides, now I have someone
who will help me...

478
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,519
become the president.

479
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:58,119
From now on, I'm going to
just bite the bullet and go for it.

480
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,390
Let's see who will cross...

481
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,490
the finish line first.

482
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,650
I just did it.

483
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,180
Well done.

484
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,119
Now, what should we do first?

485
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,589
We should change your office first.

486
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,390
We never know. Someone might be
monitoring us again.

487
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,329
Jung Hee, I'm home.

488
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,660
How come you're home
in the middle of the day, ma'am?

489
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:44,369
What's that?

490
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,869
This is mine, right?

491
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:48,599
The sleeves are a bit too long.

492
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,539
Wait, did you get hurt?

493
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,789
Is it from this bag?

494
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:11,130
It's my boss' suit!

495
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,630
No wonder it felt nice.

496
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,430
Take if off already!

497
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,670
You have no idea what this is.

498
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:25,440
The shirt. Didn't you smell
blood from the shirt?

499
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,950
I should have taken this
to the laundry shop.

500
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,079
Why did I forget that?

501
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:36,390
What was the sound?

502
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,130
Maybe it's Director Do's.

503
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,500
Kyun Woo!

504
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:48,460
I guess I'm a woman after all.

505
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:51,430
Kyun Woo!

506
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,039
I'm sorry!

507
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:01,210
(Movie audition for
"My Sassy Court Maid")

508
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,289
Ma'am.

509
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:15,590
Your mother says
you look pretty, right?

510
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,230
I'm sure she says Jun Ji Hyun is
not as pretty as you.

511
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,800
And that you could be
a more successful actress than her.

512
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,300
If you think I was bad, just say it.

513
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,639
Don't get my mother involved.
It's unfair.

514
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,940
Okay. You are bad. Next!

515
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,409
- Is that it?
- Of course that's it.

516
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,809
You're not only horrible at acting,
but also lashed at me.

517
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,380
What did you expect?

518
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,050
You made a personal attack
against me first, old lady.

519
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,849
"Old lady"?

520
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,050
Please don't...

521
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,619
Ma'am! Please calm down!

522
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,320
And you just made a personal attack
against me!

523
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:51,030
One can only be
either a person or a woman.

524
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,130
How dare you discriminate me
by calling me an old lady?

525
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,929
I'm the one who got discriminated.

526
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,929
You're a judge,
but you didn't look at me.

527
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,130
You were only looking at your phone.

528
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,800
How is that my fault?

529
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,710
It's your fault that you failed
to capture my eyes on you.

530
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:08,309
Do you have any idea
how humiliating it is...

531
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:09,780
to act so horribly
in a big audition like this?

532
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,579
I'm already angry at myself
for messing up the audition...

533
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,480
even after I lied to my sister
and ran away from home...

534
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,550
just so I could become a star.

535
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,289
Why did you have to make me
feel miserable...

536
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,019
by mentioning my mom
who doesn't even exist?

537
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:23,829
I like your guts.

538

(Movie audition for
"My Sassy Court Maid")

539
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,460
Did you think I'd say that?

540
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:31,269
If you came to an audition,

541
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:33,139
you should be impressing me
with your acting skills.

542
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,710
Why are you trying to make me
pity you instead?

543
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,940
And do you seriously think your
acting skills were good enough...

544
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,449
for you to run away from home?

545
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,449
I'm sorry for what I said
about your mom.

546
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,320
You should also apologize.

547
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,260
I'm sorry, old lady...

548
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,230
What am I supposed to call you?

549
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,760
Just call me "woman".

550
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,329
"I'm sorry, woman."

551
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,369
I'm sorry, woman.

552
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,440
Next!

(Movie audition for

554
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,739
No way.

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,480
0106421?

556
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,119
I deleted his phone number,

557
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,090
but my clever brain
must've memorized it already.

558
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:26,159
It's phone number one, right?

559
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,519
The one I use for VIPs.

560
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,130
It's phone number 10.

561
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,960
The one you use for people
you don't want to talk to.

562
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:34,400
Who is it?

563
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,929
It's President Sim Hae Yong.

564
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,440
Veronica Park speaking.

565
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:46,480
You'll get a call soon regarding the
extraordinary stockholders' meeting.

566
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,210
I'm hoping you'll attend this one.

567
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,949
No.

568
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,090
If I attend every insignificant
stockholders' meeting, like yours,

569
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,090
when will I have time to meet guys
and drink?

570
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:03,389
It's related to Director Gi.

571
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:06,000
I heard things are going well
between you two.

572
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,000
Is that what he told you?

573
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:12,469
Did he tell you that things are
going well between us?

574
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,699
Well... Well, yes.

575
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,440
What is he thinking?

576
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,039
You should drop by
to say hello to him.

577
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,650
It'd be even better
if you write me a POA.

578
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,820
President Park, it's the number
you've been waiting for, 6421!

00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,820
Awesome! I need to hang up.

Veronica Park speaking.

581
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:39,599
I don't know this number.
May I ask who's calling?

582
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:42,199
It's me, Gi Dae Ju.

583
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,400
Can we meet today?

584
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:50,340
I've never been
inside a hotel suite before.

585
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:53,739
I get that it's your first time
in a six-star hotel suite.

586
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,610
But did you really have to bring
that rice cooker...

587
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,079
and ruin the interior?

588
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:01,219
There's a hotel buffet here
that you love more than yourself.

589
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,590
Of course I made sure to bring
elastic waist pants for the buffet.

590
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,460
But I can't always have buffet...

591
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,119
until the stockholders' meeting.

592
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,389
It's really expensive.

593
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:13,599
I forgot to bring the USB.

594
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,599
USB?

595
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,400
Remember the suit you wore
on the day of the accident?

596
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,900
I found it in that suit.

597
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,010
What are you talking about?
I brought it from Dae Ju's place.

598
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,440
What? That can't be right.

599
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,940
I'm sure it was in the paper bag.

600
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,820
Here we are. The hotel suite.

601
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,070
What should I do with the car?

602
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:53,739
You won't have to come here
for a while.

603
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:55,809
Director Do will be staying here
for a couple of days.

604
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:59,139
Then I'll drive you home.

605
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,539
No, it's okay.
Why would you do that?

606
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Well...

607
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,650
You guys are working so hard.
Let me do anything to help.

608
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,820
I'll drive you home safely.

609
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,429
Where should I begin?

610
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,699
If I start with sales,
it might seem a little arrogant.

611
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,699
Would it be too obvious
if you started out with an apology?

612
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,809
I wonder what she would've done.

613
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:33,780
Who?

614
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,550
Are you talking about Veronica Park?

615
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,789
She's probably more experienced
with stuff like this than I am.

616
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,429
Why do you like her, Director Do?

617
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,300
Me?

618
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:59,670
Why do you think I like her?

619
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:04,469
Do you really think
your boss is someone...

620
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:08,710
who'd fall for a woman he just met?

621
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,719
I feel like it's your first time
asking for a woman's number...

622
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:18,820
after you went on
a blind date with them.

623
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:25,130
She's a lot richer than I am.

624
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:28,360
She comes from a better family,
and she's more competent.

625
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,429
So isn't it natural?

626
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:34,300
I'll take care of my love life
on my own.

627
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,110
Wake me up
once the rice is done cooking.

628
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,679
I haven't slept properly in days,
so I'm tired.

629
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,090
If...

630
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,659
that woman...

631
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,869
didn't have any money,

632
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,239
didn't come from a very good family,

633
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,239
and wasn't competent at all,

634
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,179
you surely wouldn't have
liked her, right?

635
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:17,579
Director Do?

636
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:21,619
Director Do.

637
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,250
I made some mistakes,

638
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,190
and I feel sorry for that.

639
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,360
But I'll repay you by working hard.

640
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,099
So please don't like her.

641
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,699
If you like her and end up
suffering because of her,

642
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,239
I'll end up hurting as well.

643
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,980
My goodness.

644
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,650
I'm not sleeping.

645
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,949
Did you hear everything?

646
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:37,429
How are you so simple-minded?

647
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:41,030
Who falls asleep that fast?

648
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:42,969
I mean...

649
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:46,239
You should've responded if you
were awake. Why did you stay quiet?

650
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:49,440
I was on the brink of
falling asleep.

651
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,110
By the way, are you sick?

652
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:56,650
I think I heard you say...

653
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,880
that it hurts or something.

654
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,789
My wrist... It really hurts.

655
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:09,360
I wiped all the plates,
and now my wrist is killing me.

656
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:12,360
Gosh, I should dip it in warm water.

657
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:23,309
You know what Veronica Park
looks like, right?

658
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,480
Do you not know?

659
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,110
Well... Yes, I know.

660
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,690
Is she pretty?

661
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,119
What if she is?

662
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,760
Is she pretty or not?

663
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,130
If I tell him that she's pretty,
he'll end up liking her even more.

664
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,500
Can you...

665
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,030
describe how she looks in detail?

666
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:54,800
What does her eyes look like?

667
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:57,440
What about her nose?

668
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,380
And what about...

669
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,539
her lips?

670
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:04,880
Tell me.

671
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:10,389
She has...

672
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:13,920
average looking eyes.

673
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,760
And her nose...

674
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,300
Her nose...

675
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,000
is also very average looking.

676
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,570
And her lips...

677
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,280
I guess her lips are quite decent.

678
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,420
But she really is pretty.

679
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,650
So many people work for her...

680
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,849
just to make her look pretty.

681
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,320
She has custom-made clothes...

682
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:51,030
that compliment her physique.

683
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,659
And her heels that were made
not for walking purposes,

684
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,630
but for beauty...

685
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,130
perfect her body line.

686
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,239
More importantly,

687
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,300
she owns...

688
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,869
a coat that nobody else owns.

689
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,940
The threads on that coat
were first planted with money,

690
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,550
then sewn with her parents,

691
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:14,519
and is laminated with competence.
It's called the coat of confidence.

692
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:17,590
It's an invisible coat,

693
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,619
but anyone can see it.

694
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,989
It makes her look
confident and beautiful.

695
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,900
I look like a mess, right?

696
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,440
I was in an audition earlier today.

697
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,909
There was a girl
with a filthy temper,

698
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:41,309
so I didn't even have time
to put on lipstick.

699
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,579
You didn't have time
to put on lipstick,

700
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:47,920
but it's on your teeth.

701
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:53,489
I feel hungry all of a sudden.

702
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,570
Sim Hae Yong asked me to come,
but Gi Dae Ju tells me not to.

703
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,769
It's funny how your company works.

704
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,039
I wonder who's on whose side.

705
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:14,940
Please do me a favor.

706
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,780
I have a friend who's like my wife.

707
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:22,320
So you're asking me a favor
for your wife?

708
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,190
How dare you!

709
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,119
Are you thinking of saying yes,
only if I meet up with you?

710
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:27,989
Is that it?

711
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:30,929
You come to see me only when
you have a favor to ask me.

712
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:32,630
You're the one who's being mean.

713
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:35,300
Don't you think I'm using it
as an excuse to see you?

714
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,429
I don't know why I'm being
so thoughtless...

715
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:40,900
every time I see you.

716
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,070
- 6 o'clock.
- 6 o'clock?

717
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,139
Now that the alarm went off,

718
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,780
shall we begin our love story now?

719
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,920
President Park.

720
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:56,489
Hello, ma'am.

721
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,159
Do you even own this restaurant?

722
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,190
That sounds so disappointing.

723
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,530
I own this whole building.

724
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,900
Then let's eat somewhere else.

725
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,239
If you eat here,
the employees will be very tired.

726
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:18,769
If we eat somewhere else,
I will be tired.

727
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,139
I know a good sushi
restaurant near here.

728
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:23,409
And the price is reasonable...

729
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:25,150
so I can pay with my own card.

730
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:29,519
You say that it's not good
in a very positive way.

731
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,119
Everything tastes good as long
as I eat it with someone I like.

732
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:38,090
Are you saying that you like me...

733
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,900
in a coy way?

734
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:41,860
It was a subjunctive.

735
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,639
If I eat something
with someone I like...

736
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,869
You'll see. I'll make
that subjunctive...

737
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:53,039
into a present progressive.

738
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:54,980
Let's go!

739
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:04,920
Director Do.

740
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,389
There were a hair band
and a sewing kit in the bathroom.

741
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,889
I didn't think you'd need them,
so I took them.

742
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,260
Thank you.

743
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,769
Gosh, it's all on my shirt.

744
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:26,840
Are you asleep?

745
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,309
Are you sleepy again?

746
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,489
Sleep in the room.

747
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:44,829
I guess he's asleep.

748
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,769
I should straighten his neck.

749
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:16,860
I can see you.

750
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,190
What?

751
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,559
In my dream,

752
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,199
I can see everything.

753
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:27,070
This isn't a dream.

754
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,710
You're pretty.

755
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,449
Am I pretty?

756
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,480
Yes. You're pretty.

757
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,090
Even though I have no money?

758
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:51,190
Even though I don't own a building?

759
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:00,969
Even though I don't have parents?

760
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,710
I wish it wasn't a dream.

761
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,349
What?

762
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,260
This isn't a dream?

763
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:24,389
Of course not.

764
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:27,599
How could you be so simple-minded?

765
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:30,530
How could you start
dreaming so soon?

766
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,070
Well...

767
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:35,199
I thought...

768
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:38,269
you were Veronica.

769
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,409
It's me, Secretary Jeong.

770
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,849
You don't even know
how Veronica looks like.

771
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,320
Well... I know that.

772
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:54,389
I just felt that way
for the time being.

773
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:58,289
I'll be here at eight
tomorrow morning.

774
00:50:58,829 --> 00:50:59,900
Bye.

775
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:03,699
Don't go.

776
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:13,579
Sleep over.

777
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,920
I'll go. You can stay here.

778
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,989
Gosh, no. You don't
have to do that for me.

779
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,559
For you? You think?

780
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,099
This is just about marginal utility.

781
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:41,400
I get to sleep here all the time,
but this is your first time.

782
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,539
So it will create
even more satisfaction.

783
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:45,610
It's all about economics.

784
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,380
Stand up.

785
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,789
Where was it?

786
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:14,639
What are you doing?

787
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:17,869
Secretary Jeong, you were
talking about...

788
00:52:18,409 --> 00:52:19,980
some coat of confidence
earlier today.

789
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,679
This is it.

790
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,349
Secretary Jeong, I want you
to stay here a few days...

791
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:27,579
wearing that coat.

792
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,920
This isn't about
consideration at all.

793
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,989
I'm just doing this for me.

794
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:37,059
If you lose confidence
before the stockholders' meeting,

795
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:39,900
it will just depress me.

796
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,599
The spa opens at 10,

797
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,670
and the breakfast buffet
opens at six.

798
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:52,909
Make sure to have the door locked.

799
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:12,230
I thought
Secretary Jeong was coming.

800
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:15,000
She will stay at the hotel
for the time being.

801
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:17,869
Let's go home.

802
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:19,369
Yes, sir.

803
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,119
I'm Jeong Gal Hee who's
staying in a suite.

804
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:46,059
Yes, you're pretty.

805
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,769
I guess I did become prettier.

806
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:57,170
As if I actually became her.

807
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:00,710
I thought...

808
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,579
you were Veronica.

809
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,579
That can't be right.

810
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,389
Sure. That's not true.

811
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:19,489
This is what it feels like...

812
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:21,360
to look down from above.

813
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:24,769
It's good.

814
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:36,110
(2 weeks later, the day of
TnT Mobile's stockholders' meeting)

815
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:38,079
I guess we picked the wrong day.

816
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:40,179
Or maybe, we picked the perfect day.

817
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:49,519
Why do you look so intimidated?

818
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,329
No, I'm not.

819
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:55,199
I was just hoping the stockholders'
meeting would be canceled.

820
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,699
Let's not bet on it.

821
00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:01,000
If it could be cancelled, they
wouldn't even have started it.

822
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,179
- What are you doing?
- Wait.

823
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,050
Your heart is beating too fast.

824
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,949
Maybe you should have taken
an antihypertensive drug.

825
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,360
Don't be ridiculous.

826
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,389
I just...

827
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:24,630
got a bit scared
because I might break the record...

828
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,800
of the number of faceless people
I see today.

829
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,559
How great is that?

830
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,170
What is?

831
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,699
Many people get nervous on stage...

832
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:35,369
and close their eyes.

833
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:38,110
But you can't see any of the faces.

834
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,610
Just look at me on the stage.

835
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,880
I'm a stakeholder too...

836
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,079
with 10 shares of the company,
after all.

837
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,150
Only 10?

838
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,389
Shall we?

839
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:52,650
Wait a second.

840
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,730
I'll let you borrow my coat.

841
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:06,400
Make sure to give it back to me
after you use it.

842
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,179
Hey, hey, hey.

843
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:20,820
There are a lot less people
than I thought.

844
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,920
It's starting at two.

845
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,889
Unless someone who has
over 100,000 shares shows up,

846
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:27,389
the meeting might be canceled.

847
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,000
That woman has to come.

848
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:38,099
The board of directors believes that
conniving assault...

849
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,269
in the workplace
is an irresponsible action...

850
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,300
that encourages abuse of power...

851
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,369
and depresses
the morale of the employees.

852
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,809
Therefore, we suggest the
resignation of Director Do Min Ik...

853
00:56:47,809 --> 00:56:50,650
for the agenda
of today's stockholders' meeting.

854
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,679
Sir.

855
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,050
(TnT Mobile
Extraordinary Stockholders' Meeting)

856
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,989
Yes, please go ahead.

857
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:04,559
I would like to hear Director Do's
stance regarding the matter.

858
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,739
This is unfair.

859
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:18,309
I second the motion.

860
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:32,289
Ma'am.

861
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,989
Good to see you here.

862
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:36,260
How did you...

863
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,059
It seemed like something fun was
going on in this company.

864
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:41,000
So I came to watch the fun.

865
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,730
Oh, no.

866
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,300
If he sees her...

867
00:57:47,139 --> 00:57:48,869
See whom?

868
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:51,369
Well...

869
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,880
I know this could sound weird,

870
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,750
but if you're here just for fun,

871
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,780
could you please just leave?

872
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:04,849
For you, it might be
just a fun thing to watch.

873
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:07,059
But my life is on the line.

874
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,789
It really sounds weird...

875
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,559
and I don't want to leave.

876
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:13,059
Besides,

877
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,730
how many times have I told you
that you have to use people?

878
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:19,730
I have no idea
how many shares you have,

879
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,139
if you want to help your boss,

880
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:24,539
or if you want to take down
your boss.

881
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,309
But whatever it is, do you think
you have enough votes for it?

882
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:30,610
I, on the other hand,

883
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:34,519
can cut off your boss' neck
and put it back...

884
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:37,219
with just one finger.

885
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,719
I can twist and squeeze his neck.

886
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,920
I can do anything I want.

887
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:45,460
What do you say?

888
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:47,199
Do you still want me to leave?

889
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,030
As the stakeholders suggested,

890
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,469
we're going to hear
Director Do Min Ik's stance.

891
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:03,380
Should I leave?

892
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,579
I can see faces.
