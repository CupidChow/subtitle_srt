00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,360
Hello.

2
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,600
Hello.  Hi.  Hello.

3
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,460
Hello.  How are you?

4
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,820
Hello.  Hi.

5
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,610
Hello.

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,950
Mr. Baek Gi!  Have you seen Jang Geu Rae?

7
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,770
No, I haven't.

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,120
Did you hear about Manager Park?

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,550
I guess you haven't heard.
Did you know that Jang Geu Rae just...

10
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,850
Jang Geu Rae.  Jang Geu Rae.  What on earth happened?

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,260
Thank you.

12
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,530
It was nothing.

13
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,140
Wh-wh-what?  What is it?

14
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,490
What is it?  What is it?  What is it?

15
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,480
The audit team is here.

16
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,610
<i>Incomplete Life (Misaeng)</i>

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,650
<i>Episode 11</i>

18
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,300
Manager Oh, we will be taking Manager Park's things.

19
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,870
Yes.  Yes.

20
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,560
Take the laptop, too.

21
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,720
What's going to happen to Manager Park?

22
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,550
They say this is the biggest corruption case since the company's founding.

23
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,500
What will happen to the Department Head?

24
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,550
<i>Our fear came true.</i>

25
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,240
<i>Resource Team 2's Manager Jeong
was called in as a witness.</i>

26
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,450
<i>[Audit Team]
Manager Park's supervisors at the time,
Senior Managers Jo Won Jin </i>

27
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,190
<i>and Shin Jae Yoon, were called in.</i>

28
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,630
<i>Even Managing Director Kim Seok Man
had to be investigated.</i>

29
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,660
<i>And...</i>

30
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,580
<i>Department Head Kim could not dodge responsibility.</i>

31
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,490
F-f-for-give me this once, Executive Director.

32
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,730
Hey, Jong Sik.

33
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,330
Yes, Executive Director.

34
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,470
What's with this trivial incident, eh?

35
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,510
As a trading company man, one can
become a crook or a gambler at times.

36
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,920
Yes, you're quite right about that.

37
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,320
In trying to achieve one's objective, one has to sully...

38
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,420
I appreciate what you did during my daughter's wedding.

39
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,040
Sir?  Oh, not at all.

40
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,530
I bet you came straight [to the ceremony] from the airport.

41
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,820
I can recall how you came running all out of breath.

42
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,880
Ah... yes.  As I was rushing back from a business trip...

43
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,910
That's right.  Jong Sik,
you were that kind of kid.

44
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,530
Even if you were to be a bit late,
you never once missed anything.

45
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,440
Unfortunately... I see you're late this time.

46
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,540
By a lot.

47
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,390
<i>Gosh. </i>

48
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,990
<i>Good grief.</i>

49
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,210
<i>I heard Director Kim handed in his resignation already.
So, these are not transfers, but  demotions.</i>
[Dir. Kim, Dept. Head Kim, Sr. Mgrs. Jo & Shin - transferred.]

50
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:04,510
Really?  Jeez, this could cut
Executive Director Choi's team in half!

51
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,760
Department Head.

52
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,580
I'll call you when I get settled.  Buy me a drink.

53
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,570
Alright.  Do your best.

54
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,680
Assistant Manager Lee.

55
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,060
Ms. Cha Yeong Yi.

56
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,770
Assistant Hwang, I heard you set the wedding date.

57
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,920
- Yes, Sir.
- Alright then I'll see you at the wedding.

58
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,510
Thank you, Sir.

59
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,500
You should get married soon, too. Right?

60
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,430
Thanks for your help, Ms. Min Ha.

61
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,820
Assistant Manager Lee.

62
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,470
Alright then.

63
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,460
<i>Hello, Sir!  I'm new recruit Oh Sang Sik!</i>

64
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,420
<i>I'm Assistant Manager Kim Bu Ryeon.</i>

65
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,470
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

66
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,960
<i>Thank you, Sir.  Thank you!  I'll ship the product right away!</i>

67
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,580
<i>Yes!  Yes!  Thank you!</i>

68
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,820
<i>Oh Sang Sik, YOU ROCK!</i>

69
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,940
<i>Thank you!  Thank you!</i>

70
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,180
<i>Let's go for a hike on the mountain.
The Executive Director will be there as well.</i>

71
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,960
<i>Ah, right.  I completely forgot
I have an alumni meeting this weekend.</i>

72
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,330
<i>Have you no desire to change this habit of yours
of passing up  golden opportunities?</i>

73
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,480
<i>What is this commotion?  Why did you hit someone?!</i>

74
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,500
<i>What are you going to do about this?
What are you going to do?!</i>

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,230
<i>Please convey my regards to F'off.</i>

76
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,320
<i>Manager Oh!!!</i>

77
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,790
<i>Hey!</i>

78
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,180
<i>Alright.  It's good.</i>

79
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,590
<i>You can just go with the completed project.
Manager Oh is in the process of developing it.</i>

80
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,610
<i>Let's put our effort into help him out.
I attended all your kids' first birthday parties!
(Korean custom: celebrates one year of life, predicts child's future by choice of pencil, knife, money, noodle etc.)</i>

81
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,890
<i>Get the health checkup again, and find a big
Middle East deal to work on for your next project.</i>

82
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,210
<i>Ah, wait a second.  Take this.</i>

83
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,240
<i>It's dried eel that I bought to give to a buyer.</i>

84
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,560
<i>You take it.</i>

85
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,480
<i>Truly unfortunate and sad . . .</i>

86
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,330
<i>when I lost a game of baduk
by just half a house, unfortunately and sadly.</i>

87
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,900
<i>Even if one wins in a small "Sa-hwal"
("a life or death" move in baduk) battle . . .</i>

88
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,730
<i>Even if you finally win the "Pae" battle,
(players' stones are interlocked surrounding the opponent's stones)</i>

89
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,600
<i>I wondered what good it all was,
if, in the end, the game was lost.</i>

90
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,830
<i>However if I were to win by merely half a house,
I would see another world.</i>

91
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,640
<i>You're thankful for the pieces that stayed alive against
the opponent's threat and enabled your victory by half a house,</i>

92
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,250
<i>and grateful for each move that earned you points
by knocking down [the opponent] little by little.</i>

93
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,800
<i>One's best, that is true to each moment,</i>

94
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,970
<i>makes the half-house victory a possibility.</i>

95
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,660
<i>To lose a moment</i>

96
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,170
<i>is to lose the whole and be defeated.</i>

97
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,510
<i>From when did you start to lose moments?</i>

98
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,650
Excuse me, Executive Director.

99
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,290
Yes?

100
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,550
In Business and Sales Team 3, there's...

101
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,510
Welcome.

102
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,410
Uh?  Mr. President!

103
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,320
Mr. President.

104
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,730
I've been briefed on how the Business and Sales Team 3 accomplished such an important task.

105
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,780
Thank you.

106
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:37,300
Here. These are special bonuses.
Our CEO prepared them personally.

107
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,330
Thank you.

108
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,290
Thank you.

109
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,150
How long have you been working as a manager?

110
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,710
It's been seven years.

111
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:07,560
We must rush. It's been delayed for a long time.

112
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,950
Oh, Dong Sik.

113
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,290
- You've worked hard.
- Thank you.

114
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,040
What are you doing here so suddenly  without any warning?

115
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,030
Oh... Executive Director Choi. They've completed
a huge deal!  Rewarding those who deserve it,

116
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,700
and reprimanding those who need
to be reprimanded, isn't that my duty?

117
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,900
Yes.

118
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,940
Oh, Geu Rae... I've heard you played
a big part on this project.

119
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,670
Not at all.

120
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,250
For once more, reflect back on your work,
instead of just rushing to get home.

121
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,930
Then, you'll be able to reduce your mistakes.

122
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,800
It has been my habitual routine,
ever since I was a rookie.

123
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,870
Thank you.

124
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,460
- Manager.
- What?

125
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,080
It looks like you're going to be
a Senior Manager next year.

126
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,100
What kind of useless...

127
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,160
Promote Manager Oh as a second-year Senior Manager.

128
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,720
Yes, Sir.  We will make that happen
at the beginning of the year.

129
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,810
When is the personnel appointment period
for the second half of the year?

130
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,990
It's one week away.

131
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:35,080
Do it at that time.  How else would a company man be compensated if it's not for his salary and well deserved promotion?

132
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,700
Aigoo. Mr. President.

133
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,990
So you are in charge of the Business and Sales Team
until Department Head Kim's successor is selected?

134
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,160
Oh, yes.

135
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
I see.

136
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,600
Good bye, sir.

137
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,840
Executive Director...

138
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,220
Good bye, sir.

139
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,990
Children! Your Dad is getting a promotion!

140
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,020
- Really?
- Really?

141
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,570
Really?

142
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,630
Do you guys even know what a promotion is?

143
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,310
Don't know!

144
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,280
Dad is going to be a senior manager.

145
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,800
Hey, hey. Do you guys know what a senior manager is?

146
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,990
We don't.

147
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,230
Why are you all excited when you
don't even know what it is?

148
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,280
You are in a good mood, Dad!

149
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,820
Mom, too!  So we're feeling good, too!

150
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,100
Freeze! Sit!

151
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,100
Oh, that's right.

152
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,470
This is our team's special bonus.

153
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,480
Special bonus? Wow!

154
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,560
Sit back.

155
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,810
Were there that many things we needed money for?

156
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,310
Since the kids are growing,
there're many things they must do.

157
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,810
- Give me your wallet.
- Why?

158
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,260
Spend it on reasonable things.

159
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,450
I can use my card.

160
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,340
At some point, you might need to pay,
at least, someone's cab fare.

161
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,450
When a man's wallet looks empty, it doesn't look good.

162
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,630
It's a trend nowadays to carry a thin wallet.
People don't carry cash around much.

163
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,460
Then just give it back...

164
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,990
Well, no... since I'm not a man who follow trends.

165
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,800
Let's see how much... Wow!
Should we order and eat pizza?

166
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,530
<i>Announcement of Personnel Appointments</i>

- Yes, I did.

If it's not reported, we won't be guaranteed
compensation, in case of an accident.

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,070
- You've got it, right?
- Yes.

171
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,070
Let's go, Senior Manager.

172
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,570
After I read the report from the Research Center.

173
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,570
<i>Manager Oh, no, Senior Manager Oh...</i>

174
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,370
<i>hasn't changed.  He still seems
careless and meticulous at the same time.</i>

175
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,010
<i>It was quiet in Business and Sales Team 3.</i>

176
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:02,630
<i>No one has mentioned about
Manager Park's incident and kept quiet.</i>

177
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,710
<i>It's probably because what our team accomplished is</i>

178
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,440
<i>sad and unfortunate, rather than joyous.</i>

179
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,830
<i>So I think we are taking refuge in work.</i>

180
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,470
<i>Senior Manager Oh spoke even less (than normal).</i>

181
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,590
<i>That's why there is nothing else to do other than work.</i>

182
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,160
<i>Even though we cannot feel the changes within our team,</i>

183
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,260
<i>as soon as we walk out to the hallway,
we can feel the others' stares.</i>

184
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,490
<i>What Business and Sales Team 3 did was not just
punish someone on the team who was neglecting his duty,</i>

185
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,300
<i>but it ended up cutting out the
infection that was festering in the company.</i>

186
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:51,000
<i>But our team was looked upon unfavorably for whistle-blowing.</i>

187
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,870
<i>Why couldn't you take care of it quietly?</i>

188
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,070
<i>How can you benefit by abandoning your colleague?</i>

189
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,400
<i>Are you guys all that clean?</i>

190
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:08,200
<i>Sympathetic messages toward the directors,
who either resigned  or were demoted, spread via the company intranet.</i>

191
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,530
<i>However, no one would deny...</i>

192
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,320
<i>the fact that this situation had to be dealt with.</i>

193
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,720
<i>Senior Manager Oh called us aside.</i>

194
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,380
From now on, it'll become a bit more uncomfortable.

195
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,940
Do not respond to that. The important thing is,

196
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,190
we did what we had to do.

197
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,860
Let's not lose sight of that.

198
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,000
<i>Senior Manager Oh gave us a guideline.</i>

199
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,450
<i>We agreed.  All that's left to do is to hang in there.</i>

200
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,540
Hey, Assistant Manager Ha.  I heard Ahn Yeong Yi tried to transfer the fertilizers all by herself that day.

201
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,970
- How did you know?
- You know Han Seok Yool from the Textile Team...

202
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,900
He's been telling his colleagues all about it.

203
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,450
He was cussing you out.

204
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,450
Ah, I told you Ahn Yeong Yi is scary!

205
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,670
What?  I'm actually beginning to feel proud of...

206
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,860
Hey, you are good in Russian, right?

207
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,030
Be in charge of Russian certification agencies.

208
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,160
Excuse me?

209
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,900
I've never seen such a vicious person
like you in my life!

210
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,440
If I left you alone, you'd just create
all kinds of ruckus and bring down our team.

211
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,910
Oh. Thank you.

212
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,650
I'm not going to go easy on you,
just because you're a woman.

213
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,280
I'll work hard.

Why are you reviewing the TF report
that the Finance Department has already approved?

216
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,420
Did I do something wrong?

217
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,450
It's a bit long-winded.  You need to make it clearer.

218
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,200
Long-winded?

219
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,850
Yes.

220
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,050
In what way?

221
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,580
There are numerous non-professional terminologies.

222
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,520
Most of all, if you thought of this as your own project,
you would have understood it much more subjectively.

223
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,630
And, that's the only way you can control the sentences.

224
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,760
Or else you become long-winded like this.

225
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,320
Yes, I understand.

226
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,730
You don't know well, do you?

227
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,870
Excuse me?

228
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,840
Try shortening it.

229
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,090
What the hell is he saying is so long-winded?

230
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,840
When I look at it, there's not much difference
from here to there.

231
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,430
What is he saying are non-professional terms?

232
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,400
I've already had that much training, too.

Senior Manager.

251
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,480
- Yes?
- Just a moment.

252
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,590
Department Head Ma asked me to do something in regards to the Cheonggukjang (fermented bean paste) account.

253
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,620
What is it?

254
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,830
The thing is... I can't understand
what on earth he's talking about.

255
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,870
<i>Hey, about this right here...</i>

256
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,250
<i>If we are to export to America,
shouldn't there be a certification for sure?</i>

258
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,520
<i>For food items... In US... what was it?</i>

259
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,710
<i>Well... FTA... what is it?
[He means FDA Food &  Drug Administration, not FTA]</i>

260
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,060
<i>The thing, you know. The thing.</i>

261
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,060
<i>Aish, why can't I think of it?</i>

262
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,050
<i>There's the thing!</i>

263
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,720
<i>The thing! The thing! You don't know?</i>

264
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,510
<i>Why can't you understand?</i>

265
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,720
<i>Go and look for it!</i>

266
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,200
<i>If you mean the FTA... Are you talking about
the Korean-American FTA (Free Trade Agreement)?</i>

267
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,920
<i>What kind of certification do we need from there?</i>

268
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,230
<i>Not free trade agreements!</i>

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,320
<i>How can a bastard like you, who can't even
understand a person's words, come into One International?!</i>

<i>Which college did you graduate from?!</i>

00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:30,690
<i>This is why you have to look at the colleges

<i>You're on Senior Manager Seon's team, aren't you?</i>

00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,090
<i>Yes.</i>

274
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,370
<i>This is why a woman can't become a team leader!</i>

<i>Find it! Go and find it!</i>

276
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,800
I have no idea what on earth he's asking for.

277
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,980
Give me the documents. I'll try talking to him about it.

278
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,710
Is there a certification that must be obtained
for cheonggukjang (fermented bean paste) exports?

279
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:57,580
Or are you talking about FTA qualifications?

280
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,470
You know... those qualifications or "whatever" certifications.

281
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,590
What on earth would be the "what" in the "whatever?"

282
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:12,180
That... we have to receive a food item certification
if we want to export living items.

283
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,720
Living items?
(<i>He should be saying "organic", not  "living".</i>)

284
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,780
Is cheonggukjang some squid or octopus?

285
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,560
What?

286
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,810
Since you reviewed it, you should know.
But fundamentally the manufacturing process chart,

287
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,990
Certificate of Analysis, residual pesticide inspection,

288
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,310
sulfuric acid allowed usage, in additional to E. coli inspection . . .

289
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,180
It's the completed profile of cheonggukjang,
which has fulfilled all tests and inspections required.

290
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,990
We've confirmed its manufacturing process
and even had a sample inspection.

291
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,410
What on earth are the  other certifications and
what other qualifications do we have to fulfill?

292
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,170
If perhaps you remember that "whatever",

293
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,960
tell us again at that time about that "whatever."

294
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,650
For now, our team is proceeding according to schedule.

295
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,260
Hey!

296
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,940
I was easy on you because you are a woman,

297
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,320
but tell your husband "thank you"

298
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,770
for living with someone like you.

299
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,720
For a second case of sexual harassment
it won't end with just a pay cut.

300
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,440
What?

301
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,040
What did you say?

302
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,530
Hey!

303
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,230
Aigoo, that...

304
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,460
Department Head Ma says he'll tell us separately
if he needs anything more,

305
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,180
so you can just proceed as planned.

306
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,700
From now on I'll take care of anything needing his decision,

307
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,250
so turn over all matters where he calls to assign tasks.

308
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,450
Yes.

309
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,980
Earlier when you were speaking to Senior Manager Oh...

310
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,430
Did he not say who is assigned to go to Team 3?

311
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,980
There's a rumor that an assistant manager will go there.

312
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,730
Why?

313
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,430
I don't want to go to Business and Sales Team 3.
I want to keep working under you a long time.

314
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,890
I can't send you, Assistant Manager Cha.

315
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,320
Senior Manager, the person to go to Business and Sales Team 3 has been decided.

316
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,300
<i>From the office of the Manager of Human Resources</i>

317
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,600
It's turned out well. They say Manager Cheon is coming.

318
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,320
What kind of person is he?

319
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,230
Don't worry, he's a normal person.

320
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:45,060
He's not a Middle East expert like Manager Park,
but he does have a lot of experience in the Middle East.

321
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,310
He was originally in Business and Sales Team 3.

322
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,840
Manager Cheon came as an experienced hire,
so it was his first division.

323
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,370
In my case, after suffering under an irritating supervisor,

324
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,210
I came during a time when I was completely frayed.
So  we relied on each other a lot.

325
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,740
We cheered each other on, working under Senior Manager Oh,
and did very well.

326
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,720
There are a lot of good memories.

327
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,700
What's the difference between an experienced hire
and an open recruitment hire?

328
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,410
First of all, he doesn't have fellow colleagues
who started at the same time like you do.

329
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,940
So he wouldn't have colleagues to
open up his heart and talk to.

330
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,760
His foundation in the position is weak, too.

331
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,530
In this kind of atmosphere,
that he's willing to come to our department,

332
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,310
did he miss the good old times?

333
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,410
Your belly's come out, you know.

334
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Oh!

335
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,060
Manager Cheon! You're already here?

336
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,540
Yes, Kim Dong Sik.

337
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,570
No, it's Assistant Manager Kim. Have you been well?

338
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,360
- Yes.
- Oh, Manager Cheon! You're here!

339
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,570
Oh, Senior Manager. I came early to greet you.

340
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,210
- I ask you to take good care of me.
- What's with the formality?

341
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,600
Oh my word, he's become strange.

342
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,850
He's a new employee in our team.

343
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,350
- Yes.
- Hello, I'm Jang Geu Rae.

344
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:57,220
- It's nice to meet you.
- You came to give your greetings and even organized your desk.

345
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,890
With the boxes. Do you want to use this desk, Manager Cheon?

346
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:07,260
Yes. Well, I'll go settle up my previous team
and then come back.

347
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,360
<i>Manager Cheon Gwan Woong. 37 years old.</i>

348
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,760
This is my desk though.

349
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,280
<i>As soon as he came, he started by organizing his desk. </i>

350
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,620
<i>All his office supplies have found their place,
as if they had originally been there. </i>

351
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,080
<i>The person who comes, after a person like Manager Park has gone,</i>

352
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,620
<i>different than the relative ease we'd anticipated,</i>

353
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,160
<i>is someone who provokes a peculiar tension. </i>

354
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,860
- Dong Sik.
- Yes.

355
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,730
Take Jang Geu Rae to the Living Essentials Team
and bring me some samples.

356
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,570
Yes.

357
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,330
Assistant Manager.

358
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,690
What about the polyester?

359
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,340
Why should I do that?

360
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,310
Hey, taking the half day off and getting some fresh air should be enough.  What are you still so bent out of shape about?

361
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:37,410
Didn't I tell you before that it was your job?

362
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,620
Hey, Han Seok Yool, come here.

363
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,200
- Is this right?
- What is it?

364
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,060
Where you should have written "Banker's Usance,"
you wrote "Shipper's Usance."

365
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,630
There is an instance in the polyester account
that uses this exact term!

366
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,840
If you'd had the training I told you to get,
would you get stuff like this wrong, huh?!

367
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,310
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

368
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,790
I will correct it.

369
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,240
This isn't something that can be fixed  by correcting it!

370
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,230
Listen well to what I'm about to say.

371
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,740
People learn from mistakes.

372
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,090
I wish you'd acknowledge my sincerity a bit.

373
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,460
Just read some self-improvement books,
see what they say about good seniors in the workplace.

374
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,940
Don't ever be confused again.

375
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,730
Banker's and shipper's.  Hey, you're not gonna pay
the interest (caused by the error), are you?

376
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,380
It's more than your monthly salary.
I don't have the money, either.

377
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,130
Here, banker's and shipper's, okay?

378
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:44,060
In case of banker's usance payment,
the importer will pay its interest,

379
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,350
and for shipper's usance,
the exporter will pay it, though...

380
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,690
Han Seok Yool has finally met his match.

381
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,890
- It won't be easy for him
to beat Assistant Manager Seong, though.
- Pardon?

382
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:01,190
By the way, how can you memorize the
trade terminology so well, Jang Geu Rae?

383
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,570
A.O.G. <i>(Arrival of goods)</i>

384
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,680
It means that the starting time of discount
or payment will be when the goods have arrived.

385
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,300
See?  There is no hesitation.
You're like a vending machine.

386
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,690
I just pushed the button, beep, beep!

387
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,170
If you put the terms on a train, based on their relationships,
it's easy to memorize.  Baduk is the same way.

388
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:23,620
So, by your reasoning, you must understand
the core of the business plan as well, right?

389
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,370
If you keep following the content of the plan,
the scale or characteristics of the contractors

390
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,020
can reveal itself, so it would be easy to figure out.
However,

391
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,240
you always ask over and over again,
although you see them every day.

392
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,820
You do...

393
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,200
I mean, you should do well,
Vending Machine, okay?

394
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,700
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

395
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,310
Assistant Manager Kang,
that guy must have ordered it again.

396
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,470
Pardon me...?

397
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:07,300
Well, it's called "summarizing a sentence."
He always gives that to a newbie.

398
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,090
But once you do it, you can make a good report;
compact and easy to understand at a glance.

399
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,330
What...?

400
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,840
You said it can help for a good report...
But why didn't you teach me that?

401
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,290
Don't worry. I will make you vomit writing reports.
<i>(meaning "will make you write so many reports")</i>

402
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,690
<i>(in Russian) Is this Mr. Vladimir Mikhailovich Andreyev?</i>

403
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,320
<i>I'm calling about the report you sent,
because it's a bit different from what we requested.</i>

404
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,530
<i>The emission is supposed to be
calculated in "ton" of CO2 conversion, </i>

405
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:49,410
<i>but the unit used in your report is different
from the conversion unit we requested. </i>

406
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,430
<i>Did you send the wrong one?</i>

407
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,030
<i>Alright, then please correct it. </i>

408
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,870
- Well, Ahn Yeong Yi?
- Yes?

409
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,450
On your way, go to the shoe repair shop
and get my shoes back.

410
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,240
On your way back, buy a pack
of cigarettes for me, too.

411
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,210
You know what I usually smoke, right?  Last time,
you bought the wrong one with mint flavor; not menthol.

412
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,260
Why do you make her run such errands
when she's working?

413
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,830
She said she needs to send an e-mail.

414
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,100
Well... Would it be alright if I go
after copying one document?

415
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,190
She's really...

416
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,280
- Yeong Yi.
- Mr. Jang...

417
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,310
Your fly is open.
<i> (Korean idiom: The South Gate is open.)</i>

418
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,810
I gladly accept your bow.

419
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:27,880
What inconsiderate people you are... Your colleague
fell into a swamp, how could you laugh like that, eh?

420
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,870
Mr. Han!

421
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,530
What are you doing here?

422
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,510
You guys... What makes you feel so great?

423
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,820
- What...?
- I'm not feeling that great, though.

424
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:50,160
Shall we colleagues go out for some drinks tonight?

425
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,000
A superior who openly oppresses . . .
A superior who openly "pickles cabbages" . . .

426
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,600
A superior who openly...

427
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,790
Among bad superiors,
do you know who is the worst?

428
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,300
A superior who uses his/her junior employee!

429
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:20,060
Exploits his junior, dumps his work on his junior,
takes credit for the junior's achievements.

430
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,600
But do you know a superior who is even worse than that?

431
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,590
A superior who doesn't know...

432
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,760
One who doesn't know what he's doing.
No, pretends not to know.  No, he's...

433
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,680
In my opinion, he's pretending he doesn't know.
And, all other people are fooled by that.

434
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,210
How can they be fooled by that?
Are they all so "pure" (naive)?

435
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,240
Especially, our Manager Moon.

436
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,950
Is he blind or is he deaf?

437
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,640
Wow... seriously...

438
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,820
Pick up... the phone.

439
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,370
Answer the phone.

440
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,790
- Yes.
<i>- Seok Yool.  Han Seok Yool!</i>

441
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,180
What?

442
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,800
<i>- I was wrong. </i>

443
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,150
<i>These days, I've thought about it.  </i>

444
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,260
<i>When you're acting like this...
There must be some reason for it.</i>

445
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,840
<i>But this Hyung... didn't care about you enough. </i>

446
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,630
<i>Have a drink with me.</i>

447
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:19,200
<i>Ah, let's talk about it seriously, I mean.
Right now!</i>

448
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,420
<i>You punk!  Seok Yool!</i>

449
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,050
Where are you now?

450
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,360
Ah, get out.

451
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,110
Get out!

452
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,860
Why are you drinking alone, pitifully?

453
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,990
Seok Yool!  Seok Yool!!

454
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,500
Come sit, sit!  Sit down!

455
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,700
Have a seat, come on.

456
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,580
Mr. Han, seriously...

457
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,140
I know, right?  Seriously...

458
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,960
- Shall we go now?
- What?  Yes.

459
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,890
Ah, Mr. Jang Geu Rae...

460
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,270
Your zipper... is opened.

461
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:27,020
I'm not going to be fooled again.

462
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,150
But this time, it's true.

463
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,190
I accept your bow!

464
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,440
Let's go.

465
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,300
That girl is... really...

466
00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:00,000
Since I'm a man too, if you assign me
some work openly, I understand that as a man.

467
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,980
To a newbie, what is "my work" or "your work"?

468
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,920
EVERYthing is your work, Seok Yool.

469
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,270
So, as I said, if you order me, I will do it.

470
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:15,530
So, everything is your work.
Not mine, but your work!

471
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:21,170
So, you make me do all the work,
in order to teach me, right?

472
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,260
- I said, I understand.
- What I'm saying is, I'm telling you now, you punk!

473
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,750
It's not my work, but your work!

474
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,620
Your. Work.

475
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,650
You punk, now that I see you,
you really look like a sociopath.

476
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,130
Saying the same thing, over and over again.

477
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:43,990
S-s-sociopath?

478
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,140
Am I... Am I a sociopath?

479
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,050
So, I'm...

480
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:05,100
I want to be mentored by you, and to learn
properly while working, just like other newbies.

481
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:12,270
That's why... Seok Yool, that's all the work
you have to do.  Not mine, but your work!!

482
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:18,020
So, I'm not saying I won't do thoughtlessly.
I will, I'm going to do! I will.

483
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:23,930
But you can't take credit for the work I do,
and just give me only the responsibility.

484
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,220
Yes, so...

485
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,210
I think this is the part you have to consider.

486
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,540
- Seok Yool.
- Yes.

487
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:47,500
- You really seem like a sociopath.
- HEY, ASSISTANT MANAGER SEONG, (without honorific)
LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE...!!

488
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,310
Did you just talk down to me, huh?

489
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,930
Wha... what...? No, no...

490
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,070
Ha, you bastard, really...

491
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,030
I thought you were a sociopath,
but now I see you're a psychopath.

492
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,190
Psy...

493
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,590
Psychopath...?

494
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:16,540
Ah, really, I can't drink with you, you bastard.
You ruined my appetite for alcohol.

495
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,090
Damn...

496
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,240
Wait...

497
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,680
- Please pay the bill.
- What...?

498
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,770
Please pay the bill.

499
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,340
<i>Total: 564,000 won (about USD 564)</i>

500
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,280
Ah, this f***ing a$$####, that d***h@@@, really...

501
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,650
Argh, f***, you think of me an idiot, f***...

502
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,910
Take this, you've worked hard.

503
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,900
F***...

504
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,590
It's gotten cold at night.

505
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,940
Shall I give you my jacket?

506
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,130
No, I'm fine.

507
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,270
Thank you.

508
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,410
When you get a girlfriend,
you will be loved, Mr. Jang.

509
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:18,020
- What girlfriend...
- Why are you so embarrassed? We're all grown-ups.

510
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,510
Who... who was embarrassed?
It's because it's hot. I feel hot now.

511
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,990
Fall will end soon,
and winter will come and go.

512
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,370
Soon spring will come.

513
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,510
While the time passes, soon it will have been
a year since we started working.

514
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,350
What?

515
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,890
You said, "we."

516
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,340
What...?

517
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,600
<i>Your kid...</i>

518
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,480
<i>He put the glue on our document and lost it.
But only "my" kid got scolded for that!
(in Korean, "woori" means "we, our, us," but can be used for "my") </i>

519
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,370
<i>"My kid"... That's what he called me. </i>

520
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,780
<i>My... kid...</i>

521
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,690
<i>Last spring, </i>

522
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,910
<i>that "my" ("we")...</i>

523
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,230
I was hungry for it.

524
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,910
Soon, it will be spring again,
then it will have been a year,

525
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,450
that "we" have worked.

526
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,700
Ah, it's hot.

527
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,160
Oh, your ears turned red again.

528
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,470
Ah, when I feel hot, my ears turn red.

529
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,240
I see.

530
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,200
But it's true.

540
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,050
Good morning, Manager.

541
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,060
I'm also a member of Sales Team 3 as of today.

542
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,350
Good morning, Sir.

543
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,000
Oh.

544
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,240
Mr. Jang Geu Rae.

545
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,390
Yes.

546
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:28,590
The one I'm going to give the most orders to
will probably be you, right?

547
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:33,160
- Yes.
- I'm not a formal person, so let's work comfortably.

548
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,290
- For work style, we can adjust to each other.
- Yes.

549
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,200
Thank you.

550
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,000
Ah, by the way...

551
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,190
Well...

552
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,540
What are you going to do with your hair?

553
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,770
- What...?
- It's too long.

554
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:49,670
In my opinion, you'd better have a hair cut
so your back hair doesn't touch the collar.

555
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,340
Your front hair too.
What do you think?

556
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,020
I will keep it neat.

557
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,980
So, you're saying you'll have it cut, right?

558
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,920
Manager Cheon, you act
like a high school principal.

559
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,230
Is it something like "hair style control in 70's/80's"?

560
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,950
Well...

561
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,740
- Assistant Manager Kim.
- Yes.

562
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,890
- Let me have your briefing, please.
- Yes.

563
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,300
Let's go to a meeting room.

564
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,380
I can give it to you here.

565
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,210
I'd like to have a conversation to get you caught up.
Can't you take a hint?

566
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,560
Ah, I got it, Manager Cheon.
You're trying to "taste" our team, right?
<i>(meaning "check a little in advance")</i>

567
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,120
Hey, I already know Senior Manager
Oh's style, so what taste?

568
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,440
Yes.

569
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,320
I will be back soon.

570
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,140
Are you playing with me?

571
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,350
- What...?
- Is the company a joke to you?

572
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,870
Am I your friend?

573
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,510
No.

574
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,590
With a new person on the team,
you'd better be a bit nervous.

575
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,500
Yes.

576
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:52,930
The happy memories of hard work that you and
I went through three years ago, let them go.

577
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,860
Don't carry it forever, that's so pathetic.

578
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,370
Pardon?

579
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,320
Yes.

580
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,740
Well...

581
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,650
Manager Cheon...

582
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:08,550
About you joining our team...
Is there another reason for it?

583
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,470
Is there?

584
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,840
At least I have no reason.

585
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,470
Although I'm not sure why they sent me here.

586
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,880
There might be no one who approaches your team,

587
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,470
but you should know
some people are keeping an eye on you.

588
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,420
That they are glaring at you.

589
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:40,030
If you doubt me, I will act as you doubt.

590
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,970
So, don't think otherwise.

591
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,790
You guys didn't do anything wrong.
You did a good job.

592
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:58,350
But being near people like you guys
is uncomfortable, you know.

593
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:04,720
I haven't been given any instructions yet,
but if he ever needs me, he'll probably call.

594
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,410
Anyhow, I'm set in my ways, so adjust to it.

595
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,180
Why...

596
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:14,330
Why did he send you?

597
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,370
I'm going crazy.

598
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,370
Excuse me?

599
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,880
He sent me because you and I are close.

600
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:27,620
Since he's not sure what would happen if he sent someone
you weren't close to that might get filtered through you.

601
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,650
Let's work together appropriately well.

602
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:42,590
<i>Timing and subtitles by The Office Grunts Team @ Viki</i>
<i>Resync by Drafeir</i>

603
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,210
Senior Manager, you're here.

604
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,340
Oh, you came?

605
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,460
Let's see the work progress chart, Assistant Manager Kim.

606
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,290
Yes, I'll send it right over.

607
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:06,990
<i>Business and Sales Team 3 - Work progress chart.</i>

608
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,900
Who worked on this?

609
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,470
Yes, it's from our team.

610
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,050
This is the Jordanian account that caused Manager Park's "death."

611
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,210
- It's not that, but there was a reason...
- Let's see all the materials again in the afternoon.

612
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,000
- This won't do.
- Ah, I...

613
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,490
- Manager...
- Manager Cheon!

614
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,220
Yes?

615
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:34,010
You're a funny friend.

616
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,180
If you've come to the office, do work.

617
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,140
Don't tire yourself out on useless things.

618
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,160
Do you know why a person falls into a game and flounders?

619
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,550
Excuse me?

620
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,830
He falls in because he's playing a game.

621
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:55,420
If you come to work, but end up playing a game,

622
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,480
you will fall into the game first.

623
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,390
Let's have a drink after we're done.

624
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,120
What is this?

625
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,020
It's the receipt for the alcohol you drank last night.

626
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,470
Ha!

627
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,870
Ah, this guy, seriously.

628
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,900
Seok Yool.

629
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:44,710
I really want to tell you something.

630
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,500
Truthfully, I was going to tell you last night

631
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,950
and I deliberately didn't tell you,
in case your feelings might be hurt.

632
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,910
What is it?

633
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,490
If you want to have a social life,

634
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:00,610
you'll have to make sure to fix that temper of yours.

635
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,610
I'll only tell you once, so listen well.

636
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:09,010
Seeing you last night. You seemed a bit like a sociopath.

637
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,530
Fix it.

638
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:41,510
Sociopath. Sociopath. Sociopath. Sociopath.

639
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:58,880
<i>Most of all, if you thought of this as your own project,
you would have understood it much more subjectively.</i>

640
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,730
<i>That's the only way you can control the sentences.</i>

641
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:11,400
Control the sentences.

642
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:23,630
It's long, too long. Shorter. Shorter.

643
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,590
Ramadan.

644
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:52,720
If the second sentence is long, the entire latter part becomes...

645
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,700
Like this...

646
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,800
Here, it's all done now.

647
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,310
You can just dip it in cheese as you eat it.

648
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,970
Here, the alcohol is here.

649
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:13,030
But you used to always come with just two dreary gentlemen.

650
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:15,480
Aigoo, how did you come with such handsome young men?

651
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,980
Thank you.

652
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,980
Eat it deliciously.

653
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,430
Manager Cheon, do you still drink by yourself
after getting off work?

654
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,920
- At times.
- Manager Cheon was famous.

655
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,110
He'd drink like that and then go home and drink more alone.

656
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:32,650
No matter how much you like alcohol, if your drinking sessions for placating someone else's mood, increases too much,

657
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,560
there will be times that you want to drink only for yourself.

658
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,230
That's right.

659
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:44,320
Even if you drink well, if you are dragged here and there,
in order to drink to suit other people's moods,

660
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,100
you miss drinking alone comfortably only in your underwear.

661
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,620
That's true. The beer you drink while only wearing your
underwear and watching baseball is really delicious.

662
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,170
I don't even expect that.

663
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,590
I want to get home at a decent hour
and order the kids rotisserie chicken,

664
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:59,530
and drink a beer next to them.

665
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,770
Let's toast to working well together.
Welcome, Manager Cheon.

666
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,410
Let's work happily together.

667
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,210
- Like old times.
- Like old times!

668
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,870
Like old times.

669
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:17,870
Go ahead and eat.

670
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:24,820
I apologize for having been lost in useless thoughts
before I came to Team 3.

671
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:29,210
As a member of Team 3, I will surely find my place.

672
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,660
Drink.

673
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:40,280
Jang Geu Rae, is there anything
you're curious about or want to ask?

674
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,410
Don't feel burdened and ask.

675
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,460
- Do I have to cut my hair?
- Huh?

676
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,960
Cut it.

677
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,500
If Manager Cheon doesn't answer,
then he's telling you to cut it.

678
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,500
He told me to straighten my hair too.

679
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,470
Cut it.

680
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,570
You, straighten it.

681
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,830
Straighten it, punk!

682
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,490
It's a joke, right?

683
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,980
It's not.

684
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,850
I'm going to have to focus on the visual soon also.

685
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:19,330
Let me start combing my hair, too.

686
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,640
Business and Sales Team 3, for the visual!

687
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,330
Cheers!

688
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,650
You're home?

689
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:43,960
Yes. I just got home.

690
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,550
You're sleeping right away?

691
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,690
What's happened? A person who used to
always have a glass as soon as he got home?

692
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,580
I drank.

693
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,400
Your new team must be all right.
You were worried about the appointment.

694
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,760
What?

695
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,190
Yeah.

696
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,560
- Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.

697
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,150
Senior Manager, we're going to have to prepare
for next year's business proposals.

698
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:41,950
Yes. There aren't any special work matters
this morning, are there?

699
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,150
- Let's start with a meeting.
- Yes, Sir!

700
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:48,430
Jang Geu Rae, I didn't know
you could attend a business proposal meeting for next year.

701
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:52,080
Starting today, we're going to be in continuous meetings.
You would do well to prepare yourself.

702
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,500
Yes, I understand.

703
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,800
- Here, let's go.
-  Yes.

704
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,330
Hello...

705
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,600
Yes, hello.

706
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:09,230
<i>All the teams in the company prepare business proposals,
budget and action plans, for the next year.</i>

707
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:13,420
<i>It's the season when we have to set performance goals.</i>

708
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,780
<i>One business deal is realized
with the cooperation of many departments.</i>

709
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,500
Yes, Assistant Manager Kang is away from...
<i>We have to have rotating meetings
and write up numerous documents.</i>

710
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:30,350
<i>From new deals to deferred project plans,
we review them again,  but...</i>

711
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,540
<i>there aren't any special ideas.</i>

712
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,190
Our food is here.

713
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:57,450
Let's eat first.

714
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,030
Let's eat.

715
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:10,370
Did you guys find anything?

716
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,340
After much thought...

717
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:18,530
how about we look into investment?

718
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:22,480
<i>Business and Sales Team 3 has been working hard for many nights.</i>

719
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,820
Oh my! I feel like I'm going to die.

720
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:30,220
Senior Manager, how many days has it been?

721
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,360
My head is completely blocked!

722
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,740
<i>Should I tell you why your baduk skills aren't improving?</i>

723
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,340
<i>You are too caught up in the rules and examples.</i>

724
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:14,660
<i>Of course, you should think about your moves
and study them properly.</i>

725
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:21,010
<i>But if they were thought of as eternal truths,
would baduk have survived such a long time?</i>

726
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:24,820
<i>Then, what should I do?</i>

727
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:33,590
<i>Break away from tradition!
You have to be unconventional.</i>

728
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,150
<i>Unconventional?</i>

729
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:42,150
<i>Without breaking the rules,
you cannot become a master.</i>

730
00:59:57,330 --> 01:00:01,950
How about the Jordan project?

731
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:22,690
Jang Geu Rae.

732
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,400
What did you just say?

733
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,330
Let's try the Jordan project again.

734
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:37,910
By Jordan project, are you talking about Manager Park's project?

735
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,340
Yes.

736
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,790
Just what are you saying right now?

737
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:47,730
You must not know because you're a newbie,
but you shouldn't steal other people's projects.

738
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:51,450
Don't even bring up the word "Jordan", okay?
At least for the time being.

739
01:00:55,110 --> 01:01:00,330
If we eliminate the corruption from that project,
it seems like an attractive item.

740
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,060
<i>The meeting cooled rapidly.</i>

741
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,090
<i>Why do they look so serious?</i>

742
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,020
Hello.

743
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:34,240
What's wrong with Jang Geu Rae's face?

744
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,960
He must be getting scolded really badly.

745
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:56,250
- W-why did you get scolded?
- I didn't get scolded.

746
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,810
You didn't?

747
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:25,140
Assistant Manager Kang.

748
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,440
It's good.

749
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:49,370
Oh, just a moment.

750
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:33,430
<i>Jang Geu Rae... wow!</i>

751
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:35,900
- What did you say?
- "What did you say, what did you say, what did you say?"

752
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,430
I asked a hundred times.

753
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:41,890
How could Jang Geu Rae come up with an idea like that?

754
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:45,280
He's a friend who really doesn't grasp the situation.

755
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,730
Doesn't he know how his team
is being looked at within the company?

756
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:54,020
They are already being looked at as whistle-blowers.
Everyone is feeling uncomfortable.

757
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,420
He seems like a fierce competitor.

758
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,090
A fierce competitor?

759
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:00,260
I don't know the reason why, but he seems that way sometimes.

760
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,450
- Did you fall for him?
- Excuse me?

761
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,820
Yeong Yi, isn't your estimation of Jang Geu Rae too high?

762
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,550
- Are you jealous?
- Excuse me?

763
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,250
Just why in the world is this kid Jang Geu Rae doing this?

764
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:12,520
What?  I'm bringing everyone down. So what?

765
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,840
I'm about to become twisted.

766
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,350
In any case,

767
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,290
even if it is Senior Manager Oh, he won't consent this time.

768
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,260
And that's also what he must do.

769
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,160
Assistant Manager Seong.

770
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,930
<i>Business and Sales Team 3's meeting has been suspended.</i>

771
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,500
<i> A predictable dispute and</i>

772
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,220
<i>the misunderstandings that can be expected.</i>

773
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,010
<i>Damage beyond expectations can be presumed.</i>

774
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:06,960
<i>Yet, to an unconventional idea uttered by a newbie,
not one person could easily say no.</i>

775
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,050
<i>Even in rejecting a newbie's suggestion,
one needs to be reasonable.</i>

776
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,010
<i>That is what a team is.</i>

777
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:19,900
<i>However, this suggestion is a bit... curious.</i>

778
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,510
<i>Is it that we don't want to do it
or is it not worth doing?</i>

779
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:30,960
<i>Is it something we shouldn't do,
or nevertheless, is it something we can do?</i>

780
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:35,500
<i>Nonetheless, it's something that shouldn't be done.</i>

781
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,260
Everybody knows that there's still business
left to be done (in the area).

782
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,820
However, no one is thinking of taking it on.

783
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,700
Because they don't want to be misunderstood
as taking another team's credit.

784
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,090
Yes.

785
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:50,660
Even the teams that had nothing to do with this are like that.

786
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:56,680
But it's Business and Sales Team 3, the principal players
in the incident, who want to take on the project, right?

787
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,950
That's right.

788
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:01,490
<i>Are you crazy?  That's not right!</i>

789
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,900
<i>Well then, you guys can do it.</i>

790
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:08,690
<i>What?  Did something happen to you
because you got taken in by what a newbie said?</i>

791
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:11,050
<i>Then shall I throw it away?</i>

792
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:16,120
<i>Throw it away.  Throw it away!
There are a lot of other things to do!</i>

793
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,020
<i>If there weren't a lot of other things, would it be okay to do it?</i>

794
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,230
<i>Are you being a smart mouth?</i>

795
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:23,360
<i>Don't do it.  The justification is weak!</i>

796
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,430
Yes, the justification is weak.

797
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:31,020
If you really want to do it, you must guarantee its validity.

798
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:36,830
Rather than it being a project with high profits,
it must have a higher value.

799
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:39,430
So you're saying I need a valid reason, right?

800
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,870
Yup.

801
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,620
Jang Geu Rae.

802
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,060
Yes.

803
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:07,490
Let me ask you just one thing.
Do you find the profit from the Jordan project desirable?

804
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,390
Is that why you don't want to let go of this deal?

805
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:13,250
That's not the only reason.
Although I did think it was a good deal.

806
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:17,000
Then what's the reason you want to take on this deal?

807
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:21,240
Because it feels like our team's work isn't finished yet.

808
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,160
It's unfinished?

809
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:28,580
It feels like we've been insulted.

810
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,120
Insulted?

811
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,820
Everyone in this company, by Manager Park.

812
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,230
The way everything turned out,
whether just reporting him was good enough...

813
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:42,980
Are you saying that wasn't enough?

814
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,480
I think we have unfinished business.

815
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,230
To finish up...

816
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:59,490
To return that project back to the way it was; to make the maximum profit, by best utilizing the company's manuals and system.

817
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:14,800
So you're saying we received insults?
That we got it from Manager Park.

That's right.  It's a good project.

821
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,740
Since you're a newbie...

822

You can think so because you're a newbie

<i>Why are you sending me to Business and Sales Team 3?</i>

833
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:33,520
How can you not be able to grasp the situation?

834
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,500
Hey, you're the one who wanted to do this, right?

835
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,710
<i>- How did Senior Manager Oh get like that?
- In the future, we'll still see each other through work.</i>

836
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,360
I still don't feel comfortable.

837
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,900
- I'm better looking though, aren't I?
- Excuse me?

01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,530
A leopard on Kilimanjaro that only goes after dangerous prey.

839
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:46,450
<i>The Executive Director will think that we're trying to give him crap.</i>

840
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:50,520
But since when were we too scared of maggots to ferment soybean paste? <i>(Don't let little things hinder you from doing your job.)</i>
