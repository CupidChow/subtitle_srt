00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:15,506
We wonder what Hae Joon's
real personality is like.

355
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:32,236
[Q: Is your real personality similar
to your character's role?]

356
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,746
I'd spit on the streets
and litter sometimes.

357
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:23,946
Oh, I shouldn't say that,

358
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:26,966
but I'm not such a goody-goody.

359
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:29,886
I'm different since I like

360
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:33,106
to drink and have fun.

361
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:41,186
Mr. Choi sent Mr. Chun to Sales Team 3.<i></i>

362
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:43,966
Mr. Chun feels conflict
in that situation.<i></i>

363
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:48,506

364
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:52,526

power and beliefs.<i></i>

365
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:56,696
Gosh, life is tough.

366

Nice to meet you.

367
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,666
Mr. Choi's a mysterious character<i></i>

368
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,806

369
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,586
He was always a dark
shadow of Sales Team 3.<i></i>

371
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:17,616
Director Kim thought Lee Gyung Young<i></i>

372
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:20,946
would be perfect for
the complicated role.<i></i>

373
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,456

Ok, good luck.

376
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:57,886
[Q: What was difficult about your role?]

377
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:31,966
'How could I give tension

378
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:36,096
through the role?'

379
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:41,366
He was the focal character who

380
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:46,186
gave a crisis and tension
to Sales Team 3.

381
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,906
'What tone could add

382

It was tough,

384
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:58,746
but fun.

385
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:02,096
I heard you wanted to see me.

386
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:09,636
I want you to reconsider the punishment
of Sales Team 3 Kim Dong Sik.

387
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:14,506
Please, sir.

388
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,806
Mr. Oh never compromised, but he<i></i>

389
00:22:18,806 --> 00:22:21,046
bowed down to Mr. Choi for Mr. Kim.

390
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:26,286
Let's go.

391
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:29,806
Mr. Choi probably wanted that.

392
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:33,686
He wanted Mr. Oh to get used to the

393
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:38,546
office politics and connections.

394
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:43,096
It could be authoritative between

395
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:47,326
the boss and his subordinate,

396
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:50,426
but he thought it was necessary.

397
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:57,576
Mr. Oh thought Mr. Choi wanted
that kind of power.

398
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,966
Oh, thank you, here.

399
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:09,856
Mr. Choi tells off Sales Team 3
because of another team's mistake.

400
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:13,906
What brings you here, sir?

401
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,866
[Proposal]

402
00:23:24,426 --> 00:23:25,966
It was on the lobby floor.

403
00:23:31,616 --> 00:23:32,726
Oh.

404
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:39,616
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:44,856
- I...
- Be quiet.

406
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:53,746
The line that represented
Mr. Choi's character.

407
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:56,626
Let's do well.

408
00:23:57,026 --> 00:23:58,106
Yes, sir.

409
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:29,736
[Q: The line that represented
Mr. Choi's character?]

410
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:05,306
I think the line "let's do well"

411
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:11,226
starts and ends his character.

412
00:24:12,726 --> 00:24:22,276
That was my first line in the drama.

413
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:26,046
I wouldn't have been sent

414
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:29,386
away if they had done well.

415
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,666
Working moms are always at fault.

416
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:36,326
At work, around in-laws,

417
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:38,706
not to speak of the kids.

418
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:42,046
Ms. Sun showed the
reality of working moms.<i></i>

419
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:45,846
Don't get married if you
want to continue working.

[Ms. Sun's role / Shin Eun Jung]

421
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:50,546
She was similar to me in that
she was a working mom too.

422
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:55,906
But I had never worked
for an office before.

423
00:24:55,906 --> 00:25:00,906
I wasn't familiar with the life

424
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:06,636
or struggles of office ladies.

425
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,146
Right.

426
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:14,646
Working moms always have to balance
their work and motherly duties.<i></i>

427

Hi, So Mi.

428
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:19,006
Right, that won't be a problem.

429
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:21,326
Since we make the orders...

430
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:24,656
<i>My kid is So Mi's age and she</i>

431
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,566
goes to a day care center.

432
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:29,986
I always feel like that

433
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,546
when I leave for work.

434
00:25:32,546 --> 00:25:35,806
I want to do my best

435
00:25:35,806 --> 00:25:39,146
for work and my child.

436
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:46,006
Those desires are always in conflict.

437
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:49,466

I think that line resonated with

440
00:25:56,986 --> 00:26:03,006
many moms since I felt that way too.

Ok, I'll draw you pretty.

They're all good actors.

They deserved bigger roles.

454
00:27:09,726 --> 00:27:13,606
They played characters who

455
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:17,106
didn't have big roles.

456
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:20,566

<i>Mr. Oh's friend/colleague.</i>

He has to be there
for those key roles,

461
00:27:33,706 --> 00:27:36,346
but he can't be away when

462
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:39,086
he doesn't have lines.

463
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:42,626
Their facial acting was key

464
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:45,026
even when there were no lines.

465
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:49,866

Even we don't have lines,
we'd be caught on camera,

so we can't be doing something else.

We have to be alert and

So we'd be reading our scripts,

475
00:28:21,946 --> 00:28:24,226

even though they weren't talking.

477
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:31,266
They were nicknamed the "meerkats"

I mean I twisted the characters.

[Jang Baek Ki's role / Kang Ha Neul]

guy, I guess he is.'

<i>...is always made somehow.</i>

885
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:12,863
You spoke with a company
in Jordan, right?

886
00:53:12,863 --> 00:53:14,133
You're right.

887
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:17,043
They have Koreans too?

888
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:19,823
You can't lie for too long and he

889
00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:22,203
loses everything in a moment's time.

890
00:53:22,203 --> 00:53:25,303
I like it, I felt like I had really

891
00:53:27,183 --> 00:53:32,763
lost everything when
I played that role.

892
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:42,543
I thought about Mr. Park's behind story.

893
00:53:42,543 --> 00:53:46,483
Someone who used embezzlement
to climb the ladder

894
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:49,423
must've had many crises in life.

895
00:53:50,623 --> 00:53:59,083
He's a smart guy who'd
resolved each problem,

896
00:54:00,023 --> 00:54:05,383
but he came too far
and he lost everything he had.

897
00:54:05,723 --> 00:54:15,493
Playing the scene with that mindset,
I got emotional during shooting.

898
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:21,843
Mr. Park is a tragic character
created by a capitalist society.

899
00:54:21,843 --> 00:54:25,243
[Mr. Park's role / Kim Hee Won]

900
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:28,043
[Suh Jin Sang's role / Song Jae Ryong]

901
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:30,063
Mt. <i>Baekdu's rare mushrooms
are eaten by the deers.</i>

902
00:54:30,063 --> 00:54:32,163
The deers take dumps.

903
00:54:32,163 --> 00:54:33,143
They're round...

904
00:54:33,143 --> 00:54:34,583
Mr. Oh Sang Sik.

905
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:40,123
Each episode had scene stealers
making short but impress shots.

906
00:54:36,253 --> 00:54:39,383
[Mr. Byun's role / Lee Dal Hyung]

907
00:54:40,463 --> 00:54:42,803
They were all mirroring us.

908
00:54:42,803 --> 00:54:44,123
Come here.

909
00:54:44,123 --> 00:54:45,643
Suk Yool!

910
00:54:45,643 --> 00:54:47,023
Don't run away, come here.

911
00:54:47,023 --> 00:54:48,223
What did you do?

912
00:54:48,223 --> 00:54:49,893
- I'm sorry.
- You are?

913
00:54:48,123 --> 00:54:49,893
[Ms. Lee's husband / Oh Jung Se]

914
00:54:49,893 --> 00:54:55,843
The reason so many characters
came alive is because

915
00:54:56,463 --> 00:55:02,563
our lives are not full of
special events every day.

916
00:55:02,563 --> 00:55:07,603
The reality is that our
lives are a repetition.

917
00:55:07,603 --> 00:55:09,903
It's the same with the drama.

918
00:55:09,903 --> 00:55:12,943
It's daily repeated life,
like a documentary.

919
00:55:13,923 --> 00:55:17,403
Then people won't watch dramas.

920
00:55:17,403 --> 00:55:23,623
So we use the characters
to focus on the events.

921
00:55:25,343 --> 00:55:29,933
It's like 20 years of events
in the work life

922
00:55:30,563 --> 00:55:37,483
compressed into a year.

923
00:55:38,423 --> 00:55:44,953
We wanted to touch a lot of viewers,
so the director

924
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:54,883
and the scriptwriter felt each
character should be impressive.

925
00:55:55,183 --> 00:56:00,083
So even a short appearance
would create a big sensation.

926
00:56:00,353 --> 00:56:04,063
I think it was a crucial drama.

927
00:56:07,173 --> 00:57:19,303
[What is Misaeng to you?]

928
00:56:06,373 --> 00:56:11,743
It's my life project.

929
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,703
Misaeng is a complete life.

930
00:56:14,703 --> 00:56:18,953
A once-in-a-lifetime project.

931
00:56:18,953 --> 00:56:21,183
A turning point in my career.

932
00:56:21,183 --> 00:56:25,893
Joy that I can do a good
project with good people.

933
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:28,693
It's eternity.

934
00:56:28,693 --> 00:56:31,823
It taught me how to overcome hardships.

935
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:36,603
A task that I should resolve.

936
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:40,003
It blessed so many people.

937
00:56:40,003 --> 00:56:42,233
Our lives.

938
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,043
A shining moment of my life.

939
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:46,743
A blessing for me.

940
00:56:46,743 --> 00:56:50,583
The current me or us.

941
00:56:51,183 --> 00:56:53,483
Many people related to it

942
00:56:53,483 --> 00:56:56,283
and it was a new challenge.

943
00:56:56,283 --> 00:56:59,103
Something that we should've looked

944
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:02,153
something that we've missed.

945
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:05,423
Pursuing a complete life is

946
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:08,593
never giving up just
because there's no way.

947
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:13,843
A beautiful project that

948
00:57:15,743 --> 00:57:18,543
gave me a new experience.

949
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:28,983
The drama "Misaeng" is the desire

950
00:57:28,983 --> 00:57:33,283
we have for our daily lives.

951
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,443
The characters are like you and I

952
00:57:37,443 --> 00:57:41,193
who try to pursue a complete life.

953
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:46,063
Since we're not alone,
because we're "us,"

954
00:57:46,723 --> 00:57:50,373
our lives can be beautiful
though it's incomplete.

955
00:57:51,423 --> 00:57:54,873
It's ok if it's irresponsible
consolation or

956
00:57:54,873 --> 00:57:57,823
useless hope which Mr. Oh
mentioned before.

957
00:57:58,843 --> 00:58:02,613
We're all taking a step towards

958
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:05,483
a complete life together.

959
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:10,423
We make a hopeful move each time.

960
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:42,783
I want to tell all of
the Jang Geu Raes in the world.

961
00:59:43,883 --> 00:59:47,303
I'd like to tell you not to struggle

962
00:59:47,303 --> 00:59:50,243
anymore, but that's just unrealistic.

963
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:53,393
But the more important message I

964
00:59:53,393 --> 00:59:56,163
want to give through "Misaeng" is

965
00:59:57,943 --> 01:00:00,303
most of us are

966
01:00:00,303 --> 01:00:03,583
struggling just like you,

967
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:07,803
so I hope we can live for each other

968
01:00:07,803 --> 01:00:11,143
as we help each other throughout life.

969
01:00:11,143 --> 01:00:12,423
Let's do it!
