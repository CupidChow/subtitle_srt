1
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,270
Honey.

2
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,230
Focus on what you think is right.

3
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,240
The rest is beyond your control.

4
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,420
What a surprise!

5
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,510
You complained
that classy suits get wrinkled easily.

6
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,140
All right.

7
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,940
You should do whatever you want today.

8
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,400
You should avoid bad luck.

9
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,070
Take a taxi to work
and buy an expensive lunch.

10
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,990
I'll see you later.

11
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,380
Is that so?

12
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,090
A good idea.

13
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,600
Hello, is Mr. Choi in his office?

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,520
Come in.

15
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,310
Hello.

16
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,100
Have a seat.

17
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,980
EPISODE 18

18
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,740
It was worth waiting for you.

19
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm glad you didn't disappoint me.

20
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,880
Only recently did Poshin join
the national solar power project.

21
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,720
So, that variable is not
properly reflected

22
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,600
in the solar panel project
that we've been working on.

23
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,350
You should take that variable
into consideration

24
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,600
and show the ability of your team.

25
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,480
Yes, sir.

26
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,190
It's been a while
since we worked together.

27
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,740
I feel great.

28
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,320
This reminds me of our old memories.

29
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,450
It stirs my blood, too.

30
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,290
-Sir.
-Yes.

31
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,290
Let me ask you one thing.

32
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,470
Why me?

33
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,390
Why...

34
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,060
Sales Team Three?

35
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
You know why.

36
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,020
I'm asking you because i think
you can do it well.

37
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,190
Sang-sik Oh.

38
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,820
Do I need any other reason?

39
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Do I?

40
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,620
Let's have lunch together.

41
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,250
Yes, sir.

42
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,550
Did you really

43
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,010
decide to do it?

44
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,770
Do you think it's okay?

45
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,900
That's great.

46
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,610
Hopefully we would get moved
to somewhere far from the restroom.

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,700
Geu-rae, please review this.

48
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,200
Are there two projects?

49
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,290
Yes.
This one is a solar power plant project.

50
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,380
-It's a 500-million-dollar project.
-What?

51
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,710
-Fifty, five hundred, five thousand...
-How do we proceed with  guanxi ?

52
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,510
We'll decrease our margin
by controlling the original costs.

53
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,180
So we'll increase Poshin's profit.

54
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Sir.

55
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,020
I'm always ready to go with
what you suggest.

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,190
However, the risk factor
that you're concerned about...

57
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,690
Isn't it still uncertain
whether Poshin will win

58
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,940
the power plant project?

59
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,440
That's right, as of now.

60
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,070
As of now?

61
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,530
There's a way to remove the risk factors.

62
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,790
The Chinese government wants
high-quality solar panels and facilities.

63
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,540
It also wants an experienced company
with a high trading volume,

64
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,500
and able to handle a large-sized
development.

65
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,090
The more solar panels Poshin secures,

66
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,340
the more chance they'll win
the solar power plant project.

67
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,930
Securing more solar panels?

68
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,810
Wait.

69
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,810
Then, why did the company
previously in charge

70
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,150
plan such a small size?

71
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,780
It wasn't connected
to the power plant project at that time.

72
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,320
Things only changed recently.

73
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,450
Then, it all depends on how we work.

74
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,910
Don't we have to receive  guanxi
instead of giving it to them?

75
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,870
-You're right.
-Stop talking nonsense.

76
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,250
Dong-sik, talk to Poshin about our plans.

77
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,790
Mr. Cheon, check
if we have any connections

78
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,090
in high-quality solar
panel-exporting countries.

79
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,170
Yes, we have connections
in America and Europe.

80
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,180
There are several
domestic manufacturers, too.

81
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,590
Good.

82
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,260
Geu-rae, go over it.

83
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,270
Give them proper support.

84
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,560
Yes.

85
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,150
Don't act like Captain Jang
like you did last time.

86
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,270
If you become a philosopher,
idling away, I'll fire you.

87
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,780
Okay, let's go and work.

88
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,370
-Yes.
-Yes.

89
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,220
By the way, what is  guanxi ?

90
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,190
It would be better if you didn't know.

91
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,610
Why? It's also a part
of the business manual.

92
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,360
Do you think Geu-rae should be
that pure and innocent?

93
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,110
In China,

94
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,990
guanxi  comes first than system
when you work.

95
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,280
That means

96
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,580
the Chinese people prioritize
connections over the law.

97
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,660
It's especially so in business.

98
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,210
So,  guanxi  means...

99
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,550
You shouldn't consider  guanxi
as just a bribe.

100
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,760
It's more like establishing
emotional bonds.

101
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,600
Still, it's not Mr. Oh's cup of tea.

102
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,350
Then, why did he accept this project?

103
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,020
And Mr. Choi...

104
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,570
According to Mr. Cheon,

105
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,860
he's trying to move us away
from the restroom.

106
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,070
I hate this smell. Don't you?

107
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,610
Let's move away.

108
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,040
Here.

109
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,170
Your dead project came back to life.

110
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,340
Headquarters wants
to proceed with your project.

111
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,060
Then, what about Mr. Ma's Team Three, sir?

112
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,940
Congratulations.

113
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,950
What? Congratulations?

114
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,030
We're all dead now. What should we do?

115
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,290
Stop it!

116
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,370
We might be moved
to Sales Team Three's spot.

117
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,790
Gosh, it stinks there.

118
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,920
Thank you.

119
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,880
It's all thanks to everyone here.

120
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,380
As a token of my gratitude,
let me get you some coffee.

121
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,340
Really?

122
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,890
Yes.

123
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,850
Hey, it's been a while.

124
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,860
-What?
-Your shirt.

125
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,690
It's been a while since I saw you wear it.

126
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,400
-Right.
-What's that?

127
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,820
It's been a while?

128
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,990
Since I saw Baek-ki.

129
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,350
Jeez, there's no water.

130
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,730
Young-yi, change the bottle.

131
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,860
It's reverse discrimination,
women should do what men do.

132
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,160
What?

133
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,580
Mr. Ha tormented you like that, right?

134
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,340
My legs!

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,340
My legs.

136
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,800
-Gosh.
-Move away.

137
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,930
Seriously.

138
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,600
Thank you, Baek-ki.

139
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,780
Your dress shirt looks really good.

140
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,700
Wait a minute.

141
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,250
This... is pima cotton, no, wait.
Egyptian cotton 120.

142
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,920
This kind of classy dress shirt
is 100% 120 thread count

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,260
Egyptian Giza cotton.

144
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,670
It's easy to color.

145
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,840
The surface is glossy, too.

146
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,510
It's made of compact yarn.

147
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,180
-But it's not that.
-What the...

148
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,100
It's not all that great.

149
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,940
Still, you must have spent quite a lot.

150
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,190
No matter how hard I think about it,
this is not your style, Baek-ki.

151
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,030
Hey, Seok-yul.

152
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,660
Why do you come to the canteen room
on the 15th floor, not on the 16th?

153
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,950
This isn't there, you aren't there
and Young-yi isn't there.

154
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,200
Young-yi?

155
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,430
Well...

156
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,180
Is this shirt that expensive?

157
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,180
No of course not.

158
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,970
Don't feel any pressure.
I bought it on sale.

159
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,310
Well...

160
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,730
I thought you didn't like it
because you never wear it.

161
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
It's not that.

162
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,570
It was a little bit tight.

163
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,950
I lost weight by working out
to make it fit.

164
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,910
INCOMING CALL

165
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,460
DECLINE

166
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,010
I'll get going.

167
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,800
Hey, your coffee...

168
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,730
Is this really expensive?

169
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,120
APPROVAL

170
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,700
APPROVAL REQUEST

171
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,010
Sir.

172
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,260
The supplier for the Neoplan project
is now Chungsol Corp.

173
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,430
Have you reviewed it?

174
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,470
Yes. Why? Anything wrong?

175
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,270
They frequently delay their supplies?

176
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,400
I know.

177
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,940
Mr. Sung agonized over it a lot.

178
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,240
Therefore, I inserted
the penalty clause in the contract

179
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,160
in case they delay supplies.

180
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,120
-What?
-I said that a verbal promise was enough.

181
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,370
Mr. Sung insisted on specifying it
in the contract.

182
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,370
He's so meticulous.

183
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,550
Did they really accept the clause?

184
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,720
Jeez, are you my boss or something?

185
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,560
Do you think I'm obliged
to report it to you

186
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,980
over and over again?

187
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,860
Go and check the contract.

188
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,690
What?

189
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,070
You can't believe this?

190
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,530
Since I acknowledged their delays
and specified the clause in the contract,

191
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,660
it upsets you?

192
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,870
I have worked here
way longer than you, dude.

193
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,580
No matter how much you want to fly,

194
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,420
you're nothing but a baby monkey
jumping on my palm, dude.

195
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,840
Okay?

196
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,430
You're nothing.

197
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:10,800
Jeez.

198
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,580
You used to drink during the day.

199
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,590
Not anymore?

200
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,550
I'm afraid it will affect
my afternoon work.

201
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,280
Well, try to drink at least a little.

202
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,780
Yes, sir.

203
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,040
In a sense,

204
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,670
partner management
is the core of a project.

205
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,720
Even though China is changing,

206
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,890
guanxi  still matters a lot.

207
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,310
It could be a bad custom,
but it still works.

208
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,930
I spent about five years in China.

209
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,350
My former Chinese partners
all run their own businesses now.

210
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,190
They're doing great.

211
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,740
After all, the facilities business
is the best of the best.

212
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,910
You know, a sense of accomplishment.

213
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,530
A hit-and-run business.

214
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,290
It's not working anymore.

215
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,580
We should maintain
the relationship forever.

216
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,290
You, too.

217
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,790
You should make lifelong friends, okay?

218
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Sang-sik.

219
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,890
This project.

220
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,890
Let's make it happen.

221
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,020
Yes, sir.

222
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,610
And...

223
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,280
Here.

224
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,000
As I expected,
you haven't saved my number.

225
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,710
Come on, dude.

226
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,420
Save it under speed dial number eight.

227
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,470
SANG-SIK OH

228
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,970
Eight is a lucky number in China.

229
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,470
Let's call each other often

230
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,730
like we used to.

231
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,060
All right.

232
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,690
This is Geu-rae Jang
from Sales Team Three.

233
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,530
-Mr. Cheon? He's on the phone right now.
-Can you say... Hello?

234
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,320
-When the detail is given,
-All right, your number is...

235
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,740
-I'll contact you once we find it.
-Four, seven, seven, eight...

236
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,120
-I'll let him know you called. Bye.
-Thanks.

237
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,130
A company named Solartic Korea
can meet Poshin's demands.

238
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,540
Here's their contact number.

239
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,670
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

240
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,380
This is Dong-sik Kim
from Sales Team Three.

241
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,100
Why, thank you.

242
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,640
I'm sorry I didn't know
this was the direct number of the CEO.

243
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,520
All right.

244
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,940
We'll try to secure
as many supplies as possible.

245
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,860
Thank you.

246
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,240
As Mr. Oh said,
the Chinese company is proactive.

247
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,740
That's right.
This is also a breakthrough for Poshin.

248
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,410
Geu-rae, find who's in charge of this
at the trade association.

249
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,290
Ask him for more data about Poshin.

250
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,460
All right.

251
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,670
A NEW MESSAGE

252
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,840
Geu-rae, have a good day!

253
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,010
Ms. Ha keeps in touch with you.

254
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,260
Yes. Sometimes she just says hello.

255
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,390
I think she's interested in you, Geu-rae.

256
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,930
No way.

257
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,440
Be nice to her. Don't hurt her.

258
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,770
It's not difficult to reply to her anyway.

259
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,520
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

260
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,860
What? Uncomfortable? What?

261
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,740
Replying to a text message is not
something romantic but normal.

262
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,740
Come on, you're overreacting.

263
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,370
That's...

264
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,710
On the day when you had a blind date
and we drank together.

265
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,590
Let's have another round!
Where should we go?

266
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,050
Geu-rae!
Where should we go for the second round?

267
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,380
Maybe next time.

268
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,470
Okay.

269
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,260
-Good night.
-Yes, see you.

270
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,720
I'll see you next time.

271
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,100
-Sure.
-If we have a chance to.

272
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,190
All right.

273
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,310
Why are you following him?

274
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,860
I'm heading in the same direction
of his house.

275
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,530
Good night.

276
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,240
Come on, why don't you go home?

277
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,780
Where is your home?

278
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,240
-Over there.
-Gosh.

279
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,950
Please go home. I'm almost home.

280
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,290
All right, I see.

281
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,620
Please keep going.
I'm on my way home, too.

282
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,640
Where is your home?

283
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,520
Do you live here?

284
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,940
Yes. please stop sending me useless
text messages.

285
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,360
I got it.

286
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,240
Then, I'll send you useful texts.

287
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,780
Bye!

288
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,910
How did you get my number?

289
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,990
I asked So-mi's mother.

290
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,830
I feel uncomfortable.

291
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,250
Gosh, Captain Jang!
You feel uncomfortable?

292
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,260
You don't know how lucky you are.

293
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,550
Come on, sir.

294
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,130
Give her a chance.
She looks like a nice person.

295
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,300
It's not common for a woman
to be that aggressive.

296
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,270
GEU-RAE JANG: CONTRACT WORKER

297
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,860
It's not the right time
for me to date women.

298
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,860
What?

299
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,320
What?

300
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,120
Of course, it is. It's time.

301
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,240
If you delay, you'll end up like me.
You'll become crappy.

302
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't you think so, Mr. Cheon?

303
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,540
Sure. There is a time for everything.

304
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,540
Is it time for me to become crappy, then?

305
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,090
Please say no.

306
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,970
How did Poshin respond?

307
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,880
As you said, they liked it.

308
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,010
They asked us to secure
as many supplies as possible.

309
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,510
I'm still working
on the solar panel companies.

310
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,890
It'll take a while to look into companies
in America, Germany and Korea.

311
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,230
Sure, it will.

312
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,020
-By the way, sir.
-Yes?

313
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,400
Poshin doesn't have

314
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,650
any middle managers.

315
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,200
What does that mean?

316
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,620
When I called them with the number
written in the document,

317
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,910
Poshin's CEO answered the phone.

318
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,290
Poshin's CEO?

319
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,830
Yes.

320
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,210
Isn't it better
if you have the CEO's number?

321
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,010
Since it's an important business,
the CEO must be taking care of it himself.

322
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,430
Just like Mr. Choi is taking care
of it himself.

323
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,800
No, we're taking care of it on our side.

324
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,600
If they don't have middle managers
like us, when there's an issue,

325
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,270
it's hard to call anyone to handle it.

326
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,190
What issue?

327
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,270
Mr. Oh, why are you acting so foolishly?

328
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,610
As soon as you secure the solar panel
supplies, approve it and seal the deal.

329
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,610
I told you it's a done deal.

330
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,530
It's only a matter of formality.

331
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,830
-Without olives, but onions...
-Do you want it a lot?

332
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,580
-Okay.
-I'll be back soon.

333
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,460
-Where are you going?
-To buy some sandwiches.

334
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,420
For snacks.

335
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,510
Are you okay, sir?

336
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,630
Sure.

337
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,890
All right, then.

338
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,600
-Geu-rae.
-Yes.

339
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,720
Let's...

340
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,100
Let's be cautious with work.

341
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,810
Excuse me, sir?

342
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,520
Yes, sir.

343
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,311
Hello.

344
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,710
-Let me take your order.
-Four sandwiches, please.

345
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,000
One without olives but lots of onions.
Heat them all up, please.

346
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,350
Sure.

347
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,520
The same taste as my teammates.

348
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,940
Hey, Baek-ki.

349
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,240
I wish newbies would join us soon
so that we'll stop running errands.

350
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,620
Hey, your team looks so busy today.

351
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,330
Well, we're assigned to something.

352
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,080
-Mr. Choi?
-Yes.

353
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,210
I'm surprised
that Mr. Oh accepted the project.

354
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,220
Right. He doesn't like Mr. Choi.

355
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,680
He probably decided to accept it

356
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,220
because our team can grow with it.

357
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,850
I was mad at him.
I don't like him, either.

358
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,690
But I realized that I must admit

359
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,770
that I need Seok-yul Han.

360
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,780
There's a clear gap between us
that I can't overcome

361
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,370
with my pride and vanity.

362
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,580
Since he's the team leader,

363
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,330
he can't help thinking
about his team members.

364
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,540
Mr. Cheon, Mr. Kim and...

365
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,680
Didn't Mr. Oh say anything else?

366
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,140
No.

367
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,020
I see.

368
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,730
Let's go.

369
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,700
-Baek-ki.
-Yes.

370
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,280
Since the schedule has changed,
you don't have to work overtime today.

371
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,410
Well, is that so?

372
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,710
Sir.

373
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,170
I have something to ask you.

374
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,050
What's that?

375
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,840
What changes will come if a team grows?

376
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,760
What?

377
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,640
Well, I mean...

378
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,020
If a team's status or size grows...

379
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,900
You'll need more people.

380
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,480
The head of a department
can request staffing.

381
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,740
By any chance,

382
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,160
is it also possible

383
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,500
for the head to make
a temporary employee a permanent one?

384
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,870
Sure, it should be possible. What's wrong?

385
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,210
Nothing, sir.

386
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,300
See you tomorrow.

387
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,740
-Look below.
-Here?

388
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,410
-This one is the same as before.
-Yes.

389
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,660
All right.

390
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,760
Hey, getting off work?

391
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,760
Yes, sir.

392
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,720
I heard your team is working overtime.

393
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,600
Yes. Did Geu-rae complain again?

394
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,270
No, sir.

395
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,850
Sir.

396
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,650
Yes?

397
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,860
Well...

398
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,070
You started a new business project, right?

399
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,490
What? Right.

400
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,200
Well...

401
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,450
I don't think this will happen,

402
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,620
but if there's anything
that I can help with,

403
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,920
please let me know.

404
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,420
What?

405
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:07,880
Okay.

406
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,470
Hello, Dong-sik.

407
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,720
Yes.

408
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,470
It's on the desk.

409
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,840
This has been dangling for days.

410
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,190
Isn't this really expensive?

411
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,340
Still, it's not Mr. Oh's cup of tea.

412
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,510
-Mr. Choi?
-Yes.

413
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,640
I'm surprised
that Mr. Oh accepted the project.

414
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,970
He probably decided to accept it

415
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,430
because our team can grow with it.

416
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,230
However...

417
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,400
Even so...

418
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,730
I still have doubts about one thing.

419
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,490
Why?

420
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,040
Mr. Oh was pushing forward

421
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,290
with the project
more aggressively than ever.

422
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:08,710
-Sir, Poshin requested...
- It seemed he didn't mind

423
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,130
that Poshin doesn't have middle managers.

424
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,300
Yes, sir.

425
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,930
-Yes, we...
- Instead,

426
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,390
the team focused on procuring
the solar panels.

427
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,270
I looked into America and Germany...

428
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,940
Securing the manufacturers went
more smoothly than we expected.

429
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,730
-As the rest of it...
- Quantity, unit price and even quality.

430
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,860
The quantity and the due date...

431
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,610
Poshin agreed
that the conditions were great.

432
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,620
-Is it the company that you mentioned?
-I will...

433
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,330
Mr. Oh made a contract
and sent it to Poshin.

434
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,500
All he has to do now is sign the contract.

435
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,420
Everything seemed to work out well.

436
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,510
However,

437
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,680
something unexpected

438
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,850
happened.

439
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,780
What, they...

440
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,950
What's wrong, sir?

441
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,620
Connect me to Poshin's CEO.

442
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,000
Why me?

443
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:34,960
Why...

444
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,760
Sales Team Three?

445
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,880
I'm asking you because you're Sang-sik Oh.

446
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,090
Sang-sik Oh.

447
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,890
Do I need any other reason?

448
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,730
Was it this?

449
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,270
Mr. Choi?

450
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,480
We need to go through an agent?

451
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,400
And the commission is 2.5%?

452
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,450
But there's nothing like that
in the contract that we sent to them.

453
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,240
Poshin's CEO argues
that it was verbally agreed upon.

454
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,830
What?

455
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,750
Verbally agreed with whom?

456
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,090
Could it be Mr. Choi?

457
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,310
Well, then...

458
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,230
We have 3% of the margin.
Do they take 2.5% from us?

459
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,360
Then, it will decrease
our margin to only 0.5%.

460
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,070
Considering  guanxi,

461
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,700
we decreased our margin from 5%
to 3% from the start.

462
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,200
But the commission
and going through an unnecessary agent?

463
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,960
The company tacitly agreed
on the 3% margin

464
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,420
because we reflected  guanxi
in the original costs.

465
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,130
However, we have an agent all of a sudden.

466
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,680
It could be controversial if we give them
a commission from our margin.

467
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,930
I don't agree.

468
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,730
It doesn't come down to 0% margin.

469
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,150
There are many projects
with a 0.5% margin at our company.

470
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,440
If we consider the upcoming
solar power plant project,

471
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,440
we can interpret this as  guanx i, too.

472
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,280
I don't think it's a problem.

473
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,780
Above all...

474
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,830
I need to talk about this.

475
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,160
I'm not sure what it is,

476
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,420
but I feel a sense of uncertainty

477
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,290
about the whole situation.

478
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,920
It's like I'm trying to squeeze myself
into tight clothing.

479
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,010
It feels unnatural.

480
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,640
I have so many doubts.

481
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:50,970
What in the world

482
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,100
is going on?

483
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,900
Did you know that we have
such an unfavorable condition?

484
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,650
We already adjusted the costs
to reflect  guanxi  in the contract.

485
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,240
As soon as they received it,
they sent me back

486
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,120
the revised contract
involving Poshin's designated agent.

487
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,710
No matter how hard I try to understand,
this is going too far.

488
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,380
Mr. Oh.

489
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,260
Just approve it and wrap it up.

490
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,630
Then...

491
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,260
You knew about this
but wanted me to proceed?

492
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,430
The margin is not big,

493
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,890
but its number is not a problem.

494
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,690
Yes, I see.

495
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,110
Suppose we have an agent in this project.

496
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,740
Isn't a 2.5% commission too much?

497
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,620
I said, it's not a problem!

498
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,870
Sir.

499
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,040
I don't feel right about this project.

500
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,710
The issue of missing middle managers.
And this one, too.

501
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,670
If a problem arises,

502
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,760
-Sales Team Three will die.
-Come on, what are you saying?

503
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,840
You don't have to be this meticulous.

504
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,470
Just trust me. Please trust me!

505
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,180
You shouldn't dwell on this too much.

506
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,600
Wrap it up quickly and focus
on the solar power plant project.

507
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,110
After that then you don't have
to worry anymore.

508
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,170
The China project.

509
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,500
Put it on hold for now.

510
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,840
Would it be okay?

511
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,300
For the time being,

512
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,270
record all calls

513
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,810
-related to the China project.
-Excuse me?

514
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,350
What?

515
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,110
-Geu-rae.
-Yes.

516
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,530
When you covered
the rice project last time,

517
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,820
you talked to the expat
from China, didn't you?

518
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,490
Yes, Mr. Seok.

519
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,490
Did you call him after that?

520
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,660
When I wrapped up the project,
I called to thank him.

521
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,080
What did he say?

522
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,620
Is he trustworthy?

523
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,460
Well, he's not dishonest.

524
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,500
Contact him.

525
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,760
Ask him to look into the agent
designated by Poshin.

526
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,180
Ask him to check

527
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,100
if there were other previous contracts

528
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,810
where Poshin suddenly involved an agent.

529
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,100
Tell him

530
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,480
to call me directly.

531
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,650
-Yes, sir.
-Watch your words.

532
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,400
You should take care of this quietly.

533
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,240
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

534
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,710
We need to go through an agent?

535
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,750
And the commission is 2.5%?

536
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,880
Poshin's CEO argues
that it was verbally agreed upon.

537
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,710
What?

538
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,590
Verbally agreed with whom?

539
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,720
Considering guanxi,

540
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:23,520
we decreased our margin from 5%
to 3% from the start.

541
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,860
But the commission
and going through an unnecessary agent?

542
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,690
We reflected  guanxi  in the original costs,
so the company said okay.

543
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,320
However, we have an agent all of a sudden.

544
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,990
It could be controversial if we give them
a commission from our margin.

545
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,580
The China project.

546
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,920
Put it on hold for now.

547
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,670
Record all calls
related to the China project.

548
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,300
Something

549
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,720
is not right.

550
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,970
Still, it's not Mr. Oh's cup of tea.

551
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,390
Then, why did he accept this project?

552
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,560
And Mr. Choi...

553
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,690
Mr. Choi.

554
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,700
Yes.

555
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,740
I got it. Thank you.

556
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,460
-Sir.
-Yes.

557
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,500
It's about Chungsol Corp.

558
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,920
Do you know that they were sued
for delaying supplies?

559
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,960
Yes, I was told by Mr. Sung yesterday.

560
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,380
You knew about it,

561
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,930
but you still approved it?

562
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,810
I told you we added a penalty clause
against the supply delay in the contract.

563
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,480
However, that company has a bad
reputation, facing a lawsuit.

564
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,690
I'm not sure why we're still maintaining
business with them.

565
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,610
You have a point.

566
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,860
But Mr. Sung guaranteed it.

567
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,740
I have faith in Mr. Sung.

568
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,150
Excuse me?

569
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,660
He's such a meticulous person,
so I'm sure he has his reasons.

570
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,410
-Sir, I'm back.
-I see.

571
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,630
Sir.

572
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,390
I'm thinking of buying a car, sir.

573
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,760
-Please choose one.
-A car?

574
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,480
Wow! Are you going
to buy this expensive car?

575
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,560
I'm going to pay for it
with my new year bonus.

576
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,400
I haven't spent it yet.

577
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,150
The rest is in installments?

578
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,270
Did you have lunch?

579
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,740
-Yes.
-Hello.

580
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,990
Hi.

581
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,890
See me in the garden.

582
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,610
Baek-ki.

583
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,940
What's the matter?

584
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,330
-Well...
-What is it?

585
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,200
Well, I mean...

586
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm afraid the dress shirt
was too expensive.

587
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,460
What?

588
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,170
If I hadn't known that,
I might have let it slide.

589
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,050
But I had to do something.

590
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,730
It costs 50 million won.

591
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,740
And I...

592
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,910
I bought it from a discount outlet.
I mean it.

593
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,950
Don't feel pressured.

594
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,830
Wow, this...

595
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,670
Thank you.

596
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,920
You're welcome.

597
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,960
-Try them on to see if the size is right.
-Oh, okay.

598
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Here.

599
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,660
Yes, they fit well.

600
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,660
Take good care of the heels.

601
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,950
I usually don't wear heels.

602
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,120
What? Did you buy her shoes?

603
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,090
Well, no...

604
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,960
You did a good job.
I've always wanted to buy her a pair.

605
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:24,680
Whenever you wore heels, I was afraid that
your heels might break and you'd trip.

606
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,680
Your right heel is dangling, right?

607
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,560
Were you looking at my heels?

608
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,100
It's not that I observed your heels.

609
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,980
Your shoes attracted
my attention, Young-yi.

610
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,610
I wasn't really paying attention to you.

611
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,520
It was your heels
that caught my attention.

612
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,190
Okay, I got it. I got it.

613
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,740
Great seeing you here.

614
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,160
I would like to listen to your opinion.

615
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,990
Suppose there's a company.

616
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,870
We buy their products and sell them.
We're the principal.

617
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,120
But we entertain them.

618
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,330
Don't you think we should be entertained?

619
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,790
That company was even sued for failing
to meet the supplier's deadline.

620
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,880
Who sued? That company!

621
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,090
But we even went as far as making
an extra clause in the contract

622
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,470
to push ahead with business. Why?

623
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,680
You don't know?

624
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,100
I don't know.

625
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,980
He took a bribe.

626
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,570
A bribe. I'm pretty sure of it.

627
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,280
A bribe...

628
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,110
Sir, you got a call from Mr. Seok.

629
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,410
MR. SEOK IN CHINA

630
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
Hello, Mr. Seok. This is Sang-sik Oh.

631
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,920
Hello, sir.

632
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,670
-Thanks for doing me a favor.
-It's nothing.

633
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,300
The agent that you wanted me
to look into is a corporation,

634
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,420
but it's too new
to retrieve any information.

635
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,010
I also inquired about Poshin.

636
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,470
They said that Poshin only
works with agents

637
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,980
during negotiations under certain
conditions.

638
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,610
And the commission seems outrageous, 2.5%?

639
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,020
You mean it's too high?

640
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,530
Sure, it's usually only 1%.

641
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,950
And you set our margin at 3%, right?

642
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,860
Yes, I did.

643
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,660
According to industry insiders,

644
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,120
the organic thin film solar cells

645
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,750
are considered
as high-quality solar panels,

646
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,420
and you're even helping them grow in size.

647
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,290
Therefore, even if you raised the margin,

648
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,420
the contract still
would have been possible.

649
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,340
Furthermore, Poshin is the one
that wants to seal the deal quickly.

650
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,970
It's a bit weird.

651
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,010
Well, now I know.

652
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,310
There should a reason.

653
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,890
Thank you. Bye.

654
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,480
A new company?

655
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,610
And we could have increased our margin

656
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:51,070
to more than 5%
without considering  guanxi ?

657
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,370
So, what do you think, sir?

658
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,540
By any chance...

659
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,290
By any chance, do you...

660
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,920
Do you suspect

661
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,010
Mr. Choi is receiving a rebate?

662
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,350
We should drop this project, sir.

663
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,520
I understand
why you want to do this project, sir.

664
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,610
But if anything goes wrong,
our team will be wiped out.

665
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,360
Sir.

666
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:32,490
Why are you hesitating, sir?

667
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,990
Are you thinking of something else?

668
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:42,790
Geu-rae...

669
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,290
His future depends on this.

670
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,210
-What?
-What?

671
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,700
-Is everything going all right?
-What?

672
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,460
You mean the new project?

673
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,340
What are you worried about?

674
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,310
Well, it's nothing.

675
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,100
Geu-rae.

676
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,530
I don't know what's bothering you so much.

677
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,110
But just do it.

678
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,830
Don't look back on anything.

679
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,580
Don't ask anything.

680
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,080
Just believe Mr. Oh.

681
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,510
Just do it.

682
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,510
Why should I do that?

683
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,940
Geu-rae, you told me...

684
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,900
This project...

685
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,820
Mr. Oh decided to do this project
to help your team grow.

686
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,500
If your team grows enough
and he becomes the head of the department,

687
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,970
he'll be able to hire you
as a regular employee.

688
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,310
Geu-rae.

689
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,770
I don't know what's troubling your mind.

690
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,360
But, I wish...

691
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,910
you would just do it.

692
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,760
Change to a permanent position?

693
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,860
You're right.
It's a good opportunity for him.

694
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,360
That's why.

695
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,410
If I push ahead with this,

696
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
I may jeopardize our team.

697
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,160
But if I quit,

698
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,330
I may blow

699
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,460
Geu-rae's best but last chance.

700
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,290
Sir.

701
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:20,880
There's no evidence
that Mr. Choi is receiving a rebate.

702
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:24,510
Why don't you be more cautious, sir?

703
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,770
That's right, sir.

704
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,770
If Geu-rae's future depends on this,

705
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,690
I want to do my best.

706
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,530
If your team grows enough
and he becomes the head of the department,

707
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:51,160
he'll be able to hire you
as a regular employee.

708
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,450
-Hello.
-Where are you now?

709
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:33,290
I'm on my way back.

710
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,670
I have something to tell you, sir.

711
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,340
You should go inside.

712
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,930
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

713
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,870
I'll get some fresh air.

714
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,000
I need to sort out my thoughts, too.

715
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,330
All right. I understand, sir.

716
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,810
Do you suspect

717
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,110
Mr. Choi is receiving a rebate?

718
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,320
Geu-rae...

719
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:45,570
His future depends on this.

720
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,240
If I push ahead with this,

721
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,030
I may jeopardize our team.

722
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,330
But if I quit,

723
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,580
I may blow

724
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,960
Geu-rae's best but last chance.

725
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:15,730
What's up?

726
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,230
-What's it...
-Is it because of me?

727
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:20,480
What?

728
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,730
All the suspicious conditions
of this project...

729
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,230
You never would have overlooked them

730
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,860
if you had decided like you normally do.

731
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,280
But you closed your eyes.

732
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,200
Is it because of me?

733
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,410
How arrogant!

734
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,420
If it's because of me, please stop.

735
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,710
I don't know what you're saying.

736
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,460
And what are the suspicious conditions?

737
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,470
Stop talking bullshit
and get back to work.

738
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,640
An agent appeared
out of nowhere in the contract.

739
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,220
They asked for commission,

740
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,600
-which was beyond my understanding.
-I make the decision.

741
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,810
I'm afraid...

742
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,060
I clouded your judgment.

743
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,860
Arrogant kid.

744
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,320
-Who do you think you are...
-You're trying to save me.

745
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,330
You're going to make me

746
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,790
a regular employee, so...

747
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,960
Now...

748
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,260
You decided to work with someone
you normally wouldn't work with.

749
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,520
I don't want to put our team at risk.

750
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:39,980
Please.

751
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,110
-Please stop.
-I don't know what's on your mind.

752
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,690
But if you're going to criticize Mr. Choi,
you better stop.

753
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,240
Right, I didn't get along with Mr. Choi.

754
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,910
However, we keep our private
and public lives separate.

755
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,990
We both understand that.

756
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,540
Do you think the company is a joke?

757
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:02,420
I think Mr. Choi has another plot in mind.

758
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,920
-I think he's using us for his plot.
-You're talking bullshit!

759
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,880
He's achieved way better results than you.

760
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:11,630
He's made more contributions
to this company than me.

761
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:15,640
He's worked for the company
a lot longer than you or me.

762
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,810
He may hate me,
but he wouldn't do anything

763
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,520
that may harm his team or company.

764
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,190
Don't worry.

765
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,820
I'll definitely make this work.

766
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,360
I won't jeopardize anyone.

767
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,700
I'll find the best way
to produce the best results.

768
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,370
-Sir.
-You're right.

769
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,290
This is an opportunity to save you.

770
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,040
So I'm going to do whatever I can.
You know why?

771
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:46,960
If I don't do it now,

772
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,340
even if a chance comes again,

773
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,220
I'm not sure I'll make the same decision.

774
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,680
I said he can't.

775
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,890
He's living in more difficult
times than Eun-ji.

776
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,230
What's the use of giving him

777
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,480
empty hope or irresponsible consolation?

778
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,570
Even if it's a word of empty hope,

779
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,740
there are many people desperate for that.

780
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,150
Still...

781
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:18,280
He can't.

782
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,870
Go down.

783
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,790
All you have to do is work. Nothing else.

784
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,800
Don't be suspicious of anything, either.

785
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:02,660
Your shoes will get worn out soon.

786
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,080
Isn't it too straightforward?

787
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:09,350
Since I bought them for you,
I feel quite embarrassed.

788
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,690
Well...

789
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,230
Whenever I wear new shoes,

790
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,940
I make an effort not to turn my toes out.

791
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,410
Is the Argentina project going well?

792
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,450
If you need it,
ask Sang-hyun Lee for help.

793
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:25,620
What?

794
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,410
He said he's got a close friend
at Korea Resources Corporation.

795
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:36,630
Young-yi.

796
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,260
Who is this?

797
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:46,390
I'm Young-yi's father.

798
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,930
Yes. Hello.

799
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,480
I'm Baek-ki Jang.

800
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,980
I joined the company
the same time she did.

801
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,650
You can go now. I'll see you tomorrow.

802
00:57:59,070 --> 00:57:59,900
All right.

803
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,330
I called Mr. Shin.

804
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,460
Let's have rice soup, okay?

805
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,920
Let me eat some rice.

806
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,750
Don't be like that. It upsets my stomach.

807
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,550
Your mom has a cold.

808
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:05,220
She feels pain in her bones because of
arthritis or rheumatism or whatever.

809
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,050
You should go and see her.

810
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,800
You can hate me,

811
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:12,770
but don't hate your mom.

812
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:18,690
How did you know where I'm working?

813
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,280
I called Mr. Shin.

814
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,110
I visited him a while ago.

815
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,990
Why did you visit him, Dad?

816
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,450
Just to say hello.

817
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:35,120
He said he met you there
and saw you working well.

818
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,790
He complimented you a lot.

819
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:47,090
I went there to say thanks.

820
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,100
It's rather late,
but I should have thanked him earlier.

821
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,810
I just couldn't visit him
because you were against it.

822
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,270
What would he think of me?

823
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,820
He lent me so much money.

824
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,150
He would think of me as someone
without manners or a conscience.

825
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,410
So...

826
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,580
What brings you here?

827
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,500
I heard you have a bank debt.

828
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:17,410
Have you paid it off?

829
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,070
I wanted to help you somehow.

830
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,570
I'm sorry I couldn't.

831
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,160
Don't spend your money recklessly.

832
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,700
Save it every time you earn

833
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,500
so that you can use it for emergencies.

834
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,790
Right.

835
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,550
Please transfer 500,000 won if you can.

836
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:50,890
What should I do?

837
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,020
What should I do

838
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,350
to escape you, Dad?

839
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,110
Wire it.

840
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:06,960
Do you want to have a drink?

841
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:47,340
This is my dad.

842
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:49,500
Speechless.

843
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,680
He makes me speechless.

844
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,060
He was a soldier.

845
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:15,240
He was unhappy that
I wasn't born as a boy.

846
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,790
While I was growing up,
he kept telling me,

847
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,000
"You should have been born as a boy."

848
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,250
My mom heard this the most.

849
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,130
"Don't put a lot of effort into a girl."

850
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,760
They never paid for my tuition.

851
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,770
I started to work part-time
during my high school days.

852
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,360
Here's your double cheese pizza.

853
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:55,450
After my dad quit,
he tried to start businesses.

854
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,570
He was either swindled or went bankrupt.

855
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,870
Then, he even took my wages.

856
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,870
I went to college on a full scholarship.

857
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,580
I worked part-time
and gave the money to my dad.

858
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:13,170
Still, I couldn't break free from him.

859
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,470
Before I graduated,

860
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,560
I was hired.

861
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,480
By Samjung Corporation.

862
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:43,790
By any chance...

863
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:48,000
Do you know Woo-hyun Shin of Samjung?

864
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:49,580
Yes.

865
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,130
He was my boss.

866
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,130
Then, what happened?

867
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,680
How much is your salary?
What about benefits?

868
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:08,810
Since it's a big company,
you can loan quite a lot, right?

869
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:14,150
I plan to open a new store this time.

870
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:18,150
At first, I gave him money
through a bank overdraft.

871
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,370
Once I was eligible for a loan,
I made a loan for him.

872
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,240
But he still wanted more.

873
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:29,000
There was no way out.

874
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:31,460
One day...

875
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:34,000
My dad...

876
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,970
He met Mr. Shin without letting me know.

877
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,140
Mr. Shin

878
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,980
was the one who taught me

879
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,100
how to live as Young-yi An.

880
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:56,020
Not as a girl who felt sorry
for not being born as a boy.

881
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:57,650
You did a great job.

882
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:04,200
Buyers from China or the Middle East
don't think a woman can be in charge.

883
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:08,660
Whenever you sit with guys at a meeting,
make sure to sit in the middle.

884
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:09,580
Yes, sir.

885
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,460
The benefit of hard work

886
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,040
and...

887
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:17,420
myself.

888
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,380
My future.

889
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,300
I started to value those things,

890
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,560
until I learned
my dad borrowed money from him.

891
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:37,230
Why did you do that?

892
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,820
Why did you do that without asking me?

893
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,030
Did you think I would thank you?

894
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,570
Did you expect me
to think of you as my savior?

895
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,910
I didn't want to see you falter
because of it.

896
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,450
Falter?

897
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,040
Who said that? Did he say that?

898
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:57,460
If you don't lend him money,

899
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:59,300
I'll be in trouble?

900
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,710
-Young-yi An.
-Stop it!

901
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:05,430
You're a hypocrite, sir.

902
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,220
You still did it when you know
I would be upset about it.

903
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,600
I can see

904
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:14,600
-that you're enjoying this.
-Young-yi An!

905
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,570
I lashed out at him like a crazy person.

906
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,190
Then...

907
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:25,910
The end.

908
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:33,790
After I quit Samjung, I stayed at home

909
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,500
for about six months, like I was dead.

910
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,340
I wanted to die.

911
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,380
Then, one day,

912
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:51,390
I was blankly watching
a documentary on TV.

913
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:57,900
I realized that I couldn't die like that.

914
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,860
What documentary?

915
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:04,740
I don't remember.

916
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:07,820
Lots of office workers rushed outside

917
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:11,990
and argued who's going
to pay for their lunch.

918
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,710
They looked pathetic.

919
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:28,050
I thought I should be among them.

920
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:33,640
I should live

921
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,520
my own life.

922
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,990
Mr. Shin,

923
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,450
did you like him?

924
01:08:58,750 --> 01:08:59,580
Well...

925
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,090
Young-yi.

926
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,390
Yes?

927
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:17,020
Do you want to catch
a late-night horror movie?

928
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:20,900
What? You can't watch a horror movie.

929
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,360
True.

930
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,820
But I suddenly realized

931
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,120
that I could watch it.

932
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:37,950
After the movie,
can we have ox blood soup too?

933
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,870
Well...

934
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,710
That's too much for now.

935
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,550
Let's go.

936
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,100
Yes, okay.

937
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,280
Don't worry.

938
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:10,200
I'll definitely make this work.

939
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,080
I won't jeopardize anyone.

940
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:20,460
I'll find the best way
to produce the best results.

941
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:44,560
Right, this is an opportunity to save you.

942
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,070
So I'm going to do whatever I can.
You know why?

943
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:49,820
If I don't do it now,

944
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,320
even if a chance comes again,

945
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,870
I'm not sure I'll make the same decision.

946
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:14,260
Please update the shipping status
of the subsidiary materials now.

947
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:16,590
Yes, right.

948
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,720
Last time, the factory manager
complained about the delay.

949
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,640
The fabric arrived on time
and is being processed now.

950
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:24,730
Please don't worry.

951
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,940
Please meet the deadline
for the materials.

952
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,820
The sooner, the better. Thank you.

953
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:32,530
Bye.

954
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:37,570
Bribery.

955
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:40,950
I'm sure it's involved.

956
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,170
I'm sure of it.

957
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,340
Gosh, what is he thinking of so deeply?

958
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,680
Was he scolded again?

959
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:08,440
It's not the right time to talk to him.

960
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,660
Hello.

961
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,160
Do you know what happened to Geu-rae?

962
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,920
I don't know. Something happened?

963
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,590
How come you don't care for him at all?
Are you bullying him?

964
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,210
-Anything wrong?
-Hey, Baek-ki.

965
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,550
I think something happened to Geu-rae.
Do you know what it is?

966
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,050
No, I don't.

967
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,470
Why was he deep in thought?

968
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,060
The four of us should have lunch together.

969
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:54,690
You haven't heard anything?

970
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:56,990
No.

971
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:01,700
I think Mr. Choi has another plot in mind.

972
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,950
I think he's using us for his plot.

973
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,580
You're talking bullshit!

974
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,620
He's achieved way better results than you.

975
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,290
He's made more contributions
to this company than me.

976
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:15,170
He's worked for the company
a lot longer than you or me.

977
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,390
He may hate me,
but he wouldn't do anything

978
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:22,390
that may harm his team or company.

979
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:46,790
Geu-rae.

980
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:50,120
Yes.

981
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,460
What are you thinking about again?

982
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:54,960
Nothing, sir.

983
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,340
Yes, you are.

984
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,880
I warned you not to become a philosopher.

985
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:03,470
-Sir, I...
-Our talk was finished yesterday.

986
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,560
-Sir.
-Do your job.

987
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:21,950
Sir.

988
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:24,780
Because of me...

989
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:27,910
If you or our team is put at risk,

990
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,330
there's no point in what we're doing.

991
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,080
It's enough

992
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,420
that you tried to save me.

993
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:28,970
Hello, Mom.

994
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,640
You're busy, aren't you?

995
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,560
I'll make it simple.

996
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:33,940
All right.

997
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,230
Which dry cleaner is your necktie at?

998
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,820
I'm going to pick it up.

999
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,650
Mr. Kim's or Mr. Lee's?

1000
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:43,320
Mom, Mr. Lee's has closed down.

1001
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:47,030
That's right. I see. I'll hang up, then.

1002
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,330
-Mom.
- Yes?

1003
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:52,790
I'm busy. Speak.

1004
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,500
I'm busy. Speak.

1005
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:57,710
Mom.

1006
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,760
Do you feel bad for not being able
to do public service?

1007
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,130
What?

1008
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,640
When I took the employment exam
during my internship,

1009
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:15,180
you complained that you won't be able
to do it anymore if I pass.

1010
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,480
Of course, I feel bad.

1011
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:25,530
Let me hang up.

1012
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:27,280
Come home early.

1013
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:29,280
All right.

1014
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:03,650
MANAGER OF SALES TEAM THREE
SANG-SIK OH

1015
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,590
Hello.

1016
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:28,220
Geu-rae.

1017
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:29,760
Mr. Seok.

1018
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:31,390
Hello.

1019
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,720
Isn't Mr. Oh in the office?

1020
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,430
He's not in at the moment.

1021
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,600
If it's urgent, you can just tell me.

1022
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,020
I'll record it and pass it to him.

1023
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:46,400
I also asked someone
who's familiar with Poshin.

1024
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,200
People say that once Poshin
successfully orders the solar panels,

1025
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,070
they will win a power plant project.

1026
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,240
If that's the case,

1027
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:57,870
we really don't have to sign a contract
that is unfavorable to us right?

1028
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:01,000
All we are doing is just helping them
to win the power plant contract,

1029
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,250
by securing them solar panels?

1030
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:06,710
Yes, you're right.
That's why I told Mr. Oh

1031
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,210
that based on my research,

1032
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:11,680
we could have asked for
a lot higher margin without a problem.

1033
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,600
Yet, Poshin demands the commission
that we are supposed to receive

1034
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,180
for their agent's commission,

1035
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:20,430
under the name of  guanxi.

1036
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:21,890
That's right.

1037
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,400
Mr. Seok.

1038
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:28,860
Let me ask you something.

1039
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,150
Then...

1040
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,450
Isn't it like we're just giving them
everything they want

1041
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,330
when it should be the other way around?

1042
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,040
Because of Mr. Choi's decision,
which was unknown to me,

1043
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:43,790
they are just taking advantage of us.
Yet, it should be the other way around.

1044
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:47,500
Mr. Seok.

1045
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,630
Geu-rae Jang!

1046
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:36,180
Even if you can't make it,
you should see the ending.

1047
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:38,640
Since it has come to this, we can't
do anything but push through.

1048
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,430
Did he grab the opportunity?

1049
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:41,680
I'm disappointed with Mr. Oh.

1050
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,770
You don't know anything,
so don't talk like that.

1051
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:44,850
We're from the headquarters.

1052
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,900
Our sources said Sales Team Three
recorded calls.

1053
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:49,900
How can I help? What can I do?

1054
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:54,700
Sometimes, even though we know
the ending, we still do it.

1055
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:03,120
