1
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,020
Sell it to the person you least want

2
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,900
to sell it to?

3
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,210
I heard you came to my office.

4
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,510
Is there something you want to say?

5
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,720
I have a favor to ask
about Sales Team Three.

6
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,760
A favor? What kind of favor?

7
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
From Sales Team Three,

8
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,730
the disciplinary action
to Deputy Manager Dong-sik Kim,

9
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,520
please reconsider it.

10
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,150
Please.

11
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,330
Let's go.

12
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,550
I'm at a loss.

13
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,300
I'm just dumbfounded.

14
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,430
Presentation Assignment
If you were to sell something

15
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,550
Damn it!

16
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,390
to your partner,
what would it be? And why?

17
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,180
An individual presentation,
positive or negative,

18
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,230
exposes my true colors
through the partner.

19
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,030
If I'm convinced by my partner,
he will get the credit.

20
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,190
If I turn him down awkwardly,

21
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,700
then I may look narrow-minded.

22
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,370
But...

23
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,620
Geu-rae, you know me.

24
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,000
No matter what you sell,
I will never buy it!

25
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,130
I won't buy it. No matter what is!

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,130
Never!

27
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,710
This bastard doesn't care

28
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,590
if he'll look narrow-minded at all.

29
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,760
What should I do?

30
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,570
EPISODE 4

31
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,780
Yes.

32
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,280
After receiving the topic
of the next presentation,

33
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,780
nobody left the office.

34
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,080
It's because they can find most
of the materials in the office,

35
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,620
and they can also spy on their partner.

36
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,000
If only we could sell...

37
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,550
Some of them are in the reference room,

38
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,220
flipping through product catalogs
which could give them some insights.

39
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,930
Please give me the power of googling.

40
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,100
Or others google for tips

41
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,470
and similar cases.

42
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,270
Hello.

43
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,150
In your company,

44
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,900
there's someone who was in the same club
as my presentation partner, right?

45
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,940
And others want to get a hint
through their personal connections.

46
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,370
SEOK-YUL HAN

47
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,250
I don't consider anyone
who does not know the site, a senior.

48
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,090
Is that jerk emphasizing
the importance of working onsite?

49
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,130
Or does he simply hate working
in an office?

50
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,300
Isn't the onsite work eventually completed
in an office?

51
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,060
SANG-SIK OH
SALES TEAM THREE MANAGER

52
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,110
Hello, Young-yi.

53
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,530
Favorite food, hobbies,
specialties, and likes.

54
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,080
Tell me anything, okay?

55
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,450
Sang-hyun, please stop.

56
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,000
Come on. I need to do research on you
to prepare for my presentation.

57
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,260
Young-yi, say something.

58
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,710
You should've just let it go.

59
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,540
A few months' pay will be cut.

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,170
It doesn't mean that I'm fired though.

61
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,260
My performance review...

62
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,180
It's okay if my promotion gets delayed.

63
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,770
Come on, bastard.
Just tell me you're sorry and thankful.

64
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,980
I know how hard it is

65
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,900
for you to ask a favor from the director.

66
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,910
Why didn't I double-check
the verbal contract?

67
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,530
Since it was a preventable mistake,

68
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,830
it drives me crazy.

69
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,910
Because it was preventable,
it's a mistake.

70
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,830
If you make the same mistake twice,
that's your fault.

71
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,210
I know.

72
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,880
Mr. Oh.

73
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,630
Thank you.

74
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,590
And I'm sorry.

75
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,140
Look at that...

76
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,560
Hey.

77
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,640
I got a call from Mr. Cho, HR Team.

78
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,810
It looks like it will work well, right?

79
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,360
-Yes.
-I see.

80
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,400
Cheer up.

81
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,990
-Hey, let's take a seat.
-Yes.

82
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,080
-You won't drink much today?
-Of course not.

83
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,250
You have been working hard.

84
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,210
You should drink only three glasses
at most, then go rest.

85
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,960
-You need to rest for the presentation.
-Thank you.

86
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,880
Shall we order?

87
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,670
I wonder what Geu-rae is doing now.

88
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,510
I'd like to have beef.

89
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,350
Can we have  Gopchang  for three?

90
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,690
PROPOSAL

91
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,880
The onsite work is completed in an office.

92
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,050
The information about your products are

93
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,970
all here in this document.

94
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,100
APPROVAL

95
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,600
You'll have to sign this document.

96
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,730
The document that has your signature

97
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,320
will be completed
only after the final decision-maker.

98
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,860
Therefore,

99
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,610
I'm going to sell this pen
that you can sign with.

100
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,200
That's not enough.

101
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,580
You're right. That's not enough.

102
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,910
Mr. Oh.

103
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,250
You're pressing him to buy it
by saying it's important.

104
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,040
It's not convincing.

105
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,130
I thought you already went home.

106
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,470
Mr. Oh.

107
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,140
Isn't the office work as important
as the onsite work?

108
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,060
Of course, it is.

109
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,180
You're right,

110
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,150
but I can't counterattack his principle
of emphasizing the onsite work.

111
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,860
If only the onsite work is important,
why do we need this huge building?

112
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,320
Everything made onsite is
completed in an office.

113
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,990
I agree with you.

114
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,450
Actually,

115
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,330
we can't precisely divide office work
from onsite work.

116
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,410
International sales can't be done

117
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,250
with only office work
nor onsite work alone.

118
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,880
When you're working on site,
your feet will be on fire.

119
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,460
When you're working in an office,
you'll have sweaty feet.

120
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,260
What?

121
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,970
Nothing.

122
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,480
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

123
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,040
I found it.

124
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,420
-When does it finish?
-Pardon?

125
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,750
How will the presentation take?

126
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,840
I think it will end in the afternoon.

127
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,690
Why did you get so much laundry?
You have a backache.

128
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,770
You should do all the laundry.
You will be jobless tomorrow.

129
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,030
Do you want me to pass or not?

130
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,820
I don't care whether you pass or not.

131
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,280
You don't care even if I fail?

132
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,120
If you get hired,
I won't have to work anymore.

133
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,700
I'll be idle.

134
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,040
I'm confused too.

135
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,870
Should I pray for you to pass or fail?

136
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,340
I'll be back.

137
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,710
Goodbye.

138
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,510
INTERNSHIP PRESENTATION CONTEST

139
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,350
Hello.

140
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,770
Geu-rae.

141
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,190
I'm so nervous.

142
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,300
Young-yi.

143
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,970
This will be the hardest day
since we came to this company.

144
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,770
Hello.

145
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,850
Let's do well, Geu-rae.

146
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,400
No, I mean please do well.

147
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,190
You too, Seok-yul.

148
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,980
Don't worry about me.

149
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,120
All right, please line up in order.

150
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,290
We're going inside now.

151
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,500
Are you ready?

152
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,720
Put your box under the desk.

153
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,230
Testing, one, two, three.

154
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,810
Testing, one, two, three.

155
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,970
Please be seated.

156
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,130
This reminds me
of our own presentation in the old days.

157
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,170
Is that Young-yi?

158
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,760
A lot of teams want to have her.

159
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,840
She'll join my team.

160
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,970
-What?
-What?

161
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,810
She likes my charisma.

162
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,690
The team presentation will be five minutes
of presentation and a five-minutes of Q&A.

163
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,530
Except for the files you've submitted,

164
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,490
you can't use any other files.

165
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,920
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

166
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,050
We're strict with time. Keep that in mind.

167
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,340
What's wrong?

168
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,590
I forgot to bring it.

169
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,340
What?

170
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,850
Nice to meet you, everyone.

171
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,520
Some of you look familiar.

172
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,560
But the rest of you, I haven't met yet.

173
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,150
We'll see
whether I'll get to see you regularly,

174
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,860
or this will be the last time
I'll see you.

175
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,860
We're looking for salespeople

176
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,570
who are adventurous

177
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,200
and who can overcome frustration

178
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,370
and find hope.

179
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,000
Please do your best

180
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,210
so that we can make an organization chart

181
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,460
for our company with you in it.

182
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,940
The first team, please come forward,
Ki-seok Jang and Hyun-woo Gu.

183
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,400
Hello. Determined to leave our footprints

184
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,240
in the sales world, we applied

185
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,280
for One International.

186
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,200
We're Ki-seok Jang and Hyun-woo Gu,
team Jang-Gu!

187
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,380
We should have come up with such an idea.

188
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,540
Next!

189
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,050
Are you here for a picnic?

190
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,800
Change your clothes and do it again.

191
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,640
Hello, Mr. Kim. How are you doing?

192
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,270
Nothing special.

193
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,440
Things are kind of tough.

194
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,780
This is the end. Thank you.

195
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,860
-Where did you get the company logo?
-That...

196
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,950
Well, that's...

197
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,660
We used screen capture.

198
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,210
Since we had only a small image,

199
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,170
Ki-seok suggested capturing it.

200
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,750
-No, Hyun-woo did.
-I should've stopped him.

201
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,840
Next.

202
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,300
-We're not finished yet...
-Next!

203
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,050
Myanmar is a strategic foothold

204
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,220
which connects China and India.

205
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,260
Since the civilian government
was launched in 2011,

206
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,140
they're undergoing
gradual opening and reforms.

207
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,310
However, there are some crises.

208
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,650
So we classified them as systematic risks
and unsystematic risks.

209
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,280
Do you know you're mixing the terms,
crisis and risk?

210
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,110
Well, risk refers to

211
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,870
the exposure to harm or loss.

212
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,120
Crisis is...

213
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,040
We aim to make One International
become a general trading company

214
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,620
by securing the value chain
of food resources.

215
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,290
We'll produce the raw materials.

216
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,630
We'll also secure the supply chain
and ultimately be responsible for feeds.

217
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,670
We'll work hard
in order to make our company the best

218
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,010
in terms of food resources.

219
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,590
It looks good, but...

220
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,220
You look more suitable for advertising.

221
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,930
You're right, I also think...

222
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,060
Coil center is the heart
of Ukraine's strategic industry

223
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,400
as well as its steel industry.

224
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,280
We expect it to become one
of the strategic bases in Eastern Europe.

225
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,820
Good job.

226
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,160
But you did an internship
at another trading company.

227
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,490
Why did you apply for our company again?

228
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,000
Well...

229
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,750
I'm interested

230
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,790
in the trading business.

231
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,670
But you could do it at that company.

232
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,050
Well, I graduated
from a relatively unknown college.

233
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,930
I thought I'm not competitive enough
in every aspect.

234
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,640
You mean,

235
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,230
you thought
you would be competitive in our company.

236
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,190
Although you graduated
from an unknown college,

237
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,570
you have a good GPA, language skills,

238
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,740
and internship experience.
How come you have no confidence?

239
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,780
Should we hire you or not?

240
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,910
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,490
Why are you apologizing?

242
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,830
You're hopeless.

243
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,330
I'll become better.

244
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,040
I didn't intend to play down the company.

245
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,670
He got tricked by Mr. Choi.

246
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,920
Some people think
honesty is the best policy.

247
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,260
But they become honest

248
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,350
to justify themselves or make an excuse.

249
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,600
It's irrelevant to the truth.

250
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,520
Next.

251
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,460
In terms of fuel cell and solar power,

252
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,340
there's no cost reduction
in spite of the government support.

253
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,590
According to the results
of the simulations,

254
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,970
if we install the equipment
of 50 kilowatts solar power...

255
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,220
Seok-yul, are you sick?

256
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,850
Don't talk to me.

257
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,060
What's your problem?
Can't you do a presentation?

258
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,020
-Then, we should...
-I can.

259
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,610
...based on that, the sum of A and B,

260
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,900
and the annual average amount of
option one and two comes at 120...

261
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,740
Next, Young-yi An
and Sang-hyun Lee's team.

262
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Hello.

263
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,130
I'm Young-yi An.

264
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,420
I'm going to talk about India solar power,
IPP business plan.

265
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,430
We're going to suggest
how to specialize and develop

266
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,430
the private power business,

267
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,520
called the IPP,
or independent power producer,

268
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,390
by expanding the value chains

269
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,150
through networking and equity investment.

270
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,650
There are three ways

271
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,700
to develop the IPP.
If you secure the supply chain

272
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,530
of raw materials for solar power
through an M&A,

273
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,780
as a result, you'll be able
to create added value.

274
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,080
This way, you can increase
the value of trading.

275
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:34,231
We will reinforce
the seating capacity of EPC

276
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,951
and materialize
a smart manufacturing plant.

277
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,582
And you'll be able to
create the sales synergy.

278
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,120
You may wonder

279
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,210
why we should pursue
solar energy of all choices.

280
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,260
You'll be able to figure out why
if you take a look at this graph.

281
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:10,737
Young-yi is really good.

282
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:11,760
Unlike other energy sources,
the solar power recorded
Young-yi is really good.

283
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,640
Unlike other energy sources,
the solar power recorded

284
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,350
-the highest...

285
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:23,288
-By the way,

286
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,330
how can we secure
the raw materials in India?

287
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,010
Through an M&A

288
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,600
with ingot and wafer manufacturers,

289
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,220
we'll be able to secure the raw materials.

290
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,770
Then, we'll also procure
the value chain as well.

291
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,600
What about developing countries?

292
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,350
How can we procure the development fund?

293
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,320
It's also the same. If we pursue an M&A
with the polysilicon manufacturer...

294
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,240
She doesn't yield to the judges at all.

295
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,450
She's expressing her opinions in a bold

296
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,660
and comprehensive way.

297
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,490
The country's fund...

298
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,160
She's got a lot of nerve.

299
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,310
My Seok-ho did a good job, too.

300
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,180
How can you pursue the M&A
with module manufacturers?

301
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,100
Young-yi An is rather suspicious.

302
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,940
-What?
-She's very suspicious.

303
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,320
Well, I mean...

304
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,610
The M&A with module manufacturers...

305
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,580
Through the existing references...

306
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,830
Through the existing references...
To the market of developed countries...

307
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,290
You mentioned the existing references.

308
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,210
What is that?

309
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,040
Well... That's...

310
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,380
Developed countries like Japan...

311
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,630
Let me explain to you on behalf of him.

312
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,760
I'll briefly explain to you
about the M&A with module manufacturers

313
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,140
and the existing references

314
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,810
that we thought are essential
for advancing to the developed countries.

315
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,890
Let me explain them to you.

316
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,400
-In the Philippines...
-Sang-hyun is

317
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,110
completely beaten by Young-yi.

318
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,280
The government is giving huge support

319
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,530
to the solar energy development plans
in their country.

320
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,530
The power company, Infinity

321
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,280
-in the Philippines...
-Sang-hyun Lee.

322
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,830
He must have given up.
He looks rather relieved.

323
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,460
We analyzed the ranking index
of One International's core values.

324
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,340
After analyzing the ranking index
we came to a conclusion.

325
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,550
In order to face challenges creatively,

326
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,380
our company should diversify
the relevant businesses

327
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,840
based on our core competencies
and cope with changes flexibly.

328
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,140
First, we'll look
at IBM's flexible strategies

329
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,020
of their new business plan.

330
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,400
They have a business environment
and information body for management

331
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,230
and decision-makers called close nest.

332
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,570
The new business is not evaluated
by sales, but by a process review

333
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,200
as a way of pursuing innovation.

334
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,910
He's the master of presentations.

335
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,370
Every word of his is easy to understand.

336
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,450
He's very logical.

337
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,580
To specialize the value chain business...

338
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,540
He's good,

339
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,920
but he's appealing to our reason.

340
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,420
He should appeal to our heart
if he wants to sell things.

341
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,970
So far we tried to forecast
One International's growth and future

342
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,180
by analyzing the strategies
of a global firm.

343
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,510
Thank you.

344
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,160
Is he doing his presentation all right?

345
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,090
He wouldn't get nervous.

346
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,720
He's so experienced
in nerve-racking  baduk  games.

347
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,470
This is nothing to him.

348
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
Okay, next.

349
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,390
Geu-rae Jang and Seok-yul Han,
please proceed with your presentation.

350
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,310
-Is Geu-rae Jang in your team?
-Yes.

351
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,610
Don't touch me.

352
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,150
Testing.

353
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,150
GEU-RAE JANG & SEOK-YUL HAN

354
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,880
Well...

355
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,260
Seok-yul.

356
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,800
We, Geu-rae Jang and Seok-yul Han,
are going to talk about

357
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,220
the trade entrapped by culture.

358
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,060
It's about generating income
by counterattacking the phenomenon.

359
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,900
Geu-rae.

360
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,360
What's wrong with him?

361
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,200
-Our country...
-I guess he's too nervous.

362
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,410
Well, so we start from...

363
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,040
Hello.

364
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,500
Seok-yul? He's not at his desk.

365
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,710
He's probably
at the internship presentation.

366
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,760
Seok-yul is not at his desk.

367
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,970
Why is he getting so many calls today?

368
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,020
MOM

369
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,810
Did you take your anxiety pills?

370
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,070
Culture is...

371
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,450
What are you doing, Seok-yul?

372
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,950
Breathe.

373
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,450
You look hasty. Raise your head.

374
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,290
Culture is made in natural environments
that we can't avoid.

375
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,580
Don't just recite your lines.

376
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,040
So, we got to raise a question

377
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,420
that culture could be denied,
rather than embraced.

378
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,380
Wait, you better catch your breath.

379
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,630
Are you being chased?

380
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,390
No, well...

381
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,180
I'm sorry, but...

382
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,350
Can you give me a second

383
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,650
so that I can have my anxiety pills?

384
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,780
Please.

385
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,330
You may go.

386
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,830
But I won't give you more time.

387
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,000
Other candidates might object.

388
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,380
You have seven minutes left.

389
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,770
Well...

390
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,850
Let me cover his part.

391
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,450
I'll cover his part.

392
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,120
That bastard.

393
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,920
Explain.

394
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,970
Explain to me
why you put your stone there.

395
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,850
It's just because...

396
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,770
There's nothing
like just because in  baduk .

397
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,310
For every move you make,

398
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,610
you should have a plan.

399
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,690
That's called intention.

400
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,990
You're having a crisis
on your right upper side. What now?

401
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,990
I need to abandon unnecessary stones.

402
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,000
Which one?

403
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,830
His splendid rhetoric and eloquence.

404
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,000
I will throw out the reason
I chose Seok-yul for.

405
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,090
Being entrapped by culture means

406
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,920
the limitation

407
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,100
imposed by

408
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,810
customs or living conditions.

409
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,310
So, being entrapped means

410
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,900
the limitation.

411
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,610
What an idiot. Why is he stuttering?

412
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
Well...

413
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,450
Culture entrapped by environments...

414
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,780
Many...

415
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,740
Let it pass. Pass.

416
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,000
He won't make it.

417
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,500
The limitations...

418
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,540
Because of the limitations...

419
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,380
The limit...

420
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,800
I'm not ready yet.

421
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,050
Having a strong will is not enough.

422
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,680
Gosh. Damn it.

423
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,310
Dad!

424
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,560
My Seok-yul!

425
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,980
Dad, are you going to the factory?

426
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,940
Yes, I'm working the night shift today.

427
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,110
Your hands are dirty.

428
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,280
That's because of oil stain.

429
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,700
Are you ashamed?

430
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,410
I'm not ashamed of you, Dad.

431
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,370
How sweet.

432
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,750
I'll be back.

433
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,630
When do we get to negotiate?

434
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,750
Negotiation? They're going to fire
all the participants in the strike.

435
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,300
Hey, Seok-yul. My dad works in an office.

436
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
Your dad is killing time at home, right?

437
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,020
You must be ashamed.

438
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,890
I'm not ashamed of my dad.

439
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,310
He's ashamed.

440
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,400
Damn it.

441
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,610
I mean,

442
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,610
it's not what they need.

443
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,610
But

444
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,120
we make them want it.

445
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,330
That's our objective.

446
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,370
Limitations,

447
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,460
in other words,

448
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,960
because of their environmental limits...

449
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,510
Seok-yul must be doing his presentation.
He's not picking up his phone.

450
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,010
You're right. I think so.

451
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,510
I called him too, but he didn't answer.

452
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,640
When will his presentation be over?

453
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,310
-He'll do great.
-I want to buy him a meal.

454
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,180
He's not answering the phone.

455
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,230
He'll finally become an office worker.

456
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,060
Seok-yul shouldn't work on site.

457
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,400
By the way, he has stage fright.

458
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,860
He got his pills?

459
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,530
In the places
where white nights frequently happen,

460
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,830
there are not as many people.
Because there are not as many people,

461
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,370
because of that,

462
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,750
containers are...

463
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,380
containers are not full.

464
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,630
-So, the shipping...
-Wait.

465
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,720
It's a nice story,
but I find it hard to keep listening.

466
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,390
Your presentation lacks professional
jargon, not to mention neutral terms.

467
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,430
Don't you think it's not appropriate?

468
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,440
If that's the case, I'm sorry.

469
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,770
Have you ever been to the site?

470
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,320
You should provide us with some
creative ideas about each product.

471
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,280
You have never been on site, right?

472
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,870
-No.
-Interns know nothing about the site.

473
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,370
They don't even take a tour.

474
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,580
If their boss doesn't give them orders,
they don't care to visit.

475
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,880
You're right.

476
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,180
The onsite work matters.

477
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,940
You did a good job.

478
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,650
I'm sorry to confuse you.

479
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,360
Let me continue.

480
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,490
Dad, I'm not ashamed

481
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,700
of you,

482
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,870
nor onsite work.

483
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,290
We need to consider the moment
we can't go with FCL.

484
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:42,130
Then, our priority is how to negotiate it
with the forwarding company.

485
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,880
We can proceed
in either LCL or air transport.

486
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,050
This way we can send even a few products

487
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,300
directly to each importing country.

488
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,010
In northern Russia,

489
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,680
the dead or their families...

490
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,650
It was Seok-yul's one-man show.

491
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,860
His presentation,
loaded with the onsite terms,

492
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,190
flew seamlessly.

493
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,820
The board members,

494
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,280
especially those
who are experienced in onsite work

495
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,910
even smiled at him.

496
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,790
Can our ancestors find us out?

497
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,830
He even calculated the lost time,

498
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,920
effectively skipping some parts.

499
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,130
His presentation still flew smoothly.

500
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,630
He controlled the audience.

501
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,380
Unless he sees the whole picture,

502
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,010
it was impossible.

503
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,260
What do you think?

504
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,180
Controlling the audience.

505
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,470
Let me conclude this.

506
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,310
In the end, culture is...

507
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,560
Within only three minutes,

508
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,310
Seok-yul became just like Young-yi.

509
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,110
You can't help it.

510
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,570
In other words, culture is the target
of denial, not of approval.

511
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,610
You get to think if it's true.

512
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,740
Three minutes was enough

513
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,410
to transform himself
from a swindler to a saint.

514
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,620
He reminds me of my old self.

515
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,670
Why did he nitpick at the logo?
I was really nervous.

516
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,920
Because of Mr. Choi's charisma,

517
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,800
a lot of people screwed up.

518
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,340
Nevertheless, don't you think
Young-yi did a wonderful job?

519
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,850
Young-yi, do you want some coffee?

520
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,310
He needs to sell her his stuff.

521
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,570
Baek-ki Jang was great.

522
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,610
Besides Seok-ho, Young-yi was good.

523
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,910
Young-yi was really good.

524
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,370
Mr. Park wouldn't like that.
She's just a girl.

525
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,580
I like Seok-yul Han
since he seems to have big ideas.

526
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,660
Young-yi An.

527
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,920
She's better than most assistant managers.

528
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,090
Geu-rae's paper and presentation contents
were quite good. I feel sorry for him.

529
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,180
It was a chance for him.

530
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,060
That's all he can do.

531
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,520
It's a miracle that he came this far.

532
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,360
At least, I liked him
because he didn't overrate himself.

533
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,820
You're doing this on purpose?

534
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,740
Don't do that.

535
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,790
I'm worried about you as much as him.

536
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,710
What are you talking about?

537
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,420
We think our past came back to haunt us.

538
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,010
However,

539
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,840
we often haunt our own past.

540
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,680
Whenever I see you, I feel like that.

541
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,140
Hey! Don't try to seduce me.

542
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,730
Why do you care about a married man?
You're a married woman.

543
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:49,110
Since you got promoted earlier than me,

544
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,440
are you looking down on me?

545
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,160
You still think every woman likes you?

546
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,750
Yes.

547
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,630
Did Geu-rae do well?

548
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,380
Not at all.

549
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,420
He was so naive, stupid,

550
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:13,930
and slow-witted.

551
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,470
-Really?
-Young-yi was the best.

552
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,520
Come on, Mr. Oh. Forget about her.

553
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,060
-I'll be out.
-All right.

554
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,710
If you can't win, trip him, at least.

555
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,270
What?

556
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,110
It'll be interesting to see him fall down.

557
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,320
What?

558
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,820
We're going to start
the second presentation.

559
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,288
As you've been notified,

560
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,902
the individual presentation is
to sell a product

561
00:38:07,946 --> 00:38:10,542
to your partner.
What are you going to sell and...

562
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:17,537
Keep in mind that you'll lose points
if you refuse to buy without reason.

563
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,080
This is going to be fun right, Geu-rae?

564
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,200
I bought this wallet for 600 dollars
in Hong Kong.

565
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,430
I'll sell this at 350 dollars.

566
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,760
I won't buy.

567
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,220
Come on. He shouldn't blindly refuse.

568
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,310
This belt is a perfect counterfeit

569
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:01,810
of a luxury brand.

570
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,020
You love luxury brands, right?

571
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,020
You said you wanted one earlier.

572
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,110
I believe domestic products are
way better in qualify.

573
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,360
You're the one
who likes foreign luxury brands.

574
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,820
You bragged about purchasing a pair
of used luxury shoes.

575
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,240
What a pity. Are they squabbling?

576
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,450
Buying used goods is
rediscovering the resources.

577
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,920
What does that mean?

578
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,550
Jong-min, you're a capable person.

579
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,090
You're diligent.

580
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,840
But you lack confidence.

581
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,390
It comes from your anxiety,

582
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,390
since you couldn't establish
your own originality.

583
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:41,270
Jong-min. You're the brand itself.

584
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,770
Stop copying others.

585
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,060
Let others copy you.
Try to establish your own originality.

586
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,440
So, I'm selling this mirror to you.

587
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,260
Copying others?

588
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,170
What is he selling?

589
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,890
It's hard to put a price on

590
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,510
what I'm trying to sell Young-yi.

591
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,220
It depends on how much you want to pay.

592
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,310
I'm going to sell her memories,

593
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,110
of Young-yi, by Young-yi,
and for Young-yi.

594
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,950
An intern of One International.

595
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,160
It's Young-yi's day.

596
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,080
YOUNG-YI'S DAY

597
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,710
YOUNG-YI IS ALWAYS BUSY.

598
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,220
LIKE AN ANGEL

599
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,930
YOUNG-YI'S DAY

600
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,680
YES

601
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,440
HER NAME IS YOUNG-YI.

602
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,200
SILENCE
PRESENTATION CONTEST

603
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,540
Next, Geu-rae Jang
and Seok-yul Han's team.

604
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,410
Please start. Seok-yul, you go first.

605
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,380
This is what I would like to sell

606
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,130
to Geu-rae Jang.

607
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,640
Hold it for me.

608
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,660
They're the sample textiles made
in the Ulsan factory.

609
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,070
Nylon, polyester acrylic,

610
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,080
polyurethane, polyvinyl alcohol,

611
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,660
polyvinylidene, polypropylene.

612
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,670
They are the synthetic fibers
of our major products.

613
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,500
They represent the high value-added
to the industry of the 21st century.

614
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,340
And one more thing.

615
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,890
This diary contains an analysis
on the business environment

616
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,970
of production line workers,

617
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,430
expected loss from incorrect orders,
and communication problems.

618
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,730
I'm going to sell

619
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,940
the voice of the field.

620
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,570
Geu-rae. Please decide.

621
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,590
These textiles are
in good condition, right?

622
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,600
Of course.

623
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:57,810
Then,

624
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,980
I'll only buy your diary.

625
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,690
Textiles...

626
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,530
I won't buy the textiles.

627
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,370
Why?

628
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,500
Your diary may be valuable,

629
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,500
because it has your analysis
on the onsite work

630
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,790
and saves me time.

631
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,800
Textiles are available
to anyone at any time.

632
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,720
I think I don't need to buy them from you.

633
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,430
-He's good.
-There's more you need to know.

634
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,190
I personally touched
and used all of these textiles,

635
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,940
analyzed their pros and cons,
utility, and value,

636
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,980
and created the data

637
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,860
as much as an expert could.

638
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,280
I was even accused of being a pervert,

639
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,490
a molester, and a sex offender.

640
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:55,700
Pervert?

641
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,700
He knew about it?

642
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,160
-Jeez.
-That hurt.

643
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:06,000
It's still a crime to touch a woman's
behind without her permission.

644
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,890
I told you I didn't touch her butt.

645
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,430
I touched the textile.

646
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,520
I touched...

647
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,730
I'm not exactly sure
if you intended to touch the textile,

648
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:24,440
but you admit that
you ended up touching her behind, right?

649
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,730
Geu-rae.

650
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,690
He's interesting.

651
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,450
The textile that I wanted to touch

652
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,570
just happened to be on her butt.

653
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:38,790
You saw that.

654
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,080
I did.

655
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,410
You touched her butt.

656
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,250
All right. Both of you, calm down.

657
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,710
Geu-rae, what will you do?

658
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,590
Are you going to buy them or not?

659
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,020
In order to sell textiles,

660
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,810
I have to study as much
as Seok-yul's legwork

661
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,110
If so,

662
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,280
I'll sell them together with Seok-yul

663
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,780
if we can come back here
after passing the test.

664
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:19,740
What do you think?

665
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,080
Are you going to sell them with me?

666
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,370
Wow.

667
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,590
What are you going to do, Seok-yul?

668
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,840
Do you want to sell them with him?

669
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,090
I will...

670
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,470
I will decide it after seeing his product.

671
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,810
What a sly bastard.

672
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,230
This is interesting.

673
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,440
Geu-rae. You may start now.

674
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,230
Yes.

675
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,150
Okay. Show it to me.

676
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:01,990
Whatever you want to sell...

677
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,750
What is he holding?

678
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,300
I want to sell him this slipper.

679
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,350
Where are my slippers?

680
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,350
Wait, where are my slippers?

681
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,820
-You don't have yours either?
-It's missing.

682
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,700
What is it?

683
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,700
This is a slipper of someone
at our company.

684
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,210
Thats mine.

685
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,050
No, it's not.

686
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,560
Look at his shoes.

687
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,930
That bastard.

688
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:08,230
His shoes are clean.

689
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,560
Office workers hardly go out.

690
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,860
They should keep their shoes clean
because they often dress formally

691
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,400
and spend most of their time
at the office.

692
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,710
Please look at this slipper again.

693
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,460
Gosh. Is that bastard making fun of me?

694
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,040
It's worn out.

695
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,880
The acupuncture nodules have been worn out
around his foot shape.

696
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:46,560
That's just disgusting.

697
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,060
I can smell his sweat, too.

698
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:55,980
The smell of sweat

699
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,030
tells me that office is
also an onsite workplace.

700
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,110
The combat shoes on site.

701
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,070
I'm going to sell

702
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,000
the combat shoes of office workers to you.

703
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,290
Another wow!

704
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,460
He's good.

705
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,750
I won't buy.

706
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,590
Are you joking?
The office is an onsite workplace?

707
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,010
Do you know what an onsite workplace is?

708
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,260
Outdoor workers,
who work at the forefront,

709
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,770
can get easily laid off
once an office worker scribbles.

710
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,100
Should I tell you
about their combat shoes?

711
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,690
They wear real military boots.

712
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,030
Their foot bone will shatter
if a heavy tool falls on them.

713
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:44,910
That's what combat shoes are.

714
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:46,870
I won't...

715
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,620
I won't buy your product.

716
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,050
Seok-yul.

717
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:07,300
You've emphasized the onsite work
since the first time I met you.

718
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,680
More precisely,
you only talk about onsite work.

719
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,890
You seem to imagine
a fierce struggle on site

720
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:16,770
as machines running day and night.

721
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,730
People physically manufacture
and move products.

722
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,280
You majored in mechanical engineering.

723
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,450
You have won many awards in contests.

724
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,160
An outdoor job for you is where you show
your interests about machinery.

725
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,830
He won contests? Where?

726
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,660
Have you really won contests?

727
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,750
I have won small contests.

728
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:41,880
However,

729
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,760
office workers get crammed
into a subway everyday.

730
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,390
Could you check the exchange rate?

731
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,640
For better product return rate,

732
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,270
we check the exchange rate and
international trading price.

733
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,480
It's hard for us to manage...

734
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,270
In order to prevent careless arithmetic
mistakes, we go through various processes.

735
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,480
Just because of one sentence,
a lawsuit can be filed against us.

736
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:05,610
If we suffer a loss,
are you going to be responsible?

737
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,530
It's not just a matter of paperwork.

738
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,410
How can you say that
we're running out of stock now?

739
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:12,790
When we engage
in many intense negotiations,

740
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,370
we feel small and insignificant sometimes.

741
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:19,080
So, you received the payment slip? Okay.

742
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:21,670
In order to hear okay from our customer,
we sometimes stay up all night

743
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,710
and wait
till their local business opening time.

744
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,390
All the products
that are manufactured on site.

745
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,510
They can be made only
after we fiercely debate their value.

746
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:35,640
Those products.

747
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,150
They can't exist
without going through office work.

748
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:52,370
There are no meaningless stones
on the board.

749
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,490
Among the products that our company makes,

750
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,000
there are no meaningless products.

751
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:00,250
If your stone is isolated or in trouble,

752
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:04,210
that means you failed to see a reason
or failed to predict the opponent's move.

753
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,840
If a product fails
or suffers from a setback in sales,

754
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,260
that means we failed to plan,

755
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,600
predict or estimate the future.

756
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:15,970
Give up on the isolated stones.

757
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,520
But, you should make use of them

758
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,480
to your own advantage.

759
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,320
Give up on the failed products.

760
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,440
But we should plan better products,
regarding this failure as a lesson.

761
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,620
In a big picture, factory
and office are connected to each other.

762
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,160
Of course,

763
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:38,250
we'll see mistakes and failures
in both of them.

764
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,920
However, if we see a big picture,

765
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,130
we all have

766
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,050
a common goal.

767
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:52,970
The battlefield that I think of

768
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,510
is no different

769
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,270
from what you think of, Seok-yul.

770
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,520
I'm sure about it.

771
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,120
He deserves applause.

772
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:28,880
Geu-rae.

773
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,790
Who is it?

774
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,250
Fried chicken delivery service.

775
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,630
-Here it is.
-Yes.

776
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,840
-Thank you.
-Okay.

777
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,970
-Oh, wait!
-Yes.

778
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,140
Throw this away for me.

779
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,320
TRASH

780
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,500
Here you are.

781
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,040
Excuse me! Two more beers, please.

782
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,210
Yes, coming.

783
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,240
You mix up night and day.

784
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,990
Get up. It's time to eat.

785
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:55,080
You need to put up
another clothesline in the yard.

786
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,290
The sunshine is not strong enough.

787
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,480
You didn't hear from them, yet?

788
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,400
Well...

789
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,230
You said it would take only one week.

790
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,710
I'm calling you because of P-bond, sir.

791
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,580
Ashley Park, that bastard!

792
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,000
All right. Yes.

793
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,220
I would like you to finish it by Thursday.

794
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,470
Seriously.

795
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,970
I can't do this anymore. What should I do?

796
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:53,180
Well then...

797
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,640
Then, I'll hold it until Friday.

798
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,270
Please make sure you finish it
by then. Bye.

799
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:04,230
Geu-rae, make three copies of these...

800
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,400
I guess I'll do it myself.

801
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,450
You see, I'm already used to him.

802
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,830
You're used to him? Come on.

803
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,460
You didn't have anyone
to help you for a long time, anyway.

804
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,250
We weren't thoughtful.

805
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,960
We should have bought him
a farewell drink.

806
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,880
You think so too, right?

807
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,930
In case Young-yi comes to our team,

808
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,470
-What?
-We need to move her desk

809
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,180
for her convenience.

810
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,230
Jeez.

811
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,360
-When will they announce the results?
-No idea.

812
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,860
If they don't send anyone to our team,

813
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,700
I won't stay quiet.

814
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,250
You see? See?
This desk is right in front of a restroom.

815
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,000
You can even hear the flushing sound.

816
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,880
How can we...

817
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,460
How can we make a woman sit
in front of the restroom?

818
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,010
You should move here. Change your desks.

819
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,840
But I'm a deputy manager.

820
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,760
Do you want to become a manager?

821
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,600
You may sit at my desk. I'll sit at yours.

822
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:21,190
Then can I really sit over there?
Where did he go?

823
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,820
-You called for delivery service, right?
-Yes, here it is.

824
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:33,820
Is this right?

825
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,160
Please deliver it
to the information desk in the lobby.

826
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:42,620
-Here's the receipt.
-Okay.

827
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,880
DELIVERY SERVICE

828
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,650
DELIVERY SERVICE

829
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,610
What about him?

830
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:58,070
GEU-RAE JANG

831
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,790
Damn.

832
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,620
Here, please.

833
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,000
Thank you.

834
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,780
-Hello.
-It's me.

835
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:36,280
What?

836
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,490
I got hired.

837
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:40,910
I think I got a job.

838
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,040
Okay. That's good.

839
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:48,670
Intern Geu-rae Jang,

840
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,920
hired as a two-year contract employee.

841
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,440
Try this one. I got it dry cleaned.

842
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:09,650
Okay.

843
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:23,280
You still don't know how to tie?

844
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:24,870
I don't.

845
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,580
A man should know how to tie a necktie.

846
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,420
Becoming a grown-up

847
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:39,010
doesn't mean that you feel like it.

848
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,760
An adult should know
how to do things, if he has to.

849
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,390
A neck tie.

850
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:48,060
Plain but clean shoes.

851
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,020
A belt which is not stretched.

852
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,230
Those were your father's principles.

853
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,570
-Mom.
-What?

854
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:00,950
You don't know how to tie.

855
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,500
Go without a tie today.

856
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:10,290
I forgot it all.

857
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,270
BARBER SHOP

858
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,950
Wearing a suit, a tie, and dress shoes

859
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:49,700
makes me feel great.

860
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:52,790
I feel just the right amount of pressure.

861
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,630
The starched suit jacket makes

862
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:58,500
my back upright
and straightens up my shoulders.

863
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:02,970
Thanks to thin lining inside,
the hem of the pants don't stick

864
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:05,600
to my knees, but gliding past.

865
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:07,560
Also,

866
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,470
Geu-rae.

867
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,430
I have the handkerchief my mom gave to me.

868
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,060
Don't blow your nose with your hand.

869
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,320
Don't wipe your sweat with your palm.

870
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,320
Don't sit carelessly anywhere.

871
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,610
You better wipe the spot
or put the handkerchief on it.

872
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,950
Your behavior tells everything about you.

873
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Don't try to look like an adult,
just behave as an adult.

874
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:41,460
Young-yi.

875
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,680
Baek-ki.

876
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,720
I knew it.

877
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,260
I knew we would be here.

878
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,720
-Congratulations, Seok-yul.
-Congratulations, Baek-ki.

879
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,180
Congratulations.

880
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,230
I guess there's only three of us.

881
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,360
They hired two last year.
They hired more this time.

882
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:06,860
Yes.

883
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:11,950
Hello.

884
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,460
Hello.

885
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,630
Hello.

886
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,840
This is surprising, isn't it?

887
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,050
We meet again, Geu-rae.

888
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,510
Yes.

889
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,010
Young-yi.

890
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,020
I'm sorry.

891
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,100
Congratulations.

892
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:38,100
Thank you.

893
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,230
Great, you're all here.

894
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,440
Congratulations.
I'm Soo-dong Lee from HR Team.

895
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,780
Seok-ho Kim got hired, too.

896
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,030
He's assigned to the headquarters,
so he's over there now.

897
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,660
Then, we'll fill up some paperwork,
and go meet the director.

898
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,000
This way, please.

899
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,250
Nice to meet you.

900
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,670
Have a seat.

901
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,060
-Young-yi.
-Yes.

902
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,020
Do we know each other?

903
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:24,480
No, sir.

904
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,740
-Okay then.
-Yes.

905
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:31,370
Young-yi.

906
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,870
You won contract worth a billion
on your tenth day as an intern here?

907
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,080
It's a project
that's been delayed for two years.

908
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,460
I hope you'll keep up the good work.

909
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,260
-Seok-yul.
-Yes.

910
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:55,180
Did your father teach you
that the onsite experience matters?

911
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,520
Yes, he did. For generations...

912
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,060
Well, not for generations,

913
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,230
but most of my relatives are blue collar
workers. We take pride

914
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,990
in sacred labor, honest sweat,
and valuable onsite experience.

915
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,070
-All right.
-Yes.

916
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:14,280
That's a great attitude.

917
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,540
Thank you.

918
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,580
Next, Baek-ki.

919
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,500
I liked your calm attitude
and adherence to the basics

920
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,840
that you showed in your presentation.

921
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,170
Thank you.

922
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:28,970
You applied for the resource team?

923
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,050
Is it because you did
your internship there?

924
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,680
No, it's not that.

925
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:36,850
I just realized the trading company's
future lies in resources.

926
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:39,430
That's why we need talented people
in the resource team.

927
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,770
I have high expectations of you.

928
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,610
And, Geu-rae.

929
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:48,820
Yes.

930
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,700
-You're Geu-rae.
-Yes.

931
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,290
Okay. Work hard.

932
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,660
Yes.

933
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:14,550
Here're the company manual
and your team's contact numbers.

934
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,470
Young-yi. Baek-ki.

935
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,180
Seok-yul. Geu-rae.

936
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:22,600
You know how to connect
to the Internet, right?

937
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:25,730
You can reset your ID and password.
Could you pass me the ID cards?

938
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:29,940
Here's the ID card.

939
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:32,700
Thank you.

940
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:35,450
Here.

941
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:37,620
Check which team you're assigned to.

942
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:44,670
RESOURCE TEAM

943
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:52,090
Yes! Textile team!

944
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,930
-Which team?
-Here.

945
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,560
It's resource team.

946
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:02,430
Then, what about you?

947
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,100
Steel team.

948
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,270
Steel?

949
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:09,650
What about you, Geu-rae?

950
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:20,990
I received it this morning.
Please check the file.

951
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,000
If you think there's a problem,
let me know. I'll correct it.

952
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:25,290
Hello.

953
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,670
I'm Geu-rae Jang, a newcomer.

954
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,130
I'm back, sir.

955
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:43,930
That's what I mean!

956
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,400
Why are you here again?

957
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,560
Congratulations, Geu-rae.

958
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,740
Thank you. I'll start working then.

959
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,780
Jeez. HR team, those bastards.

960
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:00,700
Hey!

961
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:04,620
-Where did Young-yi go?
-Well, she's...

962
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,870
She's assigned to the Resource Team.

963
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,290
Seok-yul to the Textile Team,
and Baek-ki to the Steel Team.

964
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,090
I heard Seok-ho was
sent to the headquarters.

965
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,210
That's it.

966
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,430
Hey.

967
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:26,520
Why were you assigned to my team?

968
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,560
I guess you want me.

969
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,900
What? Me?

970
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:33,270
Do you really think I do?

971
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:36,190
Come on. Do you want him?

972
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,700
-No.
-I don't want you.

973
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,820
Hey, punk. I don't want you.

974
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,410
What? Are you laughing?

975
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:47,540
Goodness, I don't want you.
Tell him I don't want him.

976
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:50,210
-Me, neither.
-Mr. Ko.

977
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:52,290
-I don't want him here.
-Hello.

978
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,470
You guys seem to be having fun.

979
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,510
It's worthwhile seeing Sang-sik

980
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:04,060
doing something that's unlikely of him.

981
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,640
The atmosphere is great in your team.

982
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,690
I also feel good to get your smiles back.

983
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:14,980
Keep up the good work.

984
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,350
Your name is?

985
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,060
It's Geu-rae Jang.

986
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,480
You received your GED, and that's it?

987
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,270
Any work experience? Do you speak
English or any other foreign languages?

988
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,400
What were you doing
for the past several years?

989
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,780
You have no skills at all.

990
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,110
You're right.

991
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,950
Until I turned 26 years old,
what have I done?

992
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:22,680
It's worthwhile seeing Sang-sik
doing something that's unlikely of him.

993
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,970
The atmosphere is great in your team.

994
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,890
I also feel good to get your smiles back.

995
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,340
What are you doing?

996
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:05,010
-Mr. Oh.
-Are you goofing off on your first day?

997
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,220
No, sir.

998
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,860
To be honest,

999
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:26,280
I'm not glad you're back.

1000
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:30,530
As you know,

1001
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,370
we need a versatile, capable worker.

1002
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,130
I know.

1003
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:46,590
Young-yi should have joined us.

1004
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:55,270
Since you're already in our team,

1005
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,730
just hang in there by all means.

1006
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,110
Hang in there, and you'll be successful.

1007
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:06,650
Hang in there,

1008
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,530
then you'll somehow step closer
to a complete life.

1009
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:13,290
Complete life?

1010
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:16,040
You may not know,

1011
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,000
but these are  baduk  terms.

1012
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,750
Incomplete life.

1013
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,750
Complete life.

1014
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,810
We all have an incomplete life so far.

1015
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,900
