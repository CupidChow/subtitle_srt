1
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,660
Mr. Hwang, bring me
the Chile Shipment contract.

2
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,580
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,500
Mi-ra, here's the payment slip.
Have you received the TC yet?

4
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,920
I have to send the shipment contract.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,750
How do you expect me to get the TC
when you gave me the documents so late?

6
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,510
-It's only possible because I'm doing it.
-All right.

7
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,010
Hello, this is Geu-rae Jang.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,640
You mean the meeting
for the SMC water tank project?

9
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,680
Right, the meeting is at...

10
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,850
I apologize, but due to internal issues,
the representative was changed.

11
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,310
Yes, Dong-sik Kim is in charge.

12
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,230
The first three numbers are the same

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,400
and the last four digits are 1216.

14
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,770
Yes.

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,900
Yes. Thank you for your understanding.

16
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,540
Baek-ki, show me the estimates
for the Turkey project.

17
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,050
Okay.

18
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,920
Baek-ki, how many times
did I tell you that

19
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,170
you can't only do your own project?

20
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,090
Right, I'm sorry.

21
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,890
I'm not good at multi-tasking.

22
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,670
Sir, this is the printed report
you asked for.

23
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,090
You even print reports perfectly
and professionally, Young-yi.

24
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,430
Really?

25
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,050
Yes. It looks very neat and organized.

26
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,140
You only knew that now?

27
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,310
Young-yi, you even joke now?

28
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,780
Yes. I read and study joke books a lot.

29
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,030
Really?

30
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,410
Why are we so close
and friendly all of a sudden?

31
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,490
I don't know.

32
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,920
The subcontractor has been chosen.

33
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,720
They will produce the products that
the Ulsan factory has trouble producing.

34
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,720
-The contract has been signed.
-I see.

35
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,760
It's been three days
since they started working.

36
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,100
Good.

37
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,770
I'm relieved now.

38
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,480
Ulsan factory will produce as much
as they can to keep the costs low.

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
That's great.

40
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,570
You should be in charge of communicating
with the site from now on. Good job.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,250
I'll go and get some coffee, sir.

42
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,590
Sure. Go ahead.

43
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,810
So, what do you say? How's Saturday?

44
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,810
I'm really good. No, thank you.

45
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,810
They are studying
to become flight attendants.

46
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,820
They have the brains, body
and personality.

47
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,360
What I'm saying is, we should go
on gatherings like these.

48
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,410
Why do we need to go?

49
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,950
What is a gathering?

50
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,370
It is the only way to meet soulmate

51
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,000
and tighten the bond between coworkers.

52
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,630
It's a breath of fresh air.

53
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,420
We need to get ready for the cold winter.

54
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,510
Honestly, there aren't
any good-looking women around us.

55
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,880
It's either a drag queen
or the beautiful Young-yi An.

56
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,550
What? What about me?

57
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,600
-Hello.
-Hello.

58
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,850
Hello.

59
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,070
Ms. Sun is back tomorrow, right?
What time does she get in?

60
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,990
Four o'clock.

61
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,160
Then I guess we need to stay.

62
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,160
If the company says that it'll be tough,
she should just let it go.

63
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,080
I need to wrap up the Vietnam project too.

64
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,790
Ms. Sun is just too much.

65
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,040
She really doesn't think about us.

66
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,130
It won't even earn much.

67
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,630
We'll be working late everyday
once she gets back.

68
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,220
Be prepared.

69
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,840
She's in Pakistan
for the blanket export project.

70
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,470
Our team received a request
for assistance.

71
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,310
I guess Sales Team One doesn't want
to do the project.

72
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,640
Also that.

73
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,440
Well, the company is a bit skeptical
about the project as well.

74
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,400
You know there was an earthquake
in Pakistan, right?

75
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,030
The Pakistan government requested blankets
for the refugees.

76
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,910
They asked to decrease the cost
and delay the deadline of the payment.

77
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,870
Ms. Sun accepted that deal in an instant

78
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,080
to provide humanitarian aid.

79
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,750
Heavy workload that doesn't pay off,

80
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,130
plus an unwilling team.

81
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,250
Ms. Sun must be having a hard time.

82
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,420
She seemed so tired lately.

83
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,640
So, why were you all talking about me?

84
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,180
-The coffee's getting cold.
-Seok-yul.

85
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,810
Go to Textile Team. Where is that report?

86
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,890
So, we should go tomorrow.

87
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,620
Since this is an item I chose,

88
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,120
can't you understand when I tell you
to take this item and do it?

89
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,790
By any chance,

90
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,460
is this a project item given by Mr. Choi?

91
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,070
Yes.

92
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,070
SOLAR POWER GENERATION PROJECT

93
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,910
It's the solar power generation project
that we're trying to get.

94
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,910
The director worked hard on this item
for the past year.

95
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,160
If we win the contract,

96
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,290
we'll earn 500 million dollars.

97
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,630
It won't be that difficult.

98
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,170
SOLAR POWER DISPLAY PROJECT

99
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,300
This will back it up.

100
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,220
Everything has been set up.
We just need to have the contract signed.

101
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,100
What do you mean this will back it up?

102
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,890
Have you never done business
with China before?

103
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,560
Are you talking about bribery?

104
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,020
However, the solar power generation
is a Chinese government project.

105
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,280
I was told that nothing has been confirmed
with Poshin Co. Limited.

106
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,490
Listen.

107
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,610
They will definitely close this deal.

108
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,080
The director would not think
this would work if it wasn't for that.

109
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,000
Think about it carefully,
and let me know by Monday.

110
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,670
Hey, Mr. Cheon.

111
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,140
The director?

112
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,820
Why?

113
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,280
Why would he give us
a big project like this?

114
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Take it.

115
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,580
If it works out, it will be more than
three years' worth of performance.

116
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,670
But something is just fishy.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,210
It's not our style to use bribery.

118
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,660
Isn't doing whatever we need
to do our style?

119
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,040
If we don't do this one, everyone will say
that our team is full of idiots.

120
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,500
And bribery

121
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,580
is a common practice when you're
doing business with China.

122
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,250
Really?

123
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,130
This is not in good faith.

124
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,090
-What?
-Although bribery is a common practice,

125
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,720
there are times
when it's not the right thing to do.

126
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,680
If we don't do it carefully,
it might all go wrong.

127
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,350
And the bigger problem is,

128
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,600
that the bribery used
for this project was quite large.

129
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,860
If we don't succeed even
with the huge bribe,

130
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,480
there's a possibility that
our team will shoulder the whole loss.

131
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,700
Also, it's not in our power
whether Poshin will be able

132
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,530
to win this
solar power generation contract.

133
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,620
It all depends on whether or not

134
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,370
Poshin will win this contract.

135
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,140
Do you think
I should pull the rotten tooth

136
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,890
or leave it?

137
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,610
But then

138
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,570
I do like that side of Mr. Oh sometimes.

139
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,860
Damn it.

140
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,870
This is not in good faith.

141
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,990
If we don't succeed even
with the huge bribe,

142
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,910
there's a possibility that
our team will shoulder the whole loss.

143
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,420
Mr. Cheon.

144
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,170
Hey.

145
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,970
It's okay.

146
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,060
I'm not sure what's going on.

147
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,400
Why would Mr. Choi do that all
of a sudden?

148
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,280
What do you think?

149
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,110
You really don't want to do it?

150
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,030
Do you want an honest answer?

151
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,530
Yes.

152
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,870
To be honest, I want to do it.

153
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,210
If we succeed,

154
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,500
it will really make our team shine.

155
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,550
I guess we would be able to move
from the corner near the bathroom.

156
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,260
Poshin has been working on the solar power
generation project in China,

157
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,930
so there's a high possibility for them
to win the contract this time too.

158
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,520
They're quite a big company.

159
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,020
But I'm still wondering about the reason.

160
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,730
It's an important project
for the director as well.

161
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,440
The vice president title is on line
with the success of this project.

162
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,900
Vice president?

163
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,780
But he needs a backup, too.

164
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,660
He needs to also prepare
for the one percent chance of failure.

165
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,750
He's using us as his arsenal.

166
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,380
Then Mr. Oh will definitely not do it.

167
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,960
There's no reason to do it.
He will see right through the director.

168
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,970
It's completely different
from the Jordan project.

169
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,550
We don't have to take it.

170
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,970
I guess so.

171
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,810
I still want Mr. Oh to do it.

172
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,190
There's a high chance of success.

173
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,900
If it works we'll...

174
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,620
Are you done?

175
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,660
With what?

176
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,950
Weren't you in the trial show?

177
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,210
The researchers from the China electric
factory is giving a trial show.

178
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,960
-I told you yesterday.
-That's right.

179
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,630
My goodness.

180
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,960
Did Mr. Oh go?

181
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,720
Yes, he did.

182
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,510
He's been depressed for the past few days.

183
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,640
I guess he was able to pull it together
for that at least.

184
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,480
He said that he needed to see
if the product is good enough to sell.

185
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,560
-There he comes.
-Sir.

186
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,560
The general manager
of the factory is here too.

187
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,360
Hello, Mr. Ko!

188
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,820
-Have you been well?
-Yes, of course.

189
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,690
-Stay healthy, sir.
-Okay.

190
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,860
Mr. Hwang, you're so handsome.

191
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,530
-Well, you keep getting prettier.
-Thank you.

192
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,790
Wow! Isn't this our cute curly head,
Mr. Kim!

193
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,830
-It's good to see you!
-Hello.

194
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,920
Take the jade cushion back with you.

195
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,210
-It hurts my butt.
-What are you talking about?

196
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,260
You need to wait for that to pass.
Your body needs to get used to it,

197
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,010
then it will start healing.

198
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,180
You're all talk.

199
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,350
Mr. Seo, why didn't you send us the report

200
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,810
regarding the claim resolution last time?
I requested it a couple of times.

201
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,940
I will have it sent right away.

202
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,860
Are you sure you don't need anything?

203
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,860
Yes.

204
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,990
-How about a jade mattress?
-I don't need one.

205
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,030
-How about a jade pillow?
-I said I don't need it.

206
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,790
You are simply the best employee, Mr. Kim.

207
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,910
You work so hard.

208
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,120
When is your promotion?

209
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,670
This is my third year as a deputy manager.
I'm far from another promotion

210
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't you become a manager
after three years?

211
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,470
One more year and our cute curly-haired
Mr. Kim will become a manager.

212
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,800
Then again,

213
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,140
our two managers
took forever to get promoted.

214
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,480
-Stop that.
-That's right.

215
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,600
Oh yeah, Mr. Ko is an exception.
He was already promoted.

216
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,110
I guess it's not just how long
you've been working.

217
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,190
Isn't that right, Mr. Oh?

218
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,780
-Hello.
-Hello.

219
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,330
Who is he? I haven't seen him before.

220
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,620
He's our newbie.

221
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,750
This is the general manager
of the China factory, Jin-sang Seo.

222
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,500
This is Geu-rae Jang. That is his seat.

223
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,340
Hello. I'm Geu-rae Jang.

224
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,300
It's nice to meet you. I'm Jin-sang Seo.

225
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,970
Wow. Sales Team Three is really expanding.

226
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,350
I can't believe you have
such a good-looking newbie in your team.

227
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,640
How many newbies are there?

228
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,190
What?

229
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,580
Have you heard
of the deer honey of Paektu mountain?

230
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,050
Here you go.

231
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,840
Come on.

232
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,050
Here we go.

233
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,510
You've heard
of the Sanghwang mushroom, right?

234
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,220
You all know that it is quite expensive
and good for the health, right?

235
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,100
That very Sanghwang mushroom,

236
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,350
the Sanghwang mushroom in Paektu mountain

237
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,190
is eaten by Paektu mountain deer.

238
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,940
Those deer defecate like rabbits do.

239
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,530
Then a flower grows from that poop,

240
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,240
so the bees make honey from that flower.

241
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,750
And this is that very honey.

242
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,330
The deer honey from Paektu mountain

243
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,080
-Poop?
-Poop.

244
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,630
It's so rare.

245
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,380
Just because a deer poops,
it doesn't always grow flowers.

246
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,760
There's no such thing. Let's go.

247
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,130
It's really good for men.

248
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,680
It's really good...

249
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,480
I'm really at a loss for words.

250
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,650
This was not made to be sold.

251
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,320
The packaging is bad
because it's not for sale.

252
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,860
It's good for men.
What are you doing here?

253
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,080
It really has no effect on women.

254
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,040
It is only good for men. That's for sure.

255
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,080
However, it is really good for the skin.

256
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,380
-This?
-Here.

257
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,090
Have a taste, everyone.

258
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,920
That's right. Here you go.

259
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,300
Here, try it. I won't ask for much.

260
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,890
Here, take a spoonful. It's okay.

261
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,310
It's really good for you.
So please don't spill it.

262
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,520
Yes.

263
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,400
Wow, you are taking a lot.

264
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,980
Just a little.

265
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,450
What?

266
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,370
Geu-rae. What is that look?

267
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,290
-Well...
-Are you thinking that this is fake?

268
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,920
No. I'm not.

269
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,210
Fine. All right.

270
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,010
There's a small inn behind Gwanghwamun.

271
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,630
I'll give you my number.

272
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
If you change your mind, call me.

273
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,260
What?

274
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,310
An inn? Everyone thinks that
you're staying at Plajin Hotel.

275
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,980
I can't stay at a hotel.

276
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,900
I can't seem to sleep well
in those hotel blankets.

277
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,770
No matter how many times I've traveled,
I've never stayed at a hotel.

278
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,530
The only thing I do there is sleep.
Isn't it a waste of money?

279
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm that kind of person.

280
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,530
I don't use my money without thinking.

281
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,540
That person brought this precious...

282
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,830
Forget it. What's the point?

283
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,120
It's so rare and valuable that

284
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,050
I wouldn't even sell it
to the president or any rich person.

285
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,840
I can't sell it to people that don't know
the value of the product.

286
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,430
Okay, I understand. Have a good day.

287
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,650
Take a spoonful after every meal.

288
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,940
-No.
-No.

289
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,950
She acts like she knows it all.

290
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,160
Young-yi, I didn't expect you
to be so gullible.

291
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,330
-What?
-No, it's fine.

292
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,920
Good. I like that.

293
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,790
A spoonful after every meal?

294
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,800
-Yes.
-I'll make sure to take it.

295
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,300
Thank you Young-yi.

296
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,130
Isn't this sugar...

297
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,880
Keep your mouth shut.

298
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,850
-I don't want to eat it.
-It's the deer honey from Paektu mountain.

299
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,770
Take a spoonful after every meal.

300
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,150
-Baek-ki.
-Yes?

301
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,740
You've been suckered.

302
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,280
What?

303
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,790
Whatever it may be, thank you.

304
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,840
What? Deer honey?

305
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,090
It's good for men and the skin.

306
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,930
I'm going to give it to my mom.

307
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,640
Really?

308
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,100
You're going to get beaten
with the mackerel tail.

309
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,430
-What?
-No, it's nothing.

310
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,900
Help him out. He's going through a lot.

311
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,230
He's actually a nice person.

312
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,150
What?

313
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,570
-Mr. Cheon.
-Yes?

314
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,530
You know Mr. Seo right?

315
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,910
Of course.
I just let him take advantage of me.

316
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,490
Take advantage of you?

317
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,410
That's odd. My pen was just here.
I wonder where it is?

318
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,460
It was here for sure. How weird.

319
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,300
I'm that kind of person.

320
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,800
What? It's deer honey.

321
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,720
Deer...

322
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,220
-I did it!
-What?

323
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,890
-I get to become an expat employee!
-Where? When?

324
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,230
-Singapore! Next May!
-Let's see.

325
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,690
Wow! Good for you!

326
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,810
Do you know how much I worked to send you

327
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,690
-as an expat employee?
-Of course I do.

328
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,860
-All right.
-Congratulations.

329
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,490
Yes, thank you.

330
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,450
What is this?

331
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,950
Even Mr. Yoo
from the Resource Team will go to England?

332
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,490
He's only been a deputy manager
for a year. He'll travel already?

333
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,790
That's amazing.

334
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,620
The power of his team is showing
through, for sure.

335
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,080
-Wow.
-He's going already.

336
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,130
Mr. Hwang, congratulations.

337
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,510
Yes, thank you.

338
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,010
Good job.

339
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,300
Shouldn't you call Ga-eun?

340
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,300
-That's right.
-Yes, you should.

341
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,220
Good for you.

342
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,510
-There's a lot of people leaving.
-Yes.

343
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,810
-It's a shame we'll lose you.
-It's not until next year.

344
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,990
-Mr. Hwang, congratulations.
-Yes?

345
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,320
Yes, thank you.

346
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,530
Honey!

347
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,040
The transfer request
to Singapore has been approved!

348
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,960
I told you it would come through.
Of course!

349
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,710
Yes, you know.

350
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,130
Wow.

351
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,430
Mr. Hwang was very lucky.

352
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,100
He was told to go to Ghana last time.
He had a hard time with that.

353
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,810
Yes, that's right.
Mr. Ko really worked hard on that too.

354
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,850
Yes.

355
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,850
To be honest,
I was kind of anticipating it

356
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,900
because of Mr. Park's issue
and the Jordan project,

357
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,400
I mean, I don't have to go.

358
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,150
Of course, you do. It's the best thing
about working for a trading company.

359
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,870
When they told me to go to Congo,
maybe I should have just gone.

360
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,000
Since I declined that time,
I'm not being offered again.

361
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,040
I don't even dream
about working in the US or Europe.

362
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,380
Since I declined last time,
that made me look bad, I guess.

363
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,340
It's not because you declined.

364
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,390
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,050
What?

366
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,890
Sir, what are you saying? It's not that.

367
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,730
What are you talking about?

368
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,690
I'm going to get some fresh air.

369
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,980
Will we deliver the project
for the São Paulo Neon on time?

370
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,310
Yes, Chungsol Corp.
will be processing the delivery.

371
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,980
We will check on it once again.

372
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,310
-Chungsol?
-Yes.

373
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,230
Okay.

374
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,777
Make sure you tell Mr. Lee at Chungsol

375
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,377
to meet the deadline of delivery date.

376
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,680
It was delayed the last time.

377
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,310
Is that right?

378
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,100
I will make sure to let them know.
It will be delivered on time,

379
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,940
so please do not worry.

380
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,150
Okay.

381
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,160
What?

382
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,410
You know that Chungsol Company
always delays the delivery.

383
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,460
-So what?
-I don't think you should work with them.

384
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,790
We have other vendors.

385
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,250
This punk...

386
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,090
I didn't say anything
in front of the manager,

387
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,220
but I think you should go
with the Youngmin enterprise.

388
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,220
Who are you to tell me
what to do, you punk?

389
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,140
How much do you know about that vendor

390
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,730
to talk crap like that?

391
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,440
Crap?

392
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,520
Yes, that's right.

393
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,400
You were quite the pervert as an intern.

394
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,240
You'd better stop talking nonsense.

395
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,660
You think you're all that
because you got one thing done?

396
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,620
I think it's nonsense

397
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,540
to use a company that is lazy, complacent

398
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,500
and irresponsible.

399
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,920
What did you say, you punk?

400
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,210
Don't call me a punk.

401
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,720
You should thank me for not talking
in front of the manager.

402
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,970
Don't make personal matters interfere
with your work. Look at the facts.

403
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,560
Be rational and realistic.

404
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,390
You don't have something
with Chungsol Corp., do you?

405
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,730
What did you say?
Being silent to save face?

406
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,450
Yes, sir.

407
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,330
It's nothing.

408
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,910
Okay, I'll be right there.

409
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,920
This damn sociopath.

410
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,300
Do you want to go at it?

411
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,470
All right. Let's do it.

412
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,590
Let's do it, you punk.

413
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,680
Let's see who leaves first.

414
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,310
Let's do it.

415
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,360
Damn it, that hurt.

416
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,120
-Mr. Oh...
-Sit down.

417
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,820
Cigarette.

418
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,860
Is Dong-sik okay?

419
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,450
Well, I suppose.

420
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,330
Damn it.

421
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,660
The company is so cheap.

422
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,420
Damn it.

423
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,710
-Hey Mr. Hwang.
-Congratulations Mr. Hwang.

424
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,040
Thank you.

425
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,010
I really don't want to come to work
because of the sociopath.

426
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,720
Should I ask to go abroad?

427
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,510
You're so funny.

428
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,430
Mr. Hwang should buy some drinks.

429
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,100
-Yes, he should.
-Right.

430
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,060
Are you really delaying it
until you get married?

431
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,190
That would be better.

432
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,200
That's right.
Dong-sik didn't get it again.

433
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,620
When Mr. Oh gets absorbed in a project,

434
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,830
he's so busy making sure
the project succeeds

435
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,410
he doesn't even care for his subordinates.

436
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,620
If we're working the same hours anyway,

437
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,670
wouldn't it be much better to work
for a team where the production is shown?

438
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,000
He has no luck with his seniors.

439
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,010
It's like he goes looking for work.

440
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,090
That little...

441
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,680
But their team really gets along well.

442
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,480
Is it a club?
What's so important about that?

443
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,440
Even if you're always being yelled at,
it's better to work for a competent boss.

444
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,860
Of course.

445
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,730
It's good for him and me.

446
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,070
Get promoted together
and receive incentives.

447
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,860
So even if people talk crap,

448
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,320
that's the kind
of team people want to work for.

449
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,030
Sales Team Three?

450
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,950
All they do is choose and work
on the difficult projects.

451
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,410
Let's go. Just go.
You don't need to hear that.

452
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,920
If the manager gets work
that never gets recognized,

453
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,670
when will they get promoted?

454
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,880
Is he his servant? He's no help at all.

455
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,840
Mr. Kim is even more stupid.
I don't know why he backs him up.

456
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,890
-Those punks...
-What are you doing? Leave them alone.

457
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,060
Damn it. They're talking nonsense.

458
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,020
Let's go.

459
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,060
Those punks.

460
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Yes, this is Dong-sik Kim.
You got my email, right?

461
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,070
I wanted to go over
the estimates in the email.

462
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,990
The estimates are
a bit different from before.

463
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,620
May I call you back
after we've discussed this in our meeting?

464
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,250
Yes. Okay, thank you.

465
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,800
Hello. This is Dong-sik Kim.

466
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,310
The shipping cost has changed from before.

467
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,850
Yes. Please keep the pricing the same.

468
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,100
Hey, Mr. Hwang. Come here.

469
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,480
Come here.

470
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,820
We saw you guys talking outside.

471
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,490
Why do you guys talk so loud?

472
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,030
You shouldn't even talk
about stuff like that.

473
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,030
Damn it.

474
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,290
What?

475
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,590
What do we do?
We were idiots for doing that

476
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,800
I didn't know he could hear us.

477
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,090
You guys make me crazy!

478
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,300
Damn you guys.

479
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,850
You assholes!

480
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,270
What do you know about my manager
to talk like that?

481
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,360
Can you guys even work like Mr. Oh?
Look at yourselves first.

482
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,690
Hey, Mr. Ha and Mr. Yoo.

483
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,280
You guys don't know crap
and you're talking shit.

484
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,080
What? This asshole, you're really...

485
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,120
-Hey.
-Stop that.

486
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,330
Stop that. Don't do that.

487
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,410
He's drunk. He's not in his right mind.

488
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,960
If you mess with him at a time like this,
you don't know what he'll do.

489
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:14,960
Guys.

490
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:19,090
You all know I don't like to cuss, right?
But let me tell you one thing.

491
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,970
You fucking assholes!

492
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,590
-Damn it.
-Jeez.

493
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,560
Have you guys been yelled at like us?

494
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,560
I get yelled at so much
that it adds to my fat.

495
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,980
This is all alcohol fat and...

496
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,650
-Hey!
-Stop that.

497
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,440
-Let go of me.
-Stop it already.

498
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,230
-That little punk.
-You fucking bastards.

499
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,150
Dong-sik is another sociopath.

500
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,410
-Yeah. That's right.
-What is happening to the world?

501
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,080
What did you say? Say it again, you punk!

502
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,160
Jeez.

503
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,580
I wasn't even there.
Why did you call me out?

504
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,260
That's what friends are for.
Don't you remember when we were newbies?

505
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,970
When Dong-sik started to act up,
all four of us

506
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,590
-couldn't handle him.
-That's right.

507
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,220
When Mr. Kim starts it,
our whole team can't stop him.

508
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,140
Hey, the Resource Team started it first!

509
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,350
Yeah. Resource Team.

510
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,690
You damn...

511
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,820
I do it because I like my job.

512
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,230
How dare you talk shit about my manager.

513
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,690
If anyone was to talk,

514
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,030
I will be the one talking crap.
None of you have the right!

515
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,450
Hey.

516
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,240
Hey!

517
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,040
-Hey, Mr. Sung!
-Stop that.

518
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,710
I'll kill you
if you talk shit one more time!

519
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,870
-What?
-No.

520
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,130
-You punk.
-Stop them.

521
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,460
Help him stand up.

522
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,260
-Hey, hurry and stop them.
-Get up.

523
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,800
-Hey, get up.
-Let go of me!

524
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,340
One, two, three.

525
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,550
Let's go.

526
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,100
Mr. Sung, you son of a bitch!

527
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,230
-Pick that up.
-Go home, you asshole!

528
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,980
-Get up.
-One more bottle of soju, please.

529
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,940
-Yes, one more.
-Let's go.

530
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,870
SOLAR POWER GENERATION PROJECT

531
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,430
-Geu-rae.
-Yes?

532
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,430
What are you doing?
Do you have a lot of work?

533
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,930
-No, sir.
-Then why aren't you going home?

534
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,310
Because you're still here.

535
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,940
Go home.

536
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,780
Well, sir...

537
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,160
Is there something wrong?

538
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,700
No.

539
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,620
Go home.

540
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,160
Okay.

541
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,670
Your life can change

542
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,760
depending on who you meet.

543
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,100
If you follow a fly,

544
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,060
you'll probably walk into a bathroom.

545
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,860
If you follow a bumble bee,

546
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,280
you'll probably walk into a flower garden.

547
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,700
I see.

548
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,580
I guess that's why
I'm walking in a flower garden.

549
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,630
Okay.

550
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,810
If the manager gets work
that never gets recognized,

551
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,650
when will they get promoted?

552
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,230
Is he his servant? He's no help at all.

553
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,820
Mr. Kim is even more stupid.
I don't know why he backs him up.

554
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,490
WIFE

555
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,450
Yes, honey.

556
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,250
I'm not your honey.

557
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,420
Daddy, it's me Jun-woo.

558
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,710
Hey. My baby!

559
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,460
Ask him if he drank.

560
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,710
Did you drink, Daddy?

561
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,220
No.

562
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,800
He didn't.

563
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,050
My big brother got first place
in taekwondo.

564
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,060
I got 100% on the spelling test
and my little brother was last place.

565
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,100
You have to tell me one at a time.

566
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,270
Daddy, you're not busy right now?
Is it okay to talk long?

567
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,320
Yes, of course!

568
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,820
It's okay. Your little brother
can get last place.

569
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,860
Really? Then I can get last place too?

570
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,120
Can you be as nice as your little brother?

571
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,450
-Then you can.
-Mommy said I can't be too nice.

572
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,210
She said I need
to have ambition to live well.

573
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,170
Do you know what ambition means?

574
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,210
-That's right!
-Jeez.

575
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,130
I can only go to Congo
because our team has bad reputation.

576
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,340
-So what? Is that our team's fault?
-Jeez.

577
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,970
Is that Mr. Oh's fault?

578
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,800
-Jeez.
-Stop it already.

579
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,180
-Damn it.
-Seriously?

580
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,310
-Get up.
-I'll do it.

581
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,230
Do you guys know where Dong-sik lives?

582
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,230
I can't take him to my place.
My dad is there.

583
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,820
My wife is feeling under the weather.

584
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:37,950
My house is too small.
Dong-sik will not fit in.

585
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,160
I live with my brother.

586
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,380
No.

587
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,630
-Why?
-Why?

588
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,510
You guys are dirty.

589
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,300
Use his cell phone to call his house.

590
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,850
Dong-sik lives alone.

591
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,220
Jeez.

592
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:03,930
Let's go.

593
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,850
Where are you going?

594
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,900
My goodness.

595
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:27,290
I can't believe I'm at a place like this
with you guys.

596
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,500
I can't believe Mr. Sung
just left like that.

597
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,380
Nobody can beat him.

598
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,470
When did Dong-sik gain all that weight?

599
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,760
He's even heavier now!

600
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,010
I almost fainted taking off his pants.

601
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,640
His legs are...

602
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
They're like an elephant's.

603
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,810
I told you
we should have called his mother.

604
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,940
But still,

605
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,240
thanks to Dong-sik, we got together.

606
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,160
That's true.

607
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,660
We were so close before.

608
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,500
Now it's all about performance
connection, and competition.

609
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,380
It's like that.

610
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,760
The Resource Team is still on top.

611
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,020
You can lie down here.

612
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,730
I don't sleep at places like this.
I'm leaving soon.

613
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,530
I'm sorry.

614
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,000
Why don't you take a medicine?

615
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,770
Here you go.

616
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,740
Are you okay?

617
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,200
I think I'll survive.

618
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,410
Come to the roof.

619
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,630
Dong-sik.

620
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:35,800
Yes?

621
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,260
Would you like to transfer
to another team?

622
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,770
What are you talking about?

623
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,480
Our team is tough.

624
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,570
I heard what happened yesterday.

625
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,530
I'm sorry. Please don't think about it.

626
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,910
I would never

627
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,660
think like that.

628
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
I don't.

629
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,090
It's not that.

630
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,300
You know,

631
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,050
I'm here because I like working.

632
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,810
But...

633
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,060
I'm doing it because I want to.

634
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,270
But you're not.

635
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,400
When I work, I really don't look
at my surroundings.

636
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,860
-So...
-Mr. Oh.

637
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,830
I like working with you. That's all.

638
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,330
And I will look after myself.

639
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,250
If I want to switch teams,
I'll let you know.

640
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,760
Okay. You're right.

641
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,720
Let's get to work.

642
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,480
What's going on with the
Sales Team One's Vietnam project?

643
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,980
Mr. Cha gave me the report to review.

644
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,280
But it hasn't been reviewed
by Ms. Sun yet.

645
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,450
I think it'll only proceed
after Ms. Sun gets back.

646
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,660
-Really?
-Yes.

647
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,160
Okay.

648
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,580
I'll be in the office in one hour.

649
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,170
I will prepare the report
and send it to you by Tuesday.

650
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,960
Why don't you take a look at the report
first, and then we can discuss it again?

651
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,300
Yes.

652
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,550
Yes.

653
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,460
Yes, I already reviewed
the Vietnam project on the plane.

654
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,840
Yes.

655
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,170
I think we should just increase
the labor cost.

656
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,840
Yes. Pass that on to Sales Team Three.

657
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,050
Yes. Okay.

658
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,520
This is Mr. Cha from Sales Team One.

659
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:18,650
Okay.

660
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:20,940
What?

661
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,700
-What's wrong?
-Okay.

662
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,240
Ms. Sun collapsed, sir.

663
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,540
An ambulance picked her up
near the airport.

664
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,620
What?

665
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,830
What do you mean?

666
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,680
Yes?

667
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,480
Hey, you're here.

668
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,770
How is she doing?

669
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,320
They need to do more tests.

670
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,240
She collapsed from fatigue
and insomnia caused by stress.

671
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,870
She needs to be hospitalized
for a few days.

672
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,080
She has been working until late hours.
She even went straight to Pakistan.

673
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:13,830
She was overworked.

674
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,260
Just let her rest for a while.
She just needs some rest.

675
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,510
Ms. Sun really overworked herself.

676
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,140
I'm just so upset and guilty.

677
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,970
I was promoted.

678
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,730
Really? Congratulations.

679
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,400
Why the long face.
That's really good news.

680
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,730
Actually, we fought about that.

681
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:49,320
I told her to quit her job
since I got promoted.

682
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,700
She was having a hard time.

683
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,620
I think I pushed it too much.

684
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,120
Is she quitting?

685
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,460
No.

686
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,630
She said she didn't want to.

687
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,300
She said that it is something

688
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,340
she's been doing for 15 years.
She likes her job.

689
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,470
She needs to love herself

690
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,220
in order to love her family too.

691
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:20,020
Mr. Oh, we're about to leave now.

692
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,190
Yes. I need to go, too.

693
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:26,780
I must pick up So-mi too.
I'll give you a call.

694
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,650
Thank you for coming.

695
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,320
Sure. Go ahead.

696
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,580
Thank you for coming.

697
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,080
Mr. Oh.

698
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,630
Please stop her.

699
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:47,550
The blanket export project to Pakistan

700
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,760
is something that has no merits.
Even the company is skeptical about it.

701
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:55,350
I don't understand why she is pushing it.

702
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,390
Then again, you are both the same.

703
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,770
Anyway, we can't do it well without her.

704
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,570
Tell her to rest while she's in
the hospital and don't worry about work.

705
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,610
You guys are close.
So please tell her that.

706
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,040
Okay. I will.

707
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:22,420
You two go ahead. I need to take care
of some business before I get back.

708
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,330
Yes, sir.

709
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,530
Hey, you're awake.

710
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,950
How do you feel?

711
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,700
Why did you come?

712
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:01,620
Just because.

713
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:05,250
Do you want to get up? Hold on a second.

714
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,880
Wait, it's going down.

715
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,380
Stay still. Just lie down.

716
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,300
That's fine.

717
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,300
You scared us.

718
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,430
You need to stay here
for a couple of days.

719
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,850
Mr. Um and Mr. Cha were here.

720
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:24,810
They're very worried about you.
They want you to completely rest.

721
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,060
They said don't worry about work.

722
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:30,900
Worry?

723
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,660
Is the Pakistan project even possible?
Put it on hold,

724
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:40,040
and get back to it
when you're up and running.

725
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,160
Maybe I shouldn't do it.

726
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,580
I don't think I can do it.

727
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,590
Well, if you can't delay it,

728
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,630
Mr. Um and Mr. Cha can do it.

729
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,300
If not...

730
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,640
Is it because your husband told you
to quit your job?

731
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:07,020
When my husband told me that,

732
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:11,230
I really thought about it.

733
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,740
I discussed it with Mr. Lee.

734
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,450
But he...

735
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,240
-Did you hear about Ms. Sun?
-What?

736
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,750
She told Mr. Lee that she wants to quit.

737
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,130
She withdrew it.

738
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,000
What?

739
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,880
Then,

740
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,640
what about our promotions?

741
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,510
We need to wait longer.

742
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,020
I don't want to go to Team Three.
I want to work with you for a long time.

743
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,690
I thought of them as family.

744
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,940
I even cared
for their personal well-being.

745
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,900
But in the end,

746
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,370
it was no more than
just a business relationship.

747
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,910
When I said I was going to quit,

748
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,620
they thought of it as an opportunity.

749
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,460
They actually anticipated it.

750
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,630
Both Mr. Um and Mr. Cha.

751
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,550
That's why,

752
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,180
since I'm sick and all,

753
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,350
I don't want to do it anymore.

754
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,120
Mr. Um and Mr. Cha
just transferred not even a year ago.

755
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,290
That's why.

756
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,620
Mr. Oh, the one working abroad learned how
to work from you

757
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:36,240
and always said that
he respects you a lot.

758
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,680
Once Mr. Oh comes back, it'll change.

759
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,180
Just wait.

760
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,900
Did you send the file?

761
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,650
Yes, sir.

762
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,070
I heard that Ms. Sun collapsed.

763
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,790
It's from overfatigue and stress.

764
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,540
My goodness.

765
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,040
You need to take care of yourself.

766
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,590
You used to have esophagitis
due to stress.

767
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,170
Didn't you have it for a while?

768
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,010
-Yes.
-Go ahead.

769
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,930
That's right. About Geu-rae,

770
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:37,770
I heard that the person
in charge was changed.

771
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:40,730
I feel bad.

772
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,770
But it's a company policy.

773
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,240
I wanted to do something,
but it's really difficult.

774
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,030
It's okay, sir.

775
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,660
The company is sometimes a bit too much.

776
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,000
He is a good worker.

777
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,660
That's why you need
to build your own power.

778
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:03,130
If you keep switching temporary workers,

779
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,460
it won't look good for the company too.

780
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,720
And then you need to train them
all over again.

781
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,220
Let's dine out together soon.

782
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,430
Okay.

783
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,530
-Mr. Um.
-Yes?

784
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:33,410
You and Mr. Cha will continue working
on the project, right?

785
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,120
Is there something I can do to help?

786
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,490
What?

787
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,620
Mr. Oh.

788
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,750
We told you earlier about that.

789
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,340
Weren't you able to convince Ms. Sun?

790
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,290
Sir.

791
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,510
We're really busy right now.

792
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,970
I thought of them as family.

793
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:55,100
I even cared
for their personal well-being.

794
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:56,760
But in the end,

795
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,980
it was no more than
just a business relationship.

796
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,100
When I said I was going to quit,

797
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:06,900
they thought of it as an opportunity.

798
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,360
They actually anticipated it.

799
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,010
How's Ms. Sun doing?

800
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,380
She's fine.

801
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:37,050
Jeez, that scared me.

802
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,760
If you're done, go home.

803
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:40,680
Okay.

804
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,100
Then we'll get going.

805
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,520
Okay. See you on Monday.

806
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,610
Goodbye.

807
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,150
-Wait for me.
-Bye.

808
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,160
Goodbye. See you.

809
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,620
I'm just going to shred these,
then I'll get going.

810
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,660
Okay.

811
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,490
-Geu-rae.
-Yes?

812
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,950
Did Seok-yul go home?

813
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,460
-I don't think so.
-Call him for me.

814
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,590
Seok-yul, one second please.

815
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:18,890
Hey. This is Mr. Oh.

816
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:23,980
You know the request sent
from Sales Team Two for assistance?

817
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,600
Yes. Could you bring that to me?

818
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,870
Yes, sir.

819
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:50,071
No, I'm coming.

820
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,930
Are you really going to do this?
I said I'm coming.

821
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,940
Okay. I'll see you in a bit.

822
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,790
-Yes, thank you.
-All right.

823
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,340
-I only have one. Hurry.
-Okay.

824
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:28,510
Hurry.

825
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,010
You're eating it by yourself?

826
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,100
-Well...
-That's...

827
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,640
-Seok-yul.
-Yes?

828
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,190
It's Friday. Do you still have work to do?

829
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,770
No. I'm about to go home.

830
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:47,240
Okay. Then have a wonderful Friday night.

831
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,400
I'll see you at Kings Hotel
tomorrow morning.

832
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,660
What?

833
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:52,780
What?

834
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,160
DISPOSITION FORM

835
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,330
PAKISTAN AL RASHIM BLANKET EXPORT PROJECT

836
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:05,670
You'll handle the Pakistan report for me?

837
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,040
Yes.

838
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,790
You said it's due on Tuesday, right?

839
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,300
But I can't do everything
since it's something I haven't done yet.

840
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:17,050
I'll have 80% ready by Sunday.
Take a day to revise it.

841
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,720
No. Mr. Oh...

842
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,260
I need to take some time for myself, too.

843
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,600
I wanted to think about things as well.

844
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,690
What kind of person takes time
for themselves doing someone else's work?

845
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,190
This is my way of doing it. So what?
Do you have a problem with it?

846
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,360
Do you really want to give up?

847
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,080
-Yes...
-Don't!

848
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,790
If payment is not received,
we can receive steel in replacement.

849
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,750
This can be settled through EPC.

850
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,380
Do as much as you can.

851
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:00,800
That way you won't have any regrets.

852
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:07,970
It'll be difficult for you to do it alone.

853
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,680
Don't worry about that.
I won't do it alone.

854
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:10,940
What?

855
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,690
Where are your materials?

856
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:16,150
You recorded the meeting with the buyer
in Pakistan, right?

857
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,940
Of course, you did.

858
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,160
I think it was towed.

859
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,780
My husband can't pick it up yet.

860
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,360
-Mr. Oh.
-You're here.

861
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,320
Young-yi.

862
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,700
Come in.

863
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,570
Hurry!

864
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,790
Mr. Oh, Geu-rae is here.

865
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,000
Hey, you're here.

866
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:12,080
Hurry.

867
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,370
Mr. Oh, these are Ms. Sun's stuff.

868
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,300
Mr. Oh called me.

869
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,010
I'm not that busy on weekends anyway.

870
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,470
Mr. Oh threatened me.

871
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,180
Yes.

872
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,940
Take a look at this.

873
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,650
Does this make any sense?

874
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,980
Why are we here at this time and day?

875
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:45,410
I should be playing games
with the flight attendant students.

876
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,370
When would I get a chance to date a...

877
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,160
-What are you guys doing? Hurry!
-Okay.

878
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,160
Move.

879
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,040
The sample of the blanket is here.

880
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:59,000
I told you to get several samples.

881
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:04,090
The material is cotton.
The price is 2.96 dollars.

882
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:07,930
The CVC is 2.53 dollars
and the TC is 2.12 dollars

883
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,890
The subsidiary materials are 20 cents.

884
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:12,770
That's the processing cost.

885
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,680
Is this the Pakistan blanket
export project?

886
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:18,060
-Yes.
-So when you put that together,

887
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,690
and you order 50 thousand yards
for 3.32 dollars per yard,

888
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:22,940
it will be 150,000 dollars.

889
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,450
If it's 150,000 dollars,
isn't it too expensive?

890
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:29,780
It is expensive.

891
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,870
However, I found another fabric in stock.

892
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,950
That is the fabric right there.

893
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,370
This is the fabric that nobody took,

894
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,000
and it was sitting in storage.

895
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,800
There are 47,928 yards of it.

896
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,090
Therefore,

897
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:46,170
since it's our inventory,

898
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,260
we don't need subsidiary materials

899
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,560
and the processing fee will be one dollar
each. And for the additional fabric,

900
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,430
our lovely uncles from the nearby
factories

901
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,100
will take care of it for us.

902
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,190
Wow. Okay.

903
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:04,070
Now then, we should worry
about the production line, right?

904
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:07,070
I will take care of that too.

905
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,450
Get to work, Geu-rae.

906
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,620
Okay.

907
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,750
Okay. Yes.

908
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,630
I already know that
you have 20 lines available, sir.

909
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,550
I know that.

910
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:31,220
Just give me the two lines
that just finished

911
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,800
with the Malaysia uniforms.

912
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,600
Really?

913
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,730
Okay. Thank you so much.

914
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,270
I've got seven lines.

915
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:42,810
Look.

916
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:49,650
You're going to do it?

917
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:54,240
Yes, I'm a pro
at jotting down recorded meetings now.

918
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:11,720
The bank needs to...

919
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,510
What?

920
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,230
It's probably in English.

921
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,190
-Yes, it is.
-I'll be right back.

922
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:26,860
Geu-rae.

923
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:41,250
Young-yi.

924
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:48,090
Hello.

925
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:51,090
I am Ji-young Sun from One International.

926
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,880
Okay.

927
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,140
Hello.

928
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,680
I work for Ministry of Health of Pakistan.

929
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,720
-Pakistan's Ministry of Health.
-I'm Kurency Dieve.

930
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,770
Currency? Curr...

931
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:04,690
-Kurency Dieve.
-Kurency Dieve.

932
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,560
-I will give you the spelling later.
-Okay.

933
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,190
I think it'll be better
for you to listen, too.

934
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,690
I don't understand English.

935
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:13,660
-You should at least know who's speaking.
-All right.

936
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,410
Thank you for coming all the way
to Pakistan.

937
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,620
-Thank you.
-Yes.

938
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:31,540
I think that looks good.

939
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:37,870
Have some sandwiches.

940
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,330
Have some sandwiches, sir.

941
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,670
Don't you think it'll be better
for us to add

942
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,760
the profit that will be made
if this project continues?

943
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,100
We should emphasize that when the payment
is settled, it will profit us a lot.

944
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:54,390
Right.

945
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:56,390
I think we should add this line.

946
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,600
The estimate for the blanket is wrong.

947
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:02,020
You're right. Hold on.

948
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,820
How about sending an Excel file
with the pricing per blanket?

949
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,660
-How about sending an Excel file
-How about sending an Excel file

950
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:15,030
-with the pricing per blanket?
-with the pricing...

951
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,500
All right. Okay.

952
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:18,830
Sounds good.

953
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,330
Even the director wouldn't want
a presentation that contains

954
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:23,380
too much information spread
all over the place.

955
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,290
Let's eat.

956
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,750
-Okay.
-Do you want some water?

957
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:15,680
Keep sleeping.

958
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,080
Where are you going?

959
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,370
I'll just get some fresh air.

960
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:44,420
Let's go together.

961
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:48,710
I'll come too.

962
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,510
Where are you going?

963
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:58,800
Where are you going?

964
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:00,310
COST BREAKDOWN

965
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,390
Where?

966
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,230
Wow.

967
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,320
Jeez.

968
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,570
Here you go. Lady's first.

969
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,330
And then Geu-rae.

970
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,540
And you.

971
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,750
How can Mr. Oh do this to us?

972
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:29,540
A bunch of youngsters
gathered on the weekend like this

973
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:32,670
to work on a project for a team that
none of us is a member.

974
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,630
Are we a guerrilla team?
Are we human weapons?

975
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:45,560
But

976
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,400
I was thinking that

977
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:52,150
if something like this happened to me,

978
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:54,900
would I do what Mr. Oh is doing for me?

979
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:56,900
Would you?

980
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:05,830
Let me show you what
your expressions would be.

981
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,710
Okay. Geu-rae.

982
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,800
Shouldn't we prepare some cup noodles
so that we don't get hungry at night?

983
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,880
If I'm doing something wrong,
I'll do my best to meet your standards!

984
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,140
Mr. Oh.

985
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:21,640
I'm not like that.

986
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,890
Baek-ki.

987
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:25,680
I really want to go,

988
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:28,600
but I'm not quite prepared yet.

989
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:31,650
I will be there when I'm ready to go.

990
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,150
Seok-yul.

991
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,900
Young-yi.
I'll bring my truck and stay there.

992
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:42,320
Please understand that
I'm still new at driving!

993
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,540
I told you.

994
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:50,080
I'm the only weird one.

995
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,920
I wouldn't go.

996
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,090
Why would I?

997
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,420
I'm so thirsty.

998
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:00,840
Drink this.

999
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,140
What?

1000
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,480
Wow. Really?

1001
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,980
-It's fine.
-Let's go and wrap up.

1002
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,610
All right. Finish it and come up.

1003
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:21,820
Okay. come up.

1004
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,160
Baek-ki.

1005
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:07,660
They're pretty good.

1006
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:01,590
I called him. I called Baek-ki.

1007
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,050
All right, fine.

1008
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,050
Good job everyone.

1009
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,140
I'm going to visit Ms. Sun
at the hospital.

1010
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,890
-Shall we go, too?
-No. It's too hectic.

1011
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,230
Go home and rest.

1012
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,940
I'll buy you guys a drink.

1013
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:18,060
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

1014
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:19,230
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1015
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,480
Goodbye!

1016
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:25,400
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1017
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:28,070
Wait, no.

1018
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:32,950
How can you forget
the most important thing?

1019
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,870
Did you leave something?
Should I call him back?

1020
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,460
Geu-rae only knows work.

1021
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,590
There's still five hours and thirty-three
minutes left of Sunday.

1022
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,970
We will spend the next five hours
like it's 15 hours.

1023
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:48,430
Let's go. No, not this way.
Let's go that way.

1024
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,760
Wait, one second.

1025
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,600
My goodness.

1026
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:54,890
MR. OH

1027
01:10:55,350 --> 01:11:00,270
Remember this fun weekend of yours.

1028
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,500
NO TITLE

1029
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,460
DELETE

1030
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:22,000
Let's delete yesterday
and today from our memories.

1031
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,090
This is not good. He can't do this.

1032
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,260
Why did you hug me?

1033
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,800
You did, not me.

1034
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,390
Jeez.

1035
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:32,680
Why did you sleep on the ground?

1036
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,810
I was sleeping on...

1037
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,970
PAKISTAN AL RASHIM BLANKET EXPORT PROJECT

1038
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,140
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1039
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,100
You really can't be stopped.

1040
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:42,770
Just say you like it if you do.

1041
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:51,160
I told you I wanted to rest,
but you're making me work.

1042
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:55,200
We both rest by working.

1043
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,250
What?

1044
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,120
What are you talking about?

1045
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,090
Don't treat me like that.

1046
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,010
Our poor newbies.

1047
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,510
They really worked hard.

1048
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,140
Look at this.

1049
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,180
Oh, gosh.

1050
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:21,310
I remembered when we were newbies
when we were doing the China project.

1051
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:30,450
Humans are really funny.

1052
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:34,280
I lost trust in my team,

1053
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:38,290
found out their true feelings,
and got sick.

1054
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:42,460
So I wanted to give up on everything.

1055
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,630
But seeing this brought my will back.

1056
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:53,140
That's life. Your emotions run wild.

1057
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:01,890
But...

1058
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:05,520
What seems to be bothering you?

1059
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,213
What are you thinking about?

1060
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:15,550
What is it that's making you want
to turn your eyes on something else?

1061
01:13:17,617 --> 01:13:19,777
It's frustrating.

1062
01:13:19,848 --> 01:13:23,093
Can we get some air?

1063
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:27,740
Our team

1064
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,930
is like a punching bag.

1065
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:33,260
We just take whatever comes at us.

1066
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:38,730
Mr. Choi is really

1067
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:41,850
something else.

1068
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,730
I know his intentions,

1069
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,070
but I can't just spit it out.

1070
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,190
Goodness.

1071
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:56,950
Should I tell you?

1072
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:59,620
Why you're the way you are?

1073
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:01,920
What?

1074
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,170
You want to place your bets, right?

1075
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:06,590
What are you saying?

1076
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:11,340
You think it's time
to do that with Mr. Choi.

1077
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,300
That's the instinct you have
that you can't explain.

1078
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:16,050
What? My what?

1079
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,730
You think that this is the final draw.

1080
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:24,980
If you succeed,

1081
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:29,650
the director must recognize
both you and your team.

1082
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,450
The vice president title
is on the line for him,

1083
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:35,820
so he must support you guys.

1084
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:40,290
Isn't that it?

1085
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:46,750
Fine.

1086
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:50,210
Then how about this?

1087
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:53,010
This is for sure.

1088
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,430
If it's a 500-million-dollar deal,

1089
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:58,810
he will be able to be promoted
to vice president.

1090
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,640
And if he becomes vice president,

1091
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:04,730
you will be able to work with
anyone you want to.

1092
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,650
That's the company policy.

1093
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:09,820
What?

1094
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,740
I'm talking about Geu-rae.

1095
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:19,490
Do you still think
that Geu-rae can't do it?

1096
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,460
If I continue to work like this,
will I become a regular employee?

1097
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,290
I told him he won't.

1098
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:28,250
What's the point of giving

1099
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,500
false hope and irresponsible consolation?

1100
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,260
The company is sometimes a bit too much.

1101
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,550
That's why you need to build
your own power.

1102
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,110
This is for sure.

1103
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:07,860
If it's a 500 million dollar deal,
he will be promoted to vice president.

1104
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,820
And if he becomes vice president,

1105
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:13,530
you will be able to hire anyone
you want to work with.

1106
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:17,080
That's right.
Dong-sik didn't get it again.

1107
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,960
If the manager gets work
that never gets recognized,

1108
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,540
when will they get promoted?

1109
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:34,010
Should I wake up the kids?

1110
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:36,430
Just leave them.

1111
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:42,900
This is good.

1112
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:46,190
I should ask Mom to make some kimchi.

1113
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:47,730
Okay.

1114
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:51,820
Yes, her kimchi is really good.

1115
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:03,790
Don't you have times
where you just hate me?

1116
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,050
I guess you don't like me most
of the time.

1117
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:13,380
It's easier to find your faults.

1118
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:20,180
But when you eat what I put on the table
and say, "This is good,"

1119
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:21,390
you're not so bad.

1120
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,270
Did I change that much
since we got married?

1121
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:32,950
Talk to me.

1122
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:36,320
What?

1123
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,960
Well, you see...

1124
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,130
Would it be okay...

1125
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:54,760
to do something for someone?

1126
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:03,390
Do you think it'll be okay

1127
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:09,110
to interfere with someone else's life?

1128
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,490
Is it right for me to lend my hand

1129
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,330
to try and help them?

1130
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,590
You can forget about that now.

1131
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,640
Let Eun-ji go now. Bury it.

1132
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:42,220
What are you...

1133
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,770
Do it. Just do it.

1134
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:46,890
Do what you want to do.

1135
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,690
You didn't do anything wrong.
That's what I think.

1136
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:55,860
If that situation came up again,
you would do the same.

1137
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,700
And I think that is the right thing to do.

1138
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,990
What am I?

1139
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:05,160
That's what I'm saying.

1140
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,120
Honey.

1141
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:11,460
Focus on what you think is right.

1142
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,800
The rest is beyond your control.

1143
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:19,470
You can't influence everyone.

1144
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:24,180
Do you think that they will do
everything you tell them to?

1145
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,020
You made it seem like
you were saving your country or something.

1146
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:33,480
The soup is a bit salty today.

1147
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:36,230
-Don't eat it then.
-All right, it's good.

1148
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:47,370
MR. SANG-SIK OH
MANAGER

1149
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:50,420
He's not one to call in sick.

1150
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,880
He doesn't even catch colds.

1151
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,300
I can't believe he took a half day off.

1152
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,050
Well,

1153
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:04,930
he really had a lot on his plate lately.

1154
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,310
He helped Ms. Sun with her project
on the weekend.

1155
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:10,980
I think he overdid it.

1156
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,240
He really needs to decide by today.

1157
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:20,820
I'm worried.

1158
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:28,410
Honey.

1159
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:32,790
Focus on what you think is right.

1160
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:38,010
The rest is beyond your control.

1161
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:44,090
-Daddy didn't go to work today?
-Maybe he woke up late.

1162
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,300
Maybe he got promoted,
and he doesn't need to go early.

1163
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:49,060
Just because you get promoted,
it doesn't mean you can go late.

1164
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:51,180
Wouldn't he get into trouble
with his boss?

1165
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:54,730
You rascals, go to school.
What are you doing here?

1166
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:55,980
-Okay.
-All right.

1167
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,280
-Bye, Dad!
-Goodbye.

1168
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,400
DIRECTOR'S ROOM

1169
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:45,920
Come in.

1170
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,680
-Geu-rae!
-It's not his style.

1171
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,640
Then why did he accept this project?

1172
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,720
-Why our team?
-Is there another reason?

1173
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:38,270
-A regular employee?
-If there's anything I can do...

1174
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:40,480
I am Young-yi's Dad.

1175
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,150
Something's wrong.

1176
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:43,900
He took a bribe.

1177
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,530
-Sang-sik.
-If he becomes the vice president

1178
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:47,650
there's a chance that
I can become a regular employee.

1179
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:50,070
-Mr. Oh.
-I will make it happen.

1180
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:59,330
