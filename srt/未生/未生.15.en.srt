1
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,780
I said he can't.

2
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,780
What's the point of giving him

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,110
false hope?

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,410
Even if it's a word of false hope,

5
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,790
there are still many people
desperate for that type of hope.

6
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,500
Nonetheless,

7
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,010
he can't.

8
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,560
The end has been decided.

9
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,230
It's not that.

10
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,690
I just want to continue working

11
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,650
with you, Mr. Cheon, and Mr. Kim.

12
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,570
Us.

13
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,450
Together.

14
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,740
Forever.

15
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,540
But I still

16
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,040
have another year left.

17
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,790
Time left to be together with them.

18
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,410
EPISODE 15

19
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,080
Hello!

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,830
Hello!

21
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,370
You startled me.

22
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,710
What's up with you lately?

23
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,500
Then, I'll start my work.

24
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,220
Geu-rae, you're so energetic lately.

25
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,810
Go to the 15th floor,
and get me some coffee please.

26
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,480
Or you can go to the cafe to buy.

27
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,110
Seok-yul.

28
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,280
Cheer up.

29
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,500
Just wait.

30
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,130
All we can do is wait.

31
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm waiting, too.

32
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,340
-If I wait, Sang-hyun...
-Sang-hyun.

33
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,050
Baek-ki, how are you?

34
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,180
Of course. It's been a while.

35
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,890
If you don't have any plans,
can we go for a drink?

36
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,020
-Sang-hyun Lee.
-Should we?

37
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,520
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

38
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,400
-But waiting... Material.
-Give me the material.

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,440
I want to see it before I go.

40
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,400
Here you go.

41
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,000
Baek-ki.

42
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,750
In this sentence,
you should use "shall" instead of "must."

43
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,630
In legal papers,
the word "shall" emphasizes the duty

44
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,920
and politeness.

45
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,390
I thought that I should use "must"
so that it'll sound more assertive.

46
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,600
Then do as you wish.

47
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,950
You're so stubborn.

48
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,960
-If I wait...
-Sir, there's an issue.

49
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,710
There's a leak
in the ship headed to Aqaba.

50
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,090
What?

51
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,760
-No, I don't think it's that bad.
-We're looking into it.

52
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,260
Yes, we will get back to you
when we have more information.

53
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,180
Yes.

54
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,270
-What happened?
-Let's have a meeting in 20 minutes.

55
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,310
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,690
-Mr. Hong, come with me.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,490
We were just notified, so we're not sure,
but it won't sink right away.

58
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,570
-Where did it happen?
-Near Vietnam.

59
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,030
Call the insurance company
and have the shipping company update us.

60
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,830
Cancel my scheduled meeting too.

61
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,830
-Yes, sir.
-And Baek-ki, call the buyers.

62
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,370
-Wait, I'll do it. Get a conference room.
-Yes, sir.

63
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,670
I'm Baek-ki Jang from One International.

64
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,880
There's a problem with our ship.

65
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,510
Yes, thank you.

66
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,930
Yes, okay. Could you please find out
if there has been any similar case

67
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,270
like ours in the past?

68
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,600
Thank you.

69
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,610
It is here.

70
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,820
This is the list of the vendors

71
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
that may replace the products
in the worst case scenario.

72
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,370
Is it impossible to send another ship
there and move the products over?

73
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,490
It's impossible.
The product is 20 feet tall per item.

74
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,750
-How about a crane?
-The poor visibility

75
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,210
and fast flowing current of the Ocean
near Vietnam is a problem.

76
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,130
It's dangerous, so that's not an option.

77
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,840
How about a tugboat?

78
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,760
Where do you think a tugboat is coming
from? Is a tugboat sent from heaven?

79
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,390
By the time, we get one and send it,
the ship would have already sunk.

80
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,110
-What's going on?
-The Steel Team has a big issue.

81
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,320
The ship to Aqaba is leaking.

82
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,530
What?

83
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,530
What's going on?

84
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,820
-Hello.
-Okay.

85
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,490
-There's a problem with the ship?
-Yes.

86
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,960
Hey, Mr. Kim. Didn't Sales Team Two
have an accident with a ship last year?

87
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,460
Do you remember how they dealt with it?

88
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,380
I think the ship came back to the port,
and it was shipped on another boat.

89
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,630
It wasn't far from the port.

90
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,050
Really?

91
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,010
What are you going to do?

92
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,140
-Let's go.
-Okay.

93
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,350
If there's a leak, can't it be repaired?

94
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,260
What?

95
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,350
-Geu-rae, are you kidding...
-That's right.

96
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,390
We could repair it.

97
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,940
Mr. Kang, why are you taking it seriously?

98
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,770
I mean, it might be possible.

99
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,860
Wait, what?

100
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,110
Really?

101
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,860
Let's go.

102
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,780
Don't get involved.

103
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,250
-Sir.
-Okay.

104
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,370
How about repairing the ship?

105
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,330
What? Is that possible?

106
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,340
If it's a hole, it might not be possible.
But if it's only a crack, it might be.

107
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,590
That's true.

108
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,800
Let's send the divers
and see how big the leak is.

109
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,550
And we should have welders wait nearby
to be able to work on it right away.

110
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,970
-Okay. Let's try it.
-Okay.

111
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,640
Call the nearest office, and tell them
to get divers and welders ready.

112
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,640
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,810
This is Hae-jun Kang.

114
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,280
Hello, sir. This is Baek-ki Jang
from One International.

115
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,900
Could you please get divers
and welders to go to Danang?

116
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,660
Geu-rae.

117
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,620
-Yes?
-Did you prepare the weekly report?

118
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,710
Yes.

119
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,170
Did you review the contract
for the Mongolia project?

120
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,260
Yes.

121
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,390
How about the Japan rice wine B/L draft...

122
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,430
Here's the Japan rice with B/L draft, sir.

123
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,940
You're done with you work.
What are you doing now?

124
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,070
Well, you asked me to prepare
the new project.

125
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,400
I want to try to get one, too.

126
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,530
-By yourself?
-Yes.

127
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,320
You have never carried out a project
by yourself before.

128
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,080
Then, should I not?

129
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,410
Yeah, give it a try.

130
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,880
Okay. Thank you.

131
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,810
Mr. Yoo, the material for the
Norway minerals project has been uploaded.

132
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Print one for me, too.

133
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,440
Okay.

134
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,280
MOM

135
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,450
I'll call you back.

136
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,540
-What?
-What should we do?

137
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,800
I couldn't stop your father
this time either.

138
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,390
Young-yi.

139
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,940
What else can we do?

140
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,900
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,570
It's not my business anymore whether Dad
took the down payment for the house

142
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,450
to use it to start another business.

143
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,570
Mom.

144
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,240
I just got myself together.

145
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,960
After Dad borrowed money from Mr. Shin,

146
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,170
you know what my life has been like
for the past six months.

147
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,420
You said I could live my life now.

148
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,760
The landlord said
he would add it to the rent.

149
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,550
Please help me out just a little.
I'll make sure we take care of the rest.

150
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,470
Mom!

151
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,060
We're going to be thrown to the streets.
What can I do?

152
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,480
Where can I get that money?

153
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,270
I just paid off the debt.
I've only started to breathe.

154
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,940
It just ended.

155
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,410
I can't.

156
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,140
Sir.

157
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,310
What?

158
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,850
Do you have something to say to me?

159
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,110
No.

160
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,190
All right.

161
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Hey, Steel Team.

162
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,260
Hello.

163
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,390
I heard you guys have a problem.
Are you resolving it now?

164
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,310
Yes, thanks to Geu-rae.

165
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,520
Geu-rae? What did he do?

166
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,480
Fortunately, the leak wasn't big.

167
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,600
As Geu-rae suggested,
we repaired the ship.

168
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,480
So we're in the middle
of resolving it now.

169
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,320
That's not thanks to Geu-rae.
It's thanks to the laborers.

170
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,860
He just ran into good luck.

171
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,660
Since he's lucky, he's quite a catch.

172
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,370
There are people who don't know the
correct answer, but know the resolution.

173
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,620
You're just putting him up on a pedestal.

174
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,420
-Work hard.
-Yes, sir.

175
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,290
Good.

176
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,880
This is Baek-ki of...

177
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,550
Yes, Mr. Han.

178
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,350
Gosh.

179
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,100
Thank goodness.

180
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,100
The shipping company will give us an ETA
as soon as the ship is ready.

181
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,100
This is the additional cost
and the possible ports.

182
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,100
Yes, thank you.

183
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,820
It was Mr. Han from Danang.

184
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,450
And as you said,
we have the divers still on-call.

185
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,330
If there's another crack,
we can anchor the ship again and mend it.

186
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,040
Just in case,
we will prepare another port as well.

187
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,540
Okay.

188
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,710
Wow. That was close.

189
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,210
What would we have done
if not for Geu-rae?

190
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,350
-Hello.
-Hey, Geu-rae.

191
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,850
Mr. Cheon wanted me to give this to you.

192
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,100
Thank you.

193
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,850
-Thank you for earlier, too.
-What?

194
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,940
Ship repair.

195
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,730
I'm sorry for that.

196
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,610
I'm sorry.

197
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,190
Keep up the good work.

198
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,530
What?

199
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,760
There are people that don't know the
correct answer, but know the resolution.

200
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,980
Keep up the good work.

201
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,930
Is this yours?

202
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,460
If you have time

203
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,540
to butt in other people's affairs,

204
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,050
why don't you work
on your weaknesses first?

205
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,880
Being too nosy, is not a good trait.

206
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,310
Okay.

207
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,350
Thank you for your advice.

208
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,210
If you have time

209
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,130
to butt in other people's affairs,

210
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,550
why don't you work
on your weaknesses first?

211
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,680
Baek-ki, please.

212
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,310
Okay.

213
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,650
I will ask the audit team.

214
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,690
Thank you.

215
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,070
You don't need to thank me.

216
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,610
-Come on!
-Come on!

217
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,740
Are you crazy?

218
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,120
Wow, new item.

219
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,130
-Oh, man.
-You've changed since you were an intern.

220
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,090
Why do you keep looking
at other people's work?

221
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,720
I think I should go back to the factory.

222
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,970
What?

223
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,300
Why?

224
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,600
In this place...

225
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,640
In this company,
there's nothing I can change.

226
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,310
It's not even possible
to correct a superiorr's wrongdoings.

227
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,230
Do we need to wait to fight the strong?

228
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,860
Until when?

229
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,660
The thing I fear the most

230
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,830
is waiting

231
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,500
and ending up just like him.

232
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,330
I'm sure he wasn't like that
from the beginning.

233
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,800
If you're not crazy,
why are you smiling like that?

234
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,630
Well...

235
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,060
We'll probably never be able to close
the distance between us.

236
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,970
Baek-ki Jang.

237
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,940
If you take a step forward,

238
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,940
he takes two steps back.

239
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,980
There are people that you just can't get
close enough to.

240
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,200
Yeah, there are people like that.

241
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,870
What? Geu-rae Jang?

242
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,950
That bomb?

243
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,580
Wow. The world is just not fair.

244
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,250
Such a free rider. He just gets a job
and passes the test through networking,

245
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,710
He even fires someone he doesn't like and
is assigned a project through networking?

246
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,300
That's...

247
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,260
That's not true, Sang-hyun.

248
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,430
Are you serious?

249
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,930
Slow down.

250
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,690
People like me get unfair treatment
because of someone like him.

251
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,690
Why do you think I didn't pass?

252
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,740
Fine. Let's not say it's me.

253
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
But still!

254
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,620
One of us didn't make it because of him.

255
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,290
-He did well on his presentation.
-No, he didn't.

256
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,460
Because he sold that dirty slipper
with his horrible speech?

257
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,590
My goodness. That's how he got in.

258
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,050
That just proves how good
his connection is.

259
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,770
I recognize the pervert's skills,
but not that punk's.

260
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,190
Why don't you be honest with me?

261
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,150
Do you think Geu-rae is one of us?

262
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,240
No, right?

263
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,410
He and we are completely different.

264
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,620
A fair opportunity? Don't make me laugh.

265
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,750
How can we have a fair opportunity
if he's with us?

266
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,960
Do you know how much money my mom spent
to get me tutored and get me educated?

267
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,090
My mom really worked hard!

268
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,970
This is counter-discrimination.

269
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,690
I should have just chilled out.

270
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,360
I never slept before midnight
during middle school and high school.

271
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,780
In elementary school, do you know
how many cram schools I went to?

272
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,030
And back in college,

273
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,070
I even went to study abroad
and it cost me a lot of money.

274
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,330
But, what is this?

275
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,090
How about you? How's your job?

276
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,010
It's just a temporary job.

277
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,680
I'm going to get a better job.

278
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,850
Baek-ki.

279
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,770
You know,

280
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,610
if we want to remain as who we are now,

281
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,150
we need to get into a big company.

282
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,540
So, what is Geu-rae doing now?

283
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,090
This report must look like
it's been written by a professional.

284
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,470
The direction of the project,
vision, and objectives

285
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,430
were clearly written

286
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,440
using trade terms
and the format used by Mr. Oh.

287
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,770
Well, I'm not sure.

288
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,940
I'm not sure what it is,
but it feels different.

289
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,320
Mr. Oh said that
if I want to convince another,

290
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,580
I must be confident with it.

291
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,870
I am confident.

292
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,760
Geu-rae, you look confident.

293
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,050
No, I'm not.

294
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,470
You worked till late.

295
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,010
I'm sure you prepared for it well.

296
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,020
No, sir.

297
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
I just did my best.

298
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,980
Your effort is only appreciated in school.

299
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,070
Work requires results.

300
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,030
Geu-rae usually comes up with
a lot of brilliant ideas.

301
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,660
Only his ideas are good,
and that's only sometimes as well.

302
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,700
What's up with him again?

303
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,790
Stop over-flattering him.
He's nothing more than a newbie.

304
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,290
-Okay. I'll be back.
-Goodbye.

305
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,170
-I'll take a look when I get back.
-Yes, sir.

306
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,170
Let's go see your rare idea.

307
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,010
As you can see, the pollution levels
in the famous tourist regions

308
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,600
increase every year.

309
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,390
And also the world's automobile industry

310
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,850
is also working toward
decreasing pollution.

311
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,520
With this analysis,

312
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,520
we are able to predict
that there will be a big movement

313
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,780
to protect the environment
at famous tourist sites such as

314
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,610
the Eiffel Tower of Paris,
the Grand Canyon,

315
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,820
and the Opera House in Sydney.

316
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,120
Therefore, the development of electric
automobiles is the driving force

317
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,660
of the industry. Selling and renting
electric automobiles is expected

318
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,790
produce a lot of profit

319
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,870
Thanks for listening to my presentation.

320
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,640
A new idiot is born.

321
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,770
What?

322
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,850
I thought you will talk about the item.
What is all this?

323
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,020
Babbling about things
that you don't even know.

324
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,110
You can't even speak English.
Why did you write in English?

325
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,110
What's your product?

326
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,660
Who's your target market?

327
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,460
But it doesn't look like it was written
by an amateur.

328
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,090
The words are not the problem.

329
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,830
If you have time
to get into other people's business,

330
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,630
why don't you
work on your weaknesses first?

331
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,680
Young-yi, did you give me
the documents you've printed?

332
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,220
Did I receive it?

333
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,680
Young-yi!

334
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,940
The documents.

335
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,530
Which documents, sir?

336
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,780
The Norway project.

337
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,450
Right, yes. I'll request it now.

338
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,450
What? You said you've requested it
and it came in yesterday.

339
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,240
What? When?

340
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,040
What is wrong with you?

341
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,630
Right, the Norway project. I'm sorry.

342
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,470
Jeez. It's all over the place.

343
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,010
Print it for him first.

344
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,930
Okay.

345
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,390
Where is she going?

346
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,940
I think she went to make copies.

347
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,980
Why did she become Geu-rae
all of a sudden?

348
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,570
You wanted me to print it, right?

349
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,490
Yes.

350
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,170
Young-yi, do you have a problem?

351
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,630
No, sir.

352
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,380
I think you do.

353
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,220
No, sir. Everything is fine.

354
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,270
I think Geu-rae really wanted to do well.

355
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,270
He was going too hard, right?

356
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,440
Should we end it like that?

357
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,450
Shouldn't we tell him why it's not good?

358
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,990
Tell him what?

359
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,580
You have been weird towards him lately.

360
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,580
There's nothing weird
about what I'm doing.

361
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,800
He's too good of an employee
to lose that it's disheartening.

362
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,630
It's not going to be possible, right?

363
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,760
Turning him into a regular employee.

364
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,510
Most likely.

365
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,730
Then we should prepare
for it as early as now.

366
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,560
I'm sure he can find another job
after getting some experience here.

367
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,460
The landlord said
he would add it to the rent.

368
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,550
Please help me out just a little paying
the deposit.

369
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,420
I'll make sure we take care of the rest.

370
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,180
We're going to be thrown to the streets.

371
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,600
What can I do?

372
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,310
I'm not going to do anything.

373
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,360
DAD

374
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,620
Yes, sir.

375
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,450
Yes.

376
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,710
Young-yi, read the third condition
on the Norway project contract.

377
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,750
Yes, sir.

378
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,250
-Hurry.
-Okay.

379
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,960
DAD

380
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,010
One second please.

381
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,720
What was the number?

382
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,640
-What are you doing?
-Sorry.

383
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,850
Hurry.

384
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,580
I asked you to read a few lines.
What's taking so long?

385
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,160
-Young-yi, what are you doing?
-I'm sorry. I can't remember the code.

386
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,500
It's 2875.

387
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,920
You punks! What are you doing?

388
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,890
Give that to me!

389
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,980
I'm sorry.

390
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,360
-Damn it.
-That hurt.

391
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,370
It's not going to be possible, right?

392
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,000
Turning him into a regular employee.

393
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,660
Most likely.

394
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,630
Then we should prepare
for it as early as now.

395
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,420
I'm sure he can find another job
after his experience here.

396
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,080
High school, college, and even my old job!

397
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,590
Do you know how I suffered because of Dad?

398
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,800
How can you ask me for money again?

399
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,390
What did I do wrong?

400
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,890
I said I'm sorry.

401
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,220
Wouldn't it be nice to help your dad

402
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,730
at a time like this?

403
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,400
This is the last time.

404
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,310
I was disappointed that you weren't a boy,

405
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,520
but did I say anything to you about that?

406
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,980
Aren't daughters children too?

407
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,190
Dad!

408
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,990
Come on, Young-yi.

409
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,700
Just help me one more time.

410
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,990
Don't ever call me again.

411
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,920
Hey, Young-yi. I was just...

412
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,160
What's wrong with her today?

413
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,170
It's so odd.
I wonder if something happened to her.

414
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,880
Don't worry about it.

415
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,710
I'm trying not to worry about her.

416
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,840
But we're working together every day.
It's natural to worry.

417
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,440
Young-yi, what's up?

418
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,940
Nothing, sir.

419
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,700
Young-yi, do you have a problem
at home? You're a bit...

420
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,950
No. Don't worry about it, sir.

421
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,500
Hey, settle your personal problems
before you come to work.

422
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,750
Make sure you don't mess up at work.

423
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,380
Jeez.

424
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,260
You were too much.

425
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,430
Then again, we can't open up
to her even if we wanted to.

426
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,260
She's the one that built the wall.

427
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,100
Go away. I don't want to talk.

428
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:20,810
Jeez.

429
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,730
If you don't have the basics,
you can't climb the stairs.

430
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,320
Achieving something without the basics

431
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,700
is not climbing,

432
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,040
but falling right back
after the achievement.

433
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,040
Shouldn't we tell him why it's not good?

434
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,420
Geu-rae.

435
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:52,920
Yes?

436
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,890
This is one hundred thousand won.

437
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,890
Go sell something outside.

438
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,100
You want to do a real big project, right?

439
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,190
Business doesn't need technical words.
Business is just business.

440
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,320
It's getting profit
from something you sell.

441
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,780
It's selling good products
to those who need it. That's business.

442
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,280
Go and learn the basics of business.

443
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,330
You can't sell it to your family.

444
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,580
Be done by seven o'clock.

445
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,310
This title is too long.

446
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,730
What did he do wrong?

447
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,910
So this is why.

448
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,630
Hello?

449
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,840
Right, yes. Hello.

450
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,380
Yes, I did check the manual.

451
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,260
There was something wrong
so my manager looked at it.

452
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,680
I think it might be a bit difficult.
Let me take a look and get back to you.

453
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,140
Okay.

454
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:41,070
ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILE
SALES AND RENTING PROJECT

455
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,660
Man. What's wrong with me?

456
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,750
I changed my perfume. You want to smell?

457
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,340
-It's not funny.
-All right, man.

458
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,430
Baek-ki, you shouldn't look at that.

459
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,310
I'm sorry. It was just there.

460
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,100
It's not top secret or anything,

461
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,980
but this is Geu-rae's report
that was rejected,

462
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,400
so it's a sensitive subject.

463
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,650
Okay. But...

464
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,780
It's not that bad. What happened?

465
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,450
Why don't you tell us? You've read it.

466
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,450
What?

467
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,950
Yes, why don't you tell us?

468
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,790
Okay.

469
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,090
I think

470
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,140
a rental business should have

471
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,850
a specific site mentioned in the report.

472
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,390
The execution plan doesn't state
the way inventory will be handled,

473
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,640
and the depreciation measures
are not in the report as well.

474
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,480
Also,

475
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,360
the estimated profit is vague.

476
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,740
It must be shown with the current value.

477
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,360
That's why it should be revised.

478
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,920
-One hundred thousand won?
-Probably.

479
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,130
Ask him to take Baek-ki, too.

480
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,210
What?

481
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,050
What?

482
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,560
Why do I...

483
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,520
Where should we go?

484
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,980
Baek-ki.

485
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,940
Shouldn't we decide on what to buy first?

486
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,530
-Then what should we buy?
-How am I supposed to know?

487
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,660
Let's go somewhere we can buy products.

488
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,370
Okay, where?

489
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,790
That's what I'm trying to decide.

490
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,330
You go buy whatever.

491
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,960
It's your homework, not mine.

492
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,500
I'll sell it for you.

493
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,470
Let's go to the cafe over there.

494
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,520
Hello, sir.

495
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,400
How are you?

496
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,530
Hey, Baek-ki. It's been a while.

497
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,570
How's work?

498
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,910
It's fine. How's your business?

499
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,540
My rental business
is not really a big deal.

500
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,000
it's not really as big as you think.

501
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,750
It's just a family business.

502
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,580
Hey, we should get some drinks again?

503
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,630
Right, yes.

504
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,670
Is it all right if we meet up today?

505
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,180
You don't need to ask such a thing.
Come whenever you want to.

506
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,970
Okay. I'll see you later then.

507
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,810
I wonder how Geu-rae is doing?

508
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,530
I hope he learns something from it.

509
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,610
If he gets laughed at,

510
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,200
he will know why his report was declined.

511
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,490
I wonder what he'll sell.

512
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,580
The first time I got this mission,
it was hard for me to choose the item.

513
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,380
I was all over the place.
I looked here and there, everywhere.

514
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,760
Three for ten thousand won.
It's pretty much free.

515
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:32,590
That's why I decided to buy a cheap item
that anyone can buy and use and sell it.

516
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,180
I decided to buy something cheap
and sell lots of them.

517
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,690
That's right. That's the trap.

518
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,600
It's cheap.

519
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,360
Buying something for cheap and selling it
might seem like a good strategy.

520
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,530
That is the trap in this mission.

521
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,450
Take a look.
The pajama pants are really good.

522
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,700
Hey, are these socks popular
items in this market?

523
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,410
Of course, they are.
A lot of people buy them.

524
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,700
It's not even half
the price of other markets.

525
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,210
And this is really well-made.

526
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,670
It's really good. Look at this.

527
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,760
Five underwear for ten thousand won.

528
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,470
Eight pairs of socks for ten thousand won.

529
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,140
Sir, give me 100,000 won worth of socks.

530
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,260
-100,000 won?
-Yes.

531
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,770
Just socks?

532
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,350
Just underwear?

533
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,650
Half and half.

534
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,280
-Yes, sir.
-Geu-rae, are your products selling well?

535
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,830
I just started.

536
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,330
Make the best profit.

537
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,210
Buy it cheap, and earn big profit.

538
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,580
Okay.

539
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,130
Are we going to have happy hour
with your profit?

540
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,380
-What?
-What?

541
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,300
Okay. Good luck.

542
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,050
He kept saying, "Okay."

543
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,020
I hope he didn't buy cheap socks
off a cart on the streets.

544
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,020
He probably bought underwear too
as a full package.

545
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,860
We shouldn't do anything
in front of Seok-yul.

546
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,280
He's so scary.

547
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,280
Did you do some self-reflection, Seok-yul?

548
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,030
Hey, stop that.

549
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,990
Do you think there's any newbie
who didn't act up to his superior?

550
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,450
-I'll teach him better, okay?
-Yes, please.

551
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,370
Right, I'm sorry.

552
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,130
Bring it.

553
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,800
This is the report
of the inventory from the factory.

554
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,070
Do it again.

555
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,870
Could you tell me
what was wrong with the report?

556
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,750
Either study it

557
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,080
or ask on the bulletin.

558
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,360
Aren't you going to get it?

559
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,850
Yes, this is...

560
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,520
One moment please.

561
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,520
It's Chungseol Textile.

562
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,980
Yes, Mr. Lee?

563
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,780
Oh, my cell phone was turned off.

564
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,610
Where?

565
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,660
I'll call you right back.

566
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,550
You're still a newbie.

567
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:14,430
You must work for more than a year
in order to get an employee loan.

568
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,940
You're not qualified yet.

569
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,570
Here you go.

570
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,650
You are qualified to borrow
up to ten million won.

571
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,120
Where is she? She needs to finish this.

572
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,130
Is it the budget for the Norway project?

573
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,300
Give it to me. I'll do it.

574
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,890
Where have you been?

575
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,600
I'm sorry.

576
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,680
Mr. Yoo is doing your job!

577
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,770
I'm sorry.

578
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,410
Young-yi, don't you hear
the phone ringing?

579
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:13,990
This is Young-yi...

580
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:18,120
Yes, this is Mr. Yoo of the Resource Team.

581
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,710
Yes, the final budget
for the Norway project?

582
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,670
Yes. It will be ready within today.

583
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,760
Don't worry about it. Yes. Okay.

584
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,550
You said it's nothing.

585
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,800
Is this nothing?

586
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,850
You're not thinking straight,
and you've been out of it...

587
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,230
What? Should I just keep quiet?

588
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,610
Young-yi, go get some coffee.

589
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,990
Hey, didn't you hear her?
She said not to worry about it!

590
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,450
Hey, Mr. Ha!

591
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm sorry.

592
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,430
What is this?

593
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,720
Socks and underwear.

594
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,310
You said you can sell anything.

595
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,650
Let's go.

596
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,280
Where are we going?

597
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,370
Hello, sir.

598
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,790
Hey, Baek-ki!

599
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,380
-It's been a while.
-How have you been?

600
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,500
I'm great.

601
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,000
-Hannah, prepare a drink please.
-Okay.

602
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,220
Baek-ki, you're looking good.

603
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:00,060
I'm Geu-rae Jang from One International's
Sales Team Three.

604
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,390
Nice to meet you.

605
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,650
Please take care of our Baek-ki.

606
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,650
Have a seat.

607
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,780
I still feel bad about
the drinks you bought

608
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,820
to congratulate me being hired.
It was expensive.

609
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,120
What are you saying? It was nothing.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

610
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,160
What is it? You needed a favor?

611
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,210
The company wants me to sell something.

612
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,620
It's like a training.

613
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,960
What is it?

614
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,790
Well...

615
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:34,420
It's...

616
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,180
Here.

617
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,140
It will be best if you pay a good price.

618
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,930
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

619
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,270
Is this your company's product?

620
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,610
No.

621
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,070
We bought it on the way here.

622
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,650
Where is it from?

623
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,280
China OEM?

624
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,950
I think it's from China.

625
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,620
How much are they?

626
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,960
-A good price for you.
-Why?

627
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,880
Because it's me?

628
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,380
Or is it because that's what it's worth?

629
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:15,840
Well, that's...

630
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:21,470
I'm not buying.

631
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,560
I can buy you drink and other things.

632
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,190
But I'm not buying this.

633
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:28,810
Do you know why?

634
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,270
Because I don't need these.

635
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,610
Baek-ki,

636
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,650
did you buy this to sell it to me?

637
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,070
I'm disappointed.

638
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,630
How can you buy something like these?

639
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,920
You're the one who told me
to buy anything.

640
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,550
If we go somewhere with lots of people,
then I'm sure we can sell it.

641
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,220
Baek-ki.

642
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,890
If you can't do the mission, go back.

643
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,690
Like you said, it's my homework.

644
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,360
And like you said,
I am not competent at all.

645
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,660
That's why I'm more desperate
than you are.

646
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:28,710
I must sell these by five o'clock.

647
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,050
Are your products selling well?

648
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,820
Passengers

649
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,490
are prohibited
to sell things in the train.

650
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,870
Handing out advertisements
is also not allowed.

651
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,060
Let's go. I don't think this will work.

652
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,850
No. Let's sell it here.

653
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,690
Geu-rae, what did you say? You said we
should go somewhere with a lot of people.

654
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,070
Look.

655
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,730
You said you couldn't sell it
on the streets.

656
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,200
We have to sell it here.

657
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,410
I can't do it here.

658
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,270
Why not?

659
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,610
Everyone is staring at us.

660
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,190
It's a closed area and they don't look...
Let's go somewhere else.

661
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:57,940
We're running out of time.

662
00:48:58,610 --> 00:48:59,900
The subway is the best place.

663
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,160
There are a lot of people.
If we just move around each car...

664
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,740
If you're that confident,

665
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:06,540
then do it yourself.

666
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,950
Hello.

667
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,250
Hello, everyone.

668
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,310
Socks. Don't you need socks?

669
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,060
Take a look at these socks.

670
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,730
Six pairs for 10,000 thousand won.

671
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,770
They're well-made and cheaper than
the ones at the market.

672
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,650
Take a look at these socks.

673
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,450
Everyone can wear these kinds of socks.

674
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,620
They fit both men and women.

675
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,620
Look at this.

676
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,910
Take a look at these socks.

677
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,540
How much is it?

678
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,540
It's 10,000. It's a very good product.

679
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,080
-For how many?
-Six pairs for 10,000 won.

680
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,960
It's really cheap for six pairs.

681
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,880
Sir, would you like
to touch them at least?

682
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,260
Sir, I can show you another product.

683
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,770
Sir, the whole family can wear it.

684
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:52,890
I don't need it.

685
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,520
-It would be great if you bought a set.
-I don't need it.

686
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,650
For those traveling to Macheon,

687
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,860
please transfer to subway line five
at the next stop.

688
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,290
Ma'am.

689
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,580
Take a look at these socks.

690
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:19,170
These are free size.

691
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,670
I don't need them.

692
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,010
And like you said,
I am not competent at all.

693
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,180
Hello.

694
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,730
That's why I'm more desperate
than you are.

695
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,940
I must sell these by five o'clock.

696
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,150
It's 10,000 won for six pairs.
Ma'am, take a look at these socks.

697
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,110
Don't you think you're a bit greedy?

698
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,910
You still desire what the person
that started from the bottom has.

699
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,490
-Ma'am... Yes!
-Here!

700
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,710
-That hurt!
-I'm sorry.

701
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,170
-Do you need some socks?
-No, thanks.

702
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,590
It's from China,
but the quality is really good.

703
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,220
-No, I don't want it.
-These are from China.

704
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,470
But the quality is no different
from Korean-made ones.

705
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,730
Don't you need any?

706
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:20,020
I'm selling these.

707
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,110
-It's better than it looks.
-How much?

708
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,860
Yes. 10,000 won for six pairs.

709
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,240
-Six pairs?
-Yes.

710
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,740
The characters are really cute.

711
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,990
-And if you look here...
-It's too expensive.

712
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,990
-No it's not.
-These are 10,000 won for ten pairs.

713
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,330
You can't find that price anywhere.

714
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:38,960
-It's expensive.
-One more pair then.

715
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,080
-No, never mind.
-Hold on.

716
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,170
Okay, eight pairs then.

717
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,630
-Forget it.
-I'll do it just for you.

718
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,550
I said I don't want it.
Why do you keep forcing it on me?

719
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,090
Jeez.

720
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,680
Who would pay so much
to buy socks in the subway?

721
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,050
So why did you overdo yourself?

722
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,380
You should have been smarter.

723
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:32,050
Then again, that's the least you could do.

724
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,180
Just continue to do your best.

725
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:13,130
Wait here.

726
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:15,760
Just for a moment.

727
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,140
Where are you going?

728
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,600
I'll go and sell these.

729
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,020
-So where...
-Just stay here.

730
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,060
Hey.

731
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:43,080
It's great to have a good memory.

732
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,930
THE KOREA GO ASSOCIATION.

733
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,890
But it's better

734
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,140
to be able to forget.

735
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,880
THE KOREA GO ASSOCIATION

736
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,090
The forgotten memories

737
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,430
no longer leave a scar.

738
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,170
I'm here.

739
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,430
Like anything else,

740
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,720
the moment the play is announced,

741
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,850
you realize you weren't ready.

742
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,940
The determination or shout you make
before the play

743
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,440
is just a reaction that comes
with insecurity.

744
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,980
Also,

745
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:37,530
when you feel the urge
to run away or go back

746
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,070
it's either too late,

747
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:47,330
or the play already started.

748
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
Sir.

749
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:52,290
What?

750
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:54,750
Geu-rae!

751
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:56,900
How are you?

752
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:00,630
Good.

753
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,010
Where did he go?

754
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,920
-Go?
-I really had no other choice.

755
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:25,290
You should've set it on the other side.

756
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,340
How?

757
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,420
Why did he come here?

758
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,180
I wonder if he knows someone here?

759
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,850
Go?

760
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,580
-I couldn't retreat.
-Did you see?

761
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:46,020
Geu-rae is here.

762
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:47,560
-Really?
-Really?

763
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:51,110
I think he got a job somewhere.
He's wearing a suit.

764
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,860
Wow, Geu-rae?

765
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,160
I thought he would never come back.

766
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,370
-He actually came again?
-Really.

767
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,540
I heard you're in a trading company.

768
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,790
Yes, the president of Sungwon Inc.
introduced me to the position.

769
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,050
Right. He really liked you.

770
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,260
Are you doing okay there?

771
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,140
-Yes.
-Good.

772
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,760
So what brings you here?

773
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,930
Well...

774
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,240
My manager gave me a mission.

775
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,240
Mission?

776
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:42,370
Yes. I need to sell some products.

777
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,000
I was wondering if I could sell it here.

778
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,590
The rule of the game

779
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,010
is going forward with everything.

780
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,610
It's underwear and socks.

781
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,580
Even if hell is at the end of it.

782
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,780
Geu-rae.

783
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:46,200
Yes?

784
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,500
I don't think this
is the place to do that.

785
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,000
Do you know why?

786
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,550
Because everyone here
would buy it from you.

787
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,180
Whether it's a sign of pity,
encouragement,

788
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,510
or support,

789
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:14,560
could you say that you worked hard for it
if you sold them like that?

790
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,320
You can't sell it to your family.

791
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,440
I'm sure that your manager

792
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,780
didn't want you to resort
to something like this.

793
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,240
Okay.

794
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:56,230
Geu-rae is such a big loss.

795
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,560
Didn't we all think that Geu-rae
would be the first to make it?

796
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,980
To be honest, Geu-rae is much better
than Pro go player Kim.

797
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:04,570
Such a big loss.

798
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,490
Didn't he start when he was seven?

799
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:10,120
If you want to be a pro,
seven is a bit late to start.

800
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,450
But he became a researcher for the Korea
Go Association in one year.

801
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,750
And he won against a pro
when he was only in elementary school.

802
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,340
He's never failed to make semifinals
in the competition.

803
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,710
He was even academically capable.

804
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,800
When he dropped out of high school,

805
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:28,300
I saw his teacher come here
to try to persuade the master to help

806
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:30,760
If his family was a bit more well-off,
he would have been a pro.

807
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:32,810
I heard he even worked part-time
late in the evenings.

808
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,830
Do you think he's here for a favor?

809
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,130
It looks like he doesn't even want
to be here again.

810
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:52,470
Would he want to come back here
after he gave up go?

811
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:55,710
It must really hurt.

812
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:09,560
I'll get going now.

813
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:14,190
Okay.

814
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,450
-Geu-rae.
-Yes?

815
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,270
What is it?

816
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,980
You didn't even sell one?

817
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,320
I'm sorry.

818
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:50,240
Even if we go back to work now,
it will be past seven.

819
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,700
Yes.

820
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:56,910
Let's go.

821
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,680
Seok-yul.

822
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:20,470
Working late?

823
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,680
Yes.

824
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:24,020
Don't overwork.

825
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,940
Do you want to have some coffee?

826
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,740
Cheer up!

827
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:04,770
-Hey, Mr. Lee.
-Yes.

828
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,810
Do you think I can get the list

829
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:13,440
of sales employees
who were high school graduates?

830
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:14,530
What?

831
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:18,570
We've never had such a case before.

832
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,710
-Sir.
-Hi, please take a seat.

833
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,090
It looked like everyone
is working late in that team.

834
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:41,050
Why didn't you eat with them?

835
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:46,310
I thought
you were getting along these days.

836
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,230
Are you being left out again?

837
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:51,980
-Should I trip someone for you?
-No, sir.

838
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,650
I did something wrong.

839
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:56,570
Wrong?

840
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:59,570
What could you do wrong?

841
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,460
It's all their fault.

842
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,470
It's all their fault no matter what.

843
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:08,640
I was a bit startled before.

844
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:09,970
Before?

845
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,810
What happened before?

846
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,360
It's just that

847
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,070
when my father gets involved,

848
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,830
everything goes wrong.

849
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,380
Aren't you going home?

850
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,880
I can't go home until he gets back.

851
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:45,220
It's almost seven.

852
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,890
I heard that Geu-rae
and Baek-ki went to sell products.

853
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,020
Yes, I'm not sure
if they got anything out of it.

854
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:56,940
I don't know what it is.

855
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:58,980
But I'm sure they will.

856
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,270
Geu-rae is like that.

857
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:04,110
He is, right?

858
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:05,990
Yes.

859
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,260
Are we really going to give up?

860
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,430
Geu-rae.

861
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:42,940
We have no other choice.

862
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:49,780
Hey, you!

863
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:52,950
Are you okay?

864
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,800
TABLE TENNIS, KOREAN CHESS, GO

865
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,720
I can't do this.
I'll go to the sauna and come back.

866
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:17,430
If the buyer calls, connect me to them.

867
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:21,690
I think I'll just sleep at the sauna.
It will save time.

868
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:24,650
Geu-rae.

869
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,820
Do I have to wear the same
underwear again?

870
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:31,030
I should have brought some
if I knew I'd be sleeping in the sauna.

871
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,580
Geu-rae.

872
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:35,910
Hold this.

873
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,910
What? Where are you going?

874
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,090
Drink this.

875
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:50,720
What?

876
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,970
Let's sell it here.

877
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:53,470
What?

878
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,270
People that will buy these are all here.

879
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,060
What are you talking about?

880
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,520
PUBLIC SAUNA

881
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:04,310
Geu-rae.

882
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:07,150
You're not talking about that, are you?

883
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,030
Based on how you acted at the subway,
I think you'll need this.

884
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,540
You don't need it?

885
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,710
Who said I don't need it?

886
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:37,060
PUBLIC SAUNA

887
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:38,390
Going out of business.

888
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,020
All salary men out there!

889
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:44,270
We are One International newbies!

890
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:47,070
Hello!

891
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:52,860
Three pairs of socks and one underwear

892
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:55,780
for 10,000 won.

893
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:57,740
They're 10,000 won!

894
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:58,790
Hold on.

895
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,210
They're comfortable to wear!

896
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,540
They're comfortable to wear!

897
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:08,630
Even if you throw it away after,

898
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,550
you won't feel bad because it's so cheap!

899
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:13,130
If you wash it and re-wear it,
that would be even better!

900
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:16,760
The price is also better, only 10,000 won!

901
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,720
Socks!

902
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,600
Five pairs for 10,000 won!

903
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:22,520
-Hello!
-Hello!

904
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,770
Hold on! You will need these

905
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:28,400
when you are working late.

906
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,570
I guess they're out on a test.

907
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,490
-Yes.
-Alright then.

908
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:35,410
We've done things like this
in the past too.

909
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:37,950
Really? I'm Geu-rae!

910
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,450
Geu-rae!

911
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:42,250
-Here.
-Geu-rae's choice!

912
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,660
As you can see, this will never...

913
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:48,250
It's going to stretch out,
so please don't pull it too much.

914
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:51,380
This kid is totally drunk.
I can smell the alcohol.

915
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:54,170
-We did it drunk, too.
-Did we?

916
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:57,090
If you buy 10,000 won worth of socks,

917
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,680
-we will give you another pair.
-All right.

918
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,470
And if you buy 3,000 won worth,
we will throw in a pair of underwear.

919
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,270
You're really going to jump into business?

920
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:08,400
-Wait a minute.
-Yes, thank you!

921
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,360
-Look!
-Keep some in your desk drawer.

922
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,940
After you work so late
or when you are going for drinks.

923
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,950
Or when you are going to the sauna,
you'll look at them

924
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:20,410
and feel assured and proud of us.

925
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:21,830
You will definitely be assured.

926
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:24,540
-Here!
-This one.

927
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:27,250
Three pairs of socks and a pair
of underwear for 10,000 won.

928
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,290
-Will you sell it by pair?
-Yes.

929
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,300
We'll sell it by the pair too.

930
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,710
We will not force you.

931
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,340
Socks and underwear!
If you don't smell, you can leave.

932
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,350
We will not force you. You can leave.

933
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:43,970
May I check something?

934
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,270
I will just check your socks.

935
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:48,600
-Okay. I'll buy.
-10,000 won!

936
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:49,850
It's just 10,000 won!

937
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,660
I sold it all!

938
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,590
Do you know what time it is?

939
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:14,630
Jeez.

940
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:16,800
What's so important about that?

941
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:22,720
I sold it all!

942
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:25,520
Good.

943
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,560
It's not important that you sold them.

944
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,230
Why is that not important?

945
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:33,940
Do you know

946
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:36,900
what I've been through to sell these?

947
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,450
What did you learn?

948
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,490
I learned

949
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:46,580
that underwear and socks should be sold
in front of a sauna.

950
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,370
Why?

951
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,210
It's because

952
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:57,050
business is what you sell to who...

953
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:58,340
Write it in a report.

954
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,590
What?

955
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,220
-Sober up!
-What?

956
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,680
Even if you need to stay up all night!

957
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,100
I want to see it in the morning.

958
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:21,070
SOCKS MARKET RESEARCH AND SALES REPORT

959
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,280
SOCKS MARKET RESEARCH AND SALES REPORT

960
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,190
You're still here?

961
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:04,240
I needed to write a report.

962
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:05,740
Right.

963
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,380
Geu-rae.

964
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:19,550
Yes?

965
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:21,800
I still don't think

966
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,010
that you are

967
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,470
on the same level as I am.

968
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,310
But

969
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,280
I'll see you tomorrow.

970
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:33,790
-Wern't we born to work at the factory?
-You go there then!

971
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:36,460
I feel like I've been thrown away.

972
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:39,130
Why would the company want to invest
in an employee who will leave soon?

973
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,330
Who's feeling sorry for who?

974
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:41,790
-Latte.
-It's no longer on the menu.

975
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,840
Do you think politics only happen inside
the company? Life is full of politics.

976
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,510
Don't you want to get promoted this time?

977
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:49,550
The company is a battlefield?
Then outside must be hell!

978
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:53,760
Can't you help Geu-rae Jang?

979
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,220
Come to my office sometime.

980
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,480
Let's play go.

981
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:03,230
