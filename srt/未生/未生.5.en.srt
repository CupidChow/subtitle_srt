1
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,630
You son of a bitch!

2
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,510
Are you calling this work?

3
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,720
I told you to summarize the report
so it'll be easy to read and understand!

4
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,560
But what is this?

5
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,730
Contracts, bills and current status!

6
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,400
The order of the reports
for each item are all different!

7
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,030
I'll prepare them again.

8
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,200
It's for the takeover.
It'll be sent to the resource team.

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,240
The process
of the takeover should be clear!

10
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,160
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,670
Fortunately,

12
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,800
I'm the only one that didn't change.

13
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,510
SEOK-YUL HAN
TEXTILE TEAM ONE

14
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,510
Seok-yul.

15
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,140
Seok-yul.

16
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,240
It's been a week since Seok-yul was hired.

17
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,460
But he still hasn't gotten
used to office work.

18
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,840
The companies that are pending said
they won't be able to reply today.

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,050
One moment please.

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,930
The exchange rate should...

21
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,850
Baek-ki has been treated worse
than a bluetooth headset.

22
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:17,173
-How about Dubai?
-Even Japan won't work. How could we...

23
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,346
Young-yi

24
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,600
has become quite good at delivery.

25
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,380
I don't have any chopsticks.

26
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:36,684
Hey.

27
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,100
Chopsticks.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
Where's the kimchi?

29
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,640
Young-yi, call the restaurant,

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,100
-Two months ago,
-and tell them to bring some.

31
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,270
she was full of confidence
and dignity as an intern.

32
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,213
Not knowing the reason why,
she is now trying to overcome

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,924
the poor treatment
she is receiving from her seniors.

34
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,510
EPISODE 5

35
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,670
-Good morning, sir.
-Hey.

36
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,460
Young-yi.

37
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,050
I think it will be a very good day
since I saw Young-yi

38
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,470
to start off the day.

39
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,470
Good morning.

40
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,810
Good morning, Ms. Sun.
You're a bit late today.

41
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,230
-Am I late?
-Just a bit more than usual.

42
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,770
-You usually get here 30 minutes early.
-That...

43
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,900
I had to take my child to the daycare.

44
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,770
My husband needed to go to work early.

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,320
Hello, Geu-rae and Young-yi.

46
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,320
-Hello.
-Hello.

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,820
You guys know Ms. Sun, right?
She's One International's ace.

48
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,320
At least up until Young-yi was hired.

49
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,240
For the last three years,
the male staff chose her

50
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,620
as the number one senior they would like
to have a drink with. I came in last.

51
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,630
The deputies also chose her as
the senior they want to work with most.

52
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,210
I came in last in that category, too.

53
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,340
We were hired together, but she's already
the deputy head of the department,

54
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,550
while I'm still just a team manager.

55
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,800
-You're in charge of OJT today, right?
-Yes.

56
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,680
She is the special force of trade.
A very strong working woman.

57
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,560
She is highly respected.

58
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,310
Please transform them, and send them back.

59
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,340
When is the shipment?

60
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,560
It's on the 15th of next month...

61
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:48,690
What is the penalty
if we don't meet the shipment date?

62
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,310
The penalty...

63
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,970
It's good that you take notes,

64
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,220
but you should have complete knowledge
of contracts in progress.

65
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,470
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,600
Are you going to look at your note
in front of the buyers?

67
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
No, sir.

68
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,480
Moving on,

69
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,980
for every contract you print
for Dong-sik or me,

70
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,150
I want you to summarize the details
into one page.

71
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,900
I want to know what, where,
and when the products will be shipped.

72
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,820
Yes, sir.

73
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,620
That's right.

74
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,200
Did you send
the Turkmenistan takeover files?

75
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,330
I did yesterday.

76
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,710
He's the most suspicious
when he smiles like that.

77
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,630
Where is the approval specs
for Chris Company?

78
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,550
Yes.

79
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,760
It's in D/A91, sir.

80
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,180
What happened with Joshua's work?

81
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,310
-And Myanmar?
-Right here.

82
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,520
-The last one is Turkmenistan, right?
-Yes.

83
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,990
-Here you go.
-Let's take a look.

84
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,370
Why does this one only have the B/L draft?

85
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,080
-Excuse me?
-Didn't Sales Team Three

86
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,380
send the final B/L?

87
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,590
REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE
USED TO RETRIEVE THE PRODUCTS

88
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,500
Well...

89
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,470
I knew it.

90
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,510
Sang-sik Oh, I got you this time.

91
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,850
What?

92
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,140
Where is the original B/L?

93
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,060
-Well, I'm not...
-This bastard

94
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,360
hid the company name,
the buyer, and the seller.

95
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,070
He issued a switch B/L
and received a kickback, didn't he?

96
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,450
-Call him right now.
-What?

97
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,910
-Now!
-Okay.

98
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,960
Hello, Mr. Oh.

99
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,000
About the Turkmenistan contract,

100
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,590
why did you only send the B/L draft?

101
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,880
What?

102
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,640
Where is the original B/L?

103
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,220
What do you mean by "sorry"?

104
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,260
Hey, Mr. Jung!

105
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,180
What? The newbie did it?

106
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,100
Hey!

107
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,940
Train your newbie, and don't do it again.

108
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,940
What did he say?

109
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,490
He apologized, of course.

110
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,130
Hello.

111
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,840
Should I go? Or will you come?

112
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,800
Should I go?

113
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,010
You're with Mr. Ma, aren't you?

114
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,730
Hey.

115
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Well...

116
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,730
Hey.

117
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,450
What are you doing?

118
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,410
Why did you just include the B/L draft?

119
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,200
I gave you the B/L two months ago!

120
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,910
No, you didn't.

121
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,290
I don't have a record of receiving it.

122
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,170
You think I don't know you and Mr. Ma?

123
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,500
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

124
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,420
-What did you say?
-What?

125
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,340
I can't believe you can't even take
responsibility as a manager

126
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,090
just because you're scared of him.

127
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,800
Did you get to your position
by playing cards?

128
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,760
What kind of person are you?

129
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,520
You're the one who didn't take
responsibility when you needed to!

130
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,980
-What?
-I just have to be ashamed of myself.

131
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,980
You just dug a grave!

132
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,150
Sir!

133
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,900
Oh, no.

134
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,450
-What did you say?
-Please let go, sir.

135
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,530
-Let go right now!
-Sir, please let go.

136
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,410
What? You want to hit me? Go ahead!

137
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,750
Do it! Here, go ahead!

138
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,580
Do it so we can dig another grave!

139
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,500
Mr. Oh!

140
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,670
Mr. Oh!

141
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,270
What are you doing? Why did you hit him?

142
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,770
If the B/L is missing, you should have
just looked for it and resolved the issue!

143
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,730
Are you a kid? You should talk through...

144
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,780
Sang-sik! Hey!

145
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,300
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

146
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,630
You don't need to be sorry.

147
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,640
If it's the Turkmenistan contract,
that was two months ago.

148
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,680
I'm sure I gave it to Mr. Oh
before I went on the business trip.

149
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,520
He's a perfectionist.
I don't think he forgot to send it over.

150
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,150
Why did he have to bring up the past?

151
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,920
Letter of Resignation

152
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
Who died?

153
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,220
Eun-ji Lee died.

154
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,640
How did she die?

155
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,480
Was it suicide? Did she leave a note?

156
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,270
There aren't anything
that will affect the company, right?

157
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,490
Was there anything about me?

158
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,080
That bastard.

159
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,210
He acts all upright,
yet he's beating up people now?

160
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,000
He's the one at fault.
Why is he hitting you?

161
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,010
He's the one who sent just the B/L draft.

162
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,840
Where is the original B/L?

163
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,390
He said he gave it to us.

164
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,890
People like him need to be humiliated.

165
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,940
What are we going to do about the B/L?

166
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,570
What can we do? I don't know.

167
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,860
I'm going head on with Sang-sik.

168
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,450
Mr. Kim! Are you serious?

169
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,120
It's possible

170
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,080
that Mr. Oh really gave it to them.

171
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,540
Nothing has been proven.
Why would he come here and humiliate him?

172
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,460
That's not what's on the table right now.

173
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,380
We weren't going to make it an issue
for not sending the B/L.

174
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,550
Mr. Jung was just asking.
But what did Mr. Oh do? He hit the guy.

175
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,550
He actually shoved him
in front of everyone.

176
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,850
That bastard must think of our team

177
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,930
as some kind of pushover or something.

178
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,560
That's why I'm apologizing.

179
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,190
Why are you apologizing?

180
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,600
He should apologize himself.

181
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,570
Tell him to apologize to Mr. Jung
directly and politely.

182
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,320
Okay. I will. I got it.

183
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,570
Also,

184
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,870
have him write a letter of apology
on the company intranet.

185
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,080
Mr. Ma, I don't think that's necessary.

186
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,960
That means you just want
to humiliate the guy.

187
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,500
He needs to be humiliated.
You know what happened to me last year.

188
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,500
Anyway,

189
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,050
if he doesn't write the letter,
I will make an official complaint.

190
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,850
What are you going to do?

191
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,850
What are you going to do?

192
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,180
You can tell him to kiss my ass.

193
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,520
Mr. Oh!

194
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,400
Hey!

195
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,540
Is Mr. Jung okay?

196
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,730
Yes, I don't think he was hurt.

197
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,070
Our manager said that he sent it for sure.

198
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
I can't look for it, Geu-rae.

199
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,700
I know.

200
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,160
Hey, what this tense atmosphere
between you two?

201
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,660
You don't want to go to OJT?

202
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,120
Geu-rae, I heard that the 15th floor
was pretty steamy today.

203
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,430
I thought that Mr. Oh was geeky,
but it seems like he's a bit like me.

204
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,850
I apologize for what I said about him
on the roof the last time.

205
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,270
But you know,

206
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,690
I think Mr. Oh was rightfully pissed.
There's history behind it.

207
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,360
I heard from Mr. Sung that
in the past, Mr. Oh...

208
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,200
Hello.

209
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,120
Have a seat.

210
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,420
Hello. I'm Ji-young Sun
from Sales Team One. I will be in charge

211
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,340
of the new employee training today.
It's nice to meet you all.

212
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,460
I'm sure you've already taken a look
at the emails I sent to you.

213
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,970
The materials I sent...

214
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,140
SO-MI'S DAD

215
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,100
The material I sent

216
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,980
contain the feedback that was received
from the companies our team worked with.

217
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,570
I need to go to a funeral today.

218
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,780
Please pick-up So-mi
from the daycare today.

219
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,820
The material will prove how much our team

220
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,740
and One International works
to supply the best after-service

221
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,370
to our clients.

222
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,920
Please take a look
at the materials sent to you via email

223
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,670
regarding the importance of communication
through written documents.

224
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,600
-Seok-yul.
-That's called taming the tiger.

225
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,720
What?

226
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,680
Your seniors don't give you
any work, right?

227
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,220
That's just to control you
so that you don't act up.

228
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,200
That's what our deputy manager told me.

229
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,790
It's just because you are so intelligent.
So don't be down, okay?

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,500
At least Young-yi has work to do.

231
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,330
Isn't being
in the Resource Team difficult?

232
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,130
That team just doesn't know
how to get close to women.

233
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,800
As for me, Deputy Sung,
he just doesn't leave me alone.

234
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,010
-Yes, Mr. Ha.
-Hey, Young-yi. The OJT is over, right?

235
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,390
-Come right away.
-Yes, sir.

236
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,890
I'll get going.

237
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,940
Mr. Sung just can't work without me.

238
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Yes, sir.

239
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,210
Sir.

240
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,510
Are you not taking notes at the meeting
because it's too tedious for you?

241
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,300
Actually, was the meeting
with me too tedious for you?

242
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,010
You didn't mention that it was urgent,

243
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,260
So I planned to submit it
after I finished the business plan.

244
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,140
The finance team called,

245
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,390
and they need it by today
in order to process the budgeting.

246
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,600
Then you should've
stayed up all night then.

247
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,900
There's a meeting for selecting vendors.
What will you do?

248
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,230
This is why I don't like
working with women.

249
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,070
They have no sense of sacrifice.
What should I expect?

250
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,830
Why are you just standing there?

251
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,620
Aren't you going to apologize?

252
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,630
I'm sorry.

253
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,380
Just go. I don't want to see your face.

254
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,200
You can pick her up before you go,

255
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,950
I don't know.

256
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,210
Ask your mother or someone else.
Just take care of it.

257
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,380
We made a deal.
You're not the only one that has to work.

258
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,920
This is the meeting that was postponed
because you did this a week ago.

259
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,960
How can I change the schedule again?

260
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,630
Forget it. I need to go out,
so let's talk later.

261
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,100
I wish you didn't have to hear that.

262
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,260
It's okay.

263
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,890
Are you okay? Your eyes are red.

264
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,770
No, I'm fine.

265
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,650
-I got it.
-Oh, my.

266
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,030
Thank you.

267
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,290
Wait a second, ma'am.

268
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,210
So-mi drew this yesterday.
She forgot to take it home.

269
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,380
I see. Okay. I'll get going now.

270
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,130
Yes, this is Ji-young Sun.

271
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,710
Your daughter must have drawn it.

272
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,430
But there's no face.

273
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,930
I don't think it's finished yet.

274
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,020
WORK PLAN FOR THE WEEK

275
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,910
COLUMBIA CONDO EXPORT PROJECT

276
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,330
COLUMBIA CONDOM EXPORT PROJECT

277
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,930
-Why are you glancing at me?
-What?

278
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,220
Why are you glancing at me
and irritating me?

279
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,800
It's nothing, sir.

280
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,480
Are you at your desk?

281
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,780
Can I go there?

282
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,030
Well,

283
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,700
as I was saying,

284
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,460
it's actually not a fun thing to hear.

285
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,250
Sit down.

286
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,670
Goodness.

287
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,380
Someone died because of Manger Oh.

288
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,050
Stop staring at him.

289
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,100
-Please input these.
-Okay.

290
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,230
What are you talking about?

291
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,480
Sit down.

292
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,870
When he was still a deputy manager,

293
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,830
his subordinate made a mistake.

294
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,830
But part of it was his responsibility.

295
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,120
When that person resigned,

296
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,790
he pretended as if he didn't know.

297
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,970
I heard that person ran a small restaurant
near a construction site with his mother.

298
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,510
But then,

299
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,970
she got into an accident
and died on her way for a delivery.

300
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,740
So they keep saying that

301
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,780
if Mr. Oh took responsibility
from the beginning,

302
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,700
- none of that would have happened.

303
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:16,204
-Are you serious?

304
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,570
-Hey, go. Just go. Leave.
-Fine. I'll go.

305
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,280
-I said okay. Fine. I get it.
-Get out of here!

306
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,570
Mr. Oh is really a scary person.

307
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,120
-He literally killed her.
-Yes, I agree.

308
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,610
Mr. Oh is not someone
who would avoid responsibility.

309
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,420
You never know what people would do.
He would've gotten fired.

310
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:39,200
What else could he have done?

311
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,340
Sir.

312
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,220
You're so stubborn.

313
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,060
You used to ask our manager for help.

314
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,560
And now, you're asking us to step aside?

315
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,440
You know that we went
through all of Japan and China

316
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,570
so that we could get to that vendor!

317
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,070
Hey! Just give it to them!

318
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,780
We can't just give it to them.

319
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,450
You're just too much...

320
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,870
Hey! Take it!

321
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,870
Sir, how can you just give it
to them like that? How?

322
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,590
This is supposed to be
on our performance record.

323
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,760
We did all the work,
and they will get all the credit for it!

324
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,300
We can't have them take all our credit!

325
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,180
Sir, please!

326
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,330
Sir.

327
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,250
Everyone is thinking and talking
about something that they don't even know.

328
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,420
Why aren't you saying anything
and keeping quiet?

329
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,680
What don't they know?

330
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,930
It was the director that contracted
with that insufficient vendor.

331
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,560
Everyone is staying quiet,

332
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,600
but you know
that contract was nonsense from the start.

333
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,770
You know there were lots
of rumors about that company.

334
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,980
The director even got a commission.

335
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,320
But Eun-ji took all the blame for it!

336
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,030
Eun-ji's death had nothing to do with you.

337
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,950
-So just tell the truth!
-Whether it's my fault or the director's,

338
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
nothing changes.

339
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,670
At that time,

340
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,670
the fact that I didn't...

341
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,050
The fact that
I didn't take responsibility for that

342
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
-won't change.
-Sir.

343
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,020
Sir.

344
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,600
How many people do you think
would be able to take responsibility

345
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,600
in a situation like that?

346
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,570
Everyone would have done the same.

347
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,900
Let's go.

348
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,290
Come on.
We need to get ready for the takeover.

349
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,460
Eun-ji? Why?

350
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,260
If not Eun-ji,
will you take the responsibility?

351
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,260
Will you?

352
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,390
Will you take responsibility?

353
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,870
The latest they can care for her
at the daycare center is six o'clock.

354
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,520
I can't ask to be excused this often.

355
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,470
Su-jin!

356
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,540
-Oh, my.
-Su-jin, are you okay?

357
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,920
Su-jin. What's wrong?

358
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,840
What are you all doing?
We need to send her to the nurse.

359
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,260
-Hey.
-Help her.

360
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,310
CLINIC

361
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,030
She's pregnant.
She collapsed due to exhaustion.

362
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,830
What? Pregnant?

363
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,950
Yes. She needs to rest a bit.

364
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,830
Hey. Did you know?

365
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,040
No.

366
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,410
How many children is she going to have?

367
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,870
-Doesn't she already have two kids?
-Yes.

368
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,120
Jeez. Why did she get pregnant again?

369
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,870
She's so self-centered.

370
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,170
Move!

371
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,380
She just gave birth,
and she's pregnant again?

372
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,850
Another leave of absence?

373
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,520
We gave her a break
when she had her first two kids.

374
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,520
Oh, man.

375
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,890
We trained the newbie
and have her work again.

376
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,190
When she had her second child,
I did all of her work.

377
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,440
I guess we're going to have
to borrow manpower again.

378
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,900
Women are the problem.

379
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,120
As soon as we train them, marriage,
pregnancy, husbands, and kids

380
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,040
are their usual excuses.

381
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,500
If not that,
they'll cry through any issues.

382
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,170
It's all because women
have no sense of honor.

383
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,540
Get back to work.

384
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,680
-Ma'am.
-Thank you.

385
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,520
Su-jin

386
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,060
stayed overtime and came in
at dawn the whole week.

387
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,190
Why didn't she say anything?

388
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,860
She probably couldn't.

389
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,490
A third child is a bit too much.

390
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,240
Even though things have gotten
better in this world,

391
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,790
it's not easy to raise children
and work at the same time.

392
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,040
Working moms are always the bad person.

393
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,500
At work, at home.

394
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,790
There are also the children.

395
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,050
If husbands don't help out,
it's impossible to handle.

396
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,430
If you're going to keep your career,
don't get married.

397
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,100
That's the best choice.

398
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,310
Sir, it's time for the meeting.

399
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,020
Okay.

400
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,820
I wish he wouldn't come.

401
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,910
-What?
-It's nothing.

402
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,620
Sir.

403
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,210
About the meeting with the Resource Team
regarding the takeover,

404
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,000
maybe you shouldn't attend anymore.

405
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,670
Why?

406
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,470
I know everything about it,
so I'll just do it.

407
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,190
The final report

408
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,650
will be done by each team.

409
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,320
Our team will send out the report
for the Indonesia project

410
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,110
as soon as we receive word
from the counterpart.

411
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,410
You all know that it will take about
two to three days, right?

412
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,790
Can the Resource Department give us
an approximate date?

413
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,500
We will proceed knowing that
you will give a few more days.

414
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,750
That's fine.

415
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,340
For the remaining teams,
we will just complete the data work.

416
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,380
We keep getting inquiries for our team.

417
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,550
-Mr. Ha, please take care of it.
-Okay.

418
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,470
Sir, I think we can conclude here.

419
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,940
How can we end it here?

420
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,150
The B/L wasn't received.

421
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,400
Sir, may we talk about that separately?

422
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,320
Are you really not going to give it to us?

423
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,660
I already said that I sent it.

424
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,120
How much kickback did you get from who?

425
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,040
How much?

426
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:13,960
Sir!

427
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,880
Mr. Oh is not that kind of person.

428
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,720
You just stay put.

429
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
You women don't know when to butt in.

430
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,720
Sir.

431
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,520
You should have brought this up privately
if you didn't want others to butt in.

432
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,930
What?

433
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,230
Why aren't you apologizing?
Why didn't you write the apology letter?

434
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,070
Because I have no reason to apologize.

435
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,200
Why don't you have a reason to apologize?

436
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,160
You beat up a person.

437
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,910
You're still the same irresponsible person
even though you aged.

438
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,920
You're still the same.

439
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,580
What?

440
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,920
Are you getting cold...

441
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,010
What was it they say? Cold. What was it?

442
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,010
-Cold feet, sir
-Right.

443
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,890
You and your cold feet are just too much.

444
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,810
Are you doing this to me
because of what happened last year?

445
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,150
What? What about last year?

446
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,980
The charges against you
regarding sexual harassment.

447
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,070
What?

448
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,700
The one I testified in.

449
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,000
Hey, Sang-sik!
Why are you bringing that up here?

450
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,130
And besides,
why is that sexual harassment?

451
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,170
The one
who wore plunging neckline is at fault.

452
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,720
So did I touch her or even look at her?

453
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,180
I asked her why she wore something
like that if she's going to cover it

454
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,890
every time she bends over.

455
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,350
Is that considered sexual harassment?

456
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,560
What I was trying to tell her is

457
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,100
for her not to wear something like that.

458
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,560
"Even if you leave it be,
there's nothing to look at anyway."

459
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,110
You also said that.

460
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,240
That's true.

461
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,070
Is that sexual harassment? Is it?

462
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,200
It's also sexual harassment
to ask for coffee.

463
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,370
Worrying about them not being able
to get married is sexual harassment.

464
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,250
I can't live with all
of these provocative women!

465
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,130
Young-yi, what do you think?

466
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,430
Is that sexual harassment?

467
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,100
Why aren't you answering?

468
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:37,690
If the person being told
that feels sexually harassed,

469
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,190
I think it is sexual harassment.

470
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,360
What? What did you say?

471
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,320
Hey! What did you just say?

472
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,780
I'm not done talking!

473
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,580
You told me to write the apology letter.
I'm on my way to write it!

474
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,080
That little...

475
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,050
Geu-rae, you need to wrap up.

476
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,130
Okay.

477
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,050
Damn it.

478
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,310
Apology letter?

479
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,720
Hey, Mr. Jung.

480
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,690
Make sure you read that letter word
for word. Don't miss a thing.

481
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,020
The beginning and conclusion
will definitely be different.

482
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,690
Yes, sir. Let's go now.

483
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,110
-We have a meeting with a vendor.
-Damn it.

484
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,740
That bastard.

485
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,300
Did Mr. Ma really commit
sexual harassment?

486
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,970
The woman's club brought up charges,
and he got a three-month pay cut.

487
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,680
Did Mr. Oh really testify against him?

488
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,510
I really don't get Mr. Oh.

489
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,930
At times like that, he's like a hero.

490
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,190
And then there's the Mr. Oh
that stepped on the weak and climbed up.

491
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,360
But he's really good at what he does.

492
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,820
Wrap things up.

493
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,280
Hey, let's go together.

494
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,530
-Wrap it up.
-Okay.

495
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,450
I really wonder where that B/L went.

496
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,370
Mr. Oh is really something.

497
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,330
No one received it,
but he's still standing by his word.

498
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,420
He's saying that because he did send it.

499
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,010
So where is it? Does the resource team
have it and aren't admitting to it?

500
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,010
If it was two months ago,
we were just interns here.

501
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,810
Baek-ki, weren't you an intern
at the Resource Team?

502
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,390
-Yes.
-Didn't you see it then?

503
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,400
No, I didn't.

504
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,790
Hey, Baek-ki.

505
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,000
What's up?

506
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,170
About the B/L, did you really not see it?

507
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,220
Didn't I say so? Why are you still asking?

508
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,600
You were working there.
I'm just wondering if you know anything.

509
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,430
What are you trying to say?

510
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,140
If I worked there,
do I have to know everything?

511
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,650
Then does that mean you comprehend
all of the sales department documents?

512
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,980
Why don't you go and search for it?

513
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,030
You don't need to drag me into it.

514
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,160
Baek-ki.

515
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,910
There's a file on my desk.
It has the B/L that Sales Team Three sent.

516
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,170
Bring that to me.

517
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,260
Are you sure you didn't see it?

518
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,770
Why are you so interested?

519
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,270
Did you see it?

520
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,730
It's better that you don't know.

521
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,440
-What is that supposed to mean?
-If I say that I saw it,

522
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,780
are you going to tell Sales Team Three?

523
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,120
Think about your situation.

524
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,740
If you uncover the truth,

525
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,500
how do you think they will treat you
in your team?

526
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,880
You're just going to make it worse.
Why would you do that?

527
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,800
Even if you help Sales Team Three,
Mr. Oh will not help you.

528
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,090
-Baek-ki...
-It's none of your business, Young-yi.

529
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,550
You are a member of the Resource Team.

530
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,140
This is the reality.

531
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,820
Wow, he's a real man.

532
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,690
Apology Letter
I'm Sorry. Really.

533
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,240
Wow.

534
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,820
Geu-rae.

535
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,450
-Read it. Hurry.
-Okay.

536
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,670
-"I'm sorry."
-The whole thing.

537
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,050
"I'm sorry.

538
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,590
Really."

539
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,470
Apology Letter
I'm Sorry. Really.

540
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,400
That crazy bastard.

541
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,910
Apology Letter
I'm Sorry. Really.

542
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,040
Why are you doing this, sir?

543
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,000
What?

544
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,960
Why?

545
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,750
He wanted an apology, so I gave it to him.

546
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,670
I wanted to give a really sincere apology.

547
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,840
But I just couldn't.

548
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,510
Sir!

549
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,100
Hey, Sang-sik Oh!

550
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,020
Oh, my goodness. Damn it.

551
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,940
Hey, Sang-sik.

552
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,070
Hey, Sang-sik Oh.

553
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,940
Do you really want to go there?

554
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,360
What's the problem?

555
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,700
-I wrote the apology you asked for.
-You bastard.

556
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,250
Do you really want me
to flush you down the drain?

557
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,710
I was going to let you off
with the apology!

558
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,790
That's why I did it.

559
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,340
I said I was sorry. Really.

560
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,840
Okay? I'm sorry.

561
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
Really.

562
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,840
-This bastard.
-Sir.

563
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,340
Are you playing with me?

564
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,760
-No!
-Sir, please!

565
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:48,020
-Let go of me!
-Sir, please don't do this.

566
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,480
-Come here, you bastard.
-Stop him.

567
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,980
-Let go.
-Sir, no.

568
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,060
I said come here, you bastard.

569
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,270
Come here.

570
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,190
-Sir, please.
-Don't do this.

571
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,570
-Let go of me!
-Stop him.

572
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,240
-Let go!
-No!

573
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,030
-Dong-sik!
-Gosh, no.

574
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,950
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

575
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,870
Are you okay?

576
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,170
You hit him hard, sir.

577
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,040
Did he get hit?

578
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,420
What are you doing? What?

579
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,010
-Did you just hit my subordinate?
-I didn't hit him!

580
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,510
He didn't even get hit.

581
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,550
Come here, you bastard!

582
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,470
-Let go!
-He didn't even get hit!

583
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,060
Get off of me!

584
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,140
Damn it.

585
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,730
Are you okay?

586
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,480
Hey.

587
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,940
Are your bones okay?

588
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,240
Yes. I'll go to the hospital later.

589
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,370
Okay, go ahead.

590
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,660
Don't just get an X-ray.
Get a CT, MRI, blood test everything.

591
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,500
Hey, listen.
If something happened to your head,

592
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,080
it will cause huge problems.

593
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,830
-Are you okay?
-I'll be fine in a bit.

594
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,670
Are you sure you're okay?

595
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,960
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

596
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,260
Sir, I think we should go.

597
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,510
-Damn it!
-Sir, let's just go.

598
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,100
Call us after you get treated.

599
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,440
Damn it.

600
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,200
Hey, it's okay.

601
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,740
-Sir, you should sit down.
-It's okay. I'm fine.

602
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,830
-I'm going to the Finance Team.
-Okay.

603
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,960
Geu-rae.

604
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,290
Get me a glass of water.

605
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,220
Yes, sir.

606
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,230
Those bastards.

607
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,190
What, sir?

608
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,360
Bastards.

609
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,400
Now they're putting up an act.

610
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,070
They're mobsters.

611
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,240
Don't ever cooperate
with Sales Team Three.

612
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:15,620
Sir, why don't we just let this go now.

613
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,250
I'm sure Mr. Oh learned his lesson.

614
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,170
You...

615
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,750
Give me my glasses.

616
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:23,920
Sir.

617
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,180
Damn it.

618
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,060
Young-yi, get us some coffee.

619
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,270
Okay.

620
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,910
What are we going to do now?
The situation is getting out of hand.

621
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,750
Why didn't you just tell the truth
when you were getting the approval?

622
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,250
Why didn't you just say you forgot it.

623
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,170
Hey.

624
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,710
It's been awhile since I didn't get
chewed on. How could I have said that?

625
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,920
And besides, he was so glad
to get Mr. Oh cornered.

626
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,470
How could I rain on his parade?

627
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,090
Then what are we going to do?

628
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:13,970
Should we get rid of it?

629
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,160
If Dong-sik asks,
tell him I went for a smoke.

630
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,250
Yes, sir.

631
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,800
PURCHASE ORDER

632
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,300
PROFORMA INVOICE

633
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:58,560
Mr. Oh is not a person
who would leave the B/L out.

634
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,430
If you receive a newbie like that,

635
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,060
there's nothing you can do about it.

636
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,310
That's true.

637
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,280
I wonder if he even knows
what a B/L or a draft is.

638
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:11,320
He's on the director's bad side anyway.

639
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,370
It's almost over for Sales Team Three.

640
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,660
Having the corner area of the office
and the smallest amount of team members.

641
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,080
They received even got a newbie like that.

642
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:44,690
Sir.

643
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,690
What are you doing here?

644
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,780
I have something to ask you.

645
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,700
Do you have a lighter?

646
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,240
No.

647
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,200
What kind of man are you
if you don't know how to smoke?

648
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,290
When I was your age,
I smoked three packs a day.

649
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,590
You don't know any basics.

650
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:10,210
You should have a lighter
for others at least.

651
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:12,420
I'm sorry.

652
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,680
What do you want to know?

653
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,600
Well,

654
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,220
about the B/L,

655
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,600
Is there a possibility

656
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,980
that I may have left it out from the file?

657
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,650
-What?
-Well,

658
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,490
I keep thinking that
you might be covering for me.

659
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:38,200
But I guess not. Right.

660
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,410
Go back to work.

661
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,750
-Geu-rae.
-Hello, sir.

662
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,380
-Make two copies of this and make a file.
-Okay.

663
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,130
-Sir.
-What?

664
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,880
How long do we usually keep the bills
that have been shipped out?

665
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,340
Why? You want to find it?

666
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,760
Shouldn't I?

667
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,970
What are you trying to do?

668
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,230
Are you going to dig through
another team's files?

669
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,330
If that was possible,
I would have done it.

670
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,510
-Just do that.
-Okay.

671
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,350
What were you two talking about?

672
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,150
He was asking about the B/L.

673
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,780
He wouldn't go and dig through
the Resource Team's files, would he?

674
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,610
I'm sure he's not that stupid.

675
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,710
-Su-ho.
-Yes?

676
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,090
-Bring these to the buyer meeting today.
-Okay.

677
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:59,760
Again?

678
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,930
You postponed it last time.

679
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,470
I know.

680
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,350
Can you please try to delay it
for three hours? I'm really sorry.

681
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,770
Okay.

682
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,370
-Please sign this.
-Okay.

683
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,950
Do you need to pick up your daughter?

684
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,210
Your mom couldn't do it?

685
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:40,050
Yes, I need to drop her off at my in-laws.

686
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,130
I'm a man too, but at times like these,

687
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,140
I think men think women have it easy.

688
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,680
If a woman is a manager, they should know

689
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,890
how much more it takes.

690
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,350
One more in the back.

691
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,150
That's what I'm saying.

692
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,900
That's why my wife quit her job.

693
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,820
You have three children.

694
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:09,120
If not, I would have been the one to quit.

695
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,770
What's that guy doing there?

696
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,590
Good job.

697
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,590
Staying quiet, I mean.

698
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,030
Geu-rae.

699
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:28,820
Why are you poking
around the Resource Team?

700
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,870
Are you looking for the B/L?

701
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,120
-No.
-Then what were you doing there?

702
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,250
Were you there to see Young-yi?

703
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,380
Come here.

704
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,220
Did you ask Young-yi?

705
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,520
No, sir.

706
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,690
What are you doing not asking her?

707
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,610
-Should I ask her?
-Of course you shouldn't!

708
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,820
Who told you
to poke around there like that?

709
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:11,700
Do you have nothing better to do?

710
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,320
I'm sorry.

711
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,290
That's right.

712
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,960
Not you.

713
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,090
If you have nothing better to do, go out.

714
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,010
What?

715
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,550
Hey, Ms. Sun.

716
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,850
This isn't right.

717
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:40,690
It's okay.

718
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,650
No, it's not.

719
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,070
If I ask you to do something for me
personally, it might become an issue.

720
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,690
Hold on.

721
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,950
Mr. Oh, Geu-rae...

722
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,660
It's really fine.

723
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,580
If he stays in the office,
I'm afraid he might cause trouble.

724
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,330
I need to stop being humiliated.

725
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,300
Mr. Oh is very stubborn today,

726
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,680
-Thank you.
-It's fine.

727
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:26,360
Are you going out?

728
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,110
Yes.

729
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,490
I'm on my way out.
It's a favor for Ms. Sun.

730
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:33,400
What?

731
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,200
Oh, that's nice of you.

732
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,160
I'll see you tomorrow.

733
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,000
Geu-rae.

734
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,880
Is Mr. Oh okay?

735
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,590
What?

736
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,340
I think it was my manager's fault

737
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,800
for bringing up the past.

738
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,520
They have to respect the fact that
everyone has a past

739
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,020
they never want to reveal.

740
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:09,230
I understand why Mr. Oh

741
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,610
got so upset.

742
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:17,240
He is not upset right now.

743
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:19,950
He's just blaming himself.

744
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:26,370
Most wrong choices made
are forgotten after time

745
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,000
but not all of them.

746
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,590
Some things really get back at you later,

747
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,340
and you can't forget them.

748
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:38,890
You can't turn back time either.

749
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,390
He is just blaming himself.

750
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,050
And to me, he just looks

751
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,470
very lonely.

752
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,870
I'm here for So-mi.

753
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:06,000
Yes. We received a call from So-mi's mom.

754
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,750
So-mi, let's go home.

755
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,710
Okay.

756
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,760
There.

757
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,300
They are full-day children.

758
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,050
Their moms will be here soon.

759
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,140
Isn't my mom coming?

760
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,100
She'll be here soon.

761
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,350
Let's go inside, and wait for mommy.

762
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,440
Let's go inside.

763
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,110
Can they play with me in the playground?

764
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:37,860
We need to be there with them.

765
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:41,200
But the teachers are gone for the day
and I have work to do.

766
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,790
I'll stay with them.

767
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,120
I'll go home a little later.

768
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:54,710
Green light!

769
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,630
Red light!

770
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:58,090
Green light!

771
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,010
Red light!

772
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:01,550
Green light!

773
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,470
Red light!

774
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,970
Green light! Red light!

775
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,230
Help me!

776
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,520
Come down.

777
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,110
One, two, three!

778
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,730
Good job!

779
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,820
Very good!

780
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,240
Wow, that was great!

781
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,160
We need to hurry.

782
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,740
Hurry!

783
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,500
Hello.

784
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,830
You're here.

785
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,080
Let's go home.

786
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:33,710
Hello. Let's go home.

787
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:34,920
Let's go.

788
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,880
Goodbye.

789
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,130
Goodbye.

790
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,640
Let's go up high.

791
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:04,820
Some things really get back at you later,

792
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,450
and you can't forget them.

793
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,620
You can't turn back time either.

794
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,620
Yes, we'll make sure that
there are no mistakes...

795
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:13,540
Oh, no...

796
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,130
One second please. Let me call you back.

797
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,220
Thank you.

798
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,800
The others must not be around.

799
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:27,010
It's a buyer meeting.
So they're out picking them up.

800
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,140
Let me help you.

801
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,810
Thank you.

802
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,360
Being in the Resource Team is difficult,
isn't it?

803
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:42,650
It's a difficult team to get along with,
especially for women.

804
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:46,490
They really discriminate
against women there.

805
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,120
But still, they only send elites there.

806
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,340
You seem to be managing well.
You don't show your feelings.

807
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,840
To tell you the truth, it's not easy.

808
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:02,970
I'm sure.

809
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:11,770
Ma'am.

810
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,480
I have something to ask you.

811
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:15,810
Go ahead.

812
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,070
It's the right thing to do
and it should be done,

813
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,360
but I'm hesitating.

814
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:26,320
Why?

815
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:30,030
Because I think it will be more difficult
to hang on.

816
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,210
Does it have something
to do with your team?

817
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,960
If you ignore the right thing to do,

818
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,460
will it be easier for you?

819
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,680
At least,
I would be able to avoid criticism

820
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:49,260
since I'm a woman and all.

821
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,720
I'm not sure what it might be,

822
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,350
but I don't know if being a woman

823
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,350
has anything to do
with doing what's right.

824
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,770
At most,

825
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,690
they'll talk about your conscience.

826
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,500
And about conscience,

827
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,960
who doesn't know about that?

828
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:32,500
There are just people who do it
because they know it's right

829
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,880
and those who don't do it
even though they know it's right.

830
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,340
Geu-rae.

831
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,640
I'm sorry that I told you only now.

832
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,350
It would've been better for me
to bring the B/L with me,

833
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:04,320
but I can't get the B/L
and hand it over myself

834
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,820
because I'm a member of the Resource Team.

835
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:09,950
All right.

836
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:14,330
It's in the last drawer
of the file cabinet.

837
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:19,870
This is the cabinet number.

838
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:26,760
-I'll look after So-mi.
-What?

839
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:29,340
Right.

840
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:42,310
Thank you.

841
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,960
Who are you?

842
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,170
I'm So-mi's teacher.

843
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,090
I'm from One International.

844
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,510
I'm taking over for Geu-rae.

845
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,470
I guess Geu-rae needed
to tend to something.

846
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:18,680
-Yes, something came up at work.
-I see.

847
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:27,900
By any chance, are you two dating?

848
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,070
What? No.

849
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:35,450
Then, can you give me
Geu-rae's phone number?

850
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,410
What?

851
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,580
She said it was in here.

852
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:24,710
Who's there?

853
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,920
You little...

854
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,930
What are you doing here?

855
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:46,810
You punk!

856
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:50,480
Are you digging through another
team's cabinet without permission?

857
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:53,280
Come here. You little punk.

858
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,820
You're here to find the B/L, aren't you?
Did Mr. Oh send you?

859
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,620
-No, he didn't.
-Come here. I got you.

860
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,200
As expected from that bastard.

861
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,080
Is that what you learned
from you superior?

862
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,040
I know that the B/L is here.

863
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,670
What the hell are you talking about?

864
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,380
Hey, where is that bastard, Sang-sik?

865
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:15,840
His kid is a thief,
and he's gone for the day?

866
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:20,220
I'm going to have him fired!

867
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,390
Where is he? Tell him to come, right now!

868
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,680
Tell him to come, right now!

869
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:28,190
So is that what you're going to be like?

870
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:34,360
The guy with no strings
sends his stupid kid

871
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,450
to go through other people's stuff?

872
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,210
Here I am. The guy with no strings.

873
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,270
Sang-sik, what do you think you're doing?

874
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,940
I've respected you
just because you were hired before me.

875
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:23,740
Do you want to go at it
in front of this newbie?

876
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,950
Or do you want to go to the roof?

877
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,750
LINE

878
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:36,380
How would others know
if that was in our cabinet

879
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:39,220
or from your cabinet?

880
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,550
They wouldn't.

881
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,850
But you and I do.

882
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:50,520
What? What kind of nonsense is that?

883
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:52,060
But someone knows that

884
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,570
this was with your team.

885
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,110
Who?

886
01:05:58,900 --> 01:05:59,740
Who?

887
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,200
If you ever

888
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,160
bring up Eun-ji again,

889
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,540
I'm not going to stand back.

890
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,380
-Do you understand?
-Okay.

891
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,380
And If you ever play around

892
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:18,550
with my team again

893
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:21,130
I'm going to kill you.

894
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:23,340
Okay.

895
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:32,350
Tell Mr. Ma that you found it.

896
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:35,440
Mr. Oh.

897
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,360
-Write an apology letter.
-Sang-sik...

898
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,240
I'm going to kill you!

899
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,170
I'm sorry.

900
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:46,260
You want to go for a drink?

901
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:47,280
DAE PO RESTAURANT

902
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,530
Sir.

903
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:52,030
May I ask you a question?

904
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,870
No.

905
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,460
How did you know the number

906
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,630
to the Resource Team cabinet?

907
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:04,170
Someone told me.

908
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,590
Who?

909
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,300
You don't have to know, you punk.

910
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,880
Why didn't she draw my face?

911
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,470
Why are you so late?

912
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,390
Sorry. How about So-mi?

913
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:24,560
She's sleeping.

914
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,270
-Did So-mi draw this?
-Right.

915
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,360
But she didn't draw my face.
I look like some kind of ghost.

916
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:37,820
I don't have much to say.
I'm always sleeping.

917
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,170
You have golf tomorrow, right?

918
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,290
I have your clothes ready.

919
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,550
I'm going to have dinner afterwards.

920
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,420
I'll come home early tomorrow.

921
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:55,800
I'll come home as soon as I'm done, too.

922
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,720
We have no solution.

923
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,720
We're working hard to live a good life.

924
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,980
But it's causing us problems.

925
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:08,610
When So-mi gets older, it'll get better.

926
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:12,690
Yes, of course. You're right.

927
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,950
I will bring it in before ten.
Our team members have them ready.

928
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:18,950
Hello, you're here. Hi, So-mi.

929
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:22,240
Yes, of course.
No, that won't be a problem.

930
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:24,290
We're giving the orders...

931
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:34,710
I'll call you back.

932
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,800
So-mi, let's say bye to mommy.

933
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,640
One, two, three.

934
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,220
Goodbye.

935
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,770
You've been looking at me

936
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,020
from the back everyday, weren't you?

937
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,700
I'll be back.

938
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,670
I will never push you back ever again.

939
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,090
So-mi.

940
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:21,050
Will you draw me today?

941
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:24,470
Okay. I'll draw you really pretty.

942
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,320
Honey.

943
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,780
Where are my socks?

944
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:43,160
-My socks.
-Well, you shouldn't have drunk so much.

945
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:46,330
Dad.

946
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,500
-Have a nice day.
-Thanks.

947
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:51,040
You guys,

948
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:53,880
study hard, okay?

949
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,880
Work hard too!

950
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,510
-Okay.
-Bye.

951
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,050
Why isn't the door opening?

952
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:13,860
What is he doing here?

953
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:15,020
What is it?

954
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:19,860
My goodness.

955
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,700
He dropped you off yesterday.
I guess he couldn't walk

956
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,490
because he was too drunk.

957
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,160
What?

958
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:36,960
Hey, you. Geu-rae.

959
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:39,380
-What are you doing here?
-Good morning, sir.

960
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:41,130
Good morning.

961
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:16,540
These are the moments I live for!

962
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,106
-Please wear this tie, sir.
-I heard you told them about it.

963
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:23,190
He said that if his wife cheated on him,
this is how he'd feel.

964
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:25,530
-This is inappropriate...
-What? Are you uncomfortable?

965
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:27,990
-No, I like it.
-Will he get promoted before any of us?

966
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:30,950
-He didn't go to college.
-He said I could learn a lot from you.

967
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:33,530
I stood firm and said,
"Let's do it by the book..."

968
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:35,340
- I'm an idiot!
-Crazy bastard.

969
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,920
Call the risk management team,
the evaluation team and the legal team.

970
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:40,340
Don't forget about our deal.
I'll be waiting for your call.

971
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:41,340
Letter of Resignation
