00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,640
<i>- What do you think of the Jordan project? <br> - What?</i>

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,040
<i>If you remove the corruption, it seems like an attractive deal.</i>

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,720
<i>How could Jang Geu Rae say something like that?</i>

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,000
<i>He isn't aware that there are company eyes watching Business Team 3?</i>

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,390
<i>It feels like everyone in this company has received an insult.</i>

8
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,830
<i>Fine, let's give this project a try!</i>

9
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,250
<i>Jang Geu Rae, this really isn't right.</i>

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,250
<i>You should suggest something that you're capable of handling on your own.</i>

11
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,410
<i>With your capabilities, how much are you able to support this deal?</i>

12
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,810
<i>We set up this deal, and we're even staying still. Don't you guys have any manners or conscience?</i>

13
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,140
<i>- Pardon me?<br>- The company board has arranged a briefing for you to present your project.</i>

14
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,260
<i>I don't think I can convince them with this.</i>

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,380
<i>- What about the presentation content?<br>- It seems like the negative aspects of our project are being highlighted.</i>

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,270
<i>- What are you saying?<br>- What I mean is, when you look at a map...</i>

17
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,000
<i>I think looking at it so that North is always at the top is another type of custom.</i>

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,620
<i>So starting with a synopsis is also a custom?</i>

19
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,410
<i>If you're thinking of changing the entire order of the presentation, I'm against it.</i>

20
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,760
<i>We were trying to find a great plan inside the box, but Jang Geu Rae didn't even think about the box.</i>

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,790
<i>This doesn't make sense.</i>

22
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,970
<i>Truthfully, if this current project doesn't go well, I think I'll be very angry at you.</i>

23
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,550
<i>What have I done up to this point?</i>

24
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,010
Senior Manager Oh.

25
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,280
Why are you out here?

26
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,470
Yes, please go in.

27
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,390
Fine.

28
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,580
Do well today.

29
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,650

<i>Episode 13</i>

32
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:34,410
<i>Everyone was drawing an image in their heads of the same old, usual and obvious briefing.</i>

33
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,120
<i>They were either jotting down opposing points,</i>

34
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,970
<i>or they had already prepared them before they came.</i>

35
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,750
<i>The feeling that things were not going to go as we hoped was openly conveyed.</i>

36
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,190
<i>Is it that Business and Sales Team 3 ignorant, or are you gutsy?</i>

37
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,680
<i>How can you be so fearless?</i>

38
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,970
Previously, you resolved Manager Park's issue well, is that right?

39
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,670
Then, shouldn't you have ended it there?

40
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,890
Wasn't the president's praises and your promotion<br> a good enough incentive for you?!

41
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,240
Isn't being too ambitious worse than not doing enough?

42
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,950
That's right.

43
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,410
<i>Then...</i>

44
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,270
<i>Let's begin.</i>

45
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
The President is coming.

46
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,210
Well, I was curious,

47
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,310
and the time until my next appointment <br>was a bit ambiguous, you see.

48
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,470
- It's alright for me to attend, right? <br> - Yes, of course.

49
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,460
- Please sit.<br>- Okay.

50
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,110
Have a seat.

51
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,630
It's alright.

52
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,090
Senior Manager Oh, I'm sorry that I interrupted you. Please begin.

53
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,060
We received the advance funds for the Russian forest carbon emissions business.

54
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,920
Please check it.

55
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,070
Ok.

56
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,960
- Then this project is done for now, right?<br>- Yes.

57
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,180
Good work.

58
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,480
Ahn Yeong Yi does good work.

59
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,050
Rascal.

60
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,310
Manager.

61
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,390
Ahn Yeong Yi. This is Norwegian <br>minerals deal's supplementary work.

62
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,910
It's a simple matter, so prepare a revision<br> and get the Trading Contract.

63
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,590
Excuse me?

64
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,930
I'm telling you to take it on.

65
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,460
Thank you.

66
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,840
<i>(Trading contract - a system of inputting vendor and purchaser information) </i>

67
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,300
Ahn Yeong Yi, hello. Hello.

68
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,100
Ahn Yeong Yi, I just saw the beginning of Business and Sales Team 3's presentation and...

69
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,090
Wow! The executive directors were all lined up <br>and the board members were coming right behind them!

70
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:08,270
How do I put it? The atmosphere, the atmosphere felt like a concrete mix was poured right over everything.

71
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,950
It was like as you piss and leave, <br>you can feel the frigid air..

72
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,060
It was looming.

73
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,170
<i>Well... do you think this will work?</i>

74
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,370
<i>This is a presentation that I've never seen or heard.</i>

75
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,980
<i>What have I done up to this point?</i>

76
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,910
Just think of yourself as an observer here.

77
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,390
Yes.

78
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,940
For a moment, I'd like you to look at the screen.

79
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,690
<i>This is the Indonesia fraudulent natural resources incident of 1993.</i>

80
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:32,310
The person in charge of Indonesian office at that time paid transaction amount with reserved fund.

81
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,180
He paid with Indonesian currency <br>and made a huge marginal profit for himself.

82
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,970
This is an incident that caused enormous damage to the company.

83
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:47,590
<i>A declaration of war. The war without gun shots has begun at last.</i><br>- Are you kidding me?!

84
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,100
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

85
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,510
What are you doing right now, huh?

86
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,700
The 2002 Myanmar tungsten export corruption case.

87
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,850
The 2007 Singapore wine export corruption case.

88
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,980
In 2011, there was the Russian medical <br>electronics export corruption case.

89
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:18,140
In 2002 Myanmar tungsten export corruption case, bribery was given to the major stock holder ME Holdings.

90
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,980
The 2007 Singapore wine export corruption case was...

91
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,220
<i>The corruption that I had heard about during the OJT (On the Job Training) and during Manager Park's incident,</i>

92
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,100
<i>they were included in greater detail.</i>

93
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,340
That export corruption case was about sponsor delivering a double contract to the buyer.

94
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,840
There was an incident where they shared an illegal means of commission.

95
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,010
Also... Just recently, as you all know,

96
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,170
the Jordan used car export deal had an illegal commission profiteering incident.

97
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,920
<i>The uproar was as expected.</i>

98
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,940
<i>Either it brought about apologetic feelings about taking over someone's seat vacant due to the incident,</i>

99
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,430
<i>or it must have brought to mind those difficult times.</i>

100
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,750
<i>"What about it? What are you trying to say?"</i>

101
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,790
<i>Those expressions were asking those questions.</i>

102
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,810
<i>Also...</i>

103
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:12,370
<i>When a problem occurred, each case was dealt with accurate proficiency.</i>

104
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,270
<i>However, he doesn't stop.</i>

105
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,710
We have resolved it neatly.

106
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,090
and subsequently, we've erased that incident from our memory.

107
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,350
So what about it?!

108
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,820
What is it that you're getting at?!

109
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,090
Our company moved forward.

110
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,980
Impudence! Why bring out the past?!

111
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,740
- You're not done, are you?<br>- What's your point? Your point?!

112
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,810
Senior Manager Oh!

113
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,150
What are you pulling here?

114
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,990
Why are you bringing it out at this juncture?

115
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,440
Not desiring ever mentioning projects which went sour<br>[hence discarding the projects regardless of viability]

116
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,010
is a way of doing business and the path we've chosen to walk on.

117
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,630
If so, the businesses we've discarded and moved on,<br><i>Push and</i>

118
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,780
have you any idea where it lies and how it's been progressing?

119
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,740
<i>and dumping in [the argument].</i>

120
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,030
<i>It's conviction.</i>

121
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,730
What do you want to say exactly?!

122
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,720
<i>How many inner battles must you wage</i>

123
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,040
<i>in order to gain such conviction and assurance?</i>

124
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,560
The information you're about to see is the result of <br>other companies who pursued those very projects

125
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,230
we wanted to discard and not ever think of again.

126
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,230
Sin Seong Produce and Hae Seon Commercial achieved<br>$301 million and $275 million respectively.

127
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,490
HW Group delivered $106 million.

128
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,180
Hong Jae Commercial delivered $203 million.

129
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,580
The aforementioned businesses are on-going <br>[and generating revenue].

130
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,560
<i>One by one the examples are listed,</i>

131
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,500
Please take a look at projected revenue from those<br>businesses (opportunity cost).

132
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,100
<i>The projected revenue predicted by the then current <br>business team is shared.</i>

133
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,470
<i>These were our estimated value [revenue projected].</i>

134
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,720
<i>The revenue projected were on the money.</i><br>The [actual revenue for other companies] are nearly identical<br>to our original prediction.

135
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,380
Please take a look at those four companies' value before

136
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,040
and two years after launching the businesses [we discarded].

137
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,280
After pursuing these projects, every company's business<br>increased without exception.

138
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,560
<i>In Baduk when the opponent makes a leisurely move<br>that undermines me, or</i>

139
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,460
<i>makes a move that is overly greedy,</i>

140
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,540
Should we forget about the businesses [with corruption]<br>once we've made the guilty pay for their sins?

141
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,610
<i>and tries to avoid the fight despite its importance in that fight</i>

142
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,070
We have decided to remove the bad from the project<br>[and pursue the deal for profit].

143
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,790
<i>I pursue the move to the end.</i>

144
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:03,040
<i>Subtitles Brought To You By The Office Grunts Team @ Viki</i>

145
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,860
This seems completely different than at the rehearsal time.

146
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,590
If we don't have our wits about us, we can screw them up.

147
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,000
I think that guy is completely on the cutter.

148
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,530
Ladies and Gentlemen, from this point on...

149
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,290
<i>He changes the board and plans a new board.</i>

150
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,330
From this point on, I will begin the presentation on

151
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,940
expansion project of used car sales in Jordan.

152
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,210
Ladies and Gentlemen, from this point on...

153
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,780
<i>He changes the board and plans a new board.</i>

154
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,770
From this point on, I will begin the presentation on

155
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,470
the expansion project for used car sales in Jordan.

156
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,230
The aim of this business is to take 40% of the used car<br>sales within the domestic market

157
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:45,670
<i>Senior Manager Oh switched his presentation back to the format<br>we're well acquainted with.</i>

158
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,070
Jordan is a seemingly small country on the surface.

159
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,490
The scale of the country is narrow, and its domestic market is also limited.

160
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,150
Though it is located in the Middle East, due to lack of crude oil, it is known as a nation lacking in natural resources.

161
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,860
However owing to its stable political state, and

162
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,020
its central location within Middle Eastern market,

163
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,590
its brokering business is well developed.

164
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,570
When we export the used vehicles,<br> the number is approximately 280,000.

165
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,700
90,000 of those vehicles are being sent to Jordan.

166
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,020
The quantity seems larger than the scale of this country, but

167
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:23,980
that is because the vehicles are being exported again<br>to Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.

168
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,950
At this point, we will connect to the regional office in Jordan

169
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,020
and hear the current status of business at the location<br>from the regional branch manager.

170
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,960
<i>Everyone from the President and the executive staff, hello.</i>

171
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,070
There's been a receptivity towards the business agenda at hand<br>here in Jordan thus far,

172
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,870
and upon having met with several companies,<br> the majority of whom favored it,

173
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:50,040
<i>we could ascertain that the companies will gladly and actively promote the business.</i>

174
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,770
<i>The pertinent companies are listed on the presentation page 18.</i>

175
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:57,730
<i>Vice President Kim's confidence backed by the presentation</i>

176
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,740
<i>seems to have been conveyed directly to the executive staff.</i>

177
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,970
<i>...all that remains is to draw up the contract.</i>

178
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,830
<i>I'm convinced that this will become a sound business deal.</i>

179
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,060
With that I'll conclude the presentation of Sales Team 3's

180
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,920
used car exportation to Jordan business plan.

181
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,740
Thank you.

182
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,930
Not bad. It's not bad at all.

183
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,660
- I agree.<br>- Yep.

184
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,590
Why not go ahead and expand?

185
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,990
<i>I don't believe it was all that easy to have taken on the<br>project of a subordinate who was disciplined</i>

186
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,350
<i>from the discovery which you personally revealed.</i>

187
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,990
That is why we tried harder to maintain the value<br>of a high quality business deal.

188
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,290
This was a very well prepared report.

189
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,960
Were you able to handle the [workload] with sales team 3 alone?

190
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,220
Yes, the current Jordan team's help was invaluable as well.

191
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,530
By the way, I heard the youngest in the team is the one<br>who recommended you pursue this project again?

192
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,290
Yes, Sir. It's the new hire Jang Geu Rae.

193
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,220
His name is "Geu Rae"?

194
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,260
Jang Geu Rae?

195
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,960
Huh, Jang Geu Rae.

196
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,810
It's Jang Geu Rae.

197
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,300
Who is the kid? Where is he?

198
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,090
Hello, everyone.

199
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,330
I see that you don't have any fear.

200
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,120
- Geu Rae?<br>- Sir?<br> (play on his name Geu Rae is also "Is that so?")

201
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,830
What was the catalyst that propelled you to make such a suggestion?

202
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,700
That's because...

203
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,190
That's... because...

204
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:16,070
That's because... this is our company.

205
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,620
Our company?

206
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,310
Our... company?

207
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,250
Yes, Sir. I said our... company.

208
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,310
That's right. It's our company not someone else's right?

209
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,080
It's an obvious statement, but

210
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,940
somehow it puts us to shame.

211
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,070
That's how I feel, too.

212
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,860
Right.

213
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,100
Geu Rae. Thank you, Son.<br> (again play on his name. Gea Rae can mean "Alright")

214
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,490
Thank you.

215
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,810
This project of exporting used cars to Jordan,

216
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,050
I hope you can make sure <br>to produce some good result.

217
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,380
Thank you.

What are you doing, Kiddo?

236

Stand up, you Mr. Dazed of Dazed family.

237
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,770
Yes.

238
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,870
You played a difficult role very well, Vice President.

239
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,300
No, you guys did all.

240
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,220
Ah, right, I have to move to Abu Dhabi soon,

241
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,000
so how will you proceed about the schedule for signing the contract and everything else?

242
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,400
Yes, as for the next schedule, I will report it <br>to you after finishing some revisions.

243
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,440
Yes, yes. You've worked hard.

244
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,400
Yes, thank you!

245
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,450
Manager Cheon.

246
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,650
Yes.

247
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,070
You must have felt a lot of burden, <br>but thank you for working well until the end.

248
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,510
As you worked with us, it gave me <br>a lot of strength, Manager Cheon.

249
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,960
For me, too,

250
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,060
it felt good after a long time.

251
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,840
Shall I send a thank you e-mail to all executives <br>who attended our briefing session?

252
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,480
Ah, I will do that. You should send a message to <br>each related department and get the final confirmation.

253
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,280
Yes.

254
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Where is Jang Geu Rae?

255
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,960
He still looked like Mr. Dazed of <br>all the dazed people of Dazed family,

256
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,560
so I told him to go get some fresh air.

257
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,340
Come on, come here, <br>quickly, quickly, quickly!

258
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,860
Jang Geu Rae, enter!

259
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,920
- Tell us. <br>- There is nothing much to talk about...

260
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,660
See his neck becoming cocky. So, you're saying you're the first one (among us) to attend a briefing session where the CEO attended?

261
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,290
- No, that's not... <br>- Ever since Senior Manager Oh accepted your idea,

262
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,900
your neck probably has been cocky, I guess.

263
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,880
Congratulations, Mr. Jang Geu Rae. Frankly speaking, <br>I didn't expect you would do so well.

264
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,650
Thank you.

265

<i>Whenever I see that, it makes me feel weird. </i>

266
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,190
<i>A kind of thought that I should do better <br>so that I don't end up like that?</i>

267
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,870
Congratulations, Jang Geu Rae.

268
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,460
Yes. <br>Congratulations Jang Geu Rae.

269
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,940
Thank you.

270
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,020
Well, I will leave first. I need to send an e-mail.

271
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,960
Oh, me too.

272
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,190
Congratulations, Jang Geu Rae. <br>Yes.

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,920
Well, is an employee with the best qualification

276
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,700
coveting even the struggle of an employee <br>who started from rock bottom?

277
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,610
- What? <br>- Please don't do that.

278
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,450
Actually, we can't say the case <br>of Sales Team 3 is a normal case.

279
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,770
It's damage control for the problem which occurred.

280
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,810
Rather than that, completing the work without <br>any problem occurring from the beginning

281
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,990
would have been more proper, I think.

282
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,190
Then, is it "three at the breakfast, four at the dinner"? <br><i>(An allegory about the trickery<br> looking different but having the same result.)</i>

283
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,920
That's right, "three at the breakfast, <br>four at the dinner".

284
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,820
We just need to reach the end anyway.

293
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,990

- Ah, hello! <br>- Oh, are you going home now?

295
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,660
- Yes. <br>- You worked hard to endure today again.

00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,060
Hang in there tomorrow, endure the day after tomorrow, and keep surviving like that, okay?

00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,970
Yes, thank you!

Yes. Are you going?

Yes. See you tomorrow.

00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,180

330
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,480
You must be in a good mood.

331
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,140
In life, what's right is right, and what's wrong is wrong!

332

In here, is my letter of resignation.

333
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,280
Yes, Jang Baek Gi.

334
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,330
Ah, yes, Han Seok Yool, it's me. Well, I have a favor to ask of you.

335
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,930
Excuse me?

336
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,470
Hello? Hello, are you sure you're Jang Baek Gi?

337
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,650
<i>Quickly, please.</i>

338
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:23,140
Hey, who knew that Jang Baek Gi would be making that kind of request of me?

339
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,140
Of all the times I've seen you, I like you the most today. Okay.

340
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,930
Uh huh. Yes.

341
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,580
What is it?

342
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:40,720
It's a secret. I need to protect our Baek Gi's style also.

343
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,660
Cheers!

344
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,710
Hello.

345
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,420
Oh, wait a moment! Wait, wait a moment!

346
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,510
Get on, since I came out to meet you.

347
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:35,320
You're ten minutes late.

348
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,900
What about my request?

349
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,060
- Thank you.<br>- Take it off.

350
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,410
- Excuse me?<br>- Are you going in like that? Take your top off and come get it later.

351
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,250
I see.

352
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,850
Hey, why didn't you ask Assistant Manager Kang? He can't do that for you as your superior?

353
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,360
I still feel a bit uncomfortable, so...

354
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,960
That awkwardness?... You won't be able to discuss your issues with that person.

355
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,370
All things considered, that's true.

356
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,900
We're pretty even, then. Our psychopath,

357
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,850
is pretty similar, also.

358
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,830
- Have you been to the sauna together?<br>- What?

359
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:30,310
That's right, if you'd been to the sauna together, you wouldn't feel uncomfortable. Don't ever go to the sauna together until you become close!

360
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,830
- Why?<br>- It's so awkward that you'll go crazy and die!

361
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,640
Look here, think about being in the tub together.

362
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,140
It's embarrassing to get up first, but if you wait, then you'll get waterlogged. And it's like that when you scrub, also.

363
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,530
It's a bit awkward to bath side by side, but it's also a bit weird to start washing all by yourself.

364
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:53,330
It's a bit ambiguous.. You can't do this or that! You can't even say a word, even if they still have soap on their body.

365
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:58,420
- Why can't you say anything?<br>- Because he'll think that you've been looking at his naked body.

366
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,700
- What?<br>- What?

367
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,030
That's a serious offense!

368
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,820
You're late.

369
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,960
Well, you see... yes.

370
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,070
Han Seok Yool, come take the clothes away.

371
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,790
Yes.

372
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,810
Sheesh!

373
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,250
This is all because you're not taking care of yourself, Jang Baek Gi.

374
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,610
Yes. I apologize.

375
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,350
Yes, it looks like the six o'clock meeting today needs to be pushed back to six-thirty.

376
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,960
If I leave here now, I should arrive there about six-thirty.

377
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,740
So take care of that for me.

378
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,870
What are you doing? Get to work.

379
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:17,720
- Let's do that. And act like you're being cautious. There are still some unfavorable eyes watching you.<br>- Yes.

380
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,270
Manager Cheon.

381
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,030
Hello.

382
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,930
Yes, indeed.

383
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,080
This is Assistant Manager Kim Dong Shik.

384
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,710
Thank you.

385
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,740
I know!

386
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,200
would you like a cup of coffee?

387
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,940
Please sit.

388
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,970
Hello.

389
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,000
Should I not do it?

390
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:11,820
You do it later after seeing how it is.

391
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,980
Alright.

392
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,440
Ms. Yeong Yi.

393
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,380
I'll be going then.

394
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,920
Please make sure to tell them that I made those coffees.

395
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,890
- Mr. Han Seok Yool.<br>- Yes?

396
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:17,030
- The Assistant Manager~<br>- Manager, it was my carelessness so I'll speak to him so he understands.

397
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,720
That's wasn't it. Assistant Manager~

398
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,790
What I told you to do was take it out since it's hard to present at this time based on your settlement calculation.

399

<i>How formidable can someone who is just an assistant manager be.</i>

400

<i>It seems you don't know what is a real fighting.</i>

401
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,310
When did I do that?

402
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:45,020
You guys, seriously! <br>What are you guys doing right now?

403
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,860
Don't you think so? Why do I have to be cursed at for something I didn't do?

404
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:01,600
That's team, bound by the same objective and fate. Getting scolded and being punished together.

405
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,970
- Then why do you always exclude yourself from there?<br>- What?

406
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,480
Yes.
