1
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,580
Mr. Oh.

2
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,200
Hello.

3
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,580
We're on the same team now.

4
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,010
Wow, Mr. Kim.

5
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,640
You always look like you're a good worker.

6
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,230
I'm Geu-rae Jang.

7
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,020
Oh, you are the new contract worker.
I heard somebody hooked you up with a job.

8
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,200
I heard you're only a high school
graduate. You're quite lucky.

9
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,080
How did he get in?
I heard he doesn't have any connections.

10
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,370
Where is my desk?

11
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,210
It's here, right?

12
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,300
Whose is this?

13
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:49,970
Let's work hard.

14
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,520
What are you saying?

15
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,980
Please send someone else.

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,900
If that's not possible, please forget
about giving us more people.

17
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,610
Listen Sang-sik.

18
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,950
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm asking you

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,450
to send me someone that'll be helpful
to Sales Team Three.

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,870
That is Mr. Park.

21
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,080
Where can you find someone like
Mr. Park these days?

22
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,210
When I was in resources,

23
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,510
he was an excellent worker.

24
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,930
You can't be 100 percent pleased
with everything.

25
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,680
You need to adjust to one another.

26
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,850
Just think about work. Just work.

27
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,320
Hey, Mr. Jung.

28
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,070
I heard you recommended Mr. Park.

29
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,610
Yes. His performance is excellent.

30
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,570
What are you saying?

31
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,740
We all know that you're just trying
to get rid of him.

32
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,660
-Get rid of him?
-I have ears, you know.

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,540
I hear things.

34
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,460
I know he gave you a hard time
when he worked with you.

35
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,050
He has potential, but just doesn't fit
the Resources Team, that's all.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,470
If my leadership
was a bit more sophisticated,

37
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,430
I'm sure he would have done a better job.

38
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,120
It sounds to me that he's someone
you really wanted to get rid of.

39
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,520
Hey, high school graduate.

40
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,530
Yes.

41
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,860
Come here.

42
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,490
You're not even a high school graduate,
you only have a GED?

43
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,950
Wow, you really did well coming here,
didn't you?

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,710
That's amazing, right?

45
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,420
How did you pass the final presentation?

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,130
Mr. Kim, you didn't leak the topic
or something, did you?

47
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,930
I'm sure there's nothing you know
how to do, right?

48
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,390
You do have a pretty face.

49
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,060
I guess we can use your looks
for something.

50
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,400
Looks are important in sales.

51
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,190
Don't get too intimidated.

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,530
You have a girlfriend, right?
Let me see her picture.

53
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,030
-Let me see.
-Get to know each other later.

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,280
Let's organize the desks.

55
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,410
Mr. Oh.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,670
There are subordinates here.
What's with the tone of your voice?

57
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,840
It makes me a bit uncomfortable.

58
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,180
How was it in the other department?

59
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,510
Well, of course, it's...

60
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,300
Mr. Jung,
how did you address Mr. Park there?

61
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,560
Okay.

62
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,310
I don't think I was out of place.

63
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,810
All right, then.

64
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,520
You didn't have to go and make a call.

65
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,860
Why are you just standing there?

66
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,110
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,250
Why did you just stand there like that?

68
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,040
What?

69
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,050
Then again, how could you stand up to him?

70
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,300
But why Mr. Park of all people?

71
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,840
Seriously.

72
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,600
It's not going to be a smooth ride.

73
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,530
Geu-rae, get the materials
for the meeting ready.

74
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,440
EPISODE 9

75
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,160
These are the materials.

76
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Those are the materials
for the Middle East projects.

77
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,500
See if there's anything that might fit us.

78
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,420
Jeez. I just got here.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I was only here for three days.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,420
I didn't even get used to the team yet.

81
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,720
Why are there so many?
When am I going to finish reading these?

82
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,980
This one is probably going to kill us.

83
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:32,570
This one will not profit enough compared
to the work we'll have to put into it.

84
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,280
Hey, high school graduate.

85
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,160
Did you pick this?

86
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,170
Sir, this one will not work.

87
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,000
You can't do projects in the Middle East
merely with just your will.

88
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,260
Then why don't you bring some items
that will be good to work on.

89
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,970
Sir, are you even paying attention
to what I'm saying?

90
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,310
Let me get adjusted first.

91
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,400
Even when a gambler joins the game
in the middle,

92
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,360
he takes time to see what the stakes are
and how the game is flowing.

93
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,570
Jeez.

94
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,370
You're very competent.

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,830
I'll be back tomorrow.
Call me if anything comes up.

96
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,250
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,020
This is Baek-ki Jang.

98
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,990
Has the interview date been set?

99
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,030
Yes.

100
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,790
It's on a weekday.

101
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,870
No, it's fine. I can take a day off.

102
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,500
Yes.

103
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,930
Hey. Who asked you for this?

104
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,720
Don't do things you weren't told to do.

105
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,900
OUT OF PAPER

106
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Man.

107
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,700
Here you go.

108
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,170
Damn it.

109
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,460
Young-yi, what are you doing?

110
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,930
Did you not ask for it?

111
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,310
As you said,
I will withdraw from the project.

112
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,270
But while you are working on it,

113
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,350
I will do all of your chores for you.

114
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,270
Really?

115
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,690
Fine. Do it.

116
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,780
Clear this trash can

117
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,330
and wash it.

118
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,000
What? You don't want to do it?

119
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,750
No, sir. I'll do it.

120
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,630
While you're at it,
clear all of the trash cans.

121
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,710
Yes, sir.

122
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,140
Summarize it and bring it to me.

123
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,180
Okay.

124
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,110
Hey. What is she doing?

125
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,780
I ordered her to do it.
She really wanted to.

126
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,070
What's wrong with you?

127
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,530
Just because she wants to,
you can't have her do things like that.

128
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,570
Really.

129
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,120
Baek-ki!

130
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,580
Is this the way for you to be accepted
as a member of their team?

131
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,400
What are you doing with...

132
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,360
-Baek-ki.
-My goodness!

133
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,780
Seriously.

134
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,700
Damn it.

135
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,160
What is... Shit!

136
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,860
Please see me outside.

137
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:26,960
What was that?

138
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,140
Are they dating...

139
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,100
Are they going out?

140
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,810
Answer me Geu-rae.

141
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,810
I don't have a clue.

142
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,140
Fine.

143
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,530
You and I both don't deserve
to be treated like this.

144
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,530
If the company doesn't want me,

145
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,490
I don't think I should stay.

146
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,620
If it's the same for you, then just leave.

147
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,540
Baek-ki.

148
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,380
Don't even interfere
with my business like that.

149
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,420
I didn't mean this
when I said you should give in.

150
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Is giving in to everything
what you've decided to do?

151
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,840
Yes.

152
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,340
-For me, that's my way...
-That's not a good way.

153
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,640
Then what else can I do?

154
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,480
What else? If you know, tell me.

155
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,600
Working hard doesn't work.

156
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,650
And it gets worse if I don't.

157
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,770
What am I supposed to do?

158
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,190
I didn't learn in school
how to have people

159
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,900
that have already pushed me away

160
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,160
to open up to me.

161
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,530
It's not taught in English
and Math subjects. That's why...

162
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,830
That's why I'm doing what I can.

163
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,290
I'm doing everything that I can think of.

164
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,330
This is the way I've found.

165
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,920
If you found your own way,

166
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,340
let's keep out of each other's business

167
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,880
and do what's best for ourselves.

168
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,020
I'm going to quit the company.

169
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,430
Hey, Seok-yul.

170
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,140
Sir, I just sent the documents
to Taejin Company.

171
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,770
Good job.

172
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,940
I can really count on you.

173
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,320
Good job.

174
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,990
Do you want to have some coffee?

175
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,110
Sure.

176
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,740
Have the most expensive one.

177
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,390
-Two caramel macchiatos, please.
-Okay.

178
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,860
Sir, this card is not working.

179
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,900
What?

180
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,240
Could you try once more?

181
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,740
It's not working.

182
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,330
Here you go.

183
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,880
YOON-A: YURI IS BETTER AT ACTING THAN
WHEN I FIRST STARTED

184
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,970
-Sir, here's your coffee.
-Thank you.

185
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,890
Sir, your card.

186
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,600
Yes, my card. Thank you.

187
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,850
You exceeded your limit.

188
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,140
What?

189
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,560
That's right. How much was it?

190
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,940
It was nine thousand won.

191
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,820
Well...

192
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,320
I don't have any cash.

193
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,280
It's okay. It's on me.

194
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,830
Really?

195
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,660
You're a real man, Seok-yul.

196
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,920
Also, about the polyester project.

197
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,340
The Canadian buyer will call in a bit.

198
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,840
Organize the item list by then.

199
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,590
Wait, Canada?

200
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,350
They said that they would call
at 11:00 a.m. their time,

201
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,270
it's approximately midnight here.

202
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,480
-Midnight?
-Yes.

203
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,350
And tomorrow,

204
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,690
accompany the management
to the breakfast meeting.

205
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,190
Breakfast meeting?

206
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,780
Go to King's hotel by five-thirty.

207
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,620
Do you mean 5:30 a.m.?

208
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,530
Yes.

209
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,700
Right.

210
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,750
I have a business trip early tomorrow.
So I can't go.

211
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,220
Something's wrong.

212
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,140
Something's wrong.

213
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,510
Mr. Sung just can't do anything
without me.

214
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,770
Okay.

215
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,680
-File these.
-All right.

216
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,190
This is like

217
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,320
not getting paid
after doing a part-time job.

218
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,400
Like I got stabbed in the back.

219
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,670
Yes, Seok-yul?

220
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,420
Geu-rae, I'm in the break room
Can we talk for a moment?

221
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,430
Why?

222
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,470
Here.

223
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
What is it?

224
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,900
Listen to me.

225
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,900
Listen and let me know what you think.

226
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,990
You know that Mr. Sung

227
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,990
-is a very good person, right?
-I don't know.

228
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,280
What? Anyway,

229
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,660
something's not right.

230
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,830
-I think that...
-Do you think he's making you do his work?

231
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,630
Yes. Do you think so, too?

232
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,300
Do you think that Geu-rae?
Do you think so, too?

233
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,380
Hello?

234
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,460
It's me.

235
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,670
-Who is this?
-Don't you know your superior's voice?

236
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,930
Yes, Mr. Park.

237
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,180
Print me the EPC TF project
for the Steel Team.

238
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,100
-Yes, sir.
-Is Mr. Park here?

239
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,560
-No.
-Where's Geu-rae?

240
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,730
I'm not sure.
He was just here a moment ago.

241
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,700
There we go. It's good.

242
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,540
This is... Good!

243
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,460
Wow!

244
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,630
-You missed it!
-Yes!

245
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,380
Your phone's been ringing.
Are you going to be okay?

246
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,380
It's fine, you punk.

247
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,720
Overcome

248
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,060
the obstacle

249
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,230
in front of me first.

250
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,810
Yes! 10,000 won each.

251
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,900
-He got that?
-It's 10,000 won each.

252
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,690
-That was shady.
-It went like this.

253
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,900
Give me 10,000 won each.

254
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,240
Is that all you have? You, too?

255
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,410
Well...

256
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,910
Never mind, you punk.

257
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,410
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

258
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,080
All right. Win big.

259
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,420
Are you going to the sauna now?

260
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,130
I have a coupon. Do you want it?

261
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,300
Hey.

262
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,720
I am a member at the Phillip Hotel.

263
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,220
I don't go to those regular saunas, okay?

264
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,430
Are you going to wear those to the hotel?

265
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,270
Are you crazy?

266
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,310
Hey.

267
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,280
What do you want me to do with that?
Put it down.

268
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,000
You should have brought a shoehorn.

269
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,630
You have no consideration.

270
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,510
I'm going to meet with a vendor,

271
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,340
so take this back, okay?

272
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,500
-What is that?
-This is...

273
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,460
It's nothing, sir.

274
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,420
Where's Mr. Park?

275
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,090
He went to meet with a vendor.

276
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,920
Which vendor? He just started here.

277
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,340
It's a vendor he knew from the other team.

278
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,140
Geu-rae, call him.

279
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,350
Okay.

280
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,280
How was in at the other department?

281
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,950
Mr. Jung,
how did you address Mr. Park there?

282
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,040
I don't think I was out of place.

283
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,670
Those are the materials
for the Middle East projects.

284
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,710
See if there's anything that might fit us.

285
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,550
He's still a salary man.

286
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,560
That good-for-nothing bastard
is too arrogant.

287
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,160
Where is he? Is he gone for the day?

288
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,200
No, sir. He went to Pohang to meet buyers.

289
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,470
Yes, this is the Steel Team
of One Enterprise.

290
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,350
Yes. Mr. Kang is on a business trip.

291
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,140
Okay.

292
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,520
Okay. I'll relay the message to him.

293
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,440
Okay.

294
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,900
Give it to him.

295
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,900
Right, this is the EPC TF project.

296
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,200
The report that Mr. Kang made seems good.

297
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,580
So tell him to get
the approval from the steel team.

298
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,660
The Resource Team and our team need
to get it approved, too. It's urgent.

299
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,500
-It must be done, right away.
-Yes, sir.

300
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,250
I'll let him know as soon as he gets back.

301
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,970
-Where's Mr. Cha?
-He went to Myanmar on business.

302
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,340
This team needs
to recruit more people, too.

303
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,930
You're not physically here
but looking elsewhere,

304
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,730
are you?

305
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,850
Pardon?

306
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:09,980
See you later.

307
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,570
MYANMAR EPC TF PROJECT

308
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,090
Time really flies when you're having fun.

309
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,300
It's already time to go home.

310
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,640
Mr. Park, where did you go?

311
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,050
What?

312
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,720
Damn it. Hey you, contractor.

313
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,220
Didn't you tell him?

314
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,060
I told you that I went to meet a vendor.

315
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,650
-I did...
-Did you meet your vendor at the sauna?

316
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,320
The scent of the charcoal
in the sauna is still strong on you.

317
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,990
Our Sang-sik.

318
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,490
Your keen sense of smell
is still quite sharp.

319
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,570
Hey, Mr. Park.

320
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,320
Yes?

321
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,200
You should use formal titles
when you are at work.

322
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,250
Okay, I will.

323
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,210
You've become so bossy unlike before.

324
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,170
You weren't like that, you know?

325
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,720
You should stop going to the sauna
during work hours. It's not right.

326
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,590
All right.

327
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,340
I'm sorry.

328
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,270
I should work. This one. "Halal"?

329
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,060
Should we do this?

330
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,690
Well, is it feasible?

331
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,190
Well, it won't bring in much
in the beginning,

332
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,770
but it's great to understand
the environment of the Middle East.

333
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,280
It's not bad for Team Three
to do it as a case study.

334
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,700
Okay. Great.

335
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,410
But I can't do Middle East items
by myself.

336
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,660
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

337
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,080
Give me Geu-rae. All I need is him.

338
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,960
Mr. Park, Geu-rae is not...

339
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,630
I can't have him?

340
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,500
Why?

341
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,130
You're not capable?

342
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,260
I don't need that much support.

343
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,970
I'll just have him do things
that a high school graduate can do.

344
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,730
You're a high school graduate, right?

345
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,520
Wait.

346
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,770
-You didn't even graduate, did you?
-Hey, Mr. Park.

347
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,400
Sir, if you allow it,
I'll support Mr. Park.

348
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,780
Geu-rae.

349
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,780
Don't you know the order of rank?

350
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,450
Who's higher in rank? Mr. Oh or Mr. Park?

351
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,200
You should know better.

352
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,910
Hey, Dong-sik. Stay out of it.

353
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,460
Don't interfere.

354
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,170
What are you saying? What do you mean?

355
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,420
-What?
-Enough.

356
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,640
The order of rank
is really fucked up here.

357
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,470
A deputy is acting up to a manager?

358
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,770
Wow. The atmosphere here is nice.

359
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,360
Did you guys already get close?

360
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,770
-Hello, sir.
-Yes.

361
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,610
How's Team Three?

362
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,450
I'm really looking forward
to working with them

363
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,320
as a team.

364
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,540
Team Three's business is very important.
Work hard.

365
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,000
I took the extra mile to have you here.

366
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,750
-Yes, sir. I'll do that.
-Good.

367
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,250
Sir. where do you play golf these days?

368
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,550
My wrist got hurt a while back,
so I haven't been out recently.

369
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,720
Are you okay?

370
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,140
I'm fine.

371
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,890
Anyway, I'm expecting a lot from you.

372
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,720
Work hard.

373
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,270
Goodbye.

374
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,740
You really fucked me over this time.

375
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,300
He was a really good employee.

376
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,760
He specializes in the Middle East,
so he'll be of big help for our team.

377
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,470
I know.

378
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:14,810
He was the legend of the 120 million
dollar Jordan export project.

379
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,020
That was the best result
from the Steel Team.

380
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,060
And Mr. Park played a big part then.

381
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,480
Really?

382
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,780
He was a deputy manager then.

383
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,240
He was in charge of communicating
with the local vendors.

384
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,660
Everyone agreed that he played
the biggest part in winning the deal.

385
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,200
That's when it all started.

386
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,540
He became unstable since then.

387
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,220
Let's take him in.

388
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,760
Since he joined Sales Team Three,
he's one of us.

389
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,260
Even if we lose deals,
we don't lose people. That's our motto.

390
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,270
That's your personal motto.

391
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,270
What's with your nonsense?

392
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,070
Come tomorrow,
support him well with the halal project.

393
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,160
It won't be easy, but bear with it.
That's your specialty.

394
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,620
Perseverance.

395
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,540
-What?
-Sir, I don't like that either.

396
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,160
Geu-rae. What's wrong with you?

397
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,630
It's okay to get criticized
for not doing your work right.

398
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,670
But personal attack is something else.

399
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,010
If you don't like it, say something.

400
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,390
People will say you have no self-esteem.

401
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,860
Come tomorrow,
support him well with the halal project.

402
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,400
It won't be easy, but bear with it.
That's your specialty.

403
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,990
Perseverance.

404
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,410
Sir, I don't like that either.

405
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,920
Geu-rae. What's wrong with you?

406
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,290
It's okay to get criticized
for not doing your work right.

407
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,300
But personal attack is something else.

408
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,460
If you don't like it, say something.

409
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,970
People will say you have no self-esteem.

410
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,410
ATTACK TACTICS

411
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,750
Jumping into danger is not
the only way of showing courage.

412
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,540
You're not even a high school graduate.
You only have a GED?

413
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,710
Avoiding the area of danger
where you want to jump into

414
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,130
and silently going along is also courage.

415
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,970
Immediately reacting to a backflow
is foolish.

416
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,980
If I remain in the current as
the opponent tries to cause a backflow,

417
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,600
it will just create a backflow
to the opponent himself.

418
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,070
Sir, if you allow it,
I'll support Mr. Park.

419
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,440
So standing firm and keeping my flow,

420
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,660
is the best defense

421
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,030
and the strongest offense.

422
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,170
Hold on, please.

423
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,130
Excuse me.

424
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,850
-Hello.
-Hello.

425
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,240
That guy is quite impatient.

426
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,280
Baek-ki.

427
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,490
Yes?

428
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,830
-What?
-Well...

429
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,800
Baek-ki, you were an intern
for Resources Team Two, right?

430
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,840
Yes.

431
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,090
What was Mr. Park like?

432
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,180
Since you were on the same team...

433
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,810
Are you trying to make me talk
behind a senior's back?

434
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,980
No, I'm not.
If that's what it sounded like,

435
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,060
I apologize.

436
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,030
He's going to be a bit too much for you.

437
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,540
I can imagine how he is treating you.

438
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,540
Don't take everything so personally.

439
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,250
That will be easier for you.

440
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,050
Just ignore him.

441
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,560
This is the list
of the halal meat distributors.

442
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,440
What? Already?

443
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,830
You really are the competent,

444
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,750
underqualified newbie as they say.

445
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,540
How did you find it?

446
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,300
I found a team that had done halal
projects and got it from them.

447
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,670
I also contacted current Arab vendors
and inquired about halal business.

448
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,050
Pretty good.

449
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,890
You know

450
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,730
I said I'll only ask easy things from you.

451
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,650
But you still need
to know how to do basic things.

452
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,940
Basics. I'm talking about basics.

453
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,690
For example, you need to know trade terms.

454
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,110
Do you know what A/S is?

455
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,660
I'm not talking
about repairing refrigerators and stuff.

456
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,410
At sight.

457
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,540
It is a condition that it must be bought
or paid when the promissory note is given.

458
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,750
You are good.

459
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,670
Volume rate.

460
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,550
It's a type of discount
for large shipments.

461
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,720
It is a discounted rate given
as the freight volume increases.

462
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,720
Knocked down.

463
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,810
Exporting goods in pieces
to be assembled once received.

464
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,850
The taxes on the finished goods
are higher.

465
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,400
Therefore it saves on cost in countries
where labor cost is low.

466
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,860
W/M.

467
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,110
It gives the shipping company the right
to choose whether to use

468
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,360
weight or capacity
to calculate shipping cost.

469
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,190
If the buyer asks this,
how would you answer?

470
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,150
You don't understand?

471
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,410
English is part of the basics
in a trade company.

472
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,450
What are we going to do with him?
He's just not qualified.

473
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,370
Jeez.

474
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:38,960
Good job.

475
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,550
He's so childish.

476
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,650
Cocky bastard.

477
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,710
Yes, sir. I understand.

478
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,013
Mr. Jang, Mr. Kang can't come today.

479
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,020
Okay. I understand.

480
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,280
-Hello.
-Hey.

481
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,200
Mr. Kang is coming today, right?
When is he coming?

482
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,030
-He can't come today.
-What? He can't?

483
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,530
No. What should I do?

484
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,290
What's wrong?

485
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,040
They want each team
to send the revised budget

486
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,380
for the EPC TC project today
to the Finance Team for approval.

487
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,880
Steel Team needs to send it in too.

488
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,010
It's nothing much.
Do you think you can do it?

489
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,260
What?

490
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:57,860
Mr. Kang finished
the whole report before he left.

491
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,980
All you have to do is summarize it
and input the budget and timetable

492
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,740
and sort it into approximately five pages
to meet the approval standards.

493
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,060
I don't think Mr. Kang will approve.

494
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,480
Let me call him.

495
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,740
Would you like some coffee?

496
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,910
It's fine.

497
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,420
MYANMAR EPC TF PROJECT

498
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,690
I'll get it.

499
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,570
This is Baek-ki Jang of the Steel Team.

500
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,410
Baek-ki, it's me.

501
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,240
I just heard from Mr. Yoo
from Resources Team Two.

502
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,500
Do you think you can do it?

503
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,760
I understand.

504
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:52,840
Okay.

505
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,260
Just because you're quitting,
you won't do a mediocre job, right?

506
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,850
I'm counting on you.

507
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,790
MS. SUN-JU KIM
CONFIRM

508
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,250
REQUEST FOR APPROVAL

509
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,670
REQUEST FOR APPROVAL NOTES

510
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:25,230
REQUEST MADE FOR HAE-JUN KANG

511
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,480
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEND THE REQUEST?

512
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,610
THE REQUEST HAS BEEN SENT

513
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,610
Sir.

514
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,660
This is the investigation
for the butchery process sorted by kind,

515
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,240
location and certification process
is done.

516
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,200
Leave it there.

517
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,410
Hey,

518
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,290
can you massage my shoulder a little?

519
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,960
It's really hurting. Just a little.

520
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,380
What's wrong with my shoulders?

521
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,300
It hurts.

522
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,010
You don't want to?

523
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,430
No, sir.

524
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,820
Yes, that feels good.

525
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,150
Did you learn how to massage or something?

526
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,700
You're so good.

527
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,080
You really have a knack for it.

528
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,870
Even if you leave here,
you'll have something to make a living of.

529
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,630
Mr. Oh, he's really good.

530
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,460
I think that's enough.

531
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,210
Geu-rae has a lot to do.

532
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,420
It's not going to take that long.

533
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,550
Okay. That's fine.

534
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,770
I'm feeling better now.

535
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:51,560
Geu-rae.

536
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,610
Did you learn
how to do a foot massage, too?

537
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,320
Can you massage my feet too?

538
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,110
Every time I move like this,
it hurts so much.

539
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,330
What are you doing?

540
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,920
Yes, that hurts.

541
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,830
Hold on. Stop.

542
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,720
Yes, sir. I'm good.

543
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,340
Yes. How's everything with you?

544
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,970
Right. I was transferred to another team.

545
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,650
Geu-rae. Let's talk for a moment.

546
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,000
Well, you know...

547
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,000
Is it because of your name?

548
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,330
What?

549
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:58,710
Well, because your name is Geu-rae,
and it means yes.

550
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,800
If you don't want to

551
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,180
and you don't think it's right,
just say so. It's okay.

552
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,100
I'm not just talking about Mr. Park.

553
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,720
Usually, when a newbie starts his new job,

554
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,850
he'd get frustrated or overdo it
after reality hits him.

555
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,730
But he'd find the right path eventually.

556
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,440
But you're not like that. You just do
everything told without complaining.

557
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,030
You seem like you're ready

558
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,360
to accept anything that is thrown at you.

559
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,660
You're like a long-term prisoner
that's just been released.

560
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,370
It's like you're doing everything you can
to adjust to society.

561
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,120
I'm sorry. I think I was out of line.

562
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,420
But Geu-rae, you're really like that.

563
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,760
I don't know much of your past, okay?

564
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,800
I know you are a high school graduate
with a GED

565
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,760
who has not done anything until now.

566
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,510
Tell me.

567
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,680
What kind of life have you live until now

568
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,230
to be so cooperative and self-sacrificial?

569
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,700
As for me,

570
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,920
I wish that

571
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,880
I'll be able to get to know you better
in the near future.

572
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,460
I'll get going first.

573
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,740
Go and get some sleep.

574
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,870
You stayed up all night
to prepare for the meeting.

575
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,160
You didn't sleep at all, did you?

576
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,660
It's okay, sir.

577
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,210
Accommodating the management
is actually the deputy manager's job.

578
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,670
Good job.

579
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,510
Mr. Sung must be tired, too.
Going on a business after an all-nighter.

580
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,510
-An all-nighter?
-He didn't even have to go.

581
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,760
Why would he volunteer for that?

582
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,850
He didn't have to go?

583
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,310
How much of the Canada polyester project
has been processed?

584
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,310
You don't know much about it, do you?

585
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,780
Well, I have...

586
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,030
Sir, I'm back.

587
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,450
Seok-yul, did it go well?

588
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,200
Good job.

589
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,790
Bring me the polyester project.
I need to take it up for review.

590
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:20,700
Yes, sir.

591
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,920
MR. JUN-SIK SUNG

592
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,260
Seok-yul.

593
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,390
You didn't send me the email
with the times for the polyester project.

594
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:44,560
If you did the work, you should have sent
me the file, too. Did you forget?

595
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,230
What's the matter with you?

596
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,395
Sir, here you are. I revised the list
as they requested, yesterday.

597
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,950
-Let's get going with it.
-Yes, sir.

598
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,870
You heard him, right? Let's get going.

599
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,540
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

600
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,580
I have something to tell you.

601
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,860
I can't do it.

602
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,110
What?

603
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,320
You can't?

604
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,410
I'm too busy.
Can't you just do it yourself?

605
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,960
-What?
-It's your job.

606
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,630
The polyester export
and this morning's breakfast meeting...

607
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,670
Hey, Seok-yul.

608
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,500
I'm busy with the next quarter's report
that I need to give to the manager.

609
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,340
I can't do your job as well.

610
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,300
What? You can't do my job?

611
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,970
You just stepped out of line.

612
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,350
Are you trying to say
that I dumped my work on you?

613
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,810
-Yes, I do think that...
-Hey!

614
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,320
This is why newbies nowadays
are troublesome.

615
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,280
You can't even help your senior with that?

616
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,290
I'm teaching you the ropes,
not dumping my work on you.

617
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,830
You need to watch what you say!

618
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,290
Baek-ki.

619
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:28,590
There was a reply from the Finance Team
regarding the report you sent.

620
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,050
Got it. All right.

621
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,800
MS. SUN-JU KIM

622
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,140
DEFERRED

623
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,850
What? There's no reason
for it being deferred?

624
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,940
Mr. Kim, not again.

625
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,600
It's Mr. Kim's

626
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,730
unique way of communicating
when there is no reason written.

627
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,070
It means that you have
to find the reason yourself.

628
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:57,070
It either means that it's completely wrong
or that it's missing an important factor.

629
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,620
-Usually, that's what it means.
-Okay.

630
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,040
I don't think you did it all wrong.

631
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,160
Take a look and see what you've missed.

632
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,920
Yes, sir. Thank you.

633
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,800
It either means that it's completely wrong
or that it's missing an important factor.

634
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,430
Damn it!

635
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
Hey, you.

636
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,150
Here.

637
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,040
-Hey, Young-yi.
-Yes?

638
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:06,870
Wipe my desk, too.

639
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,120
Yes, sir.

640
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:15,550
-Young-yi.
-Yes?

641
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,630
Clean mine as well.

642
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,510
-Okay.
-Me, too.

643
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:20,760
Yes, sir.

644
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,890
Are the documents still not done?
It's almost time for the meeting.

645
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,770
It's done.

646
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,150
Darn it. Young-yi, clean this up.

647
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,280
Okay.

648
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,780
Hey. Are the documents okay?

649
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,410
-Yes. Fortunately.
-Okay, good.

650
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:45,410
You should have been careful.
Young-yi, clean it up.

651
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,330
Yes, sir.

652
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,220
Stay. I'll get it.

653
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,080
What's wrong with us?

654
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,580
We are a soccer ball
that everybody is kicking around,

655
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,630
an abused Cinderella, a vegetable,

656
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,010
and a pushover.

657
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,300
Jeez.

658
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:43,600
Hey, Young-yi.

659
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,470
Face it head on.

660
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,060
I told you to be aggressive.

661
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,310
There's a saying in go, "Learn
to compromise when you can't change"

662
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:57,320
Immediately reacting
to a backflow is foolish.

663
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,750
So, If I remain in the current as
the opponent tries to cause a backflow,

664
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,830
it will just create a backflow
to the opponent himself.

665
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:18,670
What is he talking about?

666
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,760
-Hello?
-Ji-hyun Lee from Search and Brain.

667
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,600
I called to confirm tomorrow's interview.

668
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,690
That's right. It's tomorrow.

669
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,480
Yes, it's possible.

670
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,520
No. I will take a day off.

671
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,980
Yes.

672
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,870
-Yes?
-Sit down.

673
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,500
I heard you got deferred.

674
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,920
-Yes.
-You didn't get the reason either?

675
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:04,300
Yes.

676
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,090
I just came from the Finance Team.

677
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:08,760
Is this it?

678
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,560
-Right. Yes.
-Let's see.

679
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,150
You can't write out
the schedule like this.

680
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,520
Make a form that is applicable
to the approval format.

681
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,740
You need to calculate man/month, yourself.

682
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,570
Look, you don't know how much manpower
you need if you don't enter it.

683
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,240
You have to calculate it.

684
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:33,160
This is new. What kind of format is this?

685
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,960
I've never seen it before.

686
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,960
What kind of format is this?

687
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,420
Didn't you receive the training regarding
the One International standard format?

688
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,340
Revise it and re-send it.
The Finance Team keeps nagging.

689
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,930
I think that the  hahoe  masked witch
is getting on them.

690
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,470
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

691
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,640
-A good try.
-Thank you.

692
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,480
Even Geu-rae doesn't do it like that.

693
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,610
Sir. I'm going home now.

694
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,740
-Okay. Go ahead.
-All right.

695
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,670
Geu-rae, go home.

696
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,460
Yes, sir.

697
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:34,430
Geu-rae.

698
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,730
Hi, Young-yi.

699
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,770
-Are you going home?
-Yes.

700
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,940
We really worked hard today, too.

701
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,150
Yes.

702
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,280
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Yes.

703
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,080
Hey, contractor!

704
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,080
Going home?

705
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,830
-Yes.
-Wow. Things got easy.

706
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,710
Going home on time?

707
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,380
Goodbye, sir.

708
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,340
This kid.

709
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,430
Hey.

710
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,940
If she gets married,
she'll be the next Ms. Sun.

711
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,650
If she doesn't, she'll end up like
Ms. Kim, right?

712
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,650
See you tomorrow.

713
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,360
I'll see you tomorrow.

714
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,500
You seem like you're ready

715
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,960
to accept anything that is thrown at you.

716
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,840
You're like a long-term prisoner
that's just been released.

717
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,710
It's like you're doing everything you can
to adjust to society.

718
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,260
A long-term prisoner
that's just been released.

719
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,220
What's wrong with that?

720
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,890
I'm showing you everything.

721
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,100
Why do you need to know about my past?

722
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,250
Sir, where are you?

723
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,380
Could you wait for me a bit?

724
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,510
I need to show you something.

725
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:37,890
Okay.

726
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:46,610
This way, sir.

727
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,650
Great view.

728
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,820
-It's very high, isn't it?
-It's okay.

729
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,700
-This is it.
-Really?

730
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:08,730
I'm home.

731
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,560
You're early.

732
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:13,690
Wash up and eat. I boiled some mackerel.

733
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,440
I didn't do the seasoning right.
So it's a bit fishy near the tail.

734
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,700
-It's always fishy.
-That's why today,

735
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,990
let's decide on who will have the tail
before we go in.

736
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:27,370
Lose the stereotype of thinking
that moms are able

737
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,080
to eat fishy food and all.

738
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,830
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

739
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,000
He's our team's deputy manager.

740
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,130
Hello.

741
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,550
My goodness.
Your senior came all the way here?

742
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,090
-How about dinner?
-No, I'm fine.

743
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,390
I'll be leaving right away.

744
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,680
Geu-rae wanted to show me something.

745
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,640
What?

746
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,980
Maybe he's hiding a girlfriend?

747
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,560
Maybe not?

748
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,030
You little brat! What have you been doing?

749
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:05,450
What are you doing
that a rumor like that is being spread?

750
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:09,160
Wait, ma'am. I was just joking.

751
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:12,630
-Joke?
-Yes, just a joke.

752
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,420
-I know.
-Yes. Pardon?

753
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,050
I was joking, too.

754
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:20,130
A joke should at least be like this.

755
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,640
Mr. Deputy's joke was not funny.

756
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:25,390
The punchline was just plain.

757
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,220
Let's go in, sir.
Mom, please give me dinner.

758
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,060
I'm sorry.

759
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:36,110
Please excuse me.

760
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,820
I'm not sure how that was.

761
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,990
Well. This was really good.

762
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,660
Thank goodness.

763
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,330
Well, this...

764
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,170
It's so fishy. It's not edible.

765
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,000
Really?

766
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,170
I guess I'll have it then.

767
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,090
Well, this. I should...

768
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:05,470
I thought our guest might have
some other taste in food.

769
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:08,060
Well, why didn't you...

770
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:16,480
Then, please enjoy your stay.

771
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,690
Yes, thank you.

772
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,200
What about the tail?

773
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,290
Should I have eaten the tail?
Even the tail...

774
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,920
That's my mom's humor.

775
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:38,130
She thinks that she's really funny,
but she's not.

776
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,210
-Humor?
-Yes. Don't worry about it.

777
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,840
Yes, right. It was humor.

778
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,510
That's right.

779
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,180
I'm really curious about something.

780
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,190
Why is your house so empty?

781
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,650
We threw everything out.

782
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,820
The long-term prisoner doesn't need
things he used in prison.

783
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,070
I'm sorry. I was really out of line.

784
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,070
I said I was sorry, okay?

785
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,330
I threw everything out.
But there's still a lot left.

786
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,750
You have a go table?

787
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,960
-I used to play go.
-Go?

788
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,090
Yes.

789
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,170
My uncle taught me when I was a kid.

790
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,630
-I guess he thought I had a talent for it.
-I see.

791
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,590
Soon enough, I jumped into
the real life of go.

792
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:36,770
That means a life committed only to go.

793
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,820
you only make friends
at the go institute.

794
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,860
It's a life where you play go
by looking

795
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:49,490
at the manual for more
than ten hours a day.

796
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,780
That was my life in my teens.

797
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,160
I wanted to become a pro go player.

798
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,000
Of course, I failed.
That's why I'm in front of you now.

799
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:04,050
I threw away almost everything I had.

800
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,550
But there's one thing
I couldn't throw out.

801
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:16,430
This is the manual of all the plays
I have done in my go life.

802
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,730
-May I see it?
-Sure.

803
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,440
Every night I would look at it
to see why I won or lost.

804
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,660
I wrote down the reasons
for me to accept the game.

805
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,740
Then my teacher would make notes
for me here.

806
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:37,040
I did this since I was 11-years-old.

807
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,960
When I look at that,
I can remember everything that happened.

808
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:45,000
That is amazing. Just amazing.

809
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,510
Wait, what's this?

810
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,800
This is the record of my game
since I started working.

811
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,550
-Game?
-Yes.

812
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,890
I considered my daily work like a game.

813
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,180
It's a game diary.

814
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,190
Why does this have more pages
than the other one?

815
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,480
The game of go
is a game played by two people.

816
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,450
But there is a game in which one master

817
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:11,570
plays several games

818
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:15,580
at the same time with several opponents.

819
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:20,710
Usually,

820
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,080
the master always wins.

821
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,630
I found that in society,
there's a game like that.

822
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,880
But in society the game
is a bit different.

823
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:32,090
Those that are not masters have
to play with many opponents.

824
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,680
One game with you.

825
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,220
One game with Mr. Oh.

826
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,980
Another game with another team.

827
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,060
And also a game with my rival.

828
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:44,940
And in time,

829
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,610
I might have to play
with the company itself.

830
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,820
In go,

831
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,080
there's a rule called handicap.

832
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:00,160
When a master plays with non-masters,

833
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:04,070
they start with four to eight steps ahead.

834
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:07,070
But in society,

835
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,900
the masters play handicap go
against the non-masters,

836
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:11,570
or the newbies that is.

837
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,090
The master plays with four to eight...

838
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,680
No. They actually play
with uncountable steps ahead

839
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,100
of the opponent.

840
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,100
But what's scarier

841
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:28,020
is that the non-masters have the same
rules that must be followed.

842
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,980
The same rules?

843
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,110
I must do more.

844
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:36,820
Especially for a guy like me,
if I do just as much as others,

845
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,490
I will not be able to adjust.

846
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,450
Being a newbie means

847
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,410
that although you don't have experience,

848
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,880
you still must do more and strive.

849
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:00,550
How did you come to our company?

850
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,010
I have a sponsor.

851
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,480
He is the president of a company

852
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,020
called Sungwon Inc.

853
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,900
So you came in through the director.

854
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:13,990
That's why Mr. Oh...

855
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,150
Get out.

856
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,530
Get out, you bastard!

857
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:22,410
You have a good sponsor.

858
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:25,340
The director probably
doesn't even remember me.

859
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,880
I've never met him personally
after I got hired.

860
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:33,050
Your sponsor should have helped you
a little earlier, right?

861
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,200
He did.

862
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:38,870
After I passed the GED,
he hired me right away.

863
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,420
Why did you quit?

864
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,130
At that time...

865
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,680
I didn't hide my past as a go player.

866
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,100
At first, they were curious
and were friendly with me.

867
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,140
Then they started to doubt me.

868
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:59,310
After that,

869
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,150
the doubt became the truth.

870
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,150
They thought that I was not flexible
because I was a go player.

871
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,900
They thought I was too serious, too.

872
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,490
I stayed for a year
and then enlisted in the army.

873
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,790
Is that why you kept your past from us?

874
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,330
Because we would think of you as a loser?

875
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,920
You're not a loser.

876
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,250
I'm not from a good school.
It was difficult to get a job for me, too.

877
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,340
But once I was accepted
and started working,

878
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:33,510
it didn't seem like I already succeeded,
I just felt like I opened a new door.

879
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:44,650
I think that it's not
a matter of success or failure.

880
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:47,320
I think we live our lives

881
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,450
by opening new doors until we die.

882
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,870
Then what about success?

883
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:55,950
I think it might be

884
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,160
what you think
of that moment of your life.

885
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,420
As you work, there are some projects
that don't come through,

886
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,130
but you still feel like yourself
and you feel a sense of achievement.

887
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,840
Do you think that's a failure?

888
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:13,140
There are times that even I lose
in a game, I feel good about it.

889
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,430
Is that it?

890
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:19,730
I'm not sure, but don't you think it is?

891
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,980
Come tomorrow. Let's get along better.

892
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:27,980
Thank you.

893
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,360
You know, I have a Twitter account.

894
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:34,740
I didn't have anything to post,
but I just have the account.

895
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,370
Do you want to get one too?

896
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:40,910
On the bulletin today, they said not
to be online friends with your seniors.

897
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,040
Then I'll get going.

898
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,290
How about Face... Never mind.

899
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,000
Goodbye.

900
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,720
Don't look back. Go inside.

901
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,340
I'll see you tomorrow.

902
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,590
Did you not learn anything from our team?

903
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,430
I think it's not the time to learn,
but to use my skills.

904
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:38,970
I've already mastered the basics

905
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:42,060
in school, during my internship,
and during my new employee training.

906
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:44,520
If the basics that you are talking about

907
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,520
was that important, why didn't you
tell me that from the start?

908
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,480
I gave you lots of opportunities
to find your own faults.

909
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,490
Teaching me the basics

910
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,240
is just your excuse.

911
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:00,450
It just seems like you don't like me,
that's all.

912
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,540
Just face it head on.

913
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,630
Senior or not, just go head on.

914
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,880
Hello?

915
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,260
Baek-ki.

916
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,560
Aren't you calling me because
of the report?

917
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,230
Yes.

918
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:12,820
Which part is it?

919
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,150
It's just all wrong.

920
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,610
You didn't input the man/month, right?

921
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,160
Yes.

922
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:28,330
How should I do it?

923
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:32,540
It's 18 million won for four months,

924
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,460
so divide the resume
to middle cost laborers into four.

925
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,840
We usually calculate
4.5 million won per person.

926
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:41,390
Calculate it by laborers.

927
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,600
You left out
the piping floor plan too, right?

928
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,640
Piping floor plan?

929
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,350
We had it done before,
but it didn't work for us.

930
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,440
There is a revised file
that the labor company sent us.

931
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:58,440
It's in the quarterly contract.
Ask Da-in to find it for you.

932
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,070
Okay.

933
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:03,160
Then I should input that into
the timetable and the budget, right?

934
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:07,200
That's right. As I told you before,
prepare it to meet the format,

935
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,870
make sure it's within the file frame,
add the notes,

936
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,880
show the percentage of the change
and resubmit it.

937
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,290
For timetable, meet the format.

938
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:24,260
Baek-ki.

939
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,060
Yes?

940
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:31,850
I'll see you tomorrow.

941
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:37,570
Okay.

942
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,820

DONG-SIK KIM

946
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,470
REQUEST TO FOLLOW

947
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,550
I'm not sure what it shows,

948
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,890
but the world is full of people
that want to show things.

949
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,350
DONG-SIK KIM

950
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,980
Why do people want to show themselves?

951
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:03,490
In go, the bigger picture
influences the individual moves.

952
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,320
It's the world that the go board has
formed, within the confines of the grid,

953
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,090
If the go board is not
confined by its grid,

954
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,670
and life is full of opportunities,

955
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,050
there won't be winners or losers.

956
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,890
Really? I love it!

957
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,810
This world decides
on a part that's called "me."

958
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,890
Just once.

959
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,350
To be condoned,

960
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,650
to be understood, people show themselves.

961
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,960
Man, do I have to do it again?

962
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:09,300
Why is my stock price
always declining? Damn it.

963
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,100
I can no longer

964
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,110
work with you, like this.

965
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,610
What did you say?

966
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,010
See? Mr. Park is still useful
to the company.

967
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,720
Fucking hell.

968
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:57,020
Keep an eye on your subordinates!

969
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,390
-Hey!
-That guy. Isn't he Mr. Shin

970
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,850
-from Samjung Trading Company?
-What is he saying?

971
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:04,190
Let's see if he's a lazy pig
or a lost dog.

972
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:05,900
You don't know shit.

973
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,690
Let's have a real dinner.

974
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:10,780
-Baek-ki, I'm begging you, please.
-Pull out.

975
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,240
Geu-rae, you son of a bitch.
