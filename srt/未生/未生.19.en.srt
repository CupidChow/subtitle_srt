1
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,470
Let me ask you something.

2
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Then,

3
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,680
isn't it like we're buttering them up

4
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,810
when it should be the other way around?

5
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,730
Because of Mr. Choi's decision,
which was unknown to me,

6
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,530
is our company buttering them up,
when it should the other way around?

7
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,820
Mr. Seok.

8
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,860
Geu-rae!

9
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,910
Geu-rae.

10
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,830
What have you done?

11
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,790
What did I tell you?

12
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,010
Get Mr. Seok on line.

13
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,780
Our newbie made a slip of the tongue.

14
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,200
No. It's not like that.

15
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,030
We don't think that at all.

16
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,540
I told you last time,
we just want to be sure about everything.

17
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,960
Don't worry about it.

18
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,500
The recording?

19
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,380
We already deleted it.

20
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,930
Yes.

21
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,270
The next time you're in Korea,
I'll buy you a drink.

22
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,810
Okay. Thank you.

23
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,740
Mr. Cheon, Mr. Kim,

24
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,620
excuse us for a minute.

25
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,640
Don't you trust me?

26
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,810
Mr. Oh.

27
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,690
I told you that I'll take care of it.

28
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,400
Geu-rae.

29
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,400
Listen to me.

30
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,440
What you did today

31
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,570
might have just

32
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,330
gotten the team in more trouble.

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,740
Geu-rae...

34
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,000
Why did he do such a stupid thing?

35
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,960
He really shouldn't have done that.

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,840
Mr. Seok must be really anxious now.

37
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,880
He made it seem that Mr. Choi is engaging
in illegal activities

38
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,800
and Mr. Seok will love it.

39
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,720
Mr. Seok

40
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,970
is not in the position
to make rational decisions.

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,680
If he feels pressure about this situation,
we can't expect what he's going to do.

42
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,270
And you have no proof
of your accusations against Mr. Choi.

43
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,570
At a time like this,
if things get out of hand

44
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,530
and if the director
will be proven innocent,

45
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,410
the person

46
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,370
who brought it up first and our team

47
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,160
will be responsible for it.

48
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,910
Geu-rae

49
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,790
knew?

50
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,920
Yes.

51
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,920
You're trying to save me.

52
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,260
You're

53
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,760
trying to make me a regular employee.

54
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,930
He thinks that Mr. Oh isn't
thinking straight because of him.

55
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,230
I think he wanted to confirm his
suspicions.

56
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,060
I'm sure he was trying to save the team.

57
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,780
He is inexperienced.

58
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,950
He probably couldn't take it
because he thinks it's because of him.

59
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,160
That idiot.

60
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,910
He should have at least
discussed it with me.

61
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,390
Sir.

62
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,190
Mr. Seok has been reassured,

63
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,860
so the matter will not get any bigger.

64
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,400
If we want to reassure him, we need to
show him that the project is progressing.

65
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,070
Mr. Cheon is right.

66
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,740
We'll need to move on with this project.

67
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,080
Review the contracts for the vendors.

68
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,630
Send it to the business team
and have it reviewed thoroughly.

69
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,590
Review the contract from Poshin.

70
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,670
Make sure that the conditions
in the contract are in our favor

71
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,010
What should we do about the agent?

72
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,730
I'm going to see Mr. Choi.

73
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,340
That's right. The agent was set up.

74
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,760
It was not in the clauses
we received from the prior team.

75
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,180
I told you that
the situation changed since then.

76
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,470
I'm talking about the solar energy...

77
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,180
I thought that the rebate given
would be enough to cover that.

78
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,520
No, it's wouldn't.

79
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,100
Anyone can do that much.

80
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,100
We need to have more.

81
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,020
We just divided up the items
that might be a problem.

82
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,280
Just think that they are all rebates.

83
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,740
If we do that,

84
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,330
the profit made
off the project will only be 0.5%.

85
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,870
This means

86
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,580
the profit will be close to nothing.

87
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,710
Mr. Oh.

88
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,380
It must be done nevertheless.

89
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,420
-Sir.
-I've been here

90
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,340
for 28 years.

91
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,850
I grew with the company.

92
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,810
I always produced results.

93
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,230
Always with results.

94
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,310
When the nation's economy was in a crisis
and other companies were taking a hit,

95
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,690
do you know what we did?

96
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,650
I used all of my connections
in China and found a way out.

97
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,120
It was me who always saved the company.

98
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,830
That's how I worked in this company,

99
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,080
and that's how this company grew.

100
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,710
All of this

101
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,750
was possible thanks only to
my business partners in China

102
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,920
who are like my family.

103
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,590
It's not any different this time.
We do it that way no matter what it takes,

104
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,510
it's for the company.

105
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,870
I respect your ways and how you've grown

106
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,620
with the company.

107
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
But please don't ask me

108
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,620
to use your ways for this project.

109
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,790
We will continue with the project
according to our original plans.

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,420
-Sang-sik...
-That is

111
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,050
what the company approved

112
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,840
and that the only way I can accept.

113
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
So please let us continue this project
just as how we planned

114
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,980
The clauses for the agents,

115
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,990
please remove them yourself.

116
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,780
If not, we will not be able
to continue working on this project.

117
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,450
If they get removed,

118
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,080
we promise to win
the second project as well.

119
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,800
I will make sure that you become

120
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,260
vice president.

121
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,110
Sir.

122
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,490
Remove the agents and continue
the project as we planned.

123
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,250
Will that be okay?

124
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes.

125
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,840
Geu-rae, did the domestic vendors
reply to the email?

126
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,840
Yes, I organized it on your desk.

127
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,520
Did you threaten the director?

128
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,480
Are you sure it'll be okay?

129
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,770
He'll accept it.

130
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,440
He needs to become the vice president.

131
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,520
Sales Team Three does work well.

132
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,950
They secured a lot of products
in such short time.

133
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,330
Are you getting along with the team?

134
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,700
Yes.

135
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,910
Why are you so anxious?

136
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,460
Do I still make you that nervous?

137
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,880
So what do you think?

138
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,470
Do you think

139
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,810
that even without agents,
this project will work?

140
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,020
Do you think that Poshin will want
to give us the next project too?

141
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,890
I...

142
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,480
I think...

143
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm not sure.

144
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,200
But Mr. Oh will definitely succeed.

145
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,790
So please trust him.

146
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
Did Mr. Oh

147
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,050
tell you about Geu-rae?

148
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,720
Mr. Park. I've asked you many times
to send me the subsidiary materials list.

149
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,350
You postponed that
and ended up using cheap materials.

150
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,770
Not once, but many times
without even telling us.

151
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,560
I told you that is not acceptable.

152
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,060
Are you kidding me?

153
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,650
Mr. Lee said what?

154
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,070
No. It's not acceptable.
Please find a solution and get back to me.

155
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,700
Yes.

156
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,580
How much did Mr. Sung
take from them anyway?

157
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,830
Chungsol wants
to change the subsidiary materials again.

158
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,840
Really? They did say that it was difficult
to find the original materials.

159
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,800
What are you saying?

160
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,800
Is that how we should deal with it?
The quality will be...

161
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,350
They're professionals. You don't even know
what you're talking about.

162
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,310
No, I'll make them come here.

163
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,220
Hey!

164
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,850
Make them come here?

165
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,060
If you have business with them,
you should go instead.

166
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,900
Do you know what it's like these days?
You can't treat the vendors like that.

167
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,490
Hello?

168
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,450
Yes, Mr. Lee. I heard.

169
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,620
No, just go ahead with that.
I'll get it approved.

170
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,960
It's more important to meet the deadline.

171
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,210
No. You don't need to come here.

172
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,260
I'll get right back to you.

173
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,810
They stopped the production
because of you.

174
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,020
How many times do I have
to clean up your mess?

175
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,100
Damn it.

176
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,530
That's what I'm saying.

177
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,870
It's not like that between us.

178
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,750
Yes.

179
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,870
I know I did.

180
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,420
I know I got a lot from you.

181
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,260
That's why I said I'll pay you back.

182
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,720
I will continue to pay you back.

183
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,510
No. The car is...

184
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,220
Damn it.

185
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,560
Yes. I know.

186
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,150
I'll pay it all back.

187
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,220
Let's meet tomorrow night.

188
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,390
Let's talk then. Okay.

189
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,820
What is happening?

190
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,990
I suspected it. But I can't believe this.

191
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,950
Has he been doing this?

192
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,450
Did you see Geu-rae?

193
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,460
We couldn't even have lunch together.

194
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,750
He's not picking up your calls either?

195
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,590
Yes. He's not in the office.
I think they're really busy.

196
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,130
I think so, too.

197
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,430
I wonder if it's because of that?

198
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,680
What?

199
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,850
They're doing business with China.

200
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,140
It was worked on
by Mr. Ma and Resource Team Three.

201
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,110
I think that the director transferred it
to Sales Team Three.

202
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,610
It's a big project.

203
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,400
It's a project worth
about 500 million dollars.

204
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,120
About 500 million dollars?

205
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,280
Yes.

206
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,870
If they succeed, their team will grow.

207
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,410
I see.

208
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,040
I'm a bit disappointed with Mr. Oh.

209
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,340
I thought he wouldn't work
for the director like that.

210
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,050
I was a bit surprised, too.

211
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,680
But it's still work.

212
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,800
But still, I'm disappointed.

213
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,600
I wonder if he took it on
because of the benefits.

214
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,230
What are you talking about?

215
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,110
Geu-rae.

216
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,320
Don't talk about things like that
when you don't even know the truth...

217
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,040
Don't talk about people like that.

218
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,040
Geu-rae, we were just...

219
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,710
Geu-rae.

220
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,350
Yes. It's an opportunity to save you.

221
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,890
So I'm going to do what I can.
Do you know why?

222
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,690
It's because

223
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,440
if I don't do it now,

224
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,030
I might not be able to do it even
if the opportunity came again.

225
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,200
I think that Mr. Oh took on the job

226
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,450
because he wants to have you become
a regular employee.

227
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,620
A regular employee?

228
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,500
If Mr. Oh becomes a senior manager,

229
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,380
he will be able to request
for recruitment.

230
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,970
So how can that project succeed?

231
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,800
What can I do to help?

232
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,970
What you can do?

233
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,060
-Nothing.
-No. There must be.

234
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,600
I'm sure there's something.

235
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,820
-Like Ms. Sun's project, can't we...
-No.

236
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,030
No, Seok-yul.

237
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,160
This is different.

238
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,000
That's right.

239
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,170
I told you to come to my office
and play go with me.

240
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,220
I'm sorry, sir.

241
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,470
Come up when you have the time.

242
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,480
Go ahead.

243
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,960
Yes. This is Sang-sik Oh
of Sales Team Three.

244
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,830
This is Mr. Choi's office.

245
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,040
Yes?

246
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,340
Mr. Choi would like
to have dinner with you.

247
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,620
Come in.

248
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,480
I asked him to join too.

249
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,400
I was thinking...

250
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,570
I sent him to you,
but I didn't really look after him at all.

251
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,780
He did a good job in the past.

252
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,450
And as you said, it was my choice.

253
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,210
I think buying you dinner
was the least I could do.

254
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,250
I'm not sure
whether he is cautious or shy.

255
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,340
I asked him to come up to my office

256
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,970
to play a game of go with me,
but he didn't even do that.

257
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,020
That's right. Geu-rae...

258
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,230
You heard this before, right?

259
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,560
A move that's good for me

260
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,980
could be a good move for other people too.

261
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,110
Let's eat. The sea bass looks good today.

262
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,750
Geu-rae has a lot of work to do today.

263
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,010
Is that so?

264
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,260
Well, yes.

265
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,970
Alright then.

266
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,060
Let's do it again next time.

267
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:22,980
Yes, sir.

268
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,210
But I guess

269
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,920
Don't you have a reason
to do this project too?

270
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,130
I think you're forgetting that reason.

271
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,800
That's why I called you here.

272
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,600
There are people
whose only focus is winning.

273
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,180
They are used to beating others
for their own triumphs.

274
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,270
In the end, those people end up losing.

275
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,490
You should be a mindset to be
ok with losing and letting others win.

276
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,030
I don't like winning or losing.

277
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,290
Let's both win.

278
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,370
You win.

279
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,040
And i win too.

280
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,560
Don't you have a reason
to do this project too?

281
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,280
Let's both win.

282
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,490
You win.

283
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,080
And I win.

284
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,460
I'll do it.

285
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,340
I'll do it as you wish.

286
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
However,

287
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,260
I can't trust you

288
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,350
like when we dealt with Eun-ji.

289
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,180
And?

290
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,110
I will make sure this succeeds
no matter what.

291
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
So,

292
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,610
give me an answer.

293
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,110
I need you to promise that

294
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,030
Sales Team Three
will not take responsibility

295
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,700
for any issues caused by the rebates.

296
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,630
I promise.

297
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,930
Will it work if I sign the contract?

298
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
I'll take care of it under my authority.

299
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,220
If anything happens, I'll take the hit.

300
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,140
Is that good enough?

301
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,610
That's not enough?

302
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,400
I can't read his mind.

303
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,280
I thought he was using my team
as a scapegoat.

304
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,070
But,

305
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,200
he easily answered me like that.

306
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,210
Situations always change.

307
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,470
You've done everything up to the point
of signing the project.

308
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,180
You've done it better
than the director expected.

309
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,650
Because you accepted his offer, Sales Team
Three would need to do anything when told.

310
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,190
Yeah, you surely will have to.

311
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,960
You know that
he's a purpose-oriented person.

312
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,410
Just think of your own purpose too.

313
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,670
Yes, sir.

314
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,140
Yes. Then I'll see you there at 6:30.

315
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,220
Don't send the balance sheet
to the accounting team yet.

316
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,810
Why not?

317
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,100
I'm travelling there to clean up your
mess. Do I even have to pay for gas too?

318
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,980
Okay.

319
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,320
Headquarter employees will be here
to evaluate work atmosphere.

320
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
What are you going to do?

321
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,570
Just check it and send it.

322
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,130
You said that the final report should have
no errors regarding the use of budget.

323
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,590
So I changed this like this.

324
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,800
Okay. Good job.

325
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,260
Hello.

326
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,800
Why don't you finish work in the office?

327
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,600
You're pushing him too much.

328
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,430
Why don't you quit smoking?
Doesn't Young-yi say you smell bad?

329
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,810
No, she doesn't.

330
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,270
Headquarter employees will be here
to evaluate working atmosphere, right?

331
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,190
Well, yes.

332
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,820
It's such a pain.
Why do they keep doing things like that?

333
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,610
Nothing changes anyway.

334
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,590
Mr. Kang, you said you need
to go to the Finance Team.

335
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,060
Hello.

336
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,350
We're here from the headquarters
to evaluate working atmosphere.

337
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,110
I am Ms. Min-kyung Kang.

338
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,690
And this is Yeon-seo Lee from our team.

339
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,690
Okay.

340
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,440
Yeon-seo, please hand out the survey.

341
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,530
You can give it back to me
once you're done.

342
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,340
The two deputy managers are into her.

343
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,010
No way...

344
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,380
Yeon-seo.

345
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,430
Please take the pen out of your mouth.
It's disrespectful to other employees.

346
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,640
I'm sorry.

347
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,240
-I'm sorry.
-Give it to us. We'll do it.

348
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,570
You shouldn't give
the whole thing to them!

349
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,530
I'll do it. I'm sorry.

350
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,830
I'm sorry.

351
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,580
I'm sorry.

352
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,900
A woman is another woman's enemy.

353
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,370
She's like that because the other one
is younger and prettier than her.

354
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,450
So what if she puts the pen in her mouth?

355
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,910
She should learn how to act professional
in a professional atmosphere.

356
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,750
It's something to be scolded for.

357
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,880
I thought she looked cute.

358
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,420
Hello.

359
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,380
Cute? I think she needs
to learn the basics.

360
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,840
The deputy manager is the one
who needs to learn the basics.

361
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,180
She really embarrassed her.

362
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,510
Embarrassed her?

363
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,100
I have an urge to ask Young-yi
how she's been feeling.

364
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,730
Mr. Kang.

365
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,360
I've always thought that your taste
in women was quite unique.

366
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,780
What?

367
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,410
You like women who are dry and prim.

368
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,490
Tough and cold-hearted.

369
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,160
Someone who wouldn't bleed
even if she was stabbed.

370
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,500
You're out of line.

371
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,830
I like women
who live their life properly and cleanly.

372
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,960
As for you,

373
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,880
you like women who just smile
and obey you, right?

374
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,380
You're the one out of line.

375
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,600
I like women who warm up the atmosphere

376
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,220
and make people around happy.

377
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,480
I think that you like women who are sexy

378
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,980
and women who are glamorous.

379
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,190
Whatever it may be,

380
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,240
the new girl is more of my style too.

381
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,900
She's cute.

382
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,780
Baek-ki, who do you prefer?

383
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,740
What?

384
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,120
Well...

385
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,750
Well,

386
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,920
I think that the deputy manager might be
a bit too much for me.

387
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,220
You see? You have a unique taste.

388
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,140
Really.

389
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,320
Nice.

390
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,500
Mr. Kang.

391
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,290
Baek-ki, I'm disappointed
in your taste in women.

392
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,970
What's going on?

393
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,810
Baek-ki, you've been here over a year.
You still don't know?

394
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,900
The list of your boss' likes
will be your bible.

395
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,320
You laugh at their jokes
even if they're not funny.

396
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,280
You should like the same food.

397
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,820
You need to smoke with them.

398
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,160
Music, art, politics.
You need to like everything they like.

399
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:10,620
Do you know what is above all of those?

400
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,420
Taste in women.

401
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,550
You have to agree with him on that
no matter what.

402
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,430
Okay?

403
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,100
But that's only if you like that person.

404
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,640
Hello.

405
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,060
Hello.

406
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,320
Mr. Kang still doesn't agree, does he?

407
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,650
What?

408
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,030
Right, that. Yes.

409
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,780
He really has bad taste in women.

410
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,580
Here you go.

411
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,040
Young-yi. You saw too.

412
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,960
Who do you think is better?

413
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,790
The newbie was much more attractive.

414
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,210
Right?

415
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,380
You see? Women know other women.

416
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,300
That's why,

417
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:06,100
I'm trying to learn how to act cute.

418
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,520
She's the best for a reason.

419
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,030
She's very different from Baek-ki
who learned emotions from a book.

420
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,110
It's five o'clock. I have to go.

421
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,450
"I'm trying to learn

422
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,210
how to act cute?"

423
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,420
If you can't even do that much,

424
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,920
how will you last here?

425
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,340
Where is Seok-yul going?

426
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,990
It's a good thing
I got my driver's license again.

427
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,330
They are meeting at Han River.

428
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,750
I saw this in the movies.

429
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,760
That's right.

430
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,100
Okay.

431
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,980
Goodness, it is Ms. Lee.

432
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,530
Mr. Sung is so nervous.

433
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,700
Okay now. Stop talking

434
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,870
and hand over the money.

435
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,960
What is that?

436
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,090
What?

437
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,070
Seok-yul.

438
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,400
Hey.

439
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,070
Geu-rae.

440
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Are you going home?

441
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,490
Yes.

442
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Is something wrong?

443
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,240
No. It's nothing.

444
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,410
Okay.

445
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,500
See you tomorrow.

446
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,710
Geu-rae.

447
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,250
How's everything going?

448
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,590
What?

449
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,550
It should go well. It should.

450
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,520
See you tomorrow.

451
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,610
That's right.

452
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,070
Life throws you a test

453
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,990
that makes you worry
and feel tormented at times.

454
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,070
But it give you a hint
at the least expected moment.

455
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,040
Of course,

456
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,040
that hint might not lead
to the right answer.

457
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,920
Sit down. Take your seats.

458
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,300
-Mr. Choi.
-Sit down.

459
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,720
You're working hard.

460
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,520
Let me know if you need anything.

461
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,650
Mr. Kim, you might lose some weight
because of this project.

462
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,820
Keep up the hard work.

463
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,660
After the confrontation between
the director and Mr. Oh,

464
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,370
-Yes?
-our team seemed like we were running

465
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,240
for the finish line.

466
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,040
All we did was work.

467
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,330
We didn't turn our head
to anything else besides work.

468
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,210
-Mr. Oh.
-Yes?

469
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,300
How are you going to follow up
after the project begins?

470
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,300
We will test the samples...

471
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,380
And one day...

472
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,550
Yes, this is Sang-sik Oh.

473
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,680
Headquarters?

474
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,030
Mr. Sang-sik Oh.

475
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,450
Yes?

476
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,200
We're from headquarters.

477
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,080
The whole company

478
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,960
is being audited right now.

479
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,630
We received a tip off.

480
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,710
A tip off?

481
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,480
During the monthly business meeting held
at the headquarters,

482
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,650
regarding the profit and loss report,

483
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,570
there was a tip off
about Mr. Choi's China project.

484
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,450
According to the tip off,

485
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:18,070
we were told that there's a recording here
at Sales Team Three.

486
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,620
-A recording?
-What is he saying?

487
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,420
What's going on here?

488
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,630
The tip off

489
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,590
was made from China.

490
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,510
I'm sure that he wanted
to get out of this game.

491
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,350
Mr. Oh tried to comfort him.

492
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,100
However, he was recorded,

493
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,770
and because of a contracted employee
of a team,

494
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,650
Mr. Seok really got anxious,

495
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,530
so he reported it to his boss.

496
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,530
After Mr. Seok reported the issue,

497
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,410
and it was thrown in the hands
of the manager,

498
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,370
the manager reported it
to the headquarters.

499
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,660
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's something we have done before.

500
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,080
This issue is regarding that.

501
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,670
Did you always work like this?

502
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,340
For that long?

503
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,590
-That was
-The director...

504
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,010
used to make profit for the company.

505
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,970
He explained how he did business
for the past years.

506
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,180
The amount exceeded our regulation.

507
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,680
-If we don't deal with it
-He thought he could justify it.

508
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,310
like that, then how can we do business?

509
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:29,440
-But reality...
-It's all in the report, sir.

510
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,440
Look here. It's all here.

511
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:38,150
In the case of this project, Mr. Choi
didn't think about the company's profit

512
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,950
and proceeded with this project, right?

513
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,870
Is there anyone from the management
who didn't have confidence in this?

514
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,210
Let me ask you again.

515
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,960
You said that
rebates are a regular means of business.

516
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,340
If that is so, do you think that
it's a normal practice to give so much?

517
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,430
It depends on how you look at it.

518
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,640
Did you say that it depends?

519
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,390
Are you saying that this could be seen
as a normal practice?

520
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,180
There are always risks

521
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,690
to your boss's projects.

522
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,820
The team working
on it analyzes the value, risks,

523
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,570
and the loss of the projects.

524
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,650
Moreover,

525
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
thinking about the possibility
of continuous relationship

526
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,450
with the business partners...

527
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,040
Looking over your partners
might be the core value of the project.

528
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,210
Even if things have changed,

529
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,290
China is still all about rebates.

530
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,710
Even if it's not the right thing to do,
it still works.

531
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,180
You can't think only of profit and loss.

532
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,590
Mr. Oh.

533
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,680
It's like we were investing

534
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,350
in the partners that
we will be working with.

535
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,020
The size of it

536
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,440
may be decided after we have calculated
the profit and loss

537
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,400
that our company will take.

538
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,360
Then how is it that we couldn't find
any sort of kickbacks

539
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,490
in the projects you've done in the past

540
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:05,370
Doesn't it mean that you agree
that it's not the right thing to do?

541
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,950
Also, after Mr. Choi's orders,

542
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,620
you asked the temporary employee
to research it as well.

543
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,040
Doesn't that say something?

544
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,220
Mr. Choi, the president is here.

545
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,260
Hello, sir.

546
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,600
Why didn't you call for me?

547
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,940
I just had some chat with the auditors
from the headquarters.

548
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,610
Mr. Choi.

549
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,570
I think it will go through
an official investigation.

550
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,110
This is something
we've been doing in the past, sir.

551
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,320
What is the problem?

552
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,950
You are well aware of it too.

553
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,830
You put your trust in me and...

554
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,910
I was aware of it,

555
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,380
but I'm not sure if the headquarters
was aware of it too.

556
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,840
Prepare whatever you need to.

557
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,980
It's your choice.

558
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,230
You guys...

559
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,940
Mr. Jung, you've done well.

560
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,410
-Mr. Ko, you need to get promoted.
-Yes, sir.

561
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Okay.

562
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,910
Go inside. Get back to work.

563
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,830
Mr. Ma, go in.

564
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,290
No, sir. It's okay.

565
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:52,530
EPC OCEAN PLANT PROJECT
REFUSE DERIVED FUEL PROJECT FOR CHINA

566
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,670
EPC OCEAN PLANT PROJECT

567
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,050
TRANSACTION REPORT

568
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,970
MANAGER: SANG-SHIK OH
SENIOR MANAGER: YOUNG-HOO CHOI

569
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,930
Sir!

570
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,550
-I did it!
-What?

571
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,970
We got the EPC Ocean Plant project!

572
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,690
It's the first ocean plant project
for Korea. We did it!

573
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,940
-Yes! Good job, Sang-sik!
-Yes.

574
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,070
We did it! Come here!

575
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,360
Sang-sik. You did it.

576
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,450
Mr. Choi was transferred

577
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,910
to One Global, an subsidiary
that is not listed.

578
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,540
Mr. Oh and Sales Team Three,

579
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,750
did not receive any disciplinary action

580
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,380
because our team had continued

581
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,510
to report the issue and tried
to stop from taking action.

582
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,390
Poshin Company

583
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,140
stopped the project without our consent.

584
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,600
It was because

585
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,610
the rebate became an issue
and because of what happened to Mr. Choi.

586
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,860
Geu-rae.

587
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,860
Shred these.

588
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,620
The office was really unsettled.

589
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,460
And some teams

590
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,670
took direct hits because
vendors in China heard

591
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,840
about the issue with the rebates.

592
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,170
EXPORT OF SOLAR DISPLAY PANELS

593
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,510
People blame it

594
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,180
on the way Mr. Oh worked

595
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,140
and say It's just simply
the result of what he did.

596
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,310
And as the days went by,

597
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,150
all of the responsibility fell on Mr. Oh

598
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:04,500
Even the strong-willed Mr. Oh
seemed to be shaken up.

599
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,090
And I knew

600
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,800
that this was all due

601
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,930
to the impulsive talk
of a temporary employee.

602
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,860
It's not because of you.

603
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,110
It's because of me.

604
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,620
I told Mr. Seok to look into it.

605
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,540
I had him look into
every single little thing.

606
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,790
That's why everyone got anxious.

607
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,380
You knew nothing,
and I made you anxious as well.

608
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,630
So I started it.

609
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,010
And I ended it.

610
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,600
Damn it!

611
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,850
Stop acting like a manager or something.

612
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,860
Feeling guilty, taking responsibility,

613
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,490
and doing all those things

614
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,700
are only stories of those
who are capable of it!

615
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:26,830
Every time you act like a team leader

616
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,170
without even knowing your place...

617
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,210
You know, these days,

618
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,550
you really get me all riled up.

619
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,760
What do they say? LOL?

620
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,680
It will be difficult.

621
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,900
It's different
from the issue with Mr. Park.

622
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,410
Do what you're good at.

623
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:07,580
Swallow it!

624
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,210
Let's stick it out!

625
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,340
We are the invincible Sales Team Three!

626
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,350
Keep your head up.

627
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,770
Stand up straight.

628
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,970
The shipment contract of the bituminous
coal was made by your request.

629
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,640
We reviewed other vendors.

630
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,440
We're about to start the production,
and you want to review the contract again?

631
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:17,230
Don't you know that verbal contracts
also take effect in court?

632
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:25,280
If it's the bituminous coal project,
weren't they the ones that wanted

633
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,530
to contract with us first?

634
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,870
It is. They're ABD Shipping.

635
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:33,330
Yes. It's ABD Shipping, one of the many.

636
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,210
They want to review the contract again.

637
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,800
This is all because of Sales Team Three.

638
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,430
The rumor that Mr. Oh looked into
all of the vendors regarding the rebate

639
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,180
have spread all over China.

640
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,510
That guy...

641
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,560
It's bad enough that Mr. Choi is gone.

642
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,560
Let's look for other shipping companies.

643
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,730
I'll start right away.

644
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,280
We won't be able to negotiate
with this timeline.

645
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,240
There will only be
Japanese companies available.

646
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,940
But Japanese companies are expensive.

647
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,010
Oh, man.

648
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,680
I'm going to post on the bulletin board
for Mr. Oh to resign.

649
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,060
I will try to find the right vendor.

650
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,370
Young-yi.

651
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,980
I know you worry about Mr. Oh,

652
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,560
but it's not just us.

653
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,600
All teams working with China are affected.

654
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,730
With Poshin,

655
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,990
we had a good relationship with them.

656
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,070
That's why it was possible
for us to do it.

657
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,870
You know we had no other choice
when headquarters came

658
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,700
and audited us.

659
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,040
Since you brought it up,

660
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,500
was it reported to headquarters like that?

661
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,920
Although it was resolved with
disciplinary action against Mr. Choi,

662
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:55,920
you know that
it shouldn't have been like that.

663
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,550
As soon as the issue surfaced,
Poshin decided to stop the project.

664
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,300
That's what I'm saying.

665
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,010
Someone who is supposed
to be doing business

666
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,510
couldn't even work with a vendor,

667
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,560
resulting to a huge loss for the company

668
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,980
and damage to all relations with China?

669
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,150
Read the intranet bulletin board,
and see what everyone's saying.

670
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,740
If you have any conscience at all,
you will know.

671
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,030
Are you asking me to take responsibility?

672
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,910
You know that it's isn't like that.

673
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,290
I'm just saying the advantages
disadvantages of what happened.

674
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,330
I'm informing
how should our company deal with vendors.

675
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:44,970
Mr. Oh.

676
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,380
It's not your fault.

677
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:00,880
Time will heal everything.
Stop drinking so much.

678
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:04,180
No. Just drink today.

679
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,150
Mr. Choi fell in his own trap.

680
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,440
It's not your fault.

681
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:19,030
Things have changed. He should have too.

682
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,740
Isn't that right?

683
00:52:25,271 --> 00:52:27,260
He didn't change,

684
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,280
and I haven't changed either.

685
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,790
Should I make you a drink?

686
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,500
Here. Let me make you one.

687
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,210
With this drink,

688
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,550
Sales Team Three...

689
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:01,260
Done.

690
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,390
Success.

691
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,310
Mr. Oh said that
this is something you really need

692
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:07,900
when doing business.

693
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,230
Here.

694
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,030
For you, Seok-yul, I'll feed it to you.

695
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:16,200
Here you go. Drink up.
My arms are getting tired.

696
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,950
See, it's so tasty.

697
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:23,040
-No. Jeez.
-It's okay.

698
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,040
Let me wipe it off.

699
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,620
-Here you go.
-Tissue.

700
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,580
-Tissue.
-It's fine.

701
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,790
Jeez.

702
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,460
I didn't do it on purpose.

703
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,260
-It was an accident.
-It's okay.

704
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,840
Hold on. I need to wipe this.

705
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,760
-Geu-rae.
-You don't need to.

706
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,890
I need to wipe this.

707
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,480
I'm back.

708
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,270
Why did you come home so late?

709
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,780
Have you been drinking again?

710
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,400
Mom, do you know the taste of alcohol?

711
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,660
I know better than you.

712
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:35,490
Do you want something?

713
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:39,830
You must be hungry
after all that drinking.

714
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,500
Give it to me.

715
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:43,420
I want ramen.

716
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:46,000
Put some scallions

717
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,960
and an egg.

718
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,760
Eggs.

719
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,180
You shouldn't eat ramen before you sleep.

720
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,810
We only have ramen.

721
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,800
Get up and eat.

722
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,020
Your father

723
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,980
used to make his own food
when he comes home after drinking.

724
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,320
I didn't even make my husband ramen,

725
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,860
but I did for my son.

726
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,570
Thank you.

727
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:13,650
Sir.

728
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,440
Hey. Sit down.

729
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,870
-It's pretty cold today.
-Yes.

730
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,040
-How have you been?
-Good.

731
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,670
How are you?

732
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,380
Better than I thought.

733
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:46,100
Getting a disciplinary action
for my way of doing business

734
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,480
at a company I've worked in for 28 years,

735
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,480
was a big shock to me.

736
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,070
They say that management

737
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,360
is one that looks at the stars
behind the clouds

738
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,070
when everyone else
is looking at the ground.

739
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,330
I thought that it was okay

740
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,000
to leave the ground
in order to see the stars.

741
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:13,000
How many people can see the stars

742
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,500
with both feet on the ground?

743
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,170
But this time,

744
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,720
it really hit me hard.

745
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,510
The person that the company wants

746
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,930
to be in the management team

747
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:33,860
is a giant who can keep both feet
on the ground

748
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:37,860
and still be able

749
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,900
to see the stars.

750
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,490
The first time

751
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,120
I met you,

752
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,870
I knew that you would be
someone like that.

753
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,340
-Really?
-Yes.

754
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,340
I really thought you were great.

755
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,260
I even wanted to be like you.

756
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,610
Thank you

757
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,840
for not bringing up other issues

758
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,060
during the audit.

759
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,720
I wanted to say that.

760
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:21,060
Are you talking about the rebate?

761
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,690
It was without a doubt

762
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:28,690
just a baseless suspicion you have of me.

763
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:30,320
Right.

764
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,200
That's why I didn't say anything.

765
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,240
I didn't do it for you.

766
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,410
I was suspicious,

767
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,290
but I didn't have any proof.

768
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,340
Just like with Eun-ji.

769
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,220
It's a good thing I'm still working.

770
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:59,770
When it comes to global service

771
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,480
it's very difficult to show progress,

772
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,560
but I must make a comeback.

773
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:08,280
As for you,

774
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,690
it will be tough.

775
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,530
You weakened the relations with China.

776
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:17,030
Now, it will be difficult
for you to do projects

777
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,160
at One international.

778
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,010
Is that right?

779
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:40,760
I don't understand.

780
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:43,380
Yes. It's difficult.

781
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,260
Mr. Choi was right.

782
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,430
Well, anyway...

783
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:49,100
We tried to go about our daily routine,

784
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,100
but the atmosphere in the office
didn't change.

785
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,420
So take a look at this.

786
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,550
Hey.

787
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,090
Where's Mr. Kim?

788
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:04,220
He's in a meeting.

789
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:08,680
May I take a look at the packing list
sent to Sudan before?

790
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,390
Our manager prohibited us from reading
the reports without permission.

791
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:14,690
What?

792
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,610
He told us not to show anybody reports
when he's not in.

793
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,110
Give me the report.

794
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,320
Hey, you!

795
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:27,950
That was also worked on by our team.
Why can't I see it?

796
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:32,910
I'm sorry. When Mr. Kim gets back,
I'll get permission and give it to you.

797
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,330
I told you to give me the report.

798
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,550
Mr. Kim, why did you make it
so difficult to look at a chart?

799
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,800
What?

800
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:48,550
Are you telling me to go up and get it?

801
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,640
Send it through the messenger.

802
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:56,600
What are you doing?

803
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:02,230
All right.

804
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,580
What?

805
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,370
What's wrong, sir?

806
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:18,710
That's weird.

807
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:22,590
Why?

808
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,840
You know the Laos project?

809
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:28,720
The manager has approved it.

810
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:31,430
But the it's been held up
at the senior manager level.

811
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:33,720
It's being deferred.

812
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:37,980
Wow. This is too much.

813
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:39,560
Seriously.

814
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:40,980
Damn it.

815
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,440
Team Three isn't doing anything
right now, right?

816
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,700
Yes, this is Sang-sik Oh
of Sales Team Three.

817
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:00,130
This is the first time
we've had so many complaints

818
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:01,840
from China.

819
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,780
It's difficult for us to decide
how we should

820
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:15,620
resolve these.

821
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:22,080
I regret to tell you this,

822
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:25,720
but those projects

823
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,550
that you've done in the past,

824
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,600
and all of the projects from Team Three

825
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,640
are being deferred.

826
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,440
The loss for the other teams
are getting bigger and bigger.

827
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:45,040
Are you saying

828
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:50,410
that I should take responsibility
for all of this?

829
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,950
Well, I'm not saying that.

830
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,960
Jeez.

831
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:03,670
A single person

832
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:07,420
taking the responsibility
for all of this is just...

833
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:12,800
Anyway, Chinese vendors are saying

834
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:15,560
that if we have issues with rebates,

835
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,930
it'll be difficult to work with us.

836
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:21,600
So all of the other teams

837
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,070
are convincing the vendors

838
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,650
that it was not a company decision,

839
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:30,110
but a decision made
by just one person in the company.

840
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,200
Even so, it's not looking good.

841
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,580
In order to protect the company,

842
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,920
we might even need to show them
that you have been fired.

843
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:43,330
But

844
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:48,130
we can't fire an employee who hasn't
even received any disciplinary action.

845
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,470
In the end,

846
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:55,930
they want me to resign so that the company

847
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,970
can do business with China.

848
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,270
-That's not true.
-It is.

849
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,980
They are purposely keeping our team
from working.

850
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:09,240
I need to leave

851
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:12,780
in order for my team to survive.

852
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,910
Of course, the company will try

853
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:17,490
to find the easiest and the fastest way
to solve the problem.

854
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:21,250
But that's not the best choice.
We can find the right solution to this.

855
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:24,880
-So we should wait until...
-If we wait...

856
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:27,050
What if we wait

857
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,670
and die of hunger while waiting?

858
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,010
Mr. Oh.

859
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,550
Then, are you going to submit
your resignation letter?

860
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,390
Resignation.

861
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,480
Yes.

862
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,020
Resignation.

863
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:50,570
-Mr. Oh.
-It's okay.

864
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:53,990
It's not something unexpected.

865
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,790
Every salaryman has a resignation letter
in his drawer.

866
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:03,920
We all dream of writing
our resignation letter every night.

867
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,090
And we write one every morning
before going to work.

868
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:17,640
I'm been getting myself ready for it.

869
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,350
It's just...

870
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,350
It's just...

871
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,150
he is

872
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:34,860
what's stopping me.

873
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,640
Go to bed. It's late.

874
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:50,360
It's only a few hours
before you need to go to work again.

875
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,360
I...

876
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,820
Can I

877
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,660
quit my job?

878
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:05,330
Of course not.

879
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,790
That's right, isn't it?

880
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:21,470
Are you leaving? Or are you fired?

881
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,690
I'm leaving.

882
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,230
I am.

883
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:49,330
Okay.

884
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,550
But you do know that
we have three kids, right?

885
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:07,640
What?

886
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,230
At least, get the bonus before you leave.

887
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:12,940
What?

888
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:22,910
Refrigerator.

889
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,160
Television.

890
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,540
Two computers.

891
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:35,540
What are you doing?

892
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,050
They're the things we need
to buy before you leave

893
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:41,090
because we can get an employee discount.

894
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,510
I hate you.

895
01:11:57,770 --> 01:11:59,690
Hey, Young-yi.

896
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,570
Mr Oh, you're early.

897
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,650
Yes. It's been a while.

898
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,450
You're looking good.

899
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,330
I guess your team is being nice to you.

900
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:11,000
Yes. I'm doing good.

901
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,120
That's right. Those who stick it out wins!

902
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:17,750
-Hello sir.
-Hello.

903
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,500
-Good morning!
-Sir.

904
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:23,510
I couldn't talk to you guys lately because
I've been too busy dealing with my stuff.

905
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,680
I will serve you, sir.

906
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,640
You should grow your hair.

907
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,350
I miss your long hair.

908
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:35,310
Baek-ki's hair...

909
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,360
is no fun.

910
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,860
Let's go.

911
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:40,980
Let's go.

912
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,770
Resignation

913
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:23,540
I'm not dying.

914
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:29,930
I'm just leaving the company.

915
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,180
The quality and quantity

916
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,270
of your effort was different

917
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:41,650
from everyone.

918
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,070
Yes.

919
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,360
Stick it out.

920
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,620
How about you?

921
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,500
I have already stuck out.

922
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,960
I want to rest now.

923
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,040
My legs are shaky.

924
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,090
Make sure

925
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:14,260
you win.

926
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:21,770
A problem may seem impossible to overcome,
but it always passes.

927
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,360
In life, we do things

928
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:28,320
even if we know

929
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:31,240
how things will end.

930
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:40,710
Geu-rae.

931
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:43,620
Yes?

932
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:55,430
I'm sorry

933
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,060
for not being able

934
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,520
to take care of you till the end.

935
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,000
Thank you.

936
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:23,830
Mr. Oh.

937
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,250
I've thought about it countless times.

938
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:31,170
I told you that
I write my resignation letter every day.

939
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:35,550
Don't do this. It will all pass.

940
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,220
Geu-rae.

941
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,470
Please help him.

942
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,520
It's a good thing that you're still here.

943
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,320
Hurry and become a senior manager.

944
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:56,070
Then you can help Geu-rae,

945
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:59,120
help promote Dong-sik.

946
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,870
and help Sales Team Three.

947
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:02,790
Jeez.

948
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:09,040
I'm just leaving,
asking you to pick up after me.

949
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,050
Make sure

950
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,050
you get promoted

951
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,890
next year.

952
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:29,560
Stay healthy.

953
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:44,540
What?

954
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,710
Why is everyone here?

955
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:21,820
Don't eat by yourself.

956
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:55,570
You keep this.

957
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,370
PORK SKIN PORK BELLY PORK RIBS

958
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,710
BEEF INTESTINES CHICKEN FEET GIZZARD

959
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,590
Hey, Geu-rae.

960
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:22,430
When Mr. Cheon first came,

961
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:26,060
his hairstyle was worse than yours.

962
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:32,140
What did he look like?

963
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:35,520
It was the same. Maybe a little shorter?

964
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:36,980
He looked like a middle-aged woman.

965
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,030
Wasn't I slimmer then?

966
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,240
What are you talking about?

967
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,410
Have some of these. I was slimmer.

968
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:47,950
That's right.

969
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:51,500
Hyung-chul Byun from Will Mart was fired.

970
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,840
Really?

971
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,460
Nope.

972
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,680
Do you want to smell my new perfume?

973
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,390
No! It smells!

974
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:12,100
That's why you can't get married.

975
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,140
I wanted to watch this guy

976
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,730
getting married before I leave.

977
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:18,820
I'll do it someday. Don't worry.

978
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,070
The one thing

979
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:26,740
that I regret most

980
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,040
during my years in the company

981
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,710
is bringing him to my team.

982
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:38,290
Him? Who? Not me, right?

983
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:40,750
Is it me?

984
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,050
Let's just say it's me.

985
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,390
This guy!

986
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:49,310
This guy!

987
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:53,930
This guy too!

988
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,390
There's another one here, too.

989
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:57,610
Where are you going?

990
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,940
I'm going to the bathroom.

991
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:01,440
-Mr. Cheon.
-Yes?

992
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:04,360
Do you know how silly these two are?

993
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,820
I went to get a shot at the hospital,

994
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,700
and the company went crazy.

995
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,490
It was chaos.

996
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,620
Everyone was going crazy.

997
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,460
What are you doing?

998
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,220
I wanted to smoke.
But I didn't have a light.

999
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,470
You already quit.

1000
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,650
Don't smoke.

1001
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,440
It's hard to quit.

1002
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:12,970
I'm not drunk.

1003
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,060
I'm fine. Why do you keep following me?

1004
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:18,810
Okay.

1005
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:19,940
Go.

1006
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,270
Okay.

1007
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:27,360
I said, go.

1008
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:34,580
Then, I'll get going.

1009
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:37,830
Okay. Go.

1010
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:41,880
Don't come over all the time
just because you know where I live.

1011
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:48,800
Answer me.

1012
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:52,430
Okay.

1013
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:55,470
Geu-rae.

1014
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:58,060
Yes?

1015
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,900
What did I tell you?

1016
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,070
Stick it out.

1017
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,240
And?

1018
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:11,570
Win.

1019
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,080
Don't forget.

1020
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,460
Go now.

1021
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,270
The quality and quantity

1022
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:06,440
of your effort is different

1023
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:09,730
from everyone.

1024
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,440
I'm sorry.

1025
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:13,940
In life, we do things

1026
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,410
even if we know

1027
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:18,320
I'm sorry.

1028
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:20,490
how things will end.

1029
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,240
I'm sorry.

1030
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:24,660
Stick it out.

1031
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,460
I'm sorry.

1032
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,800
Convince me.

1033
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,670
-What?
-Convince me to let you stay.

1034
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,970
What's your selling point?

1035
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,140
You can teach me

1036
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:42,140
because I don't know.

1037
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:44,310
You can give me an opportunity.

1038
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:45,810
Opportunity comes with qualifications.

1039
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,270
Get out of here!

1040
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:51,270
Your team member dropped a glue
on the document

1041
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,400
so my kid got in trouble.

1042
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,360
The email or the messenger...

1043
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,490
Buster?

1044
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,870
Hello. I'm Geu-rae Jang.
I recently joined the company.

1045
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:04,870
Mr. Oh, I'm here.

1046
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:06,040
I know.

1047
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:09,420
Why is it you again?

1048
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,000
I was told that you wanted me.

1049
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,460
The contract, the approval request...
It's the report we need to pass

1050
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:17,550
to ensure a smooth transition,
you need to properly guide them!

1051
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:18,680
Okay.

1052
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:27,100
Hey, Geu-rae. What are you doing here?

1053
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:29,770
Good morning, sir.

1054
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:38,740
It's my first Merry Christmas to you.

1055
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:42,660
Who are you to say something
about my decision?

1056
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,410
You're trying to save me.

1057
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:48,790
You are trying to make me
a regular employee.

1058
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,040
Isn't that why...

1059
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,460
Sir, I'm sorry.

1060
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,750
you decided to work with someone
you wouldn't normally work with.

1061
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,090
Mr. Oh...

1062
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:05,560
Mr. Oh, I'm so sorry.

1063
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:11,600
Mr. Oh...

1064
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,240
I'm very sorry.

1065
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:43,340
Just because you don't see the road,
it doesn't mean it's not there.

1066
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:44,430
I need to do something.

1067
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,260
I'm not asking for favors.
I'm asking you to do a fair review.

1068
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:49,060
That doesn't mean
that it can be a solution.

1069
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,690
Let's do it, Geu-rae.

1070
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:54,650
Can I wish for this again?

1071
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:19,420
