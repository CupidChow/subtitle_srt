1
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,360
Did I work hard enough?

2
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,740
No.

3
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,370
Because I didn't work hard enough,
I had to come into the world.

4
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,170
Because I didn't work hard enough,
I was abandoned.

5
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,590
Because I didn't work hard enough,

6
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,420
I'm doing this right now.

7
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,400
I wanted to show

8
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,990
clear criteria of classification
and effective application.

9
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,950
The method that can satisfy both of them.

10
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,000
And above all,

11
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,340
I wanted to prove myself.

12
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,970
Hello.

13
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,510
You came early.

14
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,490
Do you know a nearby laundry shop?

15
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,030
I don't.

16
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,360
Okay.

17
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,410
You didn't go back home?

18
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,700
No.

19
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,350
An intern should dress neatly.

20
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,220
Pardon?

21
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,730
I don't know how to wear a tie.

22
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,270
Okay.

23
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
Give it to me.

24
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,670
-It's fine.
-Give it to me. I'll help you.

25
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,890
I'm really okay.

26
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,650
But what if someone gets in?

27
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,940
It might be a little embarrassing.

28
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,820
Should we go up to the roof?

29
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,700
EPISODE 2

30
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,450
He's unbelievable.

31
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,080
Did he spend all night messing around?

32
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,870
At least, he's persistent.

33
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,000
Maybe that's it.

34
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,540
Why didn't you tell him
what the problem is?

35
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,210
Why? He won't survive here anyway.

36
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,460
You're right.

37
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,010
Is he preparing for his presentation?

38
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,930
Who's going to be his partner?

39
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,180
By the way, who hired him?

40
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,600
I don't know.

41
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,890
I have a briefing with the senior manager.

42
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,270
Okay.

43
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,270
Good morning.

44
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,310
-I made...
-I saw it.

45
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,360
You proved it quantity-wise.

46
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,780
Geu-rae.

47
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,080
Why did you ignore the folder trees
that Mr. Oh had made?

48
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,210
I didn't ignore them, but there were
so many files that didn't fit there.

49
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,500
Geu-rae Jang, it's the company standard.

50
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,090
Do you know what that means?

51
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,510
Everyone understood and agreed on it.

52
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,760
But if you change everything like that,

53
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,430
should we ask you
when we encounter problems with the files?

54
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,970
You don't work alone here.

55
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,190
I'm not sure
how long you're going to stay here,

56
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,270
but keep that in mind while you're here.

57
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,190
You don't work alone.

58
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,410
NEW FOLDER

59
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,460
NATIONAL AMATEUR CONTEST

60
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,500
By contest, individual, or country.

61
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,090
Or by the various skills of baduk.

62
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,550
By the beginning, middle, and finish.

63
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,800
By baduk players, new or old.

64
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,140
That was the world only I needed to see.

65
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,430
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

66
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,480
But here,

67
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,030
you don't work alone.

68
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,240
Thanks to Mr. Choi,
I enjoyed playing golf with you last time.

69
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,030
Sure, that will be great.

70
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,240
Okay, keep in touch.

71
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,920
-Is your new project going well?
-Yes, no problem.

72
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,250
-Any plans this Sunday?
-Nothing special.

73
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,550
Let's climb a mountain with the director.

74
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,970
It slipped out of my mind
that I have an alumni reunion on Sunday.

75
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,350
I'm trying to let you in,
but you don't seem to be interested.

76
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,190
I'm telling you that you can see further
from a higher place.

77
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,150
-I talked about you with him...
-Then

78
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,320
I'll ask my friends
to climb a mountain together.

79
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,650
Well...

80
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,040
Mountain? Mountain or whatsoever...

81
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,250
You bastard!

82
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,710
Why didn't you schedule a meeting
with a freight company?

83
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,170
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,300
Do you want to get fired?
An intern can get fired too.

85
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,760
-I'm sorry.
-Gosh!

86
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,140
Mr. Hwang,
you should've taught him better.

87
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,480
-Jeez. Seriously.
-I'm sorry.

88
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,530
Take a deep breath.

89
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,280
Why did you yell at him?

90
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,460
You're always like this
whenever an intern comes.

91
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Take it easy.

92
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,920
Why did you offer your heart?

93
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,920
What heart?

94
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,130
It takes him forever
to choose a forwarding company.

95
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,140
He's meticulous.

96
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,930
Right, my situation is not
as bad as yours.

97
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,730
I'm glad you know.

98
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,770
You know? Since when?

99
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,360
-I was told this morning.
-What?

100
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,110
-What?
-Your intern.

101
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,950
Do you know who had
to pull their strings to get him here?

102
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,780
What?

103
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,540
Jeez.

104
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,380
Who is it? Who hired him?

105
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,630
Who?

106
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,630
The director.

107
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,680
Why didn't you tell him about his problem?

108
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,310
Why? He won't survive here anyway.

109
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,030
-I know right?
-We drank too much last night.

110
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,160
What's this smell? Octopus?

111
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,450
Geu-rae, you didn't go back home?

112
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,750
No.

113
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,960
Did you finish your work?

114
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,630
No, I couldn't.

115
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,170
Why did you make a fuss about it then?

116
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,720
I can't find a presentation partner yet.

117
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,380
It's due tomorrow, right?

118
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,100
I think everyone will eventually
find their partner.

119
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,560
Or maybe not.

120
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,360
After the group presentation,
we'll have an individual presentation too.

121
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,820
One problem after another.

122
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,070
I'll get going. See you later, Geu-rae.

123
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,240
I'll get going too.

124
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,380
When I keep staring at it, I feel weird.

125
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,170
Like, I don't want to be torn to shreds.

126
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,760
If anyone can't pass the final
presentation, he'll end up like that.

127
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,490
Then, what should I do?

128
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,240
If I don't want to end up like that,

129
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,660
what should I do?

130
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,210
I was joking, Geu-rae.

131
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,090
Even if you can't become
a regular employee here,

132
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,130
your life won't be ruined.

133
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,970
There are so many things
to do in your life.

134
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,390
Anyway, you should find
your presentation partner.

135
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,010
You can't do it alone.

136
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,310
People keep telling me
how I can't do everything alone.

137
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,400
What?

138
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,300
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

139
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,680
Sort out these countries
by alphabetical order.

140
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,060
And you wrote the numbers
in the wrong spots.

141
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,060
Got it? Geu-rae Jang, look here.

142
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,440
Mr. Choi, the Director, hired him.

143
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,030
He should have hired someone
more qualified.

144
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,570
I don't think he hired him,

145
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,280
because he has a trick up his sleeve.

146
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,580
I don't think he hired him
in order to keep watch over you.

147
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,290
Why does he need to?

148
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,080
He may have hired him
to cause you some trouble.

149
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,750
But Mr. Choi is not that childish,

150
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,010
even if he dislikes you.

151
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,470
-I got it.
-It seems like he couldn't say no,

152
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,140
so he dumped him into your team.

153
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,270
-Dong-sik.
-Yes.

154
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,270
Haven't you finished the estimates
of the Cambodia project?

155
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,110
-All right, Geu-rae.
-Yes.

156
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,240
-Are you done?
-Yes, I'm done.

157
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,120
He knows how to use excel program.

158
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,290
So I let him check them
by price and country.

159
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,750
-What are you doing, bastard?
-What?

160
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,420
You let him do what?

161
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,420
Are you out of your mind?

162
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,920
You let him do what?

163
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,090
-This is not a training center.
-I'm sorry.

164
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,720
-Submit it to me by 2 p.m.
-Yes, I will.

165
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,900
Eat your lunch.

166
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,710
Mr. Kim.

167
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,710
Did something happen?

168
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,360
You have no friends, right?

169
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,570
It's more like your personal diary.

170
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,700
He said I don't work alone.

171
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,250
You let him do what?

172
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,410
Are you out of your mind?

173
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,670
But I'll end up alone because of this.

174
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,300
You let him do what?
This is not a training center.

175
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,590
He never wanted to teach me anyway.

176
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,720
What did you mean by
"you don't work alone"?

177
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,970
What?

178
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,890
What?

179
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,770
What was that?

180
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,740
There were only three kinds
of chador textiles for the summer.

181
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,410
Yes. I'm not sure which one you want.

182
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,710
So, I brought all three kinds with me.

183
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,130
I'm on my way up. Bye.

184
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,470
Thank you.

185
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,890
-Okay, give it to me.
-No, let me carry them.

186
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,970
-Why?
-What?

187
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,850
First of all, it's heavy.

188
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,980
Second, it's heavy. And third, it's heavy.

189
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,820
Do you already have a partner?

190
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,820
That's right. When is the due?

191
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,450
You should decide until tomorrow.
I'm still thinking too.

192
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,580
What about the others?

193
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,580
I guess they're fighting over one person.

194
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,870
Our first priority is survival.

195
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,210
Careful.

196
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,380
Yes, I'm already here.

197
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,340
To Mr. Oh? Okay, I understand.

198
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,910
The projects for this month
have not been organized yet.

199
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,910
Thank you.

200
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,830
Yes, sir.

201
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,500
-Dong-sik.
-Yes.

202
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,460
We decided to handle
the Cambodia project. Proceed with it.

203
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,590
-All right.
-One more thing.

204
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,680
Hand this over
to the mail processing room.

205
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,140
Yes.

206
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,850
Mr. Oh, I brought the samples
of chador textiles.

207
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,020
Thank you.

208
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,190
-Have you already chosen a partner?
-Not yet.

209
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,820
I was rejected by Baek-ki.

210
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,030
Even before I asked him,
he said he wouldn't pair up with me.

211
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,950
-He's smart.
-What?

212
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,040
Anyway, find the right one.
Otherwise, both of you will fail.

213
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,120
I don't care whoever it will be.

214
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,960
-Are you that confident?
-No, it's not that.

215
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,380
Prepare well so that you can pass.

216
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,220
Thank you.

217
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,430
Yes.

218
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
-How pathetic.
-Excuse me?

219
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,470
I'm talking about those
who made a mess here, not you.

220
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,140
I see.

221
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,060
I don't care whoever it will be.

222
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
-Young-yi.
-Yes?

223
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,820
Will you be my partner?

224
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,160
What?

225
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,200
You said you don't care whoever it may be.

226
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,460
I'll do my best not to cause you trouble.

227
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,130
Geu-rae?

228
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,720
Do I have something on my face?

229
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,430
What?

230
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,470
No. I'm sorry.

231
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,690
I was thinking of something else.

232
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,030
What were you thinking of
while staring at my face?

233
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,150
Well...

234
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,610
Right, here it is.

235
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,530
I should have handed it to you earlier.

236
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,100
I should have asked her at least.

237
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,270
Anyway, you should find
your presentation partner.

238
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,730
You can't do it alone.

239
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,780
Geu-rae.

240
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,280
I've been looking for you.

241
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,910
I just realized that I didn't even know
your phone number.

242
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,870
Have you already chosen a partner?

243
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,420
Do it with me.

244
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,460
What?

245
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,510
Let's show them our perfect teamwork.

246
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
What's this?

247
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,140
-Geu-rae.
-Yes?

248
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,480
Hello.

249
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,530
These are yours. You skipped your lunch.

250
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,580
Well...

251
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,710
Have you already chosen a partner?

252
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,960
No.

253
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,750
All right.

254
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,260
What's that?

255
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,770
-What?
-Let me.

256
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,690
What?

257
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,110
Partner.

258
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,800
What's this all about?

259
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,990
Wow, you're popular, Geu-rae Jang.

260
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,920
Wait a second.

261
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,220
Yes, you may meet
the deadline by the 18th.

262
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,140
Bye.

263
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,140
The 18th...

264
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,400
Pass on the samples.

265
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,240
It's strange. No offers for me at all.

266
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,750
Young-yi.

267
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
You can't find
a presentation partner, right?

268
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,710
Do it with me. I'm saving you.

269
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,920
Nobody wants to pair up with you.

270
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,170
What? Why?

271
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,300
Of course, it's because you're unbeatable.

272
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,850
We're supposed to show our teamwork
at the first presentation.

273
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,890
Obviously, you'll be outstanding alone.

274
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,890
I was too busy to find a partner either.

275
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,690
Let's try our best.

276
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,810
NEED TO ADD MANPOWER

277
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,310
Need additional manpower

278
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:54,020
Need more manpower

279
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,400
-Geu-rae.
-Yes, Young-yi?

280
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,030
Let's have some coffee.

281
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,580
Partner?

282
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,920
Right. I was too busy to find a partner.

283
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,920
-But I can't...
-I'm a novice too.

284
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,010
Let's put our hearts into it.

285
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,440
Our hearts?

286
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,830
I'm a novice too.

287
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,960
Let's put our hearts into it.

288
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,920
Team.

289
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,840
We're on the same team.

290
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,550
Let's do it.

291
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,390
Let's put our hearts into it.

292
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,100
-Geu-rae Jang.
-Yes.

293
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,350
Have you finished correcting typos?

294
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,980
I'm almost done.

295
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,360
Geu-rae.

296
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,860
Come with me for a second.

297
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,450
Sit down.

298
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,130
-Have you already chosen a partner?
-What?

299
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,300
Why is your face getting red?

300
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,630
It's nothing.

301
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,510
I knew it.

302
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,760
Everyone wants you, right?

303
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,890
I'm not sure
why they want me all of a sudden.

304
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,100
You...

305
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,400
You have all the attributes
that other interns like.

306
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,480
What?

307
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,450
Lack of confidence, working experience,
knowledge, and skills.

308
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,820
Then why do they want me?

309
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,950
If two people can achieve great results,

310
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,870
it would be great.

311
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,790
However, if that's impossible,

312
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,830
it's safe to pair up with a bomb.

313
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,800
Did you say a bomb?

314
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,880
Right, the bomb victim is likely

315
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,130
to stand out.

316
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,470
Because they want to stand out
in front of judges,

317
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,970
that's why they want you.

318
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,310
Watch out for people who approach you.

319
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,200
That's how it always happen.

320
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,340
Whenever I finished
my night shift part-time job,

321
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,880
on the way back home in the morning,

322
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,090
I encounter the same sights.

323
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,900
Their facial expressions, clothing,

324
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,570
and even the direction
they were walking in were

325
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,030
completely opposite to mine.

326
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,490
I never belonged to any group,

327
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,910
since I became a grown-up,
whether the student or working group,

328
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,340
My desire to mingle
with them was too strong

329
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,550
to open up the uncomfortable truth.

330
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,820
Until now,

331
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,950
I'm still walking
in a different direction.

332
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,290
As usual,

333
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,670
I'm still alone.

334
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,420
And...

335
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,020
Everyone knew it,

336
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,900
but only I didn't know.

337
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,690
Seok-ho, come over here.

338
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,690
Yes, sir!

339
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,490
How many times should I tell you?

340
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,860
Clear and perfect consistency.

341
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,120
Why didn't you do it one by one?

342
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,830
Or consent.

343
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,500
How much should I share with them
till they open up to me?

344
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,960
-What? Hurry up! Run!
-I'm sorry, sir.

345
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,880
Yes, sir!

346
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,140
I'm a novice, too.

347
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,100
Let's put our hearts into it.

348
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,600
Where are you going?

349
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,940
-Aren't you listening to me?
-Because I'm alone...

350
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,700
What?

351
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,240
There's nothing that I can do.

352
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,000
What are you talking about?

353
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,960
You said I don't work alone here.

354
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,000
The company work.

355
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,010
You asked me if I have any friends.

356
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,180
You said it looked like my personal diary.

357
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,390
You're right.

358
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,770
Yes.

359
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,690
I had to do everything on my own.

360
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,860
I had to fight on my own.

361
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,280
I had to take responsibility
for the results on my own.

362
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,530
-What are you...
-I don't know how not to do things alone.

363
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,160
Since I don't know,

364
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,200
you could teach me.

365
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,410
You could give me a chance.

366
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,920
Only qualified people can get a chance.

367
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,760
-What qualification?
-You know what I mean.

368
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,380
Let me ask you.

369
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,300
-If it's because of my educational...
-Can you imagine

370
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,720
how hard other people have worked

371
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,600
in order to step into this company?

372
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,190
Can you imagine

373
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,230
how much sweat, tears,
and frustration they had

374
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,570
in order to stay here?

375
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,490
You're an unqualified candidate
who got hired through a connection.

376
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,120
That may be how the world works.

377
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,620
However,

378
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,130
I don't approve of such a system.

379
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:02,840
Sweat.

380
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,060
Tears.

381
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,680
Frustration.

382
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,250
How much more do I need to have?

383
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,610
Crazy bastard.

384
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,650
Crazy bastard.

385
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,110
Crazy bastard.

386
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,620
What the hell have I done?

387
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,260
-Seok-ho Kim.
-Yes?

388
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,890
You should have told me that
LC cable has been opened.

389
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,640
All right, I was going to.

390
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,190
Don't you sleep at night?
Why are you dozing off all the time?

391
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,860
-Seok-ho Kim.
-Yes.

392
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,530
-Come over here.
-Yes, sir.

393
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,570
Yes, sir?

394
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,870
Where's your report
on the meeting at the exhibition?

395
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,990
Well, I'm almost done.

396
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,450
Why is it taking you forever every time?

397
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,620
At your age,
you could be an assistant manager.

398
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,710
Even though you started your career late,

399
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,340
you should work
as well as your colleagues.

400
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,050
You better be proactive.

401
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,380
You're not a regular employee yet.

402
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,140
Right, I'll rectify my fault.

403
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,720
-Stop using those words.
-All right.

404
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,220
You're not in the army. Such a cliché.

405
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,690
-Let's go out for a smoke.
-I already quit smoking.

406
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,820
I'm telling you to get some fresh air!

407
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,200
Jeez.

408
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,210
I know you're working hard,
without ignoring your duties.

409
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,090
But you should be more alert.

410
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,670
I fully understand how tough it is. So,
I'm trying to support you. Don't you know?

411
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,550
Yes. Thank you.

412
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,640
I bet you'll start smoking
again in two years.

413
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,640
Yes, sir.

414
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,730
You don't have to do that, gosh.

415
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,900
I'm sorry.

416
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,150
You're having a hard time at night.
The baby keeps waking up, right?

417
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,860
No, I'm fine.

418
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,740
Mr. Hwang. Right.

419
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,450
Yes, he's here.

420
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,000
Why did you turn off your phone?

421
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,210
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

422
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,630
Listen. You can see the contract
with Namhae Chemicals on my screen.

423
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,180
Delete the article four from there.

424
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,760
Get a signature from the team leader
and bring it to Namhae Chemicals.

425
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,140
Yes, I understand.

426
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,230
Also, bring your weekly internship report
with you.

427
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,400
-I need to sign on it by today.
-Yes, sir.

428
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,750
Oh, I forgot about them.

429
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,870
I got it. I'll give them
to you right away.

430
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,880
Sorry for being late.

431
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,460
Geu-rae.

432
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,800
Where are they?

433
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,760
These are all receipts. Glue them on paper
and give it to the general affairs team.

434
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,470
Okay.

435
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,520
REUSABLE PAPER

436
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,580
Right, I'm sorry. I'll give it right away.

437
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,500
Yes, right. Bye.

438
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,460
-Welcome back.
-Yes.

439
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,100
-Geu-rae Jang.
-Yes?

440
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,510
What's that paper underneath?

441
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,770
This, sir?

442
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,770
It's reusable paper.

443
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,440
-Invoice and draft form.
-No, you should not use it.

444
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,980
You may glue it together by mistake.
It might spread around.

445
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,480
I see.

446
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,030
Don't throw away reusable paper
without thinking.

447
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,950
You should check its confidentiality.

448
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,070
You better shred papers.

449
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,240
Confidentiality is
a sensitive issue nowadays.

450
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,120
A while ago, there was a big accident.

451
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,750
Team leaders as well as team members,

452
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,340
were called out and scolded
by the director.

453
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
Yes, I understand.

454
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,320
-I finished...
-Take it to general affairs team.

455
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,440
I'll be back.

456
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,650
-Hurry.
-All right.

457
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,080
Geu-rae, can I borrow a glue?

458
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,950
-Of course, it's on my desk.
-Thanks.

459
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,250
Our supply room is always locked,

460
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,710
so I borrow it all the time.

461
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,500
-It's over there.
-Thank you.

462
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,220
Hello, I'm Seok-ho Kim, an intern.

463
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,560
Let me borrow a glue. Wait, here it is.

464
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,040
What's this paper?
Sorry, but please throw this away.

465
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,910
INVOICE

466
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,700
Since I don't know,

467
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,280
you could teach me.

468
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,120
You could give me a chance.

469
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,250
Only qualified people can have a chance.

470
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,210
What qualification?

471
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,670
It seems he just couldn't say no,

472
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
so he dumped him into your team.

473
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,430
-Hello, Mr. Choi.
-Yes.

474
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,480
What brings you here?

475
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,530
DRAFTING FORM

476
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,530
I picked it up at the lobby.

477
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,870
I'm sorry.

478
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,630
I'm sorry.

479
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,720
-It's my fault.
-Stay still.

480
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,860
Do better, okay?

481
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,370
Back to work.

482
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,530
Take care.

483
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,300
Hey, you.

484
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,170
Are you a bird brain?

485
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,390
I'm sorry.

486
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,930
How many times did I tell you
about confidentiality?

487
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,940
Get out!

488
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,570
Get out, you son of a bitch!

489
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,620
Now, you clearly know

490
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,450
why I won't give you a chance

491
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,210
and why you're unqualified.

492
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,630
Get out.

493
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:29,050
Geu-rae, please step outside.

494
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:58,370
Focus on my work. Stay focused.

495
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,000
Stay focused.

496
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,590
I'm an idiot.

497
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,840
Stay focused.

498
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,520
Geu-rae.

499
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,900
Run two more laps.

500
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,830
I'm an idiot.

501
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,510
Concentrate! Concentrate!

502
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,770
Concentrate! Concentrate!

503
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,060
Yes, this is Deung-ho Ko.

504
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,980
What? Really?

505
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,400
Yes, I got it.

506
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,240
We did it! We won the contract!

507
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,780
-We won!
-Really?

508
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,820
It's a contract worth
two thousand million won, sir!

509
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,370
Wow! We did it!

510
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,950
You did a good job!

511
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,620
They're so self-centered.

512
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,750
Congratulations!

513
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,960
Can't they see what's going on?

514
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,630
We won! We won the contract!

515
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,130
Why is he not coming back?

516
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,720
-This is great!
-It's all thanks to Mr. Ko.

517
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,630
-Awesome!
-Yes!

518
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,300
No, all of us deserve the praise.

519
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,430
Mr. Kim, well done!

520
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,350
It was a big project.

521
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,770
You're better than I expected.

522
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,400
This is the victory of Sales Team Two!

523
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,940
INTERN, SEOK-HO KIM

524
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,030
You're right.

525
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:34,240
I'm Seok-ho Kim, an intern.

526
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,660
Let me borrow a glue.

527
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,330
No no. I knew you were good from...

528
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,330
INTERN, SEOK-HO KIM

529
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:46,330
I thought all you did was sleep,
but you really came through.

530
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,750
Mr. Ko, what about a company dinner?

531
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,880
Sure, let's have dinner together!

532
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,010
Will you treat us, Seok-ho Kim?

533
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,180
I'll buy the coffee then.

534
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,470
Mr. Oh!

535
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,270
Let's go?

536
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:13,190
Seok-ho is kind of slow,
but he's very meticulous.

537
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,940
His proposal was so good

538
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,360
that even the director complimented him.

539
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:21,280
Honestly, if it had not been for him,

540
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,570
I'm not sure
if we would ever win this contract.

541
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:26,780
He was a translator
as well as an interpreter.

542
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,990
-By the way, Mr. Ko.
-What?

543
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,450
He came to my team to borrow something.

544
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,580
Did he?

545
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,580
I keep forgetting to give him a key.

546
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,590
Anyway, he's so passionate that
he refused to go back home.

547
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:41,880
He's newly married.

548
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,590
Newly married?

549
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,550
He's the eldest grandson in his family
so he got married early.

550
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,720
He's the breadwinner.

551
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,770
At any rate,

552
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,690
keep an eye on him

553
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,190
so that he won't make silly mistakes.
He'll be evaluated in every aspect.

554
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:00,690
What silly mistakes?

555
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,440
He may be slow,
but he doesn't make mistakes.

556
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,130
Young-yi, I'm leaving.

557
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,550
I'll see you tomorrow.

558
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,070
Geu-rae Jang.

559
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,650
Yes?

560
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:35,040
-Have you already chosen your partner?
-What?

561
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,540
I'm Seok-yul Han from Textile Team Two.

562
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,550
I was dispatched to a factory in Ulsan.

563
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,460
I hurried back
after hearing about the presentation.

564
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,160
Wow, it's cool up here.

565
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,620
I like factories and harbors.

566
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,540
That's enough.

567
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:18,670
Tell me the reason.

568
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,840
-What?
-The reason you want me as your partner.

569
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,400
I joined this company
a week earlier than other interns.

570
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,280
I majored in Mechanical Engineering.

571
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,570
I've won many awards in contests.

572
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,490
But I'm not interested
in operating machines.

573
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,120
I'm more interested

574
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,790
in understanding the principles
and conveying it to someone else.

575
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:54,910
That's sales.

576
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,580
I mean, the world of trade.

577
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,630
So,

578
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,390
that's why I came to this company.

579
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,720
The company appreciated my abilities
and sent me to the factory in Ulsan.

580
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:11,640
Why?

581
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,520
It's more like they already accepted me
as a regular worker.

582
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:19,860
You're great.

583
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,780
I've also witnessed
many manufacturing processes.

584
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:26,610
I've done so many interviews
with foreign buyers.

585
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,660
Geu-rae, I'm not done yet.

586
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,070
Geu-rae.

587
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:31,530
Geu-rae.

588
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,910
Hey!

589
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,520
INTERN SEOK-HO KIM

590
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,860
He's the eldest grandson in his family
so he got married early.

591
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,400
He's the breadwinner.

592
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,680
Did he really...

593
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,010
Did he leave?

594
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,770
Jeez. Even if I told him so,

595
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:42,190
how can he leave just like that?

596
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,940
No, he didn't leave.

597
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,610
-Mr. Oh.
-What?

598
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,700
What are you doing?

599
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,530
Nothing.

600
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,410
Geu-rae Jang.

601
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:41,790
What are you doing?

602
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,460
I'm sorry.

603
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,970
-Geu-rae Jang, what are you doing now?
-Dong-sik!

604
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,220
Yes?

605
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:54,760
Are you done?

606
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:57,050
No, I'm not done yet.

607
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,390
Wrap up things. Let's go for a drink.

608
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,690
What? I'm still working on SR
for the Vietnamese NPK project.

609
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,520
Come on, it will be BL
because they're going to use containers.

610
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,440
I told you yesterday
now they want tramp ships.

611
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,570
Why do they keep changing?

612
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:17,120
This is Sang-sik Oh.
Sang-sik Oh from One International.

613
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,200
Let's do it with containers.

614
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,040
You can't keep delaying it.

615
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,330
Then, what does that make us?

616
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,250
Come on! Just do it!

617
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:33,050
Jeez. Are you ignoring us
because it's only a small quantity?

618
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,180
Do it! Just do it!

619
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,090
Okay.

620
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,800
Okay, do it.

621
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,970
If you don't,
I'll have to see you tomorrow morning.

622
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:45,940
-Let's go.
-Excuse me?

623
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,360
-You come with us too.
-What?

624
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,200
-Well, I...
-Come on.

625
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,890
Let me pour...

626
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,230
Because Mr. Ko won the contract,

627
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,480
are you upset?

628
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,070
Not at all. You're right.

629
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,660
You're right. I'm upset.

630
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:41,910
Don't you think so, Geu-rae?

631
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,450
He looks funny.

632
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,920
-Dong-sik.
-Yes?

633
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,510
You know what?

634
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,640
The folders that he sorted out.

635
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,930
-He did it very efficiently.
-What?

636
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:05,060
If we follow his classification,

637
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,980
we'll be able to understand

638
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,770
the other team's work
which are related to ours.

639
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,730
So,

640
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,780
brainstorming, briefing, and approval.

641
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,990
You can check
all the processes at a glance.

642
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,120
This way you can get it faster than usual.

643
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,870
However!

644
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:25,660
You see,

645
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,870
we can't use it for account settlement.

646
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,500
Instead!

647
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,050
If we could use it at planning stage,

648
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,510
it would be a good method.

649
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,850
It's much better

650
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:49,310
than the company standard.

651
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,440
And you know,

652
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,860
about the glue earlier...

653
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,570
Why are you bringing it up again?

654
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,250
-He didn't make any mistake.
-What?

655
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,580
He wasn't the one at fault.

656
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:16,050
There should be no misunderstanding, jerk!

657
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,840
Then who else did it? He was the one
who handled the document.

658
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,340
That's

659
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,020
a secret.

660
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,980
Gosh, you're embarrassing.

661
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:36,230
Geu-rae, the chair.

662
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,320
I feel like throwing up.

663
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,610
Come on. Are you okay?

664
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,780
Here's some water.

665
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,030
Geu-rae, hold him.

666
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,750
Mr. Oh!

667
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,920
Did you have a company dinner
to celebrate?

668
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,840
Mr. Oh! Of course,
I understand everything.

669
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,420
What do you understand?

670
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,920
I mean,

671
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,090
you should use your own supplies.

672
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,050
Don't borrow our stuff.

673
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,810
What's with you?

674
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,430
You've been always envious of me.

675
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,400
Mr. Ko, you drank too much.

676
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,650
Right, I did a great job. Are you envious?

677
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:21,280
Are you pissed off? Are you jealous?

678
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,200
-What I mean is...
-How can you react like this?

679
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,570
Let's be good.

680
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,620
I want to say!

681
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:41,090
You should give him glue, bastard!

682
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:44,430
Stop talking about glue, seriously!

683
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:47,010
-Seriously!
-Your team member glued our document

684
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:50,970
by mistake and lost it,
so my kid got in trouble!

685
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,100
What about my team member?

686
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:56,690
-What?
-Mr. Ko, let's drink more. Let's go.

687
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:00,110
No! The glue...

688
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:03,940
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Geu-rae.

689
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,860
Just go!

690
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,320
You better get your head on straight.

691
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:18,250
Come on, Mr. Oh. Let's go.

692
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,210
Okay, this way.

693
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,770
The doors are on your right.

694
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:43,650
Hey, taxi!

695
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:45,280
You should go back home.

696
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,280
Okay, okay.

697
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:11,930
My sons!

698
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:15,100
Jun-woo! Jun-seo

699
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,180
-I got fried chicken!
-No!

700
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:24,270
Why are you waking the kids up?

701
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,280
Get out.

702
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,280
-Are you back?
-Did I wake you up?

703
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,330
I'm sorry.

704
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,580
I barely slept.

705
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,080
Why? Isn't he sleeping at all?

706
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,130
Not at all.

707
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:48,510
Daddy.

708
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,050
There you go.

709
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,100
Peekaboo.

710
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,600
Daddy.

711
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,390
Peekaboo.

712
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,820
He's excited to see you.
You should put him to sleep.

713
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,150
-You can sleep now, honey.
-Daddy.

714
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,160
Say Daddy.

715
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,870
Say Daddy.

716
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,460
Say Daddy.

717
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,180
Your kid glued our document
by mistake and lost it.

718
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,220
So my kid got in trouble!

719
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:40,850
Your kid glued our document
by mistake and lost it.

720
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,270
So my kid got in trouble!

721
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,940
Your kid glued our document
by mistake and lost it.

722
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,150
So my kid got in trouble!

723
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,240
...glued our document
by mistake and lost it.

724
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,450
So my kid got in trouble!

725
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:58,660
My kid...

726
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:00,620
My kid...

727
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:08,960
He called me "My kid."

728
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,930
My kid.

729
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,580
What's wrong with your clothes?

730
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,170
What are you doing there?

731
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,710
Geu-rae.

732
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:54,130
You don't work alone.

733
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,510
Geu-rae.

734
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,050
Geu-rae.

735
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:19,390
Geu-rae.

736
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,600
Geu-rae.

737
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,650
I got all the documents, sir.

738
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,570
Yes, I'll see you soon.

739
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:43,790
Geu-rae.

740
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:46,290
I'm going back to the site today.

741
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,120
-You lost a chance...
-Let's do it.

742
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,710
What?

743
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,550
Let's be partners.

744
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,990
The nosy, troublemaking pervert?

745
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,660
Are you talking about the show-off?
That pervert?

746
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,920
Don't forget.
The five minutes spent on this roof

747
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,210
will change your life.
It will be the best five minutes

748
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:33,840
you have ever spent.

749
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,260
I just sent an email
to celebrate my new inter-office account.

750
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,300
"Thanks to you,
I was able to have Gopchang..."

751
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,590
Don't you remember?

752
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,140
I remember having  Gopchang
but was he there too?

753
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,770
-Jeez.
-Why are you doing this?

754
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,850
Don't call me again.

755
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,600
-What?
-When you said you're "working on site,"

756
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,270
did it mean being a pervert on the site?

757
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,480
A disciplinary committee?
Do you really need to do that to him?

758
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:58,530
Why did you support the item
the director turned down?

759
01:04:58,610 --> 01:04:59,700
Mr. Kim!

760
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,740
Was it an order from the director?

761
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:05,450
