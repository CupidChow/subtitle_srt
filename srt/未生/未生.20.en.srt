1
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,830
After Mr. Oh left,

2
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,580
our team regained stability
as he had wished.

3
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,420
-Hello.
-You're here early.

4
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,460
Good morning.

5
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,460
What did the legal team say
about the Malaysian project complaint?

6
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,930
It's under review. They think it won't be
hard to deal with since our fault is low.

7
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,720
I scheduled a meeting tomorrow
at 3:00 p.m.

8
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,350
Okay, good job.

9
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,890
I wonder why Japan hasn't replied yet.

10
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,560
-Hey, Mr. Hwang.
-Yes?

11
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,480
-Complete this by noon.
-Yes, sir.

12
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,150
Many people,

13
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,860
were trying to keep me at ease.

14
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,570
However, the more they did so,

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,200
the more reasons there were
for me to leave.

16
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,540
However, I stayed for just one reason.

17
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,040
Geu-rae.

18
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,750
What did I tell you?

19
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,510
Stick it out.

20
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,090
Stick it out.

21
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,890
And?

22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,100
Make sure

23
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,140
you win.

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,810
Win.

25
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,150
Don't forget.

26
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,230
It's because of his advice.

27
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,690
Even if you think you won't make it,
you must fight until the end.

28
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,900
In the game of life,

29
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,030
one begins many things,
even though the end is certain.

30
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,070
That's...

31
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,740
That's why.

32
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,000
The day that I must leave this company

33
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,790
is steadily approaching.

34
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,500
Would you like a cup of coffee?

35
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,380
-Sure.
-Me too.

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,920
Okay, I'll go get some.

37
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,910
April is the cruelest month.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,210
It breeds lilacs out of the dead land,

39
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,880
it mixes memory and desire

40
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,800
and it stirs dull roots with spring rain.

41
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,380
You feel me? Don't you feel it?
It sharpens your senses.

42
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,930
Does it or doesn't it, Geu-rae?
Don't you feel it in your bones?

43
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,470
If you feel itchy, go to the public bath.

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
It's disgusting.

45
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,640
What? The love?

46
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,360
Which teams are going
to the work transition meeting?

47
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,070
Weren't they us, Sales Team One, Resource
Team, Steel Team, and Textile Team?

48
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,320
We don't have to go, do we?

49
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,490
No, we don't.

50
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,290
Work transition meetings give me
a sense of déjà vu.

51
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,500
A sense of déjà vu?

52
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,250
You mean, Mr. Ma and Mr. Oh's conflict?

53
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,680
I'm leaving first. I have to finish
organizing our team's receipts.

54
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,930
-Okay, go ahead.
-Okay.

55
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,600
His contract is ending soon
and there's nothing much we can do.

56
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,350
Mr. Kim and Mr. Cheon say they are trying
to find a way to help.

57
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,650
But there's a limit to it.

58
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,980
And honestly, there's nothing much
they can really do about it.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,070
But Ms. Sun is doing her best
to find a way to keep Geu-rae.

60
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,950
I'm willing to do anything
if it would help him to stay.

61
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,540
Did you get the lowest bidding forwarder
for the Myanmar project?

62
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,000
No, we didn't.

63
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,840
Since the Myanmar project is unique,
I proceeded with our previous forwarder.

64
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,180
Do you guys just proceed with the work
without even getting an approval?

65
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,890
Mr. Park. This is how...

66
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,140
This is how we worked under Mr. Oh.

67
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,940
This is how you worked?

68
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,020
And how did you work?

69
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,360
I see.

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,400
So, since you have your own way, you want
me to shut up and just go with it?

71
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,200
No, sir. What I mean is...

72
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,660
Let's just do it the way I want to, okay?

73
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,160
Do I have to explain myself and convince
you guys every time we do something?

74
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,120
-Can you get me a coffee?
-Okay.

75
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,050
I've been observing you guys
these past few days.

76
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,340
And I'm not sure whether you're working
or just arguing about everything,

77
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,140
or just acting like you're working.
You know? You guys are a mess.

78
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,020
Don't explain things to me.

79
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,230
Can you just submit a report?

80
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,900
Keep your calls to me short and sweet.

81
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,360
We already exchanged documents.

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,110
So why do keep repeating everything
over and over again, huh?

83
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,610
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

84
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,950
Don't your mouths ache
after chattering all day?

85
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,700
-Hand me the coffee.
-Yes, sir.

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,830
I'm going to do my best to get a competent
and well-qualified new employee next time.

87
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,290
In fact, I'm going to get a newbie
with the best qualifications.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,500
So until then, let's try to
hold down fort.

89
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,260
Go back to work.

90
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,640
I told you to put more water in.

91
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,310
I told you to put more water to the point
that you feel there's too much water.

92
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,650
I'm sorry. I'll bring you another cup.

93
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,600
Forget about it.

94
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,290
Hey.

95
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,880
Why didn't you take care
of the Chungsol payment?

96
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,210
They shipped their products out ages ago.

97
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,420
Do you want to get sued?

98
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,130
They haven't submitted their physical
and chemical report yet.

99
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,970
The product warranty is missing too.

100
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,590
If they said they would submit it,
believe them.

101
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,060
If I send their payment
and they receive it,

102
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,770
will they still take care of those
missing documents? What if they don't?

103
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,480
Then I would have to take responsibility.

104
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,110
Responsibility?
You sure like the word responsibility.

105
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,240
Your parents sure made
a fucked-up guy out of you.

106
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,320
You trust nobody. You're self-centered.
And you're just a chaotic mess.

107
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,660
Whenever it regards Chungsol,
why do you always go crazy?

108
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,120
My parents fucked me up?

109
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,000
-I always go crazy?
-Clear the payment.

110
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,830
Got it? Do it immediately.

111
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm not going to fucking look at this.

112
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,650
NOTICE FOR COOPERATION
WITH INTERN SELECTION

113
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,650
Why don't they just take care of their
current employees first?

114
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,120
Steel Team will assist Resource Team's
urban energy business with Japan

115
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,740
by proceeding
with an additional new project

116
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,790
for the disposal of electronic products,

117
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,370
such as discarded refrigerators,
among other products.

118
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,210
I hope the transfer of all necessary
and related files is completed soon.

119
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,250
Mr. You and Ms. An will assist
as much as possible.

120
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,130
The Textile Team has agreed to take over
the asbestos fiber project.

121
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,050
If the Resource Team provides us with all
the files on the asbestos fiber project,

122
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,720
we'll try to develop and advance it

123
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,260
into a Malaysia export project
through triangular trading.

124
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,850
Jeez. What the heck?

125
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,520
Why does the Resource Team always have
to transfer their work to other teams?

126
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,440
When our business becomes profitable,

127
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,520
a task force sprouts up or we're told
to transfer our work to other teams.

128
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,440
-Hey, Mr. Jung.
-Yes.

129
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,990
What the heck were you doing?

130
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,030
What? I'm sorry.

131
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,530
Sales Team One
and Three are working on a high-speed

132
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,040
internet cable installation project.

133
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,250
But we received mineral resources
as payment from Ghana.

134
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,250
So we're asking the Resource Team
to take care of it.

135
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,580
So why do you receive payment
in the form of mineral resources?

136
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,040
Barter deals are a thing of the past.

137
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,050
Is that not so, Mr. Jung?

138
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,220
Well...

139
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,130
Yes.

140
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,390
But an inspection team formed
by several French companies is in Korea

141
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,930
to discuss the potential
of financing the development project

142
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,020
for Ghana's mineral resources.

143
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,890
And also it seems
a lot of international companies

144
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,310
are trying to win the energy development
projects in Ghana.

145
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,980
They appear to be...

146
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,240
They appear to be what?

147
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,200
What about it?

148
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,160
What?

149
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,870
What?

150
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,000
We feel it's a good opportunity to link
our business with that activity, sir.

151
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,160
Yes, that's it.

152
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,880
Our team will try to find buyers
of manganese ore and bauxite ore.

153
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,970
Why should the Sales Team do that?
Our team is more than capable of doing it.

154
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,470
Is that not so, Mr. Jung?

155
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,850
What?

156
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,430
Then suit yourselves.

157
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,640
Please find us potential buyers
by tomorrow.

158
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,600
Ms. Sun...

159
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,520
That's fine.

160
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,610
I'm going to the next meeting.
Let's end it here.

161
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,650
The rest of you can wrap up
what we've just discussed.

162
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,910
April 21st: Second year since employment

163
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,040
Why couldn't I speak properly
and even stuttered in front of Mr. Ma?

164
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,710
-Is your meeting over?
-Yeah.

165
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,590
Goodness. My fate is sealed.

166
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,010
Ever since Mr. Jung spoke up
against Mr. Ma,

167
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,840
he seems to have a vendetta against us.

168
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,470
Heck, our office may be even moved
next to the toilet.

169
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,220
Zip it. Words can become reality.

170
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,060
The good days will come around,
sooner or later.

171
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,350
When is that day?

172
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,650
The day Mr. Ma retires from work?

173
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,560
Hey, Hyung-ki.

174
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,270
Aren't you supposed to be
in London by now?

175
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,900
I wish Mr. Ma was a temporary employee.

176
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,200
Hey, Young-yi.

177
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,030
Geu-rae's contract termination date
is quite near, isn't it?

178
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,620
Well, yes.

179
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,790
Jeez. When Geu-rae leaves,
someone else will have a hard time.

180
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,040
-And that's, Mr. Kim.
-You bet.

181
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,670
Whether it's an intern or a new employee,
he'll have to teach him the ropes.

182
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,510
And that's only after Geu-rae's
replacement is actually recruited.

183
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,460
Yeah.

184
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,930
When in the world has Sales Team Three
ever had new employees?

185
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,260
But Geu-rae probably won't get
a contract extension, right?

186
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,060
A contract extension means making him
a permanent employee, so why give it?

187
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,190
Ms. Sun and Sales Team Three seem
to be searching for ways to keep Geu-rae.

188
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,400
But really, their efforts are in vain.
They know it's impossible to keep him.

189
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,890
Whoever becomes my partner,

190
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,400
I thought I only need to do
my part properly.

191
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,400
But still I thought it would be good

192
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,280
to be partners with someone
I'm comfortable talking to.

193
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,910
I just wanted to tell you.

194
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,240
I didn't ask you to be my partner

195
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,240
due to the shady reasons that
you may have had in mind.

196
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,750
I'm sorry for turning you down.

197
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,830
Don't be sorry.

198
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,420
Apologize after you get accepted.

199
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,380
By the way, Young-yi.

200
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,550
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Congratulations.

202
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Thank you.

203
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,200
It's sad, isn't it? You only had three
other colleagues to begin with.

204
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,580
Is there really no way?

205
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,620
That's all I think about nowadays.

206
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,000
There's no way, isn't there?

207
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,090
Maybe you can make it
into a company-wide agenda.

208
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,100
A company-wide issue?

209
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,350
The more the better, you know.

210
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,730
What if many employees openly discuss
and dwell on the issue?

211
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,440
Then the company may have to reconsider.

212
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,190
I'm not saying that's a solution,
but it's a start.

213
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,860
Make it a company-wide issue?

214
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,320
Right, according to Mr. Ha,
the point is to get as many employees

215
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,620
as possible to understand
Geu-rae's situation.

216
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,830
That Geu-rae is an asset to the company.

217
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,370
That Geu-rae deserves a contract
extension.

218
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,040
-How?
-Yes. How?

219
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,670
We can't do a presentation
for him on his behalf.

220
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,920
And we can't put up posters,
like we did in college.

221
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,510
And we can't just go to our superiors
and implore them, like in a movie.

222
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,510
Why can't we? We just have to go.

223
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,350
We can talk, persuade, beg,
and cry out loud, can't we?

224
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,470
You know, this is like our last resort.

225
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,270
Why is it so easy
to make a fool out of someone,

226
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,440
but so difficult to get people
to see the value of someone?

227
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,820
Where are you going?

228
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,490
I have to try something.

229
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,910
I'm willing to even try the method that
made me look like an idiot in the past.

230
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,870
I'm leaving too.

231
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,420
I think I have an idea.

232
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,500
What?

233
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,860
Hello, Young-yi?

234
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,150
Yes, Ms. Sun. I have...

235
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,240
I have a favor to ask of you.

236
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,700
I am Seok-yul Han,
a newbie on Textile Team One.

237
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,660
Since I have been with the company
for two years, I guess I'm not a newbie

238
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,380
This is the same Seok-yul Han
who wrote that messy issue in the past.

239
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,880
First, I would like to extend
my rather late apology.

240
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,970
There's a reason I am apologizing first.

241
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,680
I hope that you won't close this message
upon seeing the name of the sender.

242
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,140
Today, I wish
to convey a very important message.

243
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,020
No, not convey, but sincerely ask.

244
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,230
about the the two-year
contract employee, Geu-rae Jang

245
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,360
My colleague who works
in Sales Team Three.

246
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,150
I sincerely hope that he's able
to become a permanent employee.

247
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,740
I believe that we shouldn't overlook

248
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,570
Geu-rae's excellent work performance
for the company.

249
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,450
Although I understand that,
internal rumors are difficult to resolve.

250
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,080
Ever since he joined us with news
that he had a supporter helping him,

251
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,120
interns were discontent with the notion
that he received special treatment.

252
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,540
That's not necessarily true.

253
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,210
We're not asking
for special treatment on his behalf.

254
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,920
We just want a fair evaluation
of his efforts.

255
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,010
Two years ago, we formed a team
and passed the final presentation.

256
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,890
Then he was placed in Sales Team Three.

257
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,930
He was the first among us newbies

258
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,180
to have done a presentation
for the company executives.

259
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,020
He is the Geu-rae Jang

260
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,440
who managed to make the abandoned
Jordan used car project into a success

261
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,860
as a result of this presentation.

262
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,070
He got in easy.

263
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,780
Yes, some employees have
negative views of Geu-rae Jang.

264
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,530
They say he got in through connections

265
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,660
and didn't go to college.

266
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,870
Therefore, when we all joined
the company as permanent employees,

267
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,670
he was only hired
as a two-year temporary employee.

268
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,750
He was also severely humiliated by other
interns during our internship days.

269
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
However,

270
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,670
he worked harder than anyone else,

271
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,510
always putting the company's
interests before his.

272
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,890
MYANMAR PROJECT
SALES TEAM THREE

273
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,320
Is that for Geu-rae?

274
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,360
Well,

275
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
yes.

276
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,200
I'm hoping that it might help him.

277
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,910
I'm trying to make a file
proving his performance in projects.

278
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,670
Yeah, such portfolios are necessary for
permanent employee transition evaluations.

279
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,840
Let me take a look once you're done.

280
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,670
All right. Thank you.

281
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,970
He comes to work with us
but leaves office much later than us.

282
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,430
He worked twice as hard as we did
to make up for his lack of qualifications.

283
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,600
When he lost charge
of his approved business project

284
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,520
because he's just a temporary employee,

285
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,190
he moved on without a single complaint.

286
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
Place a new person in charge.

287
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,820
You know, I...

288
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,870
I've never been more embarrassed
of my qualifications until today.

289
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,740
I feel that way too.

290
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,250
What is it with qualifications that make

291
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,870
one person so different from another?

292
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,130
Why should that person's effort

293
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,630
be treated so differently from others?

294
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,000
That is something

295
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,470
that needs to be reflected
in company regulations.

296
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,180
But transition to a permanent position
without review is improbable.

297
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,090
Yes, you're correct.

298
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,100
But I ask that he must be reviewed fairly
and not judged differently

299
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,730
due to Mr. Choi's incident

300
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,770
during his quantitative
and qualitative standard evaluation.

301
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,320
Please be fair to Geu-rae Jang.

302
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,650
In order to evaluate one's adaptability
to work, basic principles are required.

303
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,610
Although it was difficult
to estimate Geu-rae Jang's

304
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,870
basic principles in trading,

305
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,700
he has shown sufficient potential during
the last two years of his employment.

306
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,830
Geu-rae Jang should become
a permanent employee.

307
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,340
Long ago, he once told me,

308
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,510
"I will sell this fabric with you,
Seok-yul."

309
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,970
Please allow me to keep that promise.

310
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,970
Although I have had my share
of shameful moments in front of you,

311
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,270
I would like to keep that promise.

312
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,480
Please consider my request.

313
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,170
Yes, may I know if the payment was made
for the Malaysia contact lenses project?

314
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,500
Yes, we have completed
the proposal review.

315
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,460
Profits increased two-fold
due to inventory surplus.

316
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,880
Please reply immediately.

317
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,970
We ask each team send one employee

318
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,430
down to the lobby
for college graduate intern selections.

319
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,310
-Well, new interns again.
-Right.

320
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,150
It feels like Geu-rae
just started a few days ago though.

321
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,730
It's good to have newbies, isn't it?

322
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,280
Go and make sure that
they know who's in charge.

323
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,780
Go ahead.

324
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,990
Okay, I'll be on my way down.

325
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,320
See you later.

326
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,040
Hey guys, can i talk to you for a bit?

327
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,870
What?

328
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,750
Do you mean that there is a possibility?

329
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,750
Headquarters will send guidelines

330
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,380
to all subsidiaries soon.

331
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,970
Contract employees who exhibited
superior skill and experience

332
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,970
will be given a permanent position.

333
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,020
As it is an opinion that was developed
in an upper management meeting,

334
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
it is likely that our company
will follow it too.

335
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,440
The tides have changed.

336
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,230
Mr. Cheon and Mr. Kim,
your help is needed.

337
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,190
I will also try my best to help.

338
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,070
First, collect and organize all the files
that reflect Geu-rae's work performance.

339
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,450
And keep it in one file folder.

340
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,700
Yes. We will do that.

341
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,990
Okay.

342
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,460
Hey.

343
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,550
Let's try it, Geu-rae.

344
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,980
YOUNG-HO PARK
SALES TEAM THREE MANAGER

345
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,150
Can I...

346
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,700
Can I have a dream again?

347
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,260
-I'm back.
-Why are you late?

348
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,380
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

349
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Delivery has been backed up.
You have no time to waste!

350
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,060
It seems this door has to be fixed,
so it shuts properly.

351
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,560
Gosh. This is too much.

352
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,360
-Welcome. Come in.
-Can I have one roll of  kimbab ?

353
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,520
Okay.

354
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,320
Can we get two bowls of ramen
and one roll of  kimbab  please?

355
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,240
Okay.

356
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,830
Hey, how is your intern doing?

357
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,170
Don't remind me.

358
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,750
The guy's a college graduate but doesn't
even know how to use a printer.

359
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,710
So he asked for your help?

360
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,300
No, he asked his mother how to use it
over the phone, standing there.

361
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,010
What the heck?

362
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,470
That's unbelievable.

363
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,350
Oh, man. That is so wrong.

364
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,390
I don't know how to not
do things on my own.

365
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,560
Since I don't know how,

366
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,400
you can teach me.

367
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,690
You could give me a chance.

368
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,530
Goodness.

369
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,700
Well, thank you. I'm starving, let's eat.

370
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,450
I'm sorry I missed your kid's first
birthday. I was on a business trip.

371
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,370
DONG-SIK KIM

372
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,750
Hey, Hurry. You said you need to
go back soon.

373
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,330
Yeah, probably.

374
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,960
MS. JI-YOUNG SUN

375
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,760
Yes. Hello, Ms. Sun.

376
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,430
Mr. Oh, long time no talk.
How have you been?

377
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,730
Don't worry about me. I'm doing okay.

378
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,560
I'll lay the foundation
for our fledgling company.

379
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,860
So if you get fired, come to us.

380
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,730
Just trust me.

381
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,660
I'll have the red carpet laid out for you.
So if you get sick and tired over there,

382
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,200
throw your resignation letter
at Mr. Ma and head over here.

383
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,160
Mr. Ma is not even my manager,
so why throw it at him?

384
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,330
Is that so?

385
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,170
About Geu-rae,

386
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,710
he passed the evaluation review
of Human Resources today.

387
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,300
His case now goes to the planning and
evaluation board's meeting.

388
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,220
He now just needs a majority vote
from participants.

389
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,100
I'm receiving word from various channels,

390
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,480
and it seems likely that Geu-rae
will be offered a permanent position.

391
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,690
Yes, well...

392
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,360
That's good news.

393
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Thank you.

394
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,740
Please keep supporting him.
When will the results be out?

395
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,040
Tomorrow.

396
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,660
Okay.

397
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,460
Thank you.

398
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,710
All right. See you.

399
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,600
-No results yet?
-Yes, no results yet.

400
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,230
Things should work out
since Ms. Sun is in the meeting too.

401
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,070
You know, I overheard Mr. Ma
and Mr. Jung talking the other day,

402
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,000
and it seems they're optimistic since it's
a regulation from the headquarters.

403
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,750
Furthermore, Geu-rae's performance
is in good standing

404
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,710
and many superiors have given
their recommendations.

405
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,130
Good morning, everyone.

406
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,030
Why are you so busy all day long?

407
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,950
I just have a lot of stuff
to submit before 5:00 pm.

408
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,040
Let's have lunch together later.

409
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,290
I might have to take a rain check on that.

410
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,870
I have to eat lightly with my superiors
while continuously working.

411
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,970
Hey, Geu-rae.

412
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,390
Your team is proceeding with the Shenzhen
digital door lock export project, right?

413
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,350
-I heard they asked for more products.
-Yes.

414
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,350
Doesn't our team also need to obtain
a Chinese security related project?

415
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,480
Yes, we do.

416
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,440
We don't need your team's approval, right?

417
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,810
Well, I think you will need it.

418
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,980
I think we won't. Keep up the good work.

419
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,320
-See you later.
-Okay.

420
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,370
Hello, how do you do?

421
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,450
Geu-rae, regarding the discarded fridge
regeneration case files and materials,

422
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,830
I left them on your desk.

423
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,000
Since they're all sorted

424
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,460
by steel, copper, aluminum and plastic,
they should be easy to read.

425
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,330
Thank you very much.

426
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,590
Also, our task force team
business report from the last quarter.

427
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,010
May I take a look at it tonight?

428
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,930
Sure. Baek-ki said he needed it, so
I already gave it to him this morning.

429
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,010
Thank you.

430
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,930
Geu-rae, let's go
for a drink one of these days.

431
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,180
It would be my pleasure. Thank you.

432
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,580
Where are those Malaysia files?

433
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,250
Ms. Sun is coming.

434
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,390
What is this?

435
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,390
I received my company email
and just sent it as a commemoration.

436
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,270
I'm sorry. Really.

437
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,530
This is why I love being a trading man.

438
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,820
Congratulations.

439
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,230
Give me some respect!

440
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,640
Speak for yourself!

441
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,080
What?

442
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,210
Everyone is saying whatever they want.

443
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,920
Why can't you say anything?

444
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,590
You know, I would like to get to know

445
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,090
you better, Geu-rae.

446
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,990
Since you're already in our team,

447
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,990
just hang in there by all means.

448
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,490
Hang in there, and you'll be successful.

449
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,500
Hang in there,

450
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,670
then you'll somehow step closer
to a complete life.

451
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,130
We all have

452
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,090
an incomplete life so far.

453
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,720
Okay.

454
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,300
The contract for the Vietnam helmet
project has arrived.

455
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,470
In order to test this helmet,
you got harassed

456
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,390
by the chicken restaurant owner
for an entire month.

457
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,640
The point was to find a Korean product
that could compete against a Japan one.

458
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,230
And without actually trying it out, there
is no way to convince Vietnamese buyers.

459
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,780
The lightness, strength, ventilation
system and air resistance.

460
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,280
These guys nitpick on everything.

461
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,070
Okay, I got it.
You're the real export master.

462
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,910
We got the contract, thanks to you.

463
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,990
And it's our company's best performing
project yet.

464
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,120
The Vietnam helmet export project.

465
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,670
Mr. Chung-ki Moon has followed us.

466
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,670
What? What did you say?

467
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,290
The Mecca cellphone!

468
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,880
Make it a success this time too.

469
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,230
I can't do it.

470
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,150
Hey, are you disrespecting me
because I'm a salary-earning president?

471
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,030
You're the ones who called me in to do
the job. Then why don't you listen?

472
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,820
What? Are you flexing your power because
you and Sang-hyup Kim are co-owners?

473
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:47,990
Do you know I was leading a comfortable
life working at One Aluminum,

474
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,910
getting off from work at 6:00 p.m. daily?

475
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,840
It's good.

476
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,090
It's a good project item.

477
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,630
How is it?

478
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,050
It's pretty good, isn't it?

479
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,680
The business plan is appealing.

480
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,310
It's good.

481
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,900
Let's do business together
as a partnership.

482
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,280
Let's do it.

483
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,820
But let's make someone else the president.

484
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,110
It's not you nor me.

485
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,280
What?

486
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,660
Let's make
Mr. Boo-ryeon Kim the president.

487
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,620
Boo-ryeon Kim?

488
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,500
Really?

489
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,500
That cold calculating guy?

490
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,420
He's a fucking aggressive perfectionist!

491
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,760
If you agree, we're partners.

492
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,760
If you disagree, I'm out.

493
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,600
Getting off from work on time is
really important to office workers.

494
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,890
I know you've been working
so late every day.

495
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,110
And what's with the 50-50 nonsense?

496
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,440
I invested 51%
and Sang-hyup Kim invested 49%.

497
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,530
This company always has to be run

498
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,990
with this ownership share division.

499
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,320
Okay, so have 51% shares!

500
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,700
Do the Mecca phone project
while I'm asking nicely.

501
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,160
Damn that Chung-ki Moon!

502
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,710
Having loyalty even though I don't mind
if he has no loyalty or not!

503
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,790
Is this for real? Jeez.

504
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,760
Hey Mr. Kim.

505
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,340
Come quickly to the office
and talk to our president.

506
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,480
JUNE 13TH: DRINKING MILK DAY

507
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,480
The milk is almost ready.

508
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,270
It's time to drink it.

509
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,400
I'll be visiting MyungJin C&C.

510
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,780
Okay. Keep up the good work.

511
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,910
-Hello?
- Hello?

512
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,540
Hey, my youngest son!

513
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,290
Daddy, buy me some chicken!

514
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Half seasoned spicy and half fried, right?

515
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,960
Hand me the phone.

516
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,420
Clean up here, okay?

517
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:13,260
Damn. Although you have changed companies,
but why do you come home late like before?

518
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,060
You said you would reflect
on your life at your new company.

519
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,770
You promised to make up for lost time
and talk more with the kids.

520
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,860
You also promised a trip to Jeju Island.

521
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,230
But we still haven't gone.

522
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,320
And what about the camping trip?

523
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,200
You also promised to fix the curtain rod.

524
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,030
But for the last four days, you have just
ran out the door every morning!

525
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,330
So, what time are you coming home?

526
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,120
I'll be pretty late since I have
three client companies to visit.

527
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,250
Okay, I'll have dinner on my own.

528
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,130
Okay, got it.

529
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,280
You said, Martin arrived from Sao Paulo.

530
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,530
What? I must have gotten it wrong.

531
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,540
Go to the airport and pick him up.

532
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,960
I was on a work trip near the airport
and could have picked him up after lunch.

533
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,460
But you said he already arrived
at our office.

534
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,260
I came as fast as possible
without eating lunch.

535
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,630
Did you? I didn't know.

536
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,590
You should have told me.

537
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,760
Still not leaving?

538
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,070
Seok-yul, you can't go on vacation.

539
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,190
We have an office security session.

540
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,660
What session? I already checked.

541
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,080
It just came up. Push your vacation back.

542
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,750
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

543
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,380
I explained myself clearly,
and Mr. Moon already approved it.

544
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,550
It's my father's 60th birthday,
and we'll have a family vacation.

545
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,760
How do I put off my father's birthday?

546
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,300
Who said you could go on vacation
at this time of year? You idiot.

547
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,390
Are you shouting at me right now?

548
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,400
If I tell you to put it off, put it off!

549
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,820
Mr. Moon is going on a business trip
in your behalf. So the date stands!

550
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,410
Hello.

551
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,410
Okay, yes.

552
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,370
Hey, I have some time. Let's have a drink.

553
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,750
Okay, got it.

554
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,600
Jun-sik Sung of Textile Team One

555
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,690
is having an extramarital affair

556
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,150
with Chungsol's Kyung-sun Lee.

557
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,860
This act has created major setbacks
with business proceedings,

558
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,400
so therefore please investigate.

559
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,450
Shit.

560
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,540
Yes, Mom.

561
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,790
I'm sorry that I can't be there.

562
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,920
It's just that I'm so busy at work.

563
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,590
Absolutely. I earn all the money in Seoul.

564
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,140
Yes.

565
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:07,100
I know Dad's hurt by this.
May I talk with him for a minute?

566
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,140
What?

567
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,400
He won't talk to me?

568
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,110
Come on.

569
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,780
Have a pleasant trip
in the tropical country.

570
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,030
I'll absolutely go next year. I promise.

571
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,660
Yes, I got it. Keep safe.

572
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,220
You miserable piece of shit.

573
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,850
Why didn't you just pocket
the leftover money?

574
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,610
Then it would have been easier for me
to tattle on you.

575
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,490
Some private life you have...

576
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,800
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
But is there a Jun-sik Sung here?

577
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,180
-That's him.
-There? In the white shirt?

578
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,520
Thank you.

579
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,900
Hello, are you Jun-sik Sung?

580
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,650
-Yes, that's me.
-You're him?

581
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:43,610
Yes.

582
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,410
That hurt!

583
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,910
Hey, are you Jun-sik Sung?

584
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,290
-Hey, who the fuck are you?
-Who are you?

585
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,790
You know Kyung-sun Lee, don't you?

586
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,330
What? Ms. Lee at Chungsol?

587
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,090
Yes. Ms. Lee at Chungsol Textiles.

588
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,460
She's a manager at one of our client
companies. What about her?

589
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,630
Who the hell are you?

590
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,550
Who am I? Me?

591
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,680
Who do you think I am?

592
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,350
Who?

593
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,890
You fucker...

594
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,190
What did you do with my wife?

595
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,360
What the hell are talking about?

596
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,400
I knew you would try
to weasel your way out.

597
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,860
So I took pictures!

598
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,490
Look here. This is you kissing, isn't it?

599
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,950
You still don't know?
You really don't know?

600
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,540
-I think it's me.
-Look closer! You think it's you?

601
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,160
Hey, you little jerk.

602
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,500
You fucking piece of shit.

603
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,750
You fucking wife thief! Lift your chin up!

604
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,500
I'm so sorry.

605
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,630
-Come here. Get your ass over here now!
-Hey, Mr. Moon.

606
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,220
-Seok-yul! Help!
-Trying to run away? Get over here!

607
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,550
Are you sorry or are you not?

608
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,760
-I'm so sorry, sir.
-Now, you're sorry?

609
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,140
Now, you're sorry?

610
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,180
Please calm down, sir.
You can't be doing this here.

611
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,650
How far did you go?

612
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,940
How far did you go?
Did you have sex with her?

613
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
You piece of shit...

614
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,570
Zip it. I don't want to know.

615
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,740
-I'm sincerely sorry.
-Shut up and come here!

616
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:09,990
Come here!

617
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,740
Come here! To this table!

618
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,700
You fucking bastard! Get back here.

619
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,540
I said I'm sorry.

620
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,460
I'm going to leave after I kill you!

621
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,460
Get your ass back over here.

622
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,800
I am really sorry.

623
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,260
You fucking piece of shit!

624
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,470
Give me back everything
that my wife bought you.

625
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,350
-This watch...
-Return everything!

626
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,060
This watch.

627
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,850
And these shoes.

628
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,900
And wait a minute, these socks too!

629
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,520
-The necktie too.
-Not all that crap!

630
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,190
Are you fucking kidding me?

631
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,980
The car! The car keys!

632
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,110
-What? A car?
-Here you go.

633
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,370
-A car?
-Yes, car keys. But this is actually mine!

634
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,450
You son of a bitch!

635
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:57,200
No, here you go. I'm really sorry.

636
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,960
I really am...

637
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,120
BMW?

638
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,880
Hey, you bastard!

639
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,630
You can't be doing this here.

640
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,880
Hey mister,
has your wife ever had an affair?

641
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,630
-No.
-See? You don't get what I feel. Hey you!

642
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,570
Why do you live this way?

643
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,240
Shit.

644
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:21,330
You should have brought me some
wet tissues, you insensitive shit.

645
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,210
-Hey, Baek-ki.
-Yes?

646
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:34,380
Your performance for this quarter exceeded
expectations by 150%.

647
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,090
Thank you.

648
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,600
You're going to catch Mr. Kang soon.

649
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,180
-No way, sir.
-You should watch out, Mr. Kang.

650
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,640
Congratulations, Baek-ki.

651
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,690
Thank you.

652
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,520
By the way, this...

653
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,110
This is a printout of the e-mail
we need to send to Germany,

654
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,910
and you didn't revise
the word errors I had pointed out.

655
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,030
Mr. Kang.

656
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,660
The word sie you see here

657
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,960
is supposed to be written
with a capital S.

658
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,330
Because we need to use the honorific form
in this particular sentence.

659
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,750
We do?

660
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,130
Yes.

661
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,470
By the way, Mr. Kang.

662
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,810
There is something I forgot
to mention the other day.

663
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,480
You know, in German,

664
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,690
on how to pronounce the letter W.

665
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,940
You said to think of it as

666
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,070
taking a toothbrush and putting it too far
down your throat that you retch.

667
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,030
And then use the retch sound
to verbalize the letter W.

668
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,330
-Yes, I did.
-Right.

669
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,160
But actually,

670
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,040
it should sound like

671
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,840
you're popping out condensed air

672
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,760
from your mouth and not your nose.

673
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,800
Like this,  wa .

674
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,550
This is the correct way to pronounce it.

675
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,310
So...

676
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,070
Wasser.

677
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,480
Wagen.

678
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,740
Weis.

679
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:20,610
Wa...

680
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:27,910
Is that so?

681
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,130
The German language academy I went
to taught it the other way.

682
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,590
Which academy did you go to?

683
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,760
The Wahr German language academy.

684
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,470
Okay.

685
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,980
The tutor there is from my college.

686
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:00,030
I won't make it to lunch.

687
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,620
You don't have the stomach to taste it?

688
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,910
Well, you know.

689
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:12,500
Hey, you got over watching horror movies.

690
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,170
So let's continue your progress.

691
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,670
If you can't eat it, I'll take it.

692
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,380
Didn't you say you were too busy
for lunch?

693
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,800
I was so starving that I finished work
in a heartbeat.

694
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,440
Is Mr. Sung okay?

695
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:35,650
Crying shit, bloody nose, all beaten up,
and the humiliation. He's a disgrace!

696
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:39,030
Will he be able to continue working
at the company?

697
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,400
Since he's a psychopath, absolutely.
But I want to know...

698
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:43,910
When did you go watch movies together?

699
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,280
I like watching movies too.

700
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,500
You shouldn't discriminate colleagues.

701
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,830
Do you like horror movies?

702
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:54,670
What? Why watch horror movies when
there are so many other genres to watch?

703
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,300
I miss Geu-rae.

704
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,930
Since four became three,

705
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,640
symmetry has been destroyed! Get it?

706
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,680
It's crap.

707
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,440
If the subject is an item,
use the active form.

708
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:19,690
If the subject is a person,
use the passive form.

709
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,330
You know our Mr. Park?

710
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:32,080
He opened a new restaurant

711
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:36,170
and is searching for a manager.

712
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:37,880
Do you want the job?

713
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,130
No. Tell him thanks, but no thanks.

714
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,550
But do you have any other options?

715
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,390
I'm searching. And I have to attend
the Chinese language academy.

716
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,760
Is your Chinese any better?

717
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,060
Try speaking a few words to me.

718
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,060
Ni hao.

719
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:02,110
How can you talk to your mother like that?
You little brat.

720
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,690
Forget it.

721
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,950
I can't teach you
since you don't know anything.

722
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,210
Yes? Young-yi.

723
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:20,670
Hey, Young-yi.

724
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,960
Hey, you're here.

725
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,260
It's been three weeks.

726
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,590
Yes.

727
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:31,810
It feels like three years have passed
since we used to meet every day.

728
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,350
You didn't even have a farewell party.

729
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,190
And you left just like that.

730
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:44,990
I know you probably did it to detach
yourself quickly and move on.

731
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,320
But those you left behind felt guilty
over your departure.

732
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,870
No, that's not why I left quietly.

733
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:54,080
You know, after you left, Seok-yul

734
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,330
doesn't even come down to our floor
since you're not around.

735
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,880
The company hired new interns.

736
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,460
But none of them have that "it" factor

737
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,630
like you had.

738
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:09,510
What?

739
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,390
Hey, they're all here.

740
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,020
Hey Geu-rae. Long time no see.

741
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,310
-Hey, Geu-rae.
-Hey Seok-yul.

742
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,320
-I wish you work with us .
-Oh jeez.

743
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,110
-Come on. Hold up.
-Why? What?

744
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,190
What? Mine?

745
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,280
-Drink it if you get tipsy.
-Thanks.

746
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,240
-What about me?
-And me?

747
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,540
I'm jobless, you know.

748
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,710
It's great to see you all.

749
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,220
You know, I want to leave your heart,
mind, and soul,

750
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,390
but I keep lingering.

751
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,640
-Then you can leave forever today.
-Don't say that.

752
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,770
Geu-rae's heart isn't some place, where
you can just waltz in and out of.

753
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,150
What's wrong with you guys?

754
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,990
Hey, Geu-rae. I want to know
what rank am I in your heart?

755
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:10,400
Am I just an employee or manager?

756
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,280
-Come on. Stop the nonsense.
-Cut it out.

757
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,990
This isn't funny?

758
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:18,250
Hey.

759
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:21,250
Hasn't Mr. Oh called to hire you?

760
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,170
From Mr. Oh's point of view,

761
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:30,340
maybe he thinks it's too early to ask
since his new company is still unstable.

762
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,430
That makes sense.
Adventure and risk could be a burden.

763
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,930
Maybe that's what he thinks.

764
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,270
Why don't you try calling him first?

765
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,560
What?

766
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,150
Yes, try it and just say hello.

767
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,360
Geu-rae.

768
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,580
A place like a company

769
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:00,250
isn't a place you can just go in
and come out as you please, right?

770
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,750
Just like how my love
for you can't get in and out as I please.

771
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,340
-Hey, cut it out.
-Stop it, man.

772
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,420
Seok-yul. Just put this in your mouth.

773
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,420
-Another toast.
-Things never change, do they?

774
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,330
You're happily humming

775
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,210
because everyone is working
and you're not?

776
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:52,840
Mr. Oh.

777
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,050
How did you find my address?

778
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,470
You have settled down, haven't you?

779
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,390
What?

780
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,310
It's already been three weeks.

781
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,100
The milk is ready.

782
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:12,320
You already have shirts, a necktie
and a suit.

783
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:14,490
And a briefcase.

784
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,070
And formal shoes.

785
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,830
You can show up for work immediately.

786
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,920
Yes. Mr. Hong, come on.

787
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,760
You can't just say the subsidiary
materials are not transshipped yet.

788
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,550
They wouldn't complete the payment
because of a complaint.

789
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,020
You keep insisting you destroyed
the picture of the products,

790
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:44,850
but who would believe that?

791
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,020
That's what I mean.

792
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,310
This is Geun-young Kim,
an intern for Sales Team Three.

793
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,150
Hello?

794
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:57,650
Dong-sik.

795
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,280
Didn't you complete the payment
for the Philippines timber project?

796
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,290
Come on, be quick!

797
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,910
Why do they keep calling my team?

798
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,460
-Gosh.
-Got it, sir.

799
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,130
This is Dong-sik Kim of Sales Team Three.

800
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,048
Yes, sir.

801
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,790
The meeting with Dasun Chemical tomorrow?

802
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,040
Please wait.

803
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,480
Yes, right.

804
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:32,360
Right. I reserved the restaurant
Hwaryun at five o'clock.

805
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,400
I understand, sir. Bye.

806
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,970
Nowadays,
I feel like time goes by too slowly.

807
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,390
It used to go by so fast.

808
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,350
No fun.

809
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,150
Are you still trying to find fun at work?

810
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:12,780
I guess so.

811
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,450
Drink it.

812
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,120
What?

813
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,564
-We need to drink it.
-Whatever...

814
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,330
Why...

815
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,550
Why do I feel lonely?

816
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:13,810
It's weird. This picture was put face down
at One International, too.

817
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,190
-Hello, sir.
-Yes.

818
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,020
-I'm back.
-Hello.

819
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,230
-The document is ready, sir.
-Alright.

820
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,490
Did you send the invoice, packing list,
bill of lading for the Uzbekistan project?

821
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,030
I sent them two hours ago.

822
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,200
-By the way, sir.
-Yes?

823
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,500
I've wondered about this for a long time.

824
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,130
What's that?

825
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,710
I'm busy. Tell me.

826
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,460
Why do you keep putting
your family picture face down?

827
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,380
What?

828
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,380
Because my wife is noisy.

829
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:50,470
You haven't heard my wife nagging yet.

830
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,220
There's just no end to my wife's nagging.

831
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:56,730
When her nagging gets out of control,
I go numb and my soul is crushed.

832
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:58,310
I see.

833
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,150
Do you really understand how I feel?

834
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:08,410
How's it going with our job posting
for an experienced employee?

835
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,450
The number of hits is increasing,
but no one applied yet.

836
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:12,950
Well, you know...

837
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:15,950
A young internship program.
Shall we use that program?

838
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,750
Thanks to deregulation, small business
can have the benefit from the program.

839
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,880
Really? I'll look into it.

840
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,960
All right.

841
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,390
I didn't mean to throw the door open.

842
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,680
Is this my station?

843
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,390
Is this a registered trading firm
in the trading association?

844
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,020
What should I do first?

845
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,690
Hey, Mr. Kim!

846
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,570
No, Mr. President. Hello.

847
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,490
I already looked
around this whole building.

848
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:53,280
The rooftop just sucks. So disappointing.

849
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,080
Geu-rae! Delete the ad
on the online job site quickly.

850
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,540
No more fun working on the 15th floor.
I'll quit. Delete it, hurry!

851
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,120
Hey, what are you doing?

852
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,840
We follow the standard procedure, bastard!
We'll properly hire people.

853
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,170
What kind of standard procedure?

854
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,090
You said, be radical.

855
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,630
He also came through connections.

856
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,550
Come on. What's wrong?

857
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:18,730
Only Geu-rae can be radical?
But what about me?

858
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:20,850
-Accept me!
-No.

859
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,900
-Accept me please!
-No.

860
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:26,190
Where are you going, you punk?
Don't do that. Hey...

861
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,570
Come to me!

862
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,570
Wow!

863
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:37,580
I got a little nervous.

864
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,870
Get back to work!

865
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,510
What? Jin-sang Seo?

866
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:56,050
Jin-sang Seo stole the samples of
cellphone case from the factory in China.

867
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,140
What are you talking about?

868
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,060
The metal cellphone case
that we contracted with?

869
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,020
-Yes.
-Where is he? Can we find him?

870
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,730
-Do you know where did he go?
-Jeez, that honey swindler.

871
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,190
We're tracking him down now.

872
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,230
Our expat is looking into it
at the Chinese immigration office.

873
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,820
It won't be hard to locate him.

874
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:18,370
I see. Keep me updated.

875
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:21,420
I'm just at a loss.

876
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:24,500
Jin-sang Seo, that bastard.
He set the world on fire in the end.

877
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,130
Our contract could be cancelled.

878
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,050
-What now?
-How many projects for One International?

879
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:30,470
-Three, sir.
-What about us?

880
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:32,970
We have two contracts. One is in progress.

881
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,760
That's it.

882
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,770
It's only a matter of the buyer's trust
and HR controls for One International,

883
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,310
but it's life or death for us.

884
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:41,810
Jeez. Jin-sang Seo, that bastard.

885
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,270
-Hello.
-He flew to Jordan.

886
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,440
What? Jordan?

887
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,400
All right. We'll leave soon.

888
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,440
Can the Vietnam project be delayed?

889
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:52,610
If I don't show up tomorrow,
the contract could be broken.

890
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,990
Then Geu-rae should go.

891
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,410
Apply for the visa and buy the ticket.

892
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:58,450
-Yes, sir.
-Call Mr. Cho in Amman.

893
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:59,540
Yes, sir.

894
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:09,340
This is a flight ticket to Abu Dhabi.

895
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,670
And this is a flight ticket
from Abu Dhabi to Amman.

896
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,010
Please take your passport
and baggage tag. Enjoy your trip.

897
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,180
Yes, sir.

898
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,600
I just got the tickets.

899
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,980
You have to transfer at Abu Dhabi.
You should not get out there.

900
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,400
-I know, sir.
- When you arrive in Amman,

901
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,270
Mr. Cho will pick you up.
You know his number, right?

902
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,360
Yes, sir.

903
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,240
Okay, good.
Be careful with the food there.

904
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,240
-Mr. Oh.
-What?

905
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,160
-I'm not a kid.
-Well...

906
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,990
-All right.
-Bye.

907
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,340
Mr. Geu-rae Jang.

908
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,720
Yes, Mr. Cho.

909
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,140
You must be tired after a long flight.

910
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,390
I'm fine.

911
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:07,940
Where is Jin-sang Seo?

912
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,980
It's confirmed that he's in Amman.

913
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,610
We searched all the hotels
and guesthouses, but he's not there.

914
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,110
I have no idea where he is staying.

915
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:23,290
-Any acquaintances?
-He's got no acquaintances here.

916
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,750
Have you been to Jordan?

917
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:29,210
If you go to the backstreets in downtown,

918
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,000
there's a nice, small

919
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,300
yet inexpensive hotel.

920
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,670
It costs only 10,000 won a day.

921
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,600
Have you checked the hotels
in the old section of the city?

922
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,100
-Hotels in the old section?
-Yes.

923
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,980
I don't think there are any hotels
in that area.

924
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,900
I guess there are only a couple
of them, but they are...

925
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:53,190
-They are old.
-Yes, they're old.

926
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,820
-And cheap.
-Yes.

927
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:57,700
You can stay there
only with 10,000 won a day.

928
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,830
However,

929
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:03,910
I don't think Jin-sang Seo will stay
at such a place in Jordan.

930
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:06,000
He could be. Please look into it.

931
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:07,830
All right.

932
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,500
But where's Mr. Oh?

933
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:08,230
-Hello.
-Where are you now, sir?

934
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,230
-I'm checking the land now.
-Land?

935
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,020
Are you really going to do it?

936
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:17,070
You know why the Russian Mafia mobsters
have tattoos on their knees?

937
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:19,900
-What?
-It means they won't kneel down, ever.

938
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:20,990
What?

939
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,160
We never give up.
We need to whatever we can do.

940
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,240
Right. But do we really have to...

941
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:29,370
We should always have a plan B.

942
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,630
Whether or not our business succeeds
depends on this. Stay sharp!

943
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:37,300
I was told it wouldn't take long
to build one.

944
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,670
I need to hang up
because of the phone bill.

945
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,540
-Hello.
-I'll see you in Petra after three hours.

946
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:17,460
What? In Petra?

947
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:20,980
"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood.

948
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:25,820
I took the one less traveled by.

949
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:29,660
And that has made

950
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,410
all the difference."

951
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,210
Bravo.

952
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,230
Al-Khazneh.

953
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,700
The Treasury of the Pharaoh.

954
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,280
The gate of Petra.

955
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,170
Merchants had to pass by here.

956
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,960
The Persian Gulf in the East.

957
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:25,920
The Red Sea in the South.

958
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,800
And the Mediterranean Sea in the West.

959
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:31,640
This place was an ancient trade hub,
connecting all of them.

960
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:33,350
The Silk Road?

961
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,690
Come to think of it,

962
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,860
when I was 18 years old,

963
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:54,200
I dreamed of traveling around the world.

964
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,830
While I was watching  Indiana Jones
and  Last Crusades ,

965
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,750
I promised myself that I'll travel.

966
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,710
Indiana Jones?

967
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,630
Yes.

968
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:12,930
It totally slipped my mind.

969
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,970
Since I came to Jordan, I remembered it.

970
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:19,730
My dream.

971
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:21,730
Dream.

972
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:28,690
Petra...

973
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:31,360
As the trade route was shifted,

974
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:34,740
this city has been forgotten
for more than 1,000 years.

975
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,540
I see.

976
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:42,710
So I thought about it in my head,

977
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:46,090
that even if you forgot your dream,

978
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:50,220
your dream still remains there.

979
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:55,010
Even if you don't see the road,

980
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,810
the road still remains there.

981
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,940
Lu Xun once said,

982
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:07,820
"Hope

983
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,700
can't be said to exist,
nor can it be said not to exist.

984
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,450
It's just like

985
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,290
roads across the earth.

986
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,500
For actually there are no roads
to begin with,

987
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,420
but when many men pass one way,

988
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,300
a road is made."

989
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:33,970
I see.

990
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:43,770
By the way, Mr. Oh.

991
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:46,190
Yes?

992
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,570
Why did you want to meet me here?

993
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,070
I just told you.

994
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:53,150
What?

995
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,200
What? When?

996
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:57,870
-Just a while ago.
-What?

997
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:03,910
I just told you.

998
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:06,670
Well... What?

999
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:13,970
I should have brought Young-yi here.

1000
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,130
If I had told her,

1001
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,470
she would have understood it immediately.

1002
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,930
I should have brought Young-yi.

1003
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,440
By any chance,

1004
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:31,320
does that mean I must catch Jin-sang Seo?

1005
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:26,620
-Mr. Jang?
-Did you find him?

1006
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:27,960
It's Cairo Hotel.

1007
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,760
Let's meet in front of the hotel.

1008
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:50,730
-Mr. Jang!
-Yes.

1009
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,770
This way, please.

1010
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,620
Did he already check out?

1011
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,350
Mr. Seo.

1012
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,270
Mr. Seo.

1013
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:30,600
Goodness!

1014
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:45,080
Move away!

1015
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:47,370
Move!

1016
01:15:58,090 --> 01:15:59,340
Mr. Jang!

1017
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:46,260
Fuck!

1018
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:52,230
Oh, damn!

1019
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,360
Shit!

1020
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:43,360
Oh, my goodness.

1021
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:05,340
What the hell is wrong with him?

1022
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,830
My neck.

1023
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,170
I broke my ribs.

1024
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:45,920
It hurts. He's going to kill me.

1025
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,390
Where is it?

1026
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:53,680
What are you talking about?

1027
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,180
The samples that you stole
from the factory in China.

1028
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:58,850
What? What did I steal?

1029
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:01,270
Mr. Seo.

1030
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,650
If you return them,
you won't face charges.

1031
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:05,280
-What?
-If you don't,

1032
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,030
you'll go through criminal
and civil trials.

1033
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,820
You'll sell your house, and go to jail.

1034
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,530
What are you trying to say?

1035
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:16,260
Are you crazy? I just quit my job

1036
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:19,100
and came traveling here. Is that wrong?

1037
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:20,310
There's nothing in his room.

1038
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:21,850
You bastard!

1039
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:24,310
Let go of me. You're hurting me!

1040
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:26,730
You guys will pay for this.

1041
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:29,770
I'm going to contact the embassy.
This is a diplomatic issue.

1042
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:32,480
Do you have any evidence? Evidence, okay?

1043
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:34,570
-This won't work.
-What?

1044
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Where am I?

1045
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:53,300
In the middle of Wadi Rum.

1046
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:55,720
What? Wadi Rum?

1047
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:09,980
Thanks.

1048
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:19,740
Come back. It's cold.

1049
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,390
Mr. Seo, let me tell you again.

1050
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,680
If you return them,
you won't face charges.

1051
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:48,890
I really don't know.
Why are you doing this to me?

1052
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,690
Hey, Geu-rae.

1053
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,770
Why are you threatening me?

1054
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,990
Am I an employee of your company?
Am I a Korean citizen?

1055
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:58,950
Seriously.

1056
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:13,840
Hello, Mr. Oh.

1057
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:17,710
We caught him, but he won't talk.

1058
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:21,010
Since we don't have any evidence,
we can't help it.

1059
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,680
-Wait, Mr. Jang.
-What?

1060
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,060
Russia.

1061
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:27,720
Mafia mobsters' knee tattoo?

1062
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:30,390
You see? Come on.

1063
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,850
-I got it, sir.
-If you find the evidence,

1064
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:34,230
I'll turn myself in.

1065
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:36,940
Russia's Vasily Corp. is looking for you.

1066
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:39,240
Mr. Cho.

1067
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:42,200
How many stakes does the Russian
Mafia have in Vasily Corp.?

1068
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:43,950
What?

1069
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,990
According to Mr. Oh, it's over 70%.

1070
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,540
Do you think it's true?

1071
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:53,420
You're right.

1072
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:57,210
I heard the mafia has been financing
the company in recent years.

1073
01:21:57,710 --> 01:21:59,510
However, I didn't know it's that high.

1074
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:03,640
It's like the company is virtually owned
by the mafia.

1075
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:05,140
Owned by the mafia?

1076
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:06,680
Mr. Seo.

1077
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:09,350
Mr. Oh asked me to deliver you a message.

1078
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,310
What message?

1079
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,650
In Russia,

1080
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:20,240
drums beat, but laws are silent.

1081
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:23,610
Jeez, I don't get it. Why are you...

1082
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:33,370
Let's wrap up.

1083
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,250
I'm whipping! I'm riding!

1084
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,000
I'm whipping! I'm riding!

1085
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,980
Where drums beat, laws are silent.

1086
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,900
Tell me where you hid them.

1087
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:03,570
They're my friends so let me talk to them.

1088
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:04,490
Mr. Jang!

1089
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:06,200
Amman Airport...

1090
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,490
They're in a locker at Amman Airport.

1091
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:12,410
The locker number is 28. I'm sorry.

1092
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,750
I'm really sorry.
Please tell them to leave.

1093
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:20,380
Mr. Jang.

1094
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,760
You're indeed One International's
trading man.

1095
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:28,970
How come he's One International's man?

1096
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,060
Why is he One International's man?

1097
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:38,310
It was just a figure of speech.

1098
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,400
Mr. Jang made every effort
not to damage One International...

1099
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,530
Why is it because of One International?
It's all for the sake of our company.

1100
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:47,030
That's the same.

1101
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:49,780
If One International gets damaged,
then your company will get damaged too.

1102
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:51,700
-When your company gets damaged...
-Stop it!

1103
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:55,660
Don't you know our company motto?
We may lose the work, but not our people.

1104
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:58,580
I heard that's your own motto, sir.

1105
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,090
Dong-sik, that punk.

1106
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:07,760
Along the edge of the abyss

1107
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:10,850
on the very brink of the precipice

1108
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:14,810
I'm riding my horses, I'm whipping them!

1109
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,190
You're a bad bastard.

1110
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:18,810
I'm not.

1111
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,130
-Hey, Geu-rae.
-Yes.

1112
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:46,710
How come you didn't say anything when
they said One International man.

1113
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,880
Sorry?

1114
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:49,760
Any feelings left for One International?

1115
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,840
No, sir.

1116
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:54,970
Dude, you used to say you're satisfied
as long as you work as a regular employee.

1117
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,310
Jeez, you said that.

1118
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:59,850
Then a year later,
you become interested in higher salary

1119
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,350
and more benefits, right?

1120
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,280
That's right. Please increase my bonus.

1121
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,360
What?

1122
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,960
You really have no feelings left
for One International?

1123
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:23,210
I don't know.

1124
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:24,880
This punk.

1125
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,760
-Convince me, sir.
-What?

1126
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,340
Convince me, so that you can keep me.

1127
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:33,720
What's your selling point, sir?

1128
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,560
What's your selling point?

1129
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:37,930
My efforts.

1130
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,690
I haven't made any efforts so far,

1131
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:43,020
so my efforts are freaking fresh and new.

1132
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:45,060
What? How fresh and new?

1133
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:46,320
I'll do my best.

1134
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:48,530
I'll definitely do my best.

1135
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,610
Just drive, punk!

1136
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:54,200
I had a car accident before.
You shouldn't hit my head.

1137
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,530
A road

1138
01:25:56,700 --> 01:26:00,250
is not just where we walk,
but also where we move forward.

1139
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,750
A road where we cannot move forward

1140
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:04,790
is not a real road.

1141
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:07,710
A road is open to everyone.

1142
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,050
What? Hazard pay?

1143
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,630
But not everyone can take the road.

1144
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:14,470
Are you in the army? What hazard pay?

1145
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:17,180
You ordered me to catch him.
I risked my own life.

1146
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,930
Jeez, you're so mean.

1147
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,230
I'm on the road again.

1148
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:23,140
Come on.

1149
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:24,310
And

1150
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:27,770
I'm not alone.

1151
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:54,490
How can you leave us like this?

1152
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,070
Oh no...

1153
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:01,660
Honey...

1154
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:15,880
