1
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,240
If you want to achieve something,

2
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,320
you have to build up
your physical strength.

3
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,660
The reason why you break down
at the last minute...

4
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,410
The reason why it takes long
for you to recover after receiving damage.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,330
The reason why it takes you long
to recover from your mistakes...

6
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,250
It's all because of lack
of physical strength.

7
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,460
If you have poor stamina,
you get content with a comfortable life.

8
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,210
Then, you'll become impatient.

9
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,840
If you can't overcome your fatigue,

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,220
you wouldn't want
to contend for victory anymore.

11
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,390
If you want to win,

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,060
you have to build up your body first

13
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,600
so you can tolerate hardships.

14
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,270
Without physical strength,
your mental strength is nothing

15
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,440
but a useless chant.

16
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,660
On weekends, what do you usually do?

17
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,750
I go to the movies,

18
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,580
read books

19
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,460
and workout.

20
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,670
I like to work out, too.

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,510
I do yoga.

22
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,550
I heard you live alone.

23
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,430
Yes.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,640
I think it's enough for our parents
to support us until we're 20.

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,850
They've done their part.

26
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,600
You're right.

27
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,810
Until when should my dad support me?

28
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,520
At my age, I need a boyfriend.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,110
What is it like working for a big firm?

30
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,780
Above all, you can easily apply
for a mortgage loan.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,990
It wouldn't be difficult
to rent a big house.

32
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,000
I want to get married early.

33
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,170
I don't like having a dual income.

34
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,380
It doesn't look good.

35
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,090
Healing. I need healing.

36
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,300
Hello.

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,100
One ticket for the movie  My Way , please.

38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,060
-Hey.
-Hey.

39
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,440
How come you're here?

40
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,700
I live nearby. What about you?

41
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,490
No. I was just passing by.

42
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,080
Your attire looks perfect
for a blind date.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,330
What? I see.

44
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,670
No...

45
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,880
It was my friend's wedding.

46
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,590
Didn't you like your friend's wedding?

47
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,800
No.

48
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,140
His bride was terrible.

49
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,970
She was only interested
in the loan system of his company.

50
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,626
-The wedding ceremony was a horror.
-A horror?

51
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,730
-Are you here alone?
-Yes.

52
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,570
Thank you.

53
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,120
One, two tickets.

54
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,160
-Give it to me.
-Okay.

55
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,630
You should have told me
you didn't like horror movies.

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,340
You experienced two horrors today.

57
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,880
There's a nearby restaurant
famous for its ox blood hangover soup.

58
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,050
Do you want to go with me?

59
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,980
I'll see you tomorrow.

60
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,730
Baek-ki!

61
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,690
Can I add one more horror story?

62
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
What?

63
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,860
Tomorrow is Monday.

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,330
Look, Dad! I made your company.

65
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,250
-That hurts!
-Dad!

66
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,170
-Dad!
-Get up!

67
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,090
Get up!

68
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,550
Let us go!

69
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,930
Let us go!

70
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,100
Get up!

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,850
You never play with the kids on Sundays.

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,020
I want to rest on Sundays.

73
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,520
I'm the one who really wants to rest!

74
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,610
Honey, I haven't been feeling well.

75
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,490
-I feel like sinking.
-You must have drowned in alcohol.

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,910
Here.

77
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,910
Try some onion juice.

78
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,710
When the kids finish their red ginseng
extract, I'll buy yours next time.

79
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,630
I don't need red ginseng.

80
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,670
EPISODE 8

81
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
Hello.

82
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,890
-All right.
-Da-in.

83
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,510
-You look tired.
-You, too.

84
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,220
-I'm too busy.
-Ask for more staff.

85
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,560
You should ask for more manpower.

86
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
-If you're not going to join just shut up.
-Just call me.

87
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,600
Okay, congratulations.

88
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,780
Hello.

89
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,740
I'm sorry about the rare earth metals.

90
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,030
There's nothing for you to be sorry for.

91
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,620
Mr. Oh must be devastated.

92
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,200
He is, but Mr. Kim
will fully support him this time.

93
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,460
He'll give him a big project.

94
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,830
EXPORTING MECCA PHONES

95
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,540
You want me to work
on the Mecca Phone project?

96
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,000
That's a three-million-dollar project.

97
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,550
The IT sales team has been working on it,
so it's almost ready.

98
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,170
Is Chung-ki Moon coming?

99
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,800
Who else?

100
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,720
I can't.

101
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,970
-What?
-You know what kind of bastard he is.

102
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,930
Please give me work that I can do.

103
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,560
Hey, the company is paying you.
How can you be so picky?

104
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,320
You should do
whatever the company asks you to do.

105
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Anyway, I don't want my kids
to be ashamed of me.

106
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,070
Are you kidding?

107
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,240
Do you want to become a stay-at-home dad?

108
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,120
Yes, I'd rather do that. Let me quit.

109
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,960
Quit?

110
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,420
Because of Dong-sik's error,
we got a low-performance rating.

111
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,970
Okay. If you win this contract,
I'll get you more people.

112
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,510
Really?

113
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,140
So, did you say yes?

114
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,980
Or did you say no?

115
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,110
I don't care about other stuff,
but he promised to get us more people.

116
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,150
So, why can't we do it?

117
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,610
We should.

118
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,030
Then,

119
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,490
why is he agonizing over it?

120
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,580
How can I take part in a criminal act
when I have kids to raise?

121
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,960
This is the same as a back margin
or embezzlement.

122
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,660
-I think they're different.
-It's even worse!

123
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,330
Okay, if you insist, then it's worse.
So what's your decision?

124
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,210
Did you accept it or not?

125
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,140
Are going to be stubborn
because of such a bullshit excuse?

126
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,480
Okay, I got it.

127
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,730
You'll have to reach the quota

128
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,730
that you failed to reach
in the sales division.

129
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,940
You do this job!

130
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,830
What? That's nonsense!

131
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,870
Total nonsense!

132
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,830
LIST OF MECCA PHONES RELATED INDUSTRIES

133
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,130
The IT sales team sent us
the materials for the Mecca Phones.

134
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,470
But...

135
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,600
They even gave us a list of manufacturers.

136
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,140
Right. We should do this.

137
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,520
Call them to check
the production status and the models.

138
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,190
-Order the brochures too.
-Yes.

139
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,270
If anything goes wrong,
we'll be in trouble.

140
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,400
What?

141
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,780
What are you going to do, sir?

142
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,990
We need to do this.

143
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,960
We need to find a way.

144
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,130
Something to make him give up on us.

145
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,260
That's it!

146
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,640
Operating expenses.

147
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,930
We don't have enough
operating expenses, right?

148
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,770
What?

149
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,600
You're short on operating expenses?

150
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,810
Yes.

151
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,860
I really want to, but I can't
because of lack of operating expenses.

152
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,110
Really?

153
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
Use my card.

154
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,240
Just get me the receipts.
I'll take care of all of them.

155
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,130
This is weird.

156
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,250
Mr. Oh is passionate
about any kind of work.

157
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,090
Why doesn't he want to do this job?

158
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,630
It's because Mr. Oh's personality
is rather odd.

159
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,090
His personality...

160
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,010
What?

161
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,180
Mr. Chung-ki Moon.

162
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,230
He runs a big merchandising company
in the Middle East.

163
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,850
That's our main client.

164
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,600
I see, an important partner.

165
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,270
-But then, why is Mr. Oh...
-It's just that...

166
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,320
Mr. Moon is rather eccentric.
Everyone tends to shun him.

167
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,650
To us, he's a tricky customer,
unpleasant to keep but hard to let go.

168
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,200
Why do you think the IT sales team

169
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,830
was willing to hand it over to us
in spite of the loss?

170
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,330
Is he picky?

171
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,500
No. All we have to do...

172
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,250
is win the contract.

173
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,050
Mr. Oh's personality...

174
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,630
According to Mr. Oh, it's...

175
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,260
It's against his principle.

176
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,600
Principle? What principle?

177
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,060
Okay.

178
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,060
We should...

179
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,230
get sick.

180
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,650
I bought some expired milk.

181
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,450
As you said,

182
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,200
I put them under the sun for three hours.

183
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,870
Good.

184
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,580
But what are you going to do with it?

185
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,000
Drink.

186
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,710
What?

187
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,050
He wouldn't ask us to do the job
if we are suffering from food poisoning.

188
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,300
Mr. Oh!

189
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,180
Drink!

190
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,140
How can I possibly drink this?

191
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,100
Drink!

192
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,650
We should drink it.

193
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,620
Oh, my.

194
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,120
Goodness.

195
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,710
whatever.

196
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,430
There's still some left.

197
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,970
I can't!

198
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,320
Is it coming out?

199
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,160
No, it's too dirty here.

200
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,490
I'm not getting any signal.

201
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,700
Me, neither.

202
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,710
Are you sure the milk was expired?

203
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,290
Yes, I'm sure.

204
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,920
What about you, sir?

205
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,750
Useless yogurt drink!

206
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,110
Principle. It's against his principle.

207
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,780
To an employee whose work is everything,

208
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,200
what kind of work
can be against his principle?

209
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,750
Or can anything like that exist?

210
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,920
Yes, this is Sang-sik Oh,
Sales Team Three.

211
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,340
Hello.

212
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,010
This is Madam Cha from Jangwon.

213
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,600
We opened a new shop in Sinsa-dong.
I wanted to say hello.

214
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,100
What do you think you're doing?

215
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,100
Our shop, Jangwon...

216
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,360
-This is Sung-sik Oh.
-Hello.

217
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,820
-Hello, Mr. Oh.
-Dong-sik Kim speaking.

218
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,030
This is Madam Chun.
We expanded our shop in Bangbae-dong.

219
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,070
-Today I...
-What I told you today...

220
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,860
-Those jerks.
-I'll call you back.

221
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,200
Okay, bye.

222
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,660
It was Mr. Sang-bae Lee
from Luxury Lounge.

223
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,460
He'll give us a 20 percent discount.

224
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,370
Hey!

225
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,330
The rumor is everywhere.

226
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,590
When the IT sales team had a meeting...

227
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,380
Excuse me.

228
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,180
Are you Mr. Sang-sik Oh?

229
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,310
Yes, I am.

230
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,990
I'm Michell Jang
from Partner's Corporation.

231
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,370
I would like to become a business partner
of Sales Team Three.

232
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,790
-What brings you here?
-Ms. Min.

233
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,630
I heard you're doing business
with Mr. Chung-ki Moon...

234
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,630
of Alabi Merchandising.

235
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,180
We were in charge of entertaining Mr. Moon
when Sales Team One

236
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,800
had a project with him last year.

237
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,930
We successfully helped them
win the contract.

238
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,270
I know you received countless calls,
but please ignore them.

239
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,190
Partner's Corporation is ready...

240
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,650
to become your perfect partner.

241
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,880
Not only the limousine pickup service,

242
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,800
but any kind of service
that the VIP wants is available.

243
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,430
We'll do our best to satisfy them.

244
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,010
Of course,

245
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,810
I guarantee the second round,
taking out girls.

246
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,417
My friend.

247
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,920
You should close your eyes this time.

248
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,920
Don't you feel sorry for Dong-sik?

249
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,020
His face is so pale,
he looks like a sick chicken.

250
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,770
What?

251
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,730
I heard Mr. Kim promised
to get you more people.

252
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,940
Goodness.

253
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,320
It's disgusting to see Mr. Moon
making a scene at the bar,

254
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,190
but there's another reason

255
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,070
why Mr. Oh never wants to entertain him.

256
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,290
He wants the second round,
taking out a girl.

257
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,330
You mean...

258
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,460
It's illegal, I know.

259
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,640
Some buyers still want
those kinds of things these days.

260
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,850
Mr. Oh would never do that,

261
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,890
not because of the law,
but because of his principle.

262
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,060
Principle.

263
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,650
-So, what's his principle?
-I don't know.

264
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,610
He talked about it several times.

265
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,730
Well, something about human rights.

266
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
The dignity of human beings.

267
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,860
Something like that.
I just can't explain it.

268
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,580
So, Mr. Oh's principle

269
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,910
is he would never let him take a girl out.

270
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,960
I guess that's his principle.

271
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,960
Does that mean
he prioritizes people over work?

272
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,340
That's right.

273
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,340
He's so naive.

274
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,350
To be honest, how can an employee
stick to his own principle?

275
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,310
We do whatever they want.

276
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,810
Once we resolve this case,

277
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,320
we can achieve
the expected sales for this quarter.

278
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,570
Have some.

279
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,370
I'm fine.

280
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,960
Hello, sir.

281
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,170
Hello.

282
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,970
What's bothering you?

283
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,550
-Finish it at the first one.
-What?

284
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,640
Get him drunk,
make him sign the contract, the end!

285
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,560
Isn't it easy?

286
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,720
Let him drink until he gets unconscious.

287
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,360
The Mecca Phone project
is troubling you, right?

288
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,860
See, I know everything.

289
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,320
I'm actually an expert in this area.

290
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,990
I would love to help you more,

291
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,240
but I've got a pile of work to do myself.

292
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,250
Baek-ki!

293
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,250
Hey!

294
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,260
I want to help Baek-ki, too,
but I can't find a way.

295
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,510
I'm afraid he might be
thinking about resigning.

296
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,650
Mark the order
Organize by status

297
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,150
If you want to work for another company,
you may leave our company right now.

298
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,640
This is Ji-yeon Lee from Search and Brain,
a headhunting service.

299
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,480
We would like to offer you a good company
if you're looking for a new job.

300
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,820
Great.

301
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,870
What a good timing.

302
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,330
The Certified emission reduction project

303
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,040
CER - A TYPE OF EMISSIONS UNIT

304
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,540
has been approved by the Finance team.

305
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,090
Goodness.

306
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,680
Finally, the time has come.

307
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,890
Who's going to be in charge?

308
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,350
You should be. You initiated this.

309
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,900
All Young-yi did
was add the Russian forest.

310
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
But what she did was

311
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,440
-extremely crucial.
-Fine.

312
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,570
-Then do it together.
-What?

313
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,570
-No, I don't want to. Give it to her.
-What the...

314
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,200
Do you think that makes sense?

315
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,580
No matter how smart she may be,
she's just a newbie.

316
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,330
-She can't handle this alone.
-I don't want to work with her.

317
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,250
You bastard!

318
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,130
Do you think I want to give her work?

319
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,300
This could be a big success.

320
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,130
Think of your team!

321
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,260
The finance team approved?

322
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,340
Yes.

323
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,010
You did a good job.

324
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,640
-Thanks.
-Mr. Ha will be in charge.

325
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,010
Support him well.

326
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,560
Yes. I'll do my best.

327
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,810
-Sir.
-Let's talk.

328
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,860
Tell him that you can't do it.

329
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,660
What?

330
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,700
Why are you acting
like you don't understand?

331
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,950
Did you think I want to work with you?

332
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,880
I'll support you well.

333
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,210
Hey, don't you get it?

334
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,670
You'll support me well?

335
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,630
Are you acting cool now?

336
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,640
-Sir.
-Tell him that you can't do it.

337
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,010
If you're really a part of our team,

338
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,510
don't cause any more trouble.

339
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,990
Don't you feel sorry for Dong-sik?

340
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,410
His face is so pale,
he looks like a sick chicken.

341
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,510
Dong-sik Kim, Sales Team Three
of One International.

342
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,220
Right. Hello. Yes.

343
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,600
I think the tariff rate has changed.

344
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,020
I'll check and call you back.

345
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,230
Yes, bye.

346
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,770
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

347
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,730
Hanseo Enterprise...

348
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,530
I heard Mr. Kim promised
to get us more people.

349
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,740
And...

350
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,700
Hey, Dong-sik!

351
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,570
Yes?

352
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,330
Let's do it!

353
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,790
-Yes... What?
-Let's do it.

354
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,000
Let's do it.

355
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,920
Let's do it.

356
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,630
I'll finish it at the first round.

357
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,260
Geu-rae, tell Seok-yul to come over.

358
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,380
Let me start.

359
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,510
It's a strategy for entertaining
CEO Chung-ki Moon of Alabi.

360
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,390
The trade insurance credit rating is A.
It deals with communications...

361
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,970
I know, but that's not important.

362
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,220
This is the list of those who failed
to win contracts with him.

363
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,270
They have something in common.

364
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,770
They couldn't or wouldn't grant him
the second round.

365
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,770
On the other hand,
those who did either won the contract

366
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,400
or received a positive response.

367
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,990
-He's never signed in the first round?
-Never.

368
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,370
Okay, then what are the odds
that he would sign the contract

369
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,950
when he gets drunk?

370
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,870
Jumping to conclusions, we don't know.

371
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,210
He's never been dead drunk. Not even once.

372
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,290
Just in case,

373
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,880
assuming that Mr. Moon gets dead drunk,

374
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:33,840
he's likely to act
pompously, generously and pretentiously.

375
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,970
In case he feels great,

376
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,560
I think the possibility goes
a little higher.

377
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,310
This is the only alternative that we have.

378
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,020
-Okay.
-However, as I said earlier,

379
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,440
the problem is he's never been dead drunk.

380
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,820
How much can he drink?

381
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,940
If he drinks liquor
with 40 percent alcohol,

382
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,570
according to our calculations,
three bottles would make him drunk.

383
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,870
You mean one bottle every 30 minutes?
Make it simple.

384
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,660
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,710
No matter what happens, we should get him
to sign by the first round.

386
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,760
We can't get drunk first.

387
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,220
I'm sorry for being late.
Things took quite a while.

388

INCOMING CALL

389
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,650
Strategic Plan

390
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,610
The seating arrangement
is the most important thing.

391
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,240
Mr. Oh sits here. Mr. Kim sits across him.

392
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,250
And then Geu-rae sits next to Mr. Kim.

393
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,290
Mr. Moon will take the seat of honor...

394
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,090
-Young-yi An.
-Excuse me.

395
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,840
Young-yi, come over here
if you're not busy.

396
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,970
-I'll call you back.
-Sir.

397
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,890
Mr. Oh.

398
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,060
Sit here for a second.

399
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,060
She's Mr. Moon.

400
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,270
She can't be Chung-ki Moon.

401
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,810
-Aren't you busy?
-I am. Excuse me.

402
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,770
Come on. Just a second.

403
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,440
Mr. Oh will pour him a drink first.

404
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,860
Mr. Kim should follow.

405
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,030
While Mr. Moon is drinking,
Mr. Oh should get out,

406
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,450
pretending to answer the phone.

407
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,910
In this confusion,

408
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,160
Geu-rae, you should pour him more liquor.

409
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,420
You mean, we'll drink only one glass,

410
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,210
-but he'll drink three glasses.
-That's right.

411
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,210
That's great.

412
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,470
However, this won't last long.

413
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,800
From the beginning,
you should prepare two sets of liquor.

414
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,970
One is real liquor,
but the other is black tea.

415
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,730
After Mr. Moon pours you liquor,

416
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,270
and while Geu-rae pours him liquor,

417
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,320
Mr. Kim should change the glass of liquor
to that of black tea.

418
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,120
You should prepare wet cloths
and a trashcan where you can dump liquor.

419
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,250
Pretending to wipe your mouth,

420
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,210
you spit out the liquor on your cloth.

421
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,800
You can't spit out lots of liquor
on the wet cloth.

422
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,970
If you spit before it gets absorbed,
it may get messy.

423
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,680
The trick of the wet cloth depends on
the power of absorption.

424
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,020
Therefore, prepare many dry
pieces of cloth

425
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,350
that's the same type as that
of the pieces of wet cloth.

426
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,110
You should have
empty glasses in your pockets.

427
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,730
You switch them with full ones.

428
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,230
Pretend you're drunk.

429
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,900
Call each other every 30 minutes
so that your seating will be rotated.

430
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,110
Boilermaker is seven times
as strong as normal liquor.

431
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,410
If you can make it,
it will brighten up the mood.

432
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,830
You see?

433
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,210
You understand me now?

434
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,290
You know now why I kept saying
Young-yi An should have joined us.

435
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,630
I know how to make
more than 40 boilermakers

436
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,340
including loyalty, rainbow, golf,
cappuccino and waterfall drink.

437
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,090
Good. Geu-rae.

438
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,560
You should learn how to make
boilermakers from Seok-yul.

439
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,310
Thanks.

440
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,980
Let's go.

441
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,850
You should learn from him.

442
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,440
Young-yi, who are you?

443
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,040
Principle?

444
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,040
Why are you laughing?

445
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,900
I feel like I'm looking
at a very old watch...

446
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,200
in an antique store.

447
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,160
-What
-The word "principle".

448
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,900
These days,

449
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,110
when professors give a lecture,

450
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,690
when they mention "social justice",

451
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,900
students find it really embarrassing.

452
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,950
Mr. Oh is still an idealist.

453
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,370
Or he may be struggling not to become
a worker deprived of his soul.

454
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,880
By the way, sir.

455
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,050
Are you really not preparing anything
for the second round?

456
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,810
-Sir, what if...
-No!

457
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,740
Gather all information
about Chung-ki Moon, even a receipt.

458
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,380
Give me the revised version
of the agency list.

459
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,060
I'll tell you if there's more
to revise right away. Wait there.

460
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,980
You did well. Nothing further.

461
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,320
Do this one, too.

462
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,860
It's a contract document. Check the typos.

463
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,530
Check if there are errors.

464
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,620
Get it ready by tomorrow morning
so that I can mail it.

465
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,130
You heard him?

466
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,050
You should finish it by tomorrow morning.

467
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:52,960
What?

468
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,970
Baek-ki Jang, what are you doing now?

469
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,680
I came here to create a business.

470
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,930
I didn't come here
to settle accounts, make tables,

471
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,390
create agency lists, or check typos.

472
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,480
I've had enough of these chores.

473
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,110
I think it's time
to work as a regular employee.

474
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,610
Don't you see how other newbies
are working on their teams?

475
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,990
Their names are on the sale proposals
for the next quarter.

476
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,910
Even Geu-rae...

477
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,200
Sir.

478
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,420
Why don't you like me?

479
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,630
Haven't you learned anything
from our team, Baek-ki?

480
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,260
All I've learned so far is patience.

481
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,720
And I don't think it's time for me
to learn but to apply my experiences.

482
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,560
Put the file back on Baek-ki's desk.

483
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,080
Baek-ki.

484
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,250
You don't need to console me.

485
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,130
Why is he so angry?

486
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,300
Mr. Oh.

487
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,180
-Are you leaving for the day?
-Yes.

488
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,520
We're going to eat premium beef.
You should join us.

489
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,270
I have Mr. Kim's credit card in here.

490
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,560
Where is Geu-rae?

491
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,320
Are you done for the day?

492
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,070
Yes.

493
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,370
You see?

494
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:50,210
He looks frightened.
I'm afraid of leaving him alone.

495
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,630
Young-yi.
The beef there is really juicy...

496
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,800
Young-yi An.

497
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,590
Young-yi, what are you doing? Hurry!

498
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,220
I'll have to excuse myself.

499
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,890
Young-yi!

500
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,220
Young-yi.

501
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,890
Geu-rae.

502
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,850
You didn't go for dinner?

503
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,400
Mr. Oh said we should eat later.

504
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,320
-Is it because of...
-In case you ask me that,

505
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,160
he said it's not because of you.

506
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,990
His wife called.

507
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,330
I'm sorry. I'll see you tomorrow.

508
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,440
Thanks.

509
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,820
I'm so sorry.

510
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,740
It's all right.
I'll get off at the next stop.

511
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,930
Stop it!

512
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,890
-You're a hypocrite, sir.
-Young-yi.

513
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,600
Do you think I would thank you?
Do you think you're my savior?

INCOMING CALL

515
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,420
INCOMING CALL

516
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,840
Please...

517
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,260
Please stop, Dad.

518
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,830
I'm sorry. When did you get off?

519
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,670
I didn't even say goodbye.

520
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,420
Goodbye.

521
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,380
I'll see you tomorrow.

522
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,440
Their names are on the sale proposals
for the next quarter.

523
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Even Geu-rae...

524
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,230
Haven't you learned anything
from our team, Baek-ki?

525
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,960
This is a headhunting service.

526
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,290
We would like to offer you a good company
if you're looking for a new job.

527
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,220
-Isn't Mr. Oh in yet?
-No.

528
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,890
Where is he now? It's almost time.

529
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,480
I don't think I can use it.

530
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,650
-He's coming.
-He's coming!

531
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,480
We're all ready, sir.

532
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,190
-Bring the medicine.
-Yes.

533
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,590
-Let's go!
-Okay.

534
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,180
Let's go.

535
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,170
Welcome.

536
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,300
Mr. Moon is on the way here
in a limousine.

537
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,010
He'll be here soon.

538
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,730
My girls have been here for two hours.

539
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,770
My people are ready, too.

540
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,900
Great!

541
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,230
Let's do this.

542
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,950
He's here.

543
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,130
Finally, he has arrived.

544
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,100
The word "principle" is mocked these days.

545
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,100
-You've come a long way.
-Michell.

546
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,270
Nice to meet you, Mr. Moon.

547
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,310
I'm Sang-sik Oh,
One International's Sales Team Three.

548
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:43,190
The man who made Mr. Oh
bring up that archaic word.

549
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,990
I'm Dong-sik Kim.

550
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,820
I'm Geu-rae Jang.

551
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,280
This way, please.

552
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,410
Will he

553
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,920
be able to keep his principle as intended?

554
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,730
The game was over
way earlier than we expected.

555
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,030
Sir.

556
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,450
Let me pour you a drink.

557
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,240
I'm sorry.

558
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:37,000
We were unexpectedly
out of our operating area.

559
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,380
We panicked
even before we could load a gun.

560
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,590
My phone...

561
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,170
Hello.

562
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,170
Hold on. Hello.

563
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,760
Wait a second.

564
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,180
-Just a second.
-Mr. Oh.

565
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,140
The most meticulous plan
to get the client drunk...

566
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,310
in Sales Team Three's history...

567
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,520
failed even before it kicked off...

568
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
in front of the heaviest drinker on earth.

569
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,080
Have this snack.

570
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,810
The crash course I took on
mixing drinks was useless

571
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:44,270
- in the real game.
-This is the waterfall drink.

572
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,610
Yay, isn't it awesome?

573
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,820
-Inshallah!
-Inshallah!

574
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,240
Drink!

575
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,370
It's the dawn drink, which we drink
until the break of dawn.

576
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,830
Okay, here we go.

577
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,330
-Here. Have a drink.
-Cheers!

578
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,710
Mr. Kim couldn't tell which one
was liquor and which one was black tea.

579
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,590
Still, Mr. Oh struggled to get him
to sign the contract...

580
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,180
at the first round by all means.

581
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,470
And me.

582
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,100
All of us realized it
when it was four in the morning.

583
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,600
We were totally...

584
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,110
defeated.

585
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,240
We also knew...

586
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,160
Mr. Oh's heart would be crying all night.

587
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,660
Hey...

588
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:43,410
This drink...

589
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,880
You're the youngest?

590
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,170
You're the youngest, right?

591
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,460
I got you Binggre...

592
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,930
-You can go up now.
-Mr. Oh, you...

593
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,090
You're quick-witted.

594
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,310
Okay.

595
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,850
Please wait.

596
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,560
What's with this?

597
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,400
Why is it shaking?

598
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,570
Let's go. I don't have time.

599
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,240
Please take care of it.

600
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,530
Don't worry!

601
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,200
Don't worry. You, too.

602
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,220
You did a good job.

603
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,930
Where is Dong-sik?

604
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,440
Dong-sik!

605
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,440
Look here!

606
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,070
Hey.

607
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,700
Send Dong-sik first.

608
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,450
Go home quickly.

609
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,830
You should sleep a couple of hours.

610
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,000
What about you, sir?

611
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:16,920
Gosh.

612
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,010
I'm sorry.

613
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Mr. Oh failed,

614
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,860
but Sales Team Three,

615
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,200
we survived.

616
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:46,330
We survived? That's bullshit!

617
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,790
We screwed up.

618
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,580
We screwed up!

619
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:53,960
We screwed up.

620
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,090
How could that happen?

621
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,150
Are you awake?

622
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,160
Surprise!

623
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:34,340
Honey? How come you're here?

624
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:36,420
I sent her.

625
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,140
Come on, sir.

626
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,640
-My thirst has now been quenched.
-Sir.

627
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,600
Dude.

628
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,570
Did you really expect me
to do whatever he wanted so easily?

629
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,780
You sent his wife?

630
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,280
Everything.

631
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,490
It's all in the data.

632
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,210
Data research matters all the time.

633
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,000
Inside the data,

634
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,000
there's a key to success.

635
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:21,880
In a recent article
published on some financial newspaper,

636
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,680
Chung-ki Moon was said to arrive
in Korea with his wife.

637
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,930
I accidentally checked his anniversary.

638
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,020
ROMANTIC GUY, CEO MOON

639
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,230
It happened to be the same day
when we would meet him.

640
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,980
That made my blood boil.

641
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,150
What?

642
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:43,070
He was going to screw around
on his own wedding anniversary.

643
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:50,870
As my blood boiled, I came up with an idea

644
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,790
for the "just in case" scenario
for the second round.

645
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,920
I didn't say the "just in case" scenario
but the preparations for the second round.

646
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,050
I decided to give his poor wife...

647
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,260
an unforgettable anniversary gift.

648
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,720
I met her on the morning
of the entertainment day.

649
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:12,020
I let her know about our plan
as a little anniversary gift.

650
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,890
It was your plan, not ours.

651
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:17,690
After that,

652
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:23,070
-You know everything went perfectly well.
-Everything failed perfectly.

653
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,150
Why did you do such a weird thing?

654
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,570
Goodness.

655
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,330
What kind of man wants
to get entertained by his wife?

656
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,950
So...

657
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,160
You chose your principle
instead of the contract.

658
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:40,290
-What are you going to say to Mr. Kim?
-You crazy bastard!

659
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,710
Are you insane?

660
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,180
Hey, Sang-sik Oh!

661
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,300
You should jump off a bridge!

662
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,430
As long as I'm in the headquarters,

663
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:55,100
you'll keep dreaming of getting
more people on Sales Team Three, bastard!

664
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,520
I warned you before, didn't I?

665
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,520
Your team should fill all the loss
incurred by the sales headquarters.

666
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,690
All of it! Everything! No exceptions!

667
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,210
Hello.

668
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,670
Dad!

669
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:07,210
-My youngest! Future trading man!
- Dad, are you coming home early today?

670
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,880
Well, right.

671
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,050
Then, please buy us spicy fried chicken.

672
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,520
Just the spicy one?
What about the plain one?

673
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,890
Then, please buy us plain fried chicken.

674
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,310
Just the plain one?
What about the spicy one?

675
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,280
Then, a set of half and half, please.

676
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,820
Then,

677
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,490
should I buy two sets of half and half?

678
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:37,200
That's the same as one spicy fried chicken
and one plain fried chicken.

679
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,250
You're right.

680
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,620
Dad, you're stupid.

681
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:44,710
Hey, dude.
How can you call your dad stupid?

682
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,840
Dad, I love you. Bye.

683
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,090
I love you.

684
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,070
Why am I sweating like a pig?

685
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,880
I feel down.

686
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,350
I'm bleeding. Gosh.

687
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,190
Dad, please buy one set of half and half

688
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,360
in addition to one spicy fried chicken.

689
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,020
From your eldest son.

690
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,450
You were here, sir? You didn't pick up.

691
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,530
-Is your nose bleeding?
-It's nothing.

692
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,620
Are you okay?

693
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:44,450
I dozed off for a few minutes

694
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,250
and ended up with a nosebleed.

695
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,750
Were you dozing off?

696
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,800
I'm not sure if I dozed off or passed out.

697
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,510
Probably because I'm overworked,

698
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:57,470
my blood pressure went up.

699
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:05,770
No, I'm fine.

700
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:13,230
Don't mention this to Dong-sik.

701
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,900
I'm tired of him nagging.

702
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,880
Hey, Young-yi!

703
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:33,800
Yes.

704
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,010
Why are you researching
the EU-Emissions Trading System?

705
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,360
What are you playing at?

706
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,860
You never listen to your senior, do you?

707
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,370
I said you should drop out.

708
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,160
Are you protesting against me?

709
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,500
You think it's your project?
Are you claiming ownership of it?

710
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,540
It's not that, sir.

711
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,500
If you can't drop out of it, okay.

712
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,710
You can have it.

713
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,590
Me? I don't have to do it.

714
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:09,090
Put your damn name at the center
and succeed!

715
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:32,910
Young-yi.

716
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:36,080
Seok-yul.

717
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:37,200
Keep your chin up.

718
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,630
Everyone knows that losers act like that.

719
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,380
Men are such big losers.

720
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,970
In front of a talented woman,
we become worse.

721
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,560
Be confident
because you didn't do anything wrong.

722
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:59,310
As an intern,
you pulled off a two-year contract.

723
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,650
You were like a warrior.

724
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,650
Your legendary story is still rumored.

725
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,650
Go back to being that Young-yi An.

726
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:11,410
Keep your chin up. Be confident.

727
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:13,660
Be strong.

728
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,200
That's who you are.

729
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,180
What?

730
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,390
I'll do as you said.

731
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,180
As you said,

732
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,390
I'll drop out of the project

733
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:43,650
Instead,

734
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,110
while you're working on that project,
let me run errands for you.

735
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,740
What?

736
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,260
Please send your résumé

737
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,600
for that company by midnight.

738
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:07,940
Baek-ki!

739
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,110
Are you done reviewing the document?

740
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:18,110
I'll wrap it up
so that you can check it tomorrow.

741
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,540
Baek-ki.

742
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,500
I won't stop you if you want to quit.

743
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,590
Steel is a conservative business.

744
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,840
An item gets adjusted
to the business market little by little

745
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,350
over a long period of time.

746
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,350
We don't need an eloquent speaker

747
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:50,480
who wants to stand out,
but someone who has the basics,

748
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,770
someone who can look towards the future.

749
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,190
So...

750
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,570
Are you saying you've taught me
the basics so far?

751
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:09,250
If so, I was treated more unfairly.

752
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,420
I learned the basics

753
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,790
when I attended a school,
worked as an intern and got training.

754
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,220
You said you wanted
to teach me the basics.

755
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,930
But that's nothing but an excuse.

756
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,930
I think you just hate me.

757
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,230
See you tomorrow.

758
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,660
I need to get an answer today.

759
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,870
Why do you hate me so much?

760
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,290
Baek-ki.

761
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,340
It's not a matter
of who I like or dislike.

762
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:04,890
I don't even know you
well enough to judge you.

763
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,560
Then, what in the world is it?

764
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:13,270
Don't you remember the first thing you did
when you were assigned to our team?

765
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,440
Please review this.

766
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,900
I devised a profitable proposal
for the steel team.

767
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,660
Are you talking about
my business proposal?

768
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:29,450
Training should include the time
to check what you've learned.

769
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,750
There was a pile of documents
you had to read as a newbie.

770
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,040
However,

771
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,130
you submitted a business proposal
as soon as you joined the team.

772
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,260
Even before you read
the relevant documents in the steel team.

773
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:47,430
When you want to stand out
from the rest so badly,

774
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:49,640
you become hasty.

775
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,230
The basics that you mentioned.

776
01:00:57,230 --> 01:01:00,320
If they're that important,
why didn't you tell me from the beginning?

777
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,440
I've given you many chances
to reflect on your own mistakes.

778
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,950
I don't know about other teams,

779
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:06,610
but this is my style.

780
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,070
Chances?

781
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,830
You made me check typos,
make tables, run errands.

782
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,330
Do you call them chances?

783
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,420
I could learn more
by working with you, right?

784
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,750
You still have a long way to go.

785
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,250
I'm sending my resume.

786
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,420
SEND

787
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:10,590
YOUR MAIL HAS BEEN SENT.

788
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:17,810
Are you done for the day?

789
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,610
Yes.

790
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,230
Okay, then.

791
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,570
Well... The advice that you gave me.

792
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,240
I decided to take it.

793
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,040
Excuse me?

794
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,500
I decided to lose as you advised me.

795
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,920
I concluded that the way
to counter a spear...

796
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:45,090
is not to use a stronger spear
or a shield.

797
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:54,720
Young-yi.

798
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,390
You discovered your own way.

799
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,060
As for me,

800
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,770
I discovered my own way.

801
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,630
Don't you need to drink red ginseng
instead of onion juice?

802
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:32,930
My wife said she'd buy me red ginseng
once my kids finish theirs.

803
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,090
Please give it to me.

804
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,930
Why are you sweating so much?

805
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,720
You're strange.

806
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,930
Don't you have to go to the hospital?

807
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:42,350
It's because I feel hot.

808
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,110
-Let me take a rest for a while.
-Yes.

809
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,580
It's not working out well.

810
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,960
-Dong-sik, I'll be out for a moment.
-Okay.

811
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:11,340
-If anyone calls me, answer it.
-Yes. Okay, I got it.

812
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,420
What's wrong with me?

813
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,760
Where has Mr. Oh gone?

814
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,010
He felt so dizzy that he went out
to get some fresh air.

815
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,100
He won't pick up his phone.

816
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,020
Dizzy?

817
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,480
I think he's been getting
overworked lately.

818
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,400
He was just dizzy? No other symptoms?

819
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,200
Other symptoms?

820
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,820
Why?

821
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:19,200
A man in his forties is bound
to have health issues.

822
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:20,990
One of my friends was just like Mr. Oh.

823
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,410
He was always overworked
and didn't care about his health.

824
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,290
He ended up having a stroke,
even though he was still young.

825
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,790
Come on. You're going too far.

826
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,750
-A stroke in his 40s?
-There's another one

827
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,380
who collapsed due to his blood pressure...

828
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,720
while working on site and died in the end.

829
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,630
Still, that's too much, sir.

830
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,890
Mr. Oh passed out yesterday.
He even got a nosebleed.

831
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,100
What?

832
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,600
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

833
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,610
-He's still not picking up?
-No, it's still ringing.

834
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,990
I'm afraid he passed out somewhere.

835
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:57,360
I'll keep calling him.

836
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:04,490
I'm sorry. Hurry! Call him!

837
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:06,960
Keep calling him!

838
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:09,790
I'm fine. Go!

839
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:21,340
Why did you leave me?

840
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:26,850
Your call is not connected...

841
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,730
Gosh, sir.

842
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:33,520
Where in the world are you, sir?

843
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,410
Where is everyone?

844
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:45,290
They're out looking for Mr. Oh.

845
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,910
He said he would get some fresh air,
but he never came back.

846
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:51,330
He should have told them where to go.

847
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:54,040
Because Mr. Oh has been getting
stressed out lately,

848
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,840
he was not feeling well.

849
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,920
Not well?

850
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,970
Seriously?

851
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:03,300
I heard he passed out
and had a nosebleed yesterday.

852
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,100
I'm worried he might have
collapsed somewhere.

853
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:10,020
Then, what are you doing now?

854
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,230
-Send your team members to look for him!
-Yes.

855
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,940
Mr. Hwang! Mi-ra Jang!

856
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:24,450
MR. BOO-RYEON KIM

857
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:01,700
What time is it?

858
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,790
Why do I have so many calls?

859
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:11,910
My goodness.

860
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,210
Mr. Ko and even Mr. Kim?

861
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,510
-Yes.
-Sir!

862
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,090
Sir.

863
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:31,730
What's up with you?

864
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:37,060
Why didn't you get a follow-up check up?

865
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,320
Well, that's...

866
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,690
You know this will reflect
on your performance assessment.

867
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,700
If you don't fill out the form,
there's nothing I can do.

868
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:46,720
I'm sorry.

869
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:06,820
-How old is your eldest?
-Well, he's... He's in the sixth grade.

870
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,450
I've attended all of the first
birthday parties of your kids.

871
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,870
I can't tell you
to spend more family time,

872
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,750
due to the nature of our job.

873
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:17,670
However,

874
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,210
I can't allow a dad
to not take care of his own health.

875
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:24,670
Working hard includes
taking care of your health.

876
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:30,970
Get a follow-up checkup.

877
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:33,850
Make the target for your next project
the Middle Eastern market.

878
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,600
I'll fully support you this time.

879
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:38,350
Thank you, sir.

880
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:39,730
Wait.

881
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:42,650
Take this.

882
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:46,190
I bought dried eel for a buyer.

883
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:47,440
Take this.

884
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:49,610
I'm fine.

885
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:51,370
Come on.

886
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:52,950
Take this.

887
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,960
I said, take this! It's heavy.

888
01:09:58,540 --> 01:09:59,670
Thank you, sir.

889
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:02,590
Hello, this is Boo-ryeon Kim.

890
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,460
Yes.

891
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,640
-What?
- Sir.

892
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,050
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

893
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,350
You scared us.

894
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,560
What's that? Mr. Kim gave it to you?

895
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:21,230
Right, this is dried eel.

896
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:23,980
Do you want some?

897
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,400
Forget it. Please eat all of it.
Don't do anything else.

898
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,360
Don't let your stamina
have your fourth child.

899
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:31,450
Hey!

900
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:33,160
Sang-sik Oh!

901
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,500
Hey!

902
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:40,410
What in the world did you do?

903
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:50,300
All right, Sang-sik Oh!

904
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:53,970
You said you didn't feel like it.
You pretended to be naive.

905
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,510
You must have sold your soul, yes?

906
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:59,520
How come Mr. Moon wants
to make the quantity double?

907
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,400
-My card...
-Here it is.

908
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,190
You haven't returned your card yet?

909
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,280
Treat yourselves with beef.

910
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:15,200
-All right, Sang-sik Oh!
-What just happened?

911
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:19,080
So, entertaining him
with his wife worked well?

912
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:21,960
I didn't imagine Mr. Moon was so romantic.

913
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,960
Yes, maybe.

914
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,670
Let's call it a day.

915
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:36,010
-Wait, what about beef?
-No, I have to eat eel today.

916
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:41,850
Geu-rae, remove the materials
about Mr. Moon on my table.

917
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:47,440
-What about beef?
-No!

918
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,570
Then, give me the card.

919
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:51,320
No!

920
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,420
Mi-ra Kang? Mr. Moon's wife?
The final decision maker.

921
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,460
Wait! The card...

922
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:13,340
For my wife

923
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,970
In the end, Chung-ki Moon's wife

924
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:19,220
is actually the final decision maker.

925
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,640
So...

926
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,020
You opted for your principle
instead of the contract.

927
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,560
So.

928
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,320
So

929
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,530
you killed two birds with one stone.

930
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:05,290
Since it's a foreign company, it has
a comfortable atmosphere between workers.

931
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:07,000
You won't work overtime.

932
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:10,130
The amount of work depends on individuals.

933
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:13,870
Since they like your varied career,

934
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:16,120
you'll be able to have an open discussion.

935
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,370
Can I be assigned to the team that I like?

936
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,540
Probably.

937
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,180
He's hasty.

938
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:37,180
When will they give us more people?

939
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,600
Mr. Kim said he would send a specialist
from the Middle East to our team.

940
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,350
He surely will. Soon.

941
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:47,650
Who's coming?

942
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,070
I don't know.

943
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,320
Who is coming?

944
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:52,900
I don't know.

945
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,080
I want an assistant manager
who is quick-witted.

946
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:06,000
-Who do you want, sir?
-Young-yi An.

947
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:09,130
Young-yi should have joined our team
from the start.

948
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,630
-I will...
-Go!

949
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,300
Go!

950
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,430
Hey, wait.

951
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:23,270
Come on. Let me do it.

952
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:24,980
We should eat together
when someone joins us.

953
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,520
Eat what?

954
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,230
We can't.

955
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:47,960
Mr. Oh.

956
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:49,960
Hello.

957
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,090
We are on the same team.

958
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:30,750
Overcome the obstacle
in front of me first. Yes!

959
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,920
- Why?
-Has the interview date been fixed?

960
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,760
He was the legend of the 120 million
dollar Jordan export project.

961
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,760
That good-for-nothing bastard
is too arrogant.

962
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,680
Since he joined Sales Team Three,
he's one of us.

963
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,640
I didn't learn in school
how to have people open up to me.

964
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,220
Are they going out?

965
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:45,770
-Don't you think so?
-I don't know.

966
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,440
Holy crap!

967
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,480
I guess we can
use your looks for something.

968
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,440
What are you doing
that a rumor like that is being spread?

969
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,820
I'm going to quit the company.

970
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,160
