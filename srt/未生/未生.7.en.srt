1
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,760
Hey. Are you crazy?

2
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,600
What's wrong with you?

3
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,560
Goodness.

4
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,350
I told you to fix what's been deferred,

5
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,150
not evaluate my report.

6
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,900
That's not what I was trying to do.

7
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,690
As I was ordered to, I analyzed the...

8
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,570
Right. As you were analyzing it,
you found that

9
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,450
my report was not adequate for the market
and the materials were wrong!

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,960
That was just a suggestion that came up
while reviewing the report.

11
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,880
It needed revisions because it's been
a while since the report was written.

12
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,500
And additional materials were...

13
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,460
That's exactly what I'm saying.
You're saying that the report is useless.

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,590
-That's not what...
-Shut your mouth!

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,510
Mr. Ha.

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,050
Mr. Jung is looking for you.

17
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,410
This place is a trash bin.

18
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,000
Someone messes it up
and another needs to pick up after it.

19
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,300
I picked it up first.

20
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,760
It's mine.

21
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,970
A meeting to decide the new business plan
for Sales Team Three.

22
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,980
The Finance Team thinks
the Chinese rare resources would be good.

23
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,440
I can read too.

24
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,230
I can see that.

25
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,440
The evaluations for not only
the most favored A rated items,

26
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,570
the B and C rated items
are also reviewed once again.

27
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,660
B RATING

28
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,490
Do you think that the Iranian crude
will really not do well?

29
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,620
It keeps lingering in my head.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,920
Sir, I think it's best to stay safe
and stick with what's guaranteed.

31
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,380
It would be best to just go
with what's in the A ratings,

32
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,800
but Mr. Oh just can't seem
to let go of an item

33
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,220
in the B rating pile.

34
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,850
Things in Iran
are not going well these days.

35
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,690
The US has enforced embargo
on Iranian crude.

36
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,150
EU also seems a bit shaky as well.

37
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,360
You never know
when they will issue an embargo, too.

38
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,820
I know it's risky.

39
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,950
But I want to do it.

40
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,290
My instincts are acting up.

41
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,590
The go stone hid in the sleeve.

42
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,550
When you've been in the business
for this long, it just comes to you.

43
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,930
As gamblers hide a card in their hands,

44
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,600
go gamblers

45
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,770
hide the opponents stones in their sleeve.

46
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,560
Then let's send it to
the Risk Management Team for final review.

47
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,440
Okay.

48
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,780
Prepare the materials.
I will persuade the senior manager.

49
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,150
-Okay.
-Mr. Oh

50
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,860
is not trying to hide anything
from the company,

51
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,620
but one thing is for sure.
He is thinking of all the odds

52
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,160
and his senses are acting up,
and he is not letting it go.

53
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,290
The reason why a newbie like me
can see that is

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,290
because of Mr. Kim's expression.

55
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,130
As cautious as he is,
Mr. Oh is not thinking about

56
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
or worried about the data in front of him.

57
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,550
Isn't the China project safer?

58
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,220
Yes, sir. It is.
But the Iran project is more profitable.

59
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,430
As you know, if we retain crude,

60
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,640
it'll help Chemistry
and other teams as well.

61
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,230
Can you get the approval
from the Finance and Risk team?

62
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,150
At a time like this,
the risk is just too big.

63
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,700
I will do my best to get it approved.

64
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,990
It's not a good time
for the manager to do this.

65
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,160
The situation in Iran is a problem

66
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,210
but also the China project
was suggested by Mr. Kim.

67
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,630
He's pushing it.

68
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,960
Does Mr. Oh know that?

69
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,420
Of course, he does.

70
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,840
Then why?

71
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,590
He thinks that easy projects
can be done by anyone.

72
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,760
That's why he obsesses
over hard and risky projects.

73
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,180
That's what keeps him going.

74
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,890
I guess he's a very competitive person.

75
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,230
I wished he would lose
that side of him already.

76
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,190
To be honest, how many people his age
are still team manager?

77
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,070
He really needs to think
about performance evaluation more.

78
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,950
He needs to do clear and definite projects
and show results now.

79
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,040
Our manager really needs to get promoted.

80
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,040
-What can we do but do our best?
-What?

81
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,750
There's nothing we can do.

82
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,250
If he doesn't do it, he'll get drunk
and cause all kinds of problems.

83
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,840
It's been deferred.

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,810
It's been deferred?

85
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,600
We approved it,
but the Finance Team declined it.

86
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,980
Declined.

87
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,980
And declined, again.

88
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,780
Try to have that approved
by the Finance Team.

89
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,690
-What?
-You never know.

90
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,780
It might even be included
in the business plan next quarter.

91
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,830
She'll have a hard time.

92
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,330
It will never get approved
by the Finance Team.

93
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,080
Every quarter, we revised it,
and it was declined.

94
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,130
How is she going to persuade
the Finance Team?

95
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,760
But if she does,
whose project will it become?

96
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,180
If that happens, you and I both
need to commit suicide.

97
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,230
Why didn't you give her the suggestions
by the Finance Team?

98
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,690
She should work for that herself.
Why should I just give it?

99
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,940
If anything, I suppose she'll take it
to Mr. Oh again.

100
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,120
Are you a statue or something?

101
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,290
Sorry, sir.

102
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,830
Don't try to repay the favor
or anything like that.

103
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,870
You need competence for that too.

104
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,330
If an incompetent person tries to help,
it will just cause more problems.

105
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,880
-Send the file to the Steel Team.
-Yes, sir.

106
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,340
If a business plan

107
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,340
is declined by the Finance Team,
does that mean it's hopeless?

108
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,260
Yes.

109
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,270
It's difficult to get approval
from the Finance Team.

110
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,480
Even if the Finance Team members
approve the files,

111
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,190
there are lots of files that are declined
by their senior manager.

112
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,150
The Finance Team manager
is very strict and meticulous.

113
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,990
Even if you have a great record
of results, she'll look into everything.

114
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,840
If you're not completely prepared,
nine out of ten are declined.

115
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,170
Excuse me.

116
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,170
But

117
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,470
for some reason,
I think that the way she works

118
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,050
is very

119
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,970
sexy.

120
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,530
Yes? Who are you?

121
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,990
It's nothing.

122
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,750
I saw an old Hahoe mask then.

123
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,790
The sudden shock I felt
due to the disappointment.

124
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,380
It felt like I was hit by lightning

125
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,920
and my head split open.

126
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,340
You saw the Finance Team manager,
didn't you?

127
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,970
-The Finance Team manager?
-Yes, you said  Hahoe  mask.

128
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,180
Yes.

129
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,180
She's a nice and rational person.

130
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,720
She also listens to newbies.

131
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,810
She's a very open-minded person.

132
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,230
-Open...
-Just like

133
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,980
Seok-yul Han.

134
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,400
It's falling.

135
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,320
-Process this.
-Okay.

136
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,950
Da-in.

137
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,330
Did you review the wording?

138
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,710
Yes, I did.

139
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,670
-Where is the B/L draft?
-That's...

140
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,220
-Yes, sir.
-Not that one.

141
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,890
There was a slight problem,
so I'm revising it right now.

142
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,890
Yes. Alright, I will.

143
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,850
Mr. Kang.

144
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,270
These are the papers for approval.

145
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,600
Thank you.

146
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,320
And Mr. Kim wanted to know if
the shipment papers are under negotiation.

147
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,230
The negotiation will be tomorrow.

148
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,900
When the invoice packing is ready,

149
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,120
please have Mr. Kim give me a call.
Or you could call me as well.

150
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,370
Yes, sir.

151
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,300
Sir.

152
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,840
Don't we need to prepare business plans
for our team?

153
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,390
Don't worry. We are preparing them.

154
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,180
Why shouldn't I worry about it?
I'm part of the team, too.

155
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,810
Why...

156
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,110
Why are you doing this to me?

157
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,200
You're the type who makes
a big deal out of things, are you?

158
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,530
You want attention?

159
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,080
-Sir...
-Why am I doing this?

160
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,290
I hope this answers your question.

161
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,330
I don't think that
you are completely trained yet.

162
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,710
What?

163
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,800
But since you want something to do,

164
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,260
work on this.

165
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
I just

166
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,940
gave you work.

167
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,960
Prepare a graph on Excel.

168
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,060
What happened to your face?

169
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,280
Have you seen this
when you were in the Resource Team?

170
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,450
This is the carbon emission project.

171
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,240
This was deferred.

172
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,410
Right.

173
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,410
He wants to put this in the next quarter's
business plan,

174
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,910
but I can't understand why
it was deferred.

175
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,340
So did you say you can do it?
That you would have it approved?

176
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,300
I don't think that's
what they want to hear from you.

177
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,090
Just give in.

178
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,180
Just say that you're sorry, that
you can't do it, and that you need help.

179
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,570
As far as I know, it was approved
by the team members.

180
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,150
But the senior manager was hesitant.

181
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,700
The senior manager?

182
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,280
If you want to hear the right answer,
you should go and see the senior manager.

183
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,870
But I don't think it'll be that easy
to meet with her.

184
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,400
Just

185
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,310
give in.

186
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,870
It looks like it's going to rain.

187
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,660
You're right.

188
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,380
I think it'll just pass.

189
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,750
Do you want to have a drink after work?

190
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,260
What?

191
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,590
Let's talk crap about our bosses.

192
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,280
Dong-sik, did you find out
about the RMP for the Iranian project?

193
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,070
They said that they will review
the documents and get back to us.

194
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,240
-This is Geu-rae. Is this the Risk Team?
-Geu-rae!

195
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,160
-He's on the phone.
-Did you review the documents?

196
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,330
-The situation in Iran is being...
-Give me the papers.

197
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,290
Okay.

198
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,670
If the China office cooperates,
payment won't be a problem either.

199
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,500
Yes, the meeting is at three o'clock.

200
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,260
This is Mi-ra from Sales Team One.
Please check your email.

201
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,010
-Please hurry. Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

202
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,900
-Hey, Dong-sik.
-This is Geu-rae Jang.

203
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,490
Yes, the documents are ready.

204
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,870
As soon as Mr. Oh reviews it,
I will send it for approval.

205
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,780
Okay.

206
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,950
-This is Geu-rae Jang...
-It's raining.

207
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,460
Do you want to go for a drink after work?

208
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,380
I'm busy.

209
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,800
Hello, sir. Salute!

210
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,720
That fish head...

211
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,390
Yes, the email I requested
regarding the disposal of crude.

212
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,060
On days like this,

213
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,900
you should have a drink and release stress
you receive from your bosses.

214
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,320
But you and I both don't have
that sort of stress to release, do we?

215
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,360
Isn't that right, sir?

216
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,280
Please go away.

217
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,490
Sir.

218
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,910
How can co-workers not have a drink
and consider ourselves a...

219
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,790
-Dong-sik. The Iranian material.
-Yes, sir.

220
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,920
Isn't that right, sir?

221
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,460
-Please go away.
-What is it that you want to say?

222
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,630
Geu-rae, wrap things up,
and go have a drink.

223
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,340
This guy is right.

224
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,840
-No, it's okay.
-Baek-ki.

225
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,720
Let's have a drink after work.

226
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,510
The four of us.

227
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,930
Thank you, sir.

228
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,720
Thank you, sir.

229
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,690
Hello.

230
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,410
The two people whom I wanted to have
a drink with the most declined.

231
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,460
-Let's go.
-Why?

232
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,420
This is somewhere you should come
for a date. It's not a man's style.

233
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,500
Seok-yul.

234
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,930
What is this?
You said you're not drinking.

235
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,120
Young-yi, if you had a problem like that,
you should've discussed it with me.

236
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,000
Baek-ki has his own problems too.

237
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,580
He can't be counseling you.

238
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,340
Look at Baek-ki's face.
He's feeling so awkward.

239
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,130
He can't say no,
but he has no advice to give you.

240
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,010
Young-yi, you can't
put people through that.

241
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,930
Here you go.

242
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,220
Here you go.

243
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,260
Let's go. Look, it's messy.

244
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,850
If it was me,

245
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,060
I would go to the senior manager
of the Finance Team.

246
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,980
It's not that easy.

247
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,190
The company has its process.

248
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,320
And she is very weird.

249
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,080
The back
and front are completely different.

250
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,620
The problem and the solution
are completely different.

251
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,290
It's even harder than
an equation of higher degree.

252
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,130
But Mr. Sung says she a good person.

253
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,540
She's rational and opened-minded.

254
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,340
He says she listens to newbies, too.

255
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,880
Even Mr. Oh said
that she's not so uptight.

256
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,470
You can't say that just because
it's not your problem.

257
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,970
Oh, I understand.

258
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,560
It might not have been shared with you.

259
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,820
The process

260
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,740
might be more important than you think.

261
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,950
It's kind of like a promise.

262
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,320
A lot of people trust that promise,

263
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,700
prepare for it, plan for it,
and execute it.

264
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,160
If you trust that promise,
you shouldn't at least be stupid.

265
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,880
Let me try it.

266
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,470
-Young-yi.
-I'll try it.

267
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,060
She might compliment me
for being super ambitious.

268
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,100
Okay. I vote for getting the compliment.

269
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,230
Cheers.

270
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,530
Get out.

271
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,660
-What?
-Don't you see I'm working?

272
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,280
Right, I'm sorry.

273
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,660
You said you're Young-yi An
from Resource Team Two, right?

274
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,790
-Yes.
-I'm not sure why you skipped

275
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,210
the deputy and the managers
and came straight to me,

276
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,210
but you shouldn't do that.

277
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,670
Your bosses are the ones
who will get in trouble, right?

278
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,930
I'm sorry.

279
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,760
Get out.

280
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,020
It's 600 out of 20.

281
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,730
BAEK-KI JANG

282
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,900
I told you not to go.

283
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,530
Do you even know what you were doing?

284
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,330
You were so confident when you went there.

285
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,670
You're not crying, are you?

286
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,640
Hey, what is she doing?

287
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,770
Hello. I'm Young-yi An.

288
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,310
You've got mail from Young-yi An.

289
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,200
If you're late, you're late.
What's with the excuses?

290
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,120
Just hurry up and take it out.

291
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,700
-Come to my office.
-So why did you get it wrong then?

292
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,370
You should have done it right
the first time.

293
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,080
I'm going to the senior manager's office
of the Finance Team.

294
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,170
What?

295
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,630
Come in.

296
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,350
Thank you for your apology letter.
It was a masterpiece.

297
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,440
I like people who admit their mistakes.

298
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,230
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,020
So, you're working
on the carbon emission project?

300
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,320
-Yes.
-Why?

301
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,200
You know that it's been deferred
by our team

302
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,490
for a year and a half, right?

303
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,700
-Yes, I know.
-Then

304
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,040
why is the Resource Team telling a newbie
to try and make it work?

305
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,160
Why?

306
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,180
This is the report
regarding the carbon emission project.

307
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,640
By tomorrow, submit a report
from the Finance Team's point of view

308
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,480
on why you think
this project was deferred.

309
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,730
What?

310
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,930
I think it's a very generous offer
given to a newbie

311
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,470
that ignored the process and procedures.

312
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,640
I understand.

313
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,730
I want to see it
before I get to work tomorrow.

314
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,770
-Yes, ma'am.
-From the Resource Team's point of view.

315
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,280
I will write the report
from the Resource Team's point of view

316
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,990
and also another one
considering that report.

317
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,740
Man, what's with her?

318
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,160
I'm sure she heard rumors of Young-yi.

319
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,160
You know how she is, right?

320
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,120
She's probably enjoys being reminded
of her newbie days.

321
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,720
I'll get going now.

322
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,350
Okay.

323
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,190
Yes, sir. I'm on my way now.

324
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,360
I reviewed the difference
between last year and this year.

325
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,860
I reviewed and edited it.
I'll bring it now.

326
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,370
Yes, I checked it again.
It doesn't look like there are any issues.

327
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,790
Looks like you're going to work late.
You should have dinner, not coffee.

328
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Are you leaving for the day?

329
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,050
Yes. It's a bit embarrassing, though.

330
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,340
It's not as embarrassing as what happened
to me at the senior manager's office.

331
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,640
Wow.

332
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,810
-You're really doing it.
-It's not over yet.

333
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,810
I need to know why it was deferred
to be able to revise it.

334
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,310
But I still don't understand
why it was deferred.

335
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,490
I bought it yesterday
when I was getting my hangover meds.

336
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,410
Because you probably don't care
about it leaving a scar,

337
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,950
and you will probably scratch off
the scab.

338
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,790
Thank you.

339
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,060
Keep up the good work.

340
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,510
Do you want to take a break?

341
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,620
I'm sorry for suggesting that.

342
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,740
Maybe Baek-ki was right.

343
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,500
No, it was a good thing.

344
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,460
If you want to get a goal,

345
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,670
you have to kick the ball first.

346
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,130
If that's so...

347
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,090
We're both having issues
because of deferred projects.

348
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,560
Actually, Mr. Kim tried to stop Mr. Oh.

349
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,810
Because it's already been determined
from the top.

350
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,690
I wonder how Mr. Oh is going
to get it through?

351
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,560
He's going to meet with the manager

352
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,280
and the senior manager
to try persuading them.

353
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,610
Trying to view things
from the opponent's point of view

354
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,950
to make it work.

355
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,450
I think that's Mr. Oh's strategy.

356
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,710
What?

357
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,760
Your team seems

358
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,350
to be a great team.

359
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,990
Trying to view things
from the opponent's point of view

360
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,360
to make it work.

361
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,530
To make

362
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,990
it work?

363
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,960
I was thoughtless.

364
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,210
Is it not working out?

365
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,050
I don't have a clue.

366
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,760
I could have just written it,
but I didn't want to be deceitful.

367
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,510
I'm sorry. Please accept my apology.

368
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,600
I'm a bit disappointed.

369
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,730
I thought that you

370
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,650
would not spend that time just
to come up with that conclusion.

371
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,610
I didn't write it,
but I did find a few things.

372
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,900
Really?

373
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,030
First of all, I learned that even

374
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,780
with the same report, each team's stance

375
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,240
could result in different understanding
of the report.

376
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,910
The Sales Team may say it has potential,

377
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,710
but for the Finance Team,
it may sound like

378
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,750
it should be reviewed once again.

379
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,250
So when it's written
that it has positive feedback,

380
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,720
it might sound like,
nothing has been decided upon yet.

381
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,510
That's what I learned.

382
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,640
-And?
-The biggest benefit I got is

383
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,260
knowing a bit
about the Finance Team's procedure

384
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,970
where the budget is executed.

385
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,270
The sales numbers
that were anticipated in my head

386
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,060
had been re-priced
through a more reasonable basis

387
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,610
by the Finance Team.

388
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,530
I learned that even through that process,
there are projects that we can do

389
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,650
and projects that we can't do.

390
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,530
And through that, the projects are rated.

391
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,700
C RATING

392
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,620
RETURNED

393
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:59,290
From now on, if my projects are deferred,

394
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,710
I will not think about what went wrong.

395
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,040
I would think about what I didn't fulfill.

396
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,630
That was better than a report.

397
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,680
Go back now. I'll think of a punishment.

398
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,680
Okay.

399
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,310
What was your major?

400
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,350
It was Political Science.

401
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,810
It suits you.

402
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,650
Did you study Accounting?

403
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,480
-I'm studying it right now.
-Okay. Learn it quickly.

404
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,610
Accounting is the language of business.

405
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,830
Thank you.

406
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,340
She's pretty good.

407
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,826
Baek-ki, is the Excel sheet ready?

408
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,730
Here you go.

409
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,370
Baek-ki, may talk to you?

410
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,720
Is there a problem?

411
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,090
I did it as you ordered.
I also encoded the data.

412
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,390
What kind of format is this?

413
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,160
Didn't you receive the training about
the One International standard format?

414
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,580
I thought that I can revise it
after you've reviewed the data.

415
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,460
It's so busy here.
What do you think you're doing?

416
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,380
Who told you to process things
as you wish?

417
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,800
Baek-ki, don't you know the process?

418
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,240
Review the data? That's basic.

419
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,740
Are you telling me
to find the hidden message or something?

420
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,790
And revising the format
after the data has been reviewed?

421
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,790
What kind of company processes
their work like that?

422
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,170
If you want to work elsewhere,

423
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,090
you may leave now,

424
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,390
Even if an embargo is not enforced...

425
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,440
Meeting with the vendors
regarding the Iranian project.

426
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:41,070
It started late
due to the other team running overtime,

427
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,780
there's also a slight difference
in opinion.

428
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,440
Let's try to make it work.

429
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,160
I must report it to Mr. Oh by noon,

430
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,470
and Mr. Kim must meet
with a buyer at the same time.

431
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,930
We are both quite anxious.

432
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,060
We ended up just skimming through

433
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,480
what we really needed to confirm
and left the vendor's office.

434
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,610
The situation in Iran is the problem.
It'll get better, right?

435
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,990
If the situation changes,
we must review the report again, don't we?

436
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,870
Why? Do you think it won't work?

437
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,240
Well, I'm not sure.

438
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,410
What a hassle.

439
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,710
It's not optimistic nor pessimistic,

440
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,960
but I think our manager is being
optimistic about the situation.

441
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,000
But we should still have a backup plan.

442
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,920
I'll come in as soon as I'm done.

443
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,670
Goodbye.

444
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,220
We don't have time to go through these.

445
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,730
I'm sure it's fine.

446
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,480
It hasn't changed much from before.

447
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,280
If you're not sure,
you should review it again.

448
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,450
Were you unsure about this
during the meeting?

449
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,450
If you are unsure,
it's best to review it once more.

450
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,580
As your senses let you know what's good,
you should review them if it's not.

451
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,220
Sir, I'm sorry.

452
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,520
There are a few things we still need
to review.

453
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,720
Could we postpone the meeting?

454
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,980
Yes. I apologize.

455
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,210
There's nothing wrong, right?

456
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,580
Yes, sir, and the revisions
were done accurately.

457
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,470
I'm sorry. I made it troublesome.
I should've kept quiet.

458
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,680
No, it's fine.

459
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,800
It's best to avoid the risky part
of the business

460
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,970
which is becoming a racehorse
that just runs forward.

461
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,930
That's how it self-destructs.

462
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,890
It's good that you stopped it.

463
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,770
-Sir, you're still here?
-You're back, sir.

464
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,570
Good timing.

465
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,400
Let's go when it's good.

466
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
Shall we?

467
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,990
Sir, we'll go and brief you now. Okay.

468
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,200
Okay.

469
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,460
Yes, this is Sales Team Three...

470
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,630
What?

471
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,300
I understand.

472
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,840
Sir, it was a call from Iran.

473
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,800
EU enforced the embargo.

474
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,930
Sir.

475
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,980
You already predicted the embargo, right?

476
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,610
-Yes.
-Then you know it'll be a long-shot.

477
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,070
Yes.

478
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,160
Then we're done. Drop it.

479
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,410
We can do it.

480
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,050
How?

481
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,220
You know that it will be hard
to retain it if the embargo is enforced.

482
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,520
You know the risks
but you still want to do it?

483
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,810
Mr. Oh.

484
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,350
Just because you think you can do it,
doesn't mean you can.

485
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,730
There's no way we can bring it in.

486
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,570
It's possible if we go through Turkey.

487
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,900
Where?

488
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,360
It shares a border with Iran,
and they are allies.

489
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,280
They're also not a member of EU.

490
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,870
They also import energy from Iran.

491
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,750
It will not be easy
to participate in the embargo.

492
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,660
We can import it through Turkey.

493
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,630
I also have a long-time vendor in Turkey.

494
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,000
He's talking about Gyuzel.

495
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,590
They have a good relationship with Iran.

496
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,630
There will be a fee,
but they can bring it from Iran.

497
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,390
Turkey.

498
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,860
How does it look for the Risk Team?

499
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,400
Yes, I think it's good.

500
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,650
Yes, sir. It sounds good to me, too.

501
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,070
We have quite a large infrastructure
in Turkey.

502
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,200
Cheers.

503
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,670
We just need to wait
for the director's approval.

504
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,590
It's just part of the process.

505
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:23,970
Good job.

506
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,140
What's wrong?

507
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,680
What's wrong with me?

508
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,140
You don't look happy.

509
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,190
No, it's not that.

510
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,810
What is it? Tell me.

511
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,650
Will Mr. Kim be okay?

512
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,320
He really wanted to do the China project.

513
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,500
-We didn't order that.
-I did.

514
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,300
Whether or not it will end up
being good or not,

515
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,220
it will be decided soon.

516
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,580
Yes?

517
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,370
Do the China project.

518
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,380
GRILLED MEAT

519
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,810
Keep it safe.

520
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,980
This is our team's asset.

521
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,270
Yes, sure.

522
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,280
Let's go.

523
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,110
Where are you going?
We have to finish this.

524
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,200
Excuse me, please give us the grill.

525
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,460
Oil is usually 70% rejected.

526
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,170
It's just the beginning.

527
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,220
It was just a warm up.

528
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,300
Are you going to leave the theater
just after the trailers?

529
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,680
Sir.

530
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,470
The grill is ready.

531
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,180
If the grill is ready,
we should cook the meat.

532
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,190
Excuse me, take this back,

533
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,650
and give us the Korean beef.

534
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,040
Why are you drinking out of the bottle?

535
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,840
Why did you drink again today?

536
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,800
Because I'm happy!

537
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,380
You're the only one happy, okay?

538
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,680
Gosh.

539
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,260
That's right. I drank because I was happy.

540
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,350
What's wrong with that?

541
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,600
From now on,

542
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,860
I'm going to grill just
the top A class Korean beef.

543
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,780
Drink up. Drink it.

544
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,070
Drink this one. What is your problem?

545
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,780
Gosh, you must be crazy.

546
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,750
No, stop. What are you doing?

547
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,540
-Come here.
-What's your problem?

548
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,590
I wonder how Mr. Oh felt?

549
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,190
IRANIAN CRUDE EXPORT

550
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,780
The newspaper clipping
that he personally collected,

551
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,160
and all of the memos made.

552
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,950
Clipping the articles of
the fast-paced international conditions,

553
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,760
I wonder if he thought
of the same things I did.

554
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,390
Yes, I know.

555
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,230
Just one copy?

556
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,190
It was approved last July. Yes.

557
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,020
Mr. Oh acted like nothing had happened.

558
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,610
He dove straight into the next project.

559
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,110
-Did you check the conditions?
-Yes, sir.

560
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,320
I'll get back to you after I check it.

561
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,530
Okay. It will probably be next August.

562
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,000
There is a small box at my desk.

563
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,250
Geu-rae!

564
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,050
Did you collect all the materials
from the economic research center?

565
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:35,960
Yes.

566
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,380
The more my box gets full,

567
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,800
the more I will learn.

568
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,850
Okay. Let's have a meeting.

569
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,310
PREDICTED VIEW

570
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,400
It's become tougher for us.

571
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,990
The situation in China has changed
a lot since it was first planned.

572
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,580
China limited the quota
for export companies recently.

573
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,330
China

574
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,130
is supplying earth resources
to 90 percent of the world.

575
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,170
If so, importing it is difficult.

576
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,130
Why aren't other countries developing?

577
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,340
Mining the earth resources actually
harms the environment quite a bit.

578
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,890
That's why China has issued a quota on it.

579
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,760
By looking at today's report,

580
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,350
it means we should lay low for a while.

581
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,230
I think it's best to delay this one.

582
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,770
Mr. Oh.

583
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,530
Try to mobilize everything possible.
I'll back you up.

584
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:40,820
I don't think backing up will do any good.
The situation is just not good.

585
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,450
That's why it's business.

586
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,620
What kind of trade does not carry
that much risk?

587
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,160
You tried to push the Iranian project
regardless of the risks.

588
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,170
Why are you hesitating on this one?

589
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,640
You know that I reported this one, right?

590
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,220
You can't cry like a baby.

591
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,890
Just because your project failed,
don't play around with mine.

592
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:50,540
We'll do it.

593
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,920
Sir, it's not yet...

594
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:54,960
Let's just do it.

595
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,680
-Sir, these are the reports.
-Let's see.

596
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,590
Here you go.

597
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,430
See, look at this.

598
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,270
It says that everyone turned domestic
after the super cycle.

599
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,060
The situation is bad.

600
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,440
It has to work out.

601
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,150
Call China tomorrow and set up a meeting.

602
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,440
They can come, or we can go.

603
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,490
Sir, this will be reviewed again, right?

604
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,820
The reports from the research center
keeps coming in.

605
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,540
This is the senior manager's item.

606
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,120
We have to do it.

607
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,460
I know that. But the situation changed
a lot since then.

608
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,670
I know it did.

609
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,170
A lot of time has passed.

610
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,840
It's because I brought up
the deferred item again.

611
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,640
Whatever it may be,

612
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,310
the safe project was delayed because of me

613
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,230
and the situation change affected the item
because I delayed it.

614
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:53,940
It's our fault.

615
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,570
The senior manager is at stake,
so we need to succeed.

616
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,490
We have to do it.

617
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:34,840
FINAL REPORT

618
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:39,804
How many people his age
are still team manager?

619
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,730
He needs to do clear and definite projects
and show results now.

620
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:46,420
Our manager really needs to get promoted.

621
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,710
What can we do but do our best?

622
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,090
That's right.

623
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,430
I must do my best in doing my part.

624
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,430
You're the only one here?

625
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:56,850
Sir.

626
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,220
Is everyone out?

627
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,100
Yes, they are.

628
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,520
I see.

629
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,540
Tell Mr. Oh that I'm looking for him.

630
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:24,870
Yes, sir.

631
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,010
Hey.

632
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:35,260
It's much more dangerous than you said.

633
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:38,760
Don't you know that everyone is resetting
everything related to China?

634
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,220
We're trying to find
a supplement to do it.

635
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,900
I told you from the beginning all
the precautions you need to take.

636
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,190
Yes, from the three items,
you had chosen...

637
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,650
I'm not talking about that.

638
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,570
From all of the items that you brought,
it was the safest one.

639
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,530
So all I did was to approve it.

640
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,950
The project we are preparing now
is the idea that you...

641
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,620
It's an idea. Just an idea.

642
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,210
Is an idea a report? Is it
a business plan? Is it a proposal?

643
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,670
We can do well. It won't hurt you...

644
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:13,050
What did you say?
What are you trying to make me?

645
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,630
I'm sorry.

646
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,640
Anyway, do your best
preparing for your item.

647
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,930
Report to me right away.

648
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:24,890
And remove the part in the report
where it says it's my idea.

649
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,060
What kind of report is that?

650
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:32,690
Then what about the backup in China?

651
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:36,450
Don't you guys have hands?
What do you mean backup?

652
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:38,280
The company is your backup.
What else do you need?

653
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,210
Okay. I understand.

654
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,800
Come here.

655
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,720
-Where are you going?
-The senior manager called me in.

656
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,730
He suddenly wants to see
the business materials we're working on.

657
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:11,560
-Why?
-It's obvious.

658
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,400
He wants to have shares on them.

659
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,530
In the last progress report, he gave
his input with one of our business.

660
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,360
He wants to take shares with that.

661
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,490
But

662
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:25,540
he was saying that your team's
business report was useless.

663
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,750
Do it right.

664
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,370
What did he say?

665
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,210
He said that you are going
in the wrong direction.

666
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,630
It's not what he wants.

667
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,340
Just be more cooperative.

668
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,930
You need to stop pushing
only what you want.

669
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,390
You should suck up from time to time.

670
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,810
I feel bad getting promoted
because of you.

671
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,470
Goodness.

672
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,060
Sir!

673
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:52,730
Yes.

674
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,790
Sir. I just heard that...

675
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:11,920
Leave.

676
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,340
I need to review this.

677
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,630
Don't worry about the cost

678
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,300
and find all the companies

679
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,430
that have a quota
for exporting earth resources.

680
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,600
Okay.

681
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,900
Geu-rae. Go with him.

682
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,230
Yes, sir.

683
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,790
If you really want to do it, you can.

684
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,120
But all of the companies with a quota
will have different pricing.

685
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:55,080
It can backfire on you.

686
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,380
We'll change our business plan, too.

687
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,670
B quota?

688
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,130
It's smuggling.
You'll get into big trouble.

689
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:06,300
A big company like yours should not deal
with lowlives like them.

690
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,720
I can't believe that smuggling

691
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,350
is 60 percent higher than legal importing.

692
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,360
Unless we smuggle it in,
it will be difficult to get enough.

693
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,320
It's best to delay it.
But our team has no right to decide.

694
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,820
What is the senior manager like?

695
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,490
-Who?
-Mr. Kim.

696
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,160
He's just a white collared businessman.

697
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,830
He's just totally fit for the company.
There are no better words

698
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,330
to describe him.

699
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
He has good senses,
he makes quick decisions,

700
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,130
he's quick at the mouth,
and he moves quickly as well.

701
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,550
A salary man has nothing besides paychecks

702
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:44,340
and promotions.

703
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:52,220
Do you think paycheck and promotions
are everything, too?

704
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,020
Up until now, yes.
I couldn't find anything better yet.

705
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,520
Let's just save our manager.

706
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:01,980
No, let's save our team first.

707
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,990
CDM BUSINESS POSSIBILITY SCOPE

708
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,140
You're so annoying.

709
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,350
Hey.

710
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:42,270
Oh, no.

711
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,360
You should watch where you're going.

712
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,410
You have weak legs.

713
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,580
Legs are very important for men, right?

714
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,250
Don't take the elevator anymore.

715
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,880
Take the stairs.

716
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,090
-Aren't you getting on?
-Yes.

717
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,640
Thank you.

718
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,770
Is your foot okay?

719
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:23,610
What's wrong with my foot?

720
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,990
I told you to come to my team.

721
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,280
You're having a hard time
because you didn't listen to me.

722
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,210
The carbon emission project
is pretty good, right?

723
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,710
But it's difficult
to process it in Korea, right?

724
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,840
Yes.

725
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,510
No matter how much I try, it's difficult

726
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,720
to meet the Finance Team's standards
for the import.

727
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:52,890
Right.

728
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:58,310
When did you learn how to speak Russian?
You seemed pretty good at it.

729
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:59,230
In college.

730
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,310
I was there as an exchange student
for about a year. What about you?

731
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,860
I was a diplomat there
for a couple of years.

732
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:07,820
I learned a lot of Russian, then.

733
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,570
I liked Russia since I was a kid.

734
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,490
There's a Russian movie "White Nights,"
do you know it?

735
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,870
Mikhail Baryshnikov.
He's a Russian dancer.

736
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:17,950
Do you know him?

737
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,290
I saw that movie in junior high.

738
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,790
I was so moved that I promised myself
I would go to Russia someday.

739
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,920
Do you know Russia's Kiev Opera House?

740
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:32,430
Mikhail Baryshnikov dances there.

741
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,720
The song was by
Vladimir Semyonovich Vysotsky.

742
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,890
You don't know, do you?

743
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,730
He's a very famous revolutionary singer.
He's a wild horse.

744
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,710
Russian movies have a tragic beauty.

745
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,510
It's actually an American film.

746
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,430
-It's American?
-Yes.

747
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,890
Not Russian?

748
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,610
I guess went a bit overboard.

749
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,820
I heard that your earth resources project

750
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,950
is having a hard time
because of the quota.

751
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,540
Yes. It's so frustrating.

752
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,960
Who knew China would be like this?

753
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,540
I go there more often than
I go to my parents' house.

754
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,170
I had no idea.

755
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,720
You know the beacon does not shine
on its own base.

756
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,260
That's right.

757
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,810
The beacon does not shine on its own base?

758
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:13,070
Okay. I need to get going now.

759
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:16,530
-Thank you for the coffee.
-No problem.

760
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,120
Overboard?

761
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,800
Thank you, sir.

762
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,430
The beacon does not shine on its own base.

763
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,020
MAIN IDEA

764
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,730
MORE THAN 20 MILLION TONS
OF RARE EARTH RESOURCES

765
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,320
-Yes.
-Okay.

766
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,160
Mr. Oh, did you get something?

767
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,160
Yes.

768
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,580
There's news.

769
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,370
-What is it?
-I think I found a solution.

770
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,830
-What?
-The Korean Mineral Resources Corporation

771
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,090
is pushing to develop
North Korean earth resources.

772
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,050
Really?

773
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,130
There are approximately
20 million tons that they have there.

774
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:22,470
Once the development takes place,
it will have enough for us to retain.

775
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:27,850
Call the planning department
and set up a meeting right away.

776
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,900
-Let's have the meeting in one hour.
-Yes, sir.

777
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,480
Sir, how about these?

778
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,780
Start on it.

779
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,200
As soon as I'm done reviewing
Team Three's item, I'll call you in.

780
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,160
Aren't you reporting our item
to the director?

781
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,540
Who said I'll report yours?

782
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,580
Team Three's item began with my idea.

783
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,080
But...

784
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,340
Sir.

785
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,590
The senior manager suddenly changed
his mind.

786
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,630
That man.
He should've just push through yours.

787
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,970
That's why. It's driving me crazy.

788
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,260
It's just a formal act.

789
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,060
Team Two's item will be reported, too.

790
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:12,270
I'm not worried that our team's item
be reported or not.

791
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,520
It must be an item that the senior manager
is pushing.

792
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,860
Sir, please help
persuade our senior manager.

793
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,880
This is my first official meeting.

794
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,980
We only met with them to negotiate
the management of the industrial complex.

795
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,520
We have not certified it yet.

796
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,190
The research center,
the government department,

797
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,360
and the minister set up a hotline.

798
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,190
As soon as it's checked,
they are reviewed.

799
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,650
Although this situation is...

800
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,030
The planning department gathered all
of the company's resources

801
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,660
and received the most updated information.

802
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,910
That's right.

803
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:03,580
It's not the right time
to use the economic cooperation.

804
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,790
Yes, we need
to find the right political timing.

805
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:08,790
The information gathered

806
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,550
is organized by the two managers.

807
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:12,750
Everything is being cleared up.

808
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,550
The stock for earth resources are falling.

809
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,800
Everything discussed
in the meeting is being recorded,

810
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,510
and I am in charge of that.

811
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,220
Team Three, give me a report
every morning and afternoon.

812
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,680
-Yes, sir.
-Let's end it here.

813
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,730
-Thank you.
-Good job.

814
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:32,860
Sir.

815
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,280
Hey.

816
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,610
-Hello.
-Hi.

817
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,450
-Hello.
-What's going on?

818
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,450
Do you have some time this evening?

819
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,040
Is there something you want to talk about?

820
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,790
Let's have dinner.

821
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,840
Then shall we?
I have a few hours to spare.

822
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,470
He's just too much.

823
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,140
Don't worry about it.

824
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:08,140
The manager is totally set
on our idea this time

825
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,100
They're trying to turn it around again.

826
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,980
The promotion at the end
of the year should definitely be yours.

827
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:17,570
He's just too much.

828
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:21,160
-Mr. Lee.
-Just sort these out.

829
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:24,200
Geu-rae, prepare the meeting minutes,
and send it to me right away.

830
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,120
Yes, sir.

831
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:28,580
How long is it taking you to prepare that?

832
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,170
Don't elaborate. Just use keywords
so it'll be easy to understand!

833
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,290
The shouts of Mr. Ko
from Sales Team Two were eager.

834
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,670
A salary man has nothing besides paychecks

835
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,380
and promotions.

836
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:41,640
Take this out! Write one that will work!

837
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:43,260
Do you think this will work?

838
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,060
Nothing is easy.

839
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,560
Use your head!

840
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,080
DAEHYUN STEEL CO.L

841
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,250
Wow.

842
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,960
Mr. Kang is really good.

843
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:18,210
The Finance Department
will definitely approve this one.

844
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:21,470
It's absolutely perfect.

845
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:27,890
Our deputy manager, Mr. Sung,
has really good character.

846
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,520
What? Do you want to go for a drink?

847
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,150
Aren't you leaving?

848
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,070
PRINT

849
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,660
CONFIRM

850
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,930
-Let's wrap it up.
-Okay.

851
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,480
-Did you confirm with the restaurant?
-Yes.

852
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,400
Yes, sir.

853
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:28,120
She's really something else.

854
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,870
What's wrong?

855
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,950
Did she mess something up?

856
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,040
We're going to have to add it
to the next quarter's business plan.

857
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:37,960
What?

858
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,130
-Oh, man.
-What is it?

859
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,380
What is this?

860
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:46,720
Take the Korean carbon emission
and send it to Russia?

861
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:47,720
Is this possible?

862
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,100
It seems possible.

863
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,520
This

864
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:58,440
is pretty good.
It's going to pass the Finance Team.

865
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,320
I know.

866
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:01,690
Tough bitch.

867
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,240
Now I get it.

868
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:07,110
Mr. Jo from Textile Team Three said
she was kind of scary.

869
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,990
Now I'm getting scared of her too.

870
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:12,950
I really don't like her. How about you?

871
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,540
I don't know.

872
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,250
Let's go to our happy hour.

873
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:18,170
Okay.

874
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:23,880
You know where it is, right?

875
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,120
Is everything good?

876
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:54,870
Yes.

877
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:56,750
I think so.

878
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,250
Sir, this is the research material.

879
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:07,050
And this is the market research.

880
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,340
Fine. We can use it as a finalized item.

881
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:11,680
But what I'm saying is,

882
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:13,970
let's think of it as confirmed.

883
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:17,020
Mr. Oh is building a business.

884
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,310
-Let's give him some help.
-But sir,

885
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:22,060
there are still a lot you need
to help us with.

886
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:23,690
What do you mean confirmed?

887
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,280
Let's help him out with his item.

888
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,160
-Jeez.
-Sir.

889
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:35,740
Call Mr. Oh in.

890
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:41,290
Why is Mr. Ko in a restaurant?

891
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,630
Sir.

892
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,100
You're here.

893
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,560
What? The whole team came?

894
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:13,660
Here. you two have a drink.

895
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:14,820
-Okay.
-Okay.

896
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,380
Let's go with the easy route.

897
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:35,010
I will push Team Two first
rather than Team Three.

898
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,010
Yes, sir. Thank you.

899
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:38,770
Okay.

900
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,770
We're going to expand.

901
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,560
We still need to wait
for the policy of North Korea,

902
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,110
so let's prepare for it
and expand the project.

903
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:52,490
Resources should not be done
in small portions.

904
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,740
-I understand.
-Do you have any problem with that?

905
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:58,370
-No.
-No!

906
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,500
Okay, then. Let's drink.

907
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,170
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

908
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:08,800
You're the best!

909
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,970
It was a good decision, sir.

910
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,010
Mr. Choi.

911
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,970
What brings you here?

912
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,930
Our Resource Team is having a happy hour.

913
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,060
I see.

914
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:27,110
I heard a familiar voice,
so I opened the door.

915
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:29,230
We were having dinner, too.

916
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,480
Dinner is pretty wild here.

917
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:34,070
The parboiled fish is very good today.

918
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,950
NORTH KOREAN EARTH RESOURCES PROJECT

919
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:38,450
Hold on.

920
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,410
-May I see that file?
-Of course.

921
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:47,750
-Earth resources?
-Yes.

922
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Shouldn't the Resource Team
be doing this instead?

923
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,840
Isn't this the Resource Team's item?

924
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,090
-Mr. Ma.
-Yes, sir.

925
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:00,390
Didn't you talk about this before?

926
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,730
Yes.

927
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:09,150
We're getting the report ready
as we speak.

928
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:11,230
Of course this should be done
by the Resource Team.

929
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:16,110
Mr. Kim, since it's overlapping,
why don't we just make it one item?

930
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:21,700
What?

931
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:24,790
Yes, sir.

932
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:28,120
Why go through all this
when we have professionals?

933
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,420
Find an item that fits Sales Team Three.

934
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:34,710
This is on me. Enjoy your dinner.

935
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:41,640
Find items that fit you.

936
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:45,100
Jeez.

937
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:00,160
Sir, why don't you sit back here.

938
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,630
Enjoy your dinner.

939
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:14,050
-Manager Ko, let's go.
-Yes, sir.

940
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:19,970
Sir.

941
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,510
Sir!

942
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,900
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

943
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,010
We ate without talking.

944
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,430
There was a hunger within us

945
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,430
that we needed to fill.

946
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,570
It was a day we could not stay sober.

947
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:20,990
And

948
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:24,160
I'm sorry

949
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,870
that I'm just a newbie that can't even

950
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:31,460
comfort you.

951
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:44,230
I'm going to be in big trouble.

952
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:10,260
Did she change the passcode?

953
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,060
Do you know what time it is?

954
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,730
What's wrong?

955
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:45,120
Honey. Turn on the light.

956
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:47,250
Turn on the light.

957
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:54,720
I turned it on. Is it bright now?

958
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:58,180
Why do you drink every day?

959
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,060
Why do you drink
every time you go to work?

960
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:03,480
Can't you live without drinking?

961
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:06,400
-No.
-Why not?

962
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:10,980
Because it tastes good.

963
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:12,780
What?

964
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,290
Do you know what it tastes like?

965
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,210
For god's sake.

966
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:46,980
Do you guys know what it tastes like?

967
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:52,780
Do you?

968
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,220
