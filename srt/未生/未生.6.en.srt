1
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,190
I was the first person to arrive at work.

2
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,570
If felt great to be the only one here.

3
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,620
It was because I felt like I was the one
opening business for the day.

4
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,290
When I was a kid,
a stationery shop owner would always

5
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,670
open his shop and clean the front.

6
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,510
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

7
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,840
-Are you going to school?
-I loved how the clean alley felt,

8
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,510
and I started the day by going past it.

9
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,520
It felt great to think that I was the one
opening business for the day like him.

10
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,860
I checked various notice boards
on our internal server.

11
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,410
I also read news articles
on various topics on the intranet.

12
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,830
There was an appropriate amount
of tension and ease of mind.

13
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,670
-It was just like a stylish drama scene...
-Oh, they're wrong?

14
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:56,550
-I'm sorry, we sent the wrong data.
- until my boss showed up.

15
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,260
I have a file in Excel.
I'll send it right away.

16
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,560
Goodbye.

17
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,690
Yes, Mr. Song.

18
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,900
I'm working on the report now.

19
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,230
Yes, I'll call you back.

20
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,080
-Sir, is there anything I can do?
-Just wait for a while.

21
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,290
This is really urgent.

22
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,800
Hurray!

23
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,340
Yes!

24
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,010
Hold on. Let go.

25
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,680
You did great, sir.

26
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,230
Just a moment. I'll put him on.

27
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,850
Great work.

28
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,610
It's all thanks to you!

29
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,820
If you come to Korea,
dinner will be on me.

30
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,150
Yes. See you soon. Bye.

31
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,280
So you finally closed the Uzbekistan deal?

32
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,450
Yes! You bet!

33
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,870
These are the moments I live for!

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,420
Congratulations!

35
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,840
You said that tie was a present
from your kids, and it's working magic.

36
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
You owe it all to that tie.

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,880
Hey, everyone.

38
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
Let's have a cup of coffee.

39
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,550
My treat.

40
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,810
Let's go, Geu-rae.

41
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,680
Darn it.

42
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,110
-Good morning, sir.
-Oh, hi.

43
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,580
I knew his "treat" was really just this.

44
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,910
Cool it.
That's why I'm preparing it myself.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,630
Don't you know?
This is the golden ratio for coffee.

46
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,500
-Thank you.
-Okay.

47
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,710
We just need to resolve
the Willmart project.

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,630
Yes sir.

49
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,640
Here. It's hot. Be careful.

50
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,430
Go ahead. Drink up.

51
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,930
Why can't they sign the deal
even though we passed the cycle test?

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,810
Aren't the data guaranteed
after doing the test run 150,000 times?

53
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,730
That's an issue too,

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,230
but the bigger issue seems to be the cost.

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,360
Did you show them the appropriate price?

56
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,370
If you'll consider production costs
and general expenses, that's reasonable!

57
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,330
Yes, I know,

58
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,540
-but they think it's unreasonable.
-Hey!

59
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,750
Didn't I tell you to fix that attitude?

60
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,500
We can't sell anything like that.

61
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,130
What will we live on
if we satisfy all their needs?

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,920
Your attitude is a big problem.

63
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,790
You're on our side, aren't you?

64
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,210
Why are you always looking out
for their needs?

65
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,170
Remember,

66
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,760
I'll be keeping an eye
on the Canton project too.

67
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,350
Jeez. Why come down
and ruin the mood here?

68
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,110
That's Mr. Park from the IT sales team.
He's a fine man.

69
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,270
Of course.

70
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,950
He's a great employee
who cooperates well with clients.

71
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,240
You two go for client visit OJTs
with that team, don't you?

72
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,750
-Oh, yes.
-Mr. Lee, who just left, leads the team.

73
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,510
EPISODE 6

74
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,720
What? Rubber trees?

75
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,940
This is about Siberia's forests!

76
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,940
Can rubber trees grow in freezing Russia?

77
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,200
You just copied and pasted
from the Indonesian document, didn't you?

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Mr. Ha produced the original document.

79
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,490
I just prepared an MOU with it.

80
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,540
I got it mixed up with the Indonesian one.

81
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,540
-I'm sorry. I'll redo it.
-How?

82
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,460
How will you redo it?

83
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,210
The legal team
has already completed its review.

84
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,090
How will you redo it?

85
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,050
Will you go to sales team three

86
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,550
and ask them to have
the legal team review it again?

87
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,930
Tell me.

88
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,010
Aren't you going to respond?

89
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,270
The B/L project.

90
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,230
I heard you told them about it.

91
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,490
If you did, you should have stayed
quiet as an apology.

92
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,570
But...

93
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,070
"I told them"?

94
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,620
Are you kidding me?

95
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,200
You think that will change anything?

96
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,710
That's why I don't trust women!

97
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,550
You don't even need to be here.
Go back to your cubicle.

98
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,090
Get out of here now!

99
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,690
Hey!

100
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,400
Aren't you going to take this?

101
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,630
You have to correct your mistakes!

102
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,020
Good morning, Mr. Oh.

103
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,900
Young-yi is in deep trouble
for leaking the B/L project.

104
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,740
She's an impressive lady.
I don't know if she's loyal or not.

105
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,580
But anyway, she's a tough one like me.

106
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,370
I'm busy right now.

107
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,790
Man, I can't believe this...

108
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,920
Good morning, my senior!

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,250
What's with that crap?

110
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,840
You studied in Ulsan,
and I studied in Jeonju.

111
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,130
We have nothing to do with each other.

112
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,590
We had different academy directors.

113
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,890
Do we really have to do this?
Why do we always have to suffer?

114
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,180
Are you talking about
the Willmart Thai-ramen project?

115
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,400
Didn't they say if sales team three
resolves the issue,

116
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,150
sales team one and two's business
in Thailand would go smoothly?

117
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,400
I mean, the ramen project doesn't even
help sales team three's performance.

118
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,410
Sales team three suffers,

119
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,160
but sales teams one and two
get all the credit.

120
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,740
Yet your team has to pull it off.
It's discouraging, isn't it?

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,120
-Yes.
-And there's no word from Willmart.

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,420
Is there anything you don't know?

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,050
-No, there isn't.
-Hey, Seok-yul.

124
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,630
-Get going.
-Okay.

125
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,890
All right, see you later. Geu-rae.

126
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,930
Hey! The reply just came!

127
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,140
-Willmart replied?
-Yes.

128
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,060
Mr. Oh, news has arrived.

129
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,360
They want to have a meeting.

130
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,240
They were so fussy,
but I guess the deal seemed appealing.

131
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,700
This type of guy is a pain
to deal with even after meeting him.

132
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,700
HYUNG-CHUL BYUN

133
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,410
What?

134
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,120
Goodness!
Isn't this the good-for-nothing Byun?

135
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,710
-You know him?
-Sure I do!

136
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,340
He was my classmate in high school.
I'm impressed!

137
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,760
He failed the college entrance
exam three times,

138
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,470
went to the army and then studied abroad.

139
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,100
Wow, things worked out for him.

140
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,260
-Were you two close?
-Yes, we were close!

141
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,020
We were super close buddies!

142
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,770
We used to steal our dads' cigarettes
and smoke them together.

143
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,770
It's a done deal, isn't it?

144
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,440
-Great.
-Really?

145
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,440
Holy crap.

146
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,410
-You're here again?
-Yes, sir.

147
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,030
-Hey, Ms. An.
-Hello, sir.

148
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,040
-Hello.
-Samples?

149
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,450
It won't be easy to move them alone.

150
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,960
Mr. Ha is running a bit late.

151
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,880
-He'll be down soon.
-Okay, carry on.

152
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,170
-Let's go.
-What?

153
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,170
Go ahead.

154
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,760
Are you really okay?

155
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,560
Yes, I think I can manage.

156
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,270
No, not this...

157
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,480
Go ahead. I'm fine.

158
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,370
Shouldn't we help her?

159
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,950
We're running late too.

160
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,080
She ended up like that
because she helped us.

161
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,910
She said Mr. Ha would be coming down soon.

162
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,170
There he is.

163
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,790
If he sees us helping her,
he definitely won't like it.

164
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,460
You're here, sir.

165
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,130
Why didn't you ask them for help?

166
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,680
They really owe you big time.

167
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,470
What? Did they ignore you?

168
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,390
Why should I ask them
for help with you here?

169
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,440
-I'm on the resource team.
-Then why did you do that?

170
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,770
What's going on in that head of yours?

171
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,610
Do you know what our boss said?

172
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,900
He said that if his wife cheated on him,
this is how he'd feel.

173
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,110
-Sir!
-How dare you yell at me?

174
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,950
Just get to work!

175
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,210
What was that?

176
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,750
It's nothing.

177
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,960
Man, you're hopeless.

178
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,550
-Go to the clinic.
-No, I'm fine.

179
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,050
I said, go!

180
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,020
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,440
Did she do that on purpose?

182
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,780
Why is she taking that with her?

183
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,080
Why did I bring this?

184
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,710
I must be an idiot.

185
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,770
What's wrong with your foot?

186
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,360
It's nothing.

187
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,840
Baek-ki, give me the boards back.

188
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,470
-Give them back.
-I told you it would be tough.

189
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,800
Give them back.

190
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,730
Weren't you going to the clinic?

191
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,480
I can go by myself.

192
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,240
Please leave those samples on my desk.

193
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,950
CLINIC

194
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,500
This dude follows Korean time.

195
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,420
He hasn't changed a bit.

196
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,880
-Korean time?
-Don't they use that phrase these days?

197
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,890
This dude, he's always
at least 30 minutes late.

198
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,350
Hey, dude! Sang-sik!

199
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,180
-Hey, dude!
-Hey, Hyung-chul!

200
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,230
You haven't changed a bit.

201
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,610
It's been ages.

202
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,820
I can't believe we're meeting
like this again.

203
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,570
I recognized you right away
when I saw your picture!

204
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,910
What did I say?

205
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,370
You looked old for your age back then,
but now you look just great!

206
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,870
Look at him.

207
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,460
He looks exactly
like he did in high school.

208
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,670
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-Our newbie.

209
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,300
Nice to meet you.

210
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,050
Sang-sik, would you mind
waiting a bit more?

211
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,300
-I have a lot of papers to sign.
-Sure.

212
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,270
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

213
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,100
-Hey, dude.
-Take your time.

214
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,226
This is great!

215
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,560
This is just great.

216
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,248
It's good to see him again.

217
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,230
It seems like that dude

218
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,020
took a time machine to the present day.

219
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,230
I feel great!

220
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,360
-I have a feeling it's a done deal.
-You know, one time...

221
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:01,990
he fought the class bully
and was about to hit him with a chair.

222
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,570
And I blocked it with my arm!

223
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,780
What?

224
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,370
I don't know why I did that then.

225
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,660
Back then, we only had to say
"we're friends" to make up,

226
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,290
and everything seemed to work out.

227
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,630
Good times.

228
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Friends?

229
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,760
Crazy bastard.

230
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,220
Why would I be his friend?

231
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,920
Should I call him?

232
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,800
It's been over an hour.

233
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,260
No, it's okay.

234
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,390
He must have a lot of papers to sign.

235
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,580
I'll call him.

236
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,580
Oh, you're back?

237
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,420
Hey.

238
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,170
You're very busy now, right?

239
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,220
I didn't wait that long.

240
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,100
Very busy, right? Shall we start?

241
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,350
I reviewed the data you sent.

242
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,180
It's so lacking.

243
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,390
The facilities

244
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,140
-and profit rates are ambiguous.
-Hey, so I made these revisions

245
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,850
for your review.

246
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,570
Facilities, types of ramen
and the profit sharing ratio.

247
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,570
And this is...

248
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,320
-I don't have time to read this now.
-No, I'll explain them to you now.

249
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,030
It won't take long.

250
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,490
-Hey, Sang-sik.
-Yes?

251
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,000
-Hey, Sang-sik Oh.
-Yes?

252
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
You think it's going to be that easy?

253
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,420
Mr. Sang-sik Oh.

254
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,170
I'll review and check
the feasibility of the deal

255
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,670
and call you back.

256
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,020
Okay.

257
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,650
Do as you wish, sir.

258
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,990
Mr. Byun, you have
an executive meeting to attend.

259
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,990
Okay, I'll be right there.

260
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,200
Mr. Byun, you're not wearing
your tie today.

261
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,460
The executives will disapprove of it.

262
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,750
Here.

263
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,590
Please wear this tie, sir.

264
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,570
You told me your children saved money
to buy it as a birthday present.

265
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,230
How could you give it to him?

266
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,400
Hey, I can use it
as an excuse to come back.

267
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,000
Welcome back, sir.
Hello to you too, Geu-rae.

268
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,260
I'm working on the first order sheet.

269
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,720
Shall I put in just 100,000?

270
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,890
Our senior manager kept on asking.

271
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,640
I think he told sales teams one and two
that this was a done deal.

272
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,390
-He said that, didn't he?
-Yes.

273
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,310
What?

274
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,990
You went to get a deal approved.

275
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,910
Then why did you say
that it was a done deal?

276
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,870
I told you this was important.
You're aware of this, right?

277
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,080
Hey, Sang-sik.

278
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
You think it's going to be that easy?

279
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,420
Mr. Sang-sik Oh.

280
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,130
I'll review and check
the feasibility of the deal

281
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,840
and call you back.

282
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,730
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING BYUN

283
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,270
Hello, Mr. Byun.

284
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,820
Did you have a safe trip back?

285
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,610
Sorry for what happened.

286
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,990
I had so much work, and I was in a hurry.

287
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,990
No, it's okay.

288
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,370
Hey, buddy, since it's been a while,

289
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,870
shouldn't we go out for drinks?

290
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,920
-Yes, sure.
- I'm free this evening.

291
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,540
Of course, that's great.

292
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,170
Yes, sure.

293
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,380
Why don't I decide where to meet tonight?

294
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,970
Okay great.

295
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,630
- And bring that newbie with you.
-What?

296
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,090
Geu-rae?

297
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,970
Well, okay.

298
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,940
See you later.

299
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,480
That guy!

300
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,190
I knew it.

301
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,160
Dude!

302
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,040
Now that's more like it!

303
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,130
-Really?
-Yes.

304
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,130
Then I better make reservations.
Which restaurant?

305
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,260
-You know the Famous Pigs' Feet place?
-Yes.

306
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,340
Get seats there.
This dude loved pigs' feet.

307
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,930
They're so popular that I'm not sure
if they'll have seats available.

308
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,430
-Geu-rae, find it and make reservations.
-Sure.

309
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,890
He wants Geu-rae to come too.
So we can expect it's a done deal, right?

310
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,150
-Then I'll have the contract ready.
-Okay.

311
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,570
FAMOUS PIGS' FEET

312
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,160
This is a really famous
pigs' feet restaurant.

313
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,120
They don't accept reservations,
but we begged.

314
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,000
-Let's go inside.
-Are you kidding me?

315
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,840
You don't eat pigs' feet anymore?

316
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,590
Sure, I do. I like them.

317
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,300
But I don't want to eat them now.

318
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,270
Okay, got it.

319
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,560
It's a bit crowded here, isn't it?

320
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,230
Let's go somewhere else. Where?

321
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,400
Where should we go?

322
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,460
Good evening, gentlemen.

323
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,470
Hello. Please come in.

324
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,390
Hey, come on in.

325
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,650
Give them some slippers to put on.

326
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,520
Put them on.

327
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,910
Introduce yourselves.

328
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,830
This is Yun-soo. She owns this place.

329
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,250
How do you do?

330
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,210
Can you please excuse us
as we need to have a conversation?

331
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,590
Sure, no problem.

332
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,340
It's okay.

333
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,420
She can stay.

334
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,090
Should I bring your bottle-kept alcohol?

335
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,350
No, just keep it.

336
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,930
Let's open a new bottle today. How's that?

337
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,850
Sure.

338
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,640
Go and bring that.

339
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,320
This is inappropriate...

340
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,030
What? Are you uncomfortable?

341
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,740
This place doesn't suit you?

342
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,830
No.

343
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,160
This place looks great.

344
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,090
Mr. Jang, where did you graduate from?

345
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,840
-Right, I...
-He didn't go to college.

346
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
What?

347
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,880
You guys don't care
about educational backgrounds?

348
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,220
That's a great company!

349
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,390
Yes, we're a great company.

350
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,970
We recognized his talents.

351
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,820
Kind considerations, please.

352
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,540
Here, let's have a toast.
Fill up your glass too.

353
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,380
Fill it up.

354
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,630
Nice to meet you all! Let's have a toast.

355
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,050
Nice to meet you all.

356
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,230
Hey, is your liver okay?

357
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,530
I can drink alcohol when I want,
but you have to drink when others want to.

358
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,820
Dude, how could it be okay?

359
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,660
-My gallbladder's messed up too.
-Goodness.

360
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,080
I thought you would be successful
because you were an honor student.

361
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,540
Look at yourself now at a trading company.

362
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,880
Working there must be disheartening.

363
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,420
But we stockbrokers are a proud bunch.

364
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,180
Do you know which jobs are most kiss-ass?

365
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,340
Stockbrokers and trade firm employees.

366
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,600
They both have to suck up to others.

367
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,270
Hey, sometimes we're
in a powerful position.

368
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,730
-Very seldom, if ever.
-No, sometimes.

369
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,190
-Hey, you know turtles?
-What about them?

370
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,200
-Do you know how they roll?
-What?

371
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,160
How?

372
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,300
-I'll pour you a drink this time.
-Yes, okay.

373
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,390
You're handsome.

374
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,060
Does your company hire
according to good looks?

375
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,060
Then how did this guy make it in?

376
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,060
Come on. That's mean.

377
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,730
-Look at him. Man, he's ugly.
-Come on. I used to be...

378
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Don't forget about our deal.
I'll be waiting for your call.

379
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,120
Don't worry, buddy. You can trust me.

380
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,410
Hey, mister, here's the cab fare.

381
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,540
Please drive him home safely.

382
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,630
-Hey, here you go, Sang-sik.
-Okay.

383
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,380
Okay.

384
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,720
Goodbye, dude.

385
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,030
Should I get a cab for you, Mr. Oh?

386
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,570
Okay.

387
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,210
Mr. Oh, the cab is here.

388
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,860
Jeez, that was stressful.

389
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,900
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN?

390
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,690
I THINK IT WILL WORK OUT.

391
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,780
LET ME KNOW WHEN THEY CALL.

392
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,090
Wait! The hangover tonic
will be here soon.

393
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,350
Yes.

394
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,520
So...

395
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,270
how much do you need?

396
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,150
Does he want to do it,
or do you want him to do it?

397
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,450
It seems he just wants
to copy his friends.

398
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,390
Three times a week for 150,000 won is...

399
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,560
That's 600,000 won per month.

400
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,480
I know it won't go to waste, but...

401
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,050
Sir.

402
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,070
Contacting the pipe exporting firms
for the EPC project...

403
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,700
May I try it?

404
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,220
I told you there
is nothing you can do here.

405
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,430
I still want to try it first.

406
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,640
How?

407
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,790
-I found a few firms...
-I don't need your help.

408
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,380
-Hey, Mr. Kang.
-Hi, Mr. Park.

409
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,430
The electric wheelchair project.

410
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,350
Why did you discontinue the proceedings?

411
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,220
No, I said I would review it

412
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,930
if you could calculate
the profits accurately.

413
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,140
This company won't work.

414
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,230
The company is very small,

415
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,110
but R&D is under way,

416
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,840
-so if we could cooperate with them...

417
00:32:22,728 --> 00:32:24,780
-We can't connect them

418
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,700
to our buyer portfolio without knowing
the profit-to-investment ratio.

419
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,960
I've told you this many times.

420
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,450
Still, you know...

421
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,160
I'll call the company again.

422
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,370
Okay.

423
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,100
I'll go return some books.

424
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,890
Return mine too.

425
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,580
Mr. Park, how's the Canton project going?

426
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,180
What is Youngsung Company saying?

427
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,270
Don't you know our buyer is anxious?

428
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,940
Yes, I'll call them again.

429
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,280
You only keep calling
but produce zero results!

430
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,450
I'm sorry.

431
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,410
Don't be on the phone all day.
Get your ass over there!

432
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:26,700
Resolve the issue at once!

433
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,740
Yes, sir. I will.

434
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,590
I'm sorry, Mr. Park!

435
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,420
I was just about to call you.

436
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,380
You didn't have to come here.

437
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,050
Sun-young, bring us some coffee.

438
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi,

439
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,810
but when will the delayed items
issue be resolved?

440
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,270
We're in the process of securing
the goods, so wait two or three days.

441
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,270
You said that last time,
and if this is what I report back again,

442
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,900
it would put me in a difficult position.

443
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,780
-I'm sure you have your reasons, but...
-I'm sorry.

444
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,990
Actually, my daughter
was involved in a car accident.

445
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,410
What?

446
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,330
Was she hurt badly?

447
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,500
No, not really.

448
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,170
Well, yes, but she'll be fine.

449
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,300
Anyway, I'll do my best
to resolve the issue.

450
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,500
I'm sorry.

451
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,430
I'm sure the issue will be resolved soon
and you didn't do it on purpose.

452
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,720
Anyway, I'm sorry about your daughter.

453
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,310
You must be very worried.

454
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,970
Yes.

455
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,560
Yes, Mr. Lee. I just met him.

456
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,900
It seems he hadn't checked
the items for Canton.

457
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,190
They're currently in the process
of securing the goods.

458
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,570
So?

459
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,200
I asked them to expedite
the procurement process.

460
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,820
-And...
- What the hell is wrong with you?

461
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,950
You should have brought up
freight compensation

462
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,750
so that they would truly understand
the consequences of this issue!

463
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,370
Don't come back
until you have resolved this!

464
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,420
Yes, sir.

465
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,100
-How did it go?
-I heard it went smoothly.

466
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,190
Then why is there no call?

467
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,400
Don't worry. They're friends.

468
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,740
He said he would fully support us.

469
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,030
But don't you think this is too much?

470
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,500
You set us up as scapegoats,

471
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,290
so stop bugging us.

472
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,380
Geu-rae Jang, One International, speaking.

473
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,670
Willmart purchasing team?

474
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,010
Hold on, please.
I'll transfer you to Mr. Oh.

475
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,230
Yes, Sang-sik Oh speaking.

476
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,270
Yes.

477
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,360
Yes.

478
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,940
Okay, I understand.

479
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,260
That bastard!

480
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,890
Friend?

481
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,760
You said he was your friend?

482
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,390
Why did you even bring that up?

483
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,900
We would have planned a different strategy
if it weren't for you.

484
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,110
You totally ruined it for us!

485
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,440
What are you going to do now?

486
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,990
You said we could trust you!

487
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,030
What are you going to do now?

488
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,240
You told us to trust you.

489
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,330
You said because he's your friend,
this was a done deal.

490
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:02,500
What the heck is this now?
Say something, Mr. Oh.

491
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,380
What's the reason?

492
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,460
You don't like the delivery conditions?

493
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,130
No, those conditions were great.

494
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,430
But our company never had
any intention of selling those goods.

495
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,220
We think it lacks marketability.

496
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,180
Then why did you show interest
if that was the case?

497
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,610
Well, you used to show interest in my food
and take them back in school.

498
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,980
What?

499
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,110
I'm just kidding.

500
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,240
Hey, do you have a problem with me?

501
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,120
No. Come on, we're not kids anymore.

502
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,290
But, I used to, a long time ago.

503
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,960
So...

504
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,380
What pissed you off back then?

505
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,630
We're not kids anymore.

506
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,960
I'm not going into that.

507
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,720
I'll just say it clearly now
so you understand.

508
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,050
You might not know,
but I used to suck up to you.

509
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,600
What?

510
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,270
So I just wanted you to be
at the other end of the stick for once.

511
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,480
What?

512
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,270
See you at the class reunion party.

513
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,860
Goodbye, buddy!

514
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,650
Darn it!

515
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,930
He must be so disappointed.

516
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,270
Do you know which part of sales
is the most difficult?

517
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,230
Which part is that?

518
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,150
Having to entertain someone
you know personally.

519
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,570
But what's tougher
is having to entertain a friend.

520
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,660
The act of entertaining...

521
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,660
It requires a vertical dynamic
where the entertainer is the "servant."

522
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,830
It's more embarrassing
because it's your friend.

523
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,460
Then it makes you wonder
if it's all worth it...

524
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,050
if it's worth staying here.

525
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,350
Honey.

526
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,150
You know it too, right?

527
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,230
Back in college.

528
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,860
My friend Sung-sik.

529
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,820
He quit his job and went back
to graduate school.

530
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,950
He now works for a good company.

531
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,040
Maybe I should...

532
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,330
at this point in my life...

533
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,330
What?

534
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,130
What?

535
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,970
You already registered for that?

536
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,220
Goodness.

537
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,720
I wanted to discuss it with you first.

538
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:48,810
Me?

539
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,270
Right.

540
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,020
I'll be home after
a few drinks with Sung-sik.

541
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,070
Yes.

542
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,070
Okay.

543
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,200
Hey, Sung-sik.

544
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,280
Hello.

545
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,870
Do you like working
at your current company?

546
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,660
But, if I may ask...

547
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,130
when you were preparing
for graduate school,

548
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,420
how did you get your family's approval?

549
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,640
Providing for your needs
must have been really tough.

550
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,270
If you want to do something,
just think of yourself.

551
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,480
There is no choice
that will satisfy everyone.

552
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,110
Just take responsibility for your actions.

553
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,400
I'm a happy man.

554
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,120
I'm happy...

555
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,040
but I don't want to go home.

556
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,840
It's stressful...

557
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,510
at home.

558
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,150
Yes, sir, I got it.

559
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:20,820
Call me when you resolve it.

560
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,200
Yong-gu.

561
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,040
Yes, Mr. Lee.

562
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,790
We're in charge of
the OJT newbie training today.

563
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,750
It's a subcontractor trip.
Please take charge on my behalf.

564
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,670
What, me?

565
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,960
The supervisor is now Mr. Park?

566
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,050
Okay. I got it, sir.

567
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,140
Hey!

568
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:57,440
We can't sell anything like that.

569
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,900
Geu-rae, go to the roof deck...

570
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,030
and pick up the pieces of paper.

571
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,080
Letter of Resignation

572
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,290
SIGNED BY YONG-GU PARK.

573
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,340
If you want to do something,
just think of yourself.

574
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,310
Good morning, sir.

575
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,440
Yes, hello.

576
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,110
You're Mr. Park from
the IT sales team, right?

577
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,400
Yes, I am.

578
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,110
My name is Geu-rae Jang.
I'm a newbie from sales team three.

579
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,570
I'll be going on the subcontractor trip
under your supervision.

580
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,120
I see.

581
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,540
But, gosh.

582
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,040
Unlike other supervisors,

583
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,130
I won't be of much help.

584
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,420
My boss, Mr. Oh...

585
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,010
He said I could learn a lot from you.

586
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,260
He said you had a great ability
to work and cooperate with clients.

587
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,930
What? Me?

588
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,480
What else...

589
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,310
did he say?

590
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:24,610
What?

591
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,820
Well...

592
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,780
You're very considerate to the suppliers.

593
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:38,250
In short,

594
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,460
You portray yourself as
an "iron hand in a velvet glove" employee.

595
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,380
He said you were an indispensable
sales team employee.

596
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,300
Really?

597
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,340
He said that?

598
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,640
Then,

599
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,100
shall I tell you about the "art of sales"
on the way to our trip?

600
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,270
-What?
-There are many fun stories.

601
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,360
I said I would drive.

602
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,440
It's okay.

603
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,570
I should drive because I know the way.

604
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,240
Where was I?

605
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,990
Sales is like a war.

606
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,870
A battle.

607
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,620
You need guts.

608
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,200
You need to have a winning mindset.

609
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,960
You have to take it like that.

610
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,630
I have had both painful
and victorious experiences.

611
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,510
Lots of them, for sure.

612
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,420
Once...

613
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,180
The client couldn't meet
the delivery deadline,

614
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,470
and all upper management came

615
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,430
and pleaded for mercy.

616
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,440
If only you overlook it once,
everything will be fine.

617
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,650
So please cut us some slack.

618
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,230
-So?
-I stood firm and said,

619
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,900
Let's do it by the book.

620
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,990
You're a true and precise businessman.

621
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,200
What?

622
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,450
Yes.

623
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,540
Was that too big of a lie?

624
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,040
But I feel great inside.

625
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,880
This is one of our team's clients.

626
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,340
They're working with a Chinese

627
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:14,050
semiconductor firm through us.

628
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,010
But they've been having freight
delivery issues recently.

629
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,050
What's the issue?

630
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,060
Delivery keeps getting delayed.

631
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,440
They say they're having difficulty
with the procurement of goods.

632
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,650
Is it possible
that they've secured another client?

633
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,480
In these cases,

634
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,690
they usually take
existing clients for granted.

635
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,410
No, not this firm.

636
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,330
We have built a lot of trust between us.

637
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,000
However, we still need
to visit once in a while

638
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,920
to maintain some tension
for continued efficient production.

639
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,090
We're very busy now, so let's leave
One International out for now.

640
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,590
They're a new client,
so we must keep them happy.

641
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,180
First, transfer all freights to them.

642
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,180
Then, hold off One International
by phone as long as possible.

643
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,970
Mr. Park?

644
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,940
The man is soft,
so he won't be difficult to handle.

645
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,980
So I'll send it as soon as possible.

646
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,150
Man, this is awesome.

647
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,580
Mr. Park.

648
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,010
So they think we're a pushover.

649
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,150
Mr. Park, we'll head back to the office.

650
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,520
What? Okay.

651
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,400
I'm sorry.

652
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,280
I'm sorry, Geu-rae.

653
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,700
Have a safe trip back.

654
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,240
I wish to stay a little longer.

655
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,540
Geu-rae, I'd like to have a word with you.

656
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,060
What?

657
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,600
Geu-rae, given the current situation,
it's best for us to leave.

658
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:34,150
But, Mr. Park seems perplexed.

659
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,070
And training isn't over yet.

660
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,490
There is nothing we can do
to help him here.

661
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,410
And given the situation,
the site trip is now meaningless.

662
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,120
Do whatever you want. I'll be on my way.

663
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:54,290
Mr. Park, I'll be returning
to the office now.

664
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,730
Yes. They think we're a pushover.

665
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,690
All because of me.

666
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,320
As I have suspected,

667
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,110
I wasn't cut out
for this work to begin with.

668
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,410
Hey, Mr. Park. How did the discussion go?

669
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,290
It's best that I resign.

670
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,750
Why didn't you call me in advance?

671
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,170
-Where did the other man go?
-He had to return to the office.

672
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,880
Okay.

673
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,300
-Let's go in.
-Wait.

674
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,260
When will you resolve our issue?

675
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:47,350
Right away, of course!

676
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,390
Didn't I talk to you on the phone earlier?

677
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:50,970
I'm an idiot!

678
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,810
Yes we did, didn't we?

679
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,100
We did.

680
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,560
Hey, I'm sorry.

681
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,070
I was going to resolve it first,

682
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,740
but because of our new clients,

683
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,660
our freight load has reached
maximum capacity.

684
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,820
I should leave.

685
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,590
You're very considerate to the suppliers.

686
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,170
I said firmly.

687
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,800
Let's do it by the book.

688
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,890
Show him what you got.

689
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:33,520
Show him.

690
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,980
Show him what you're made of.

691
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,560
But it was all a lie.

692
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,860
There is no choice that satisfies all.
Just take responsibility for it.

693
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,990
Did I just want to be the nice guy
who appeases everyone?

694
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,330
Did I ever take on responsibility

695
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,830
while working for my company?

696
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,340
-Mr. Choi.
-Mr. Park.

697
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,470
We made a mistake.

698
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,680
We'll take care of it immediately. Okay?

699
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,930
Would you mind...

700
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,020
if we proceeded by the book?

701
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,470
If I don't do this now,

702
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,230
it will be the same wherever I go.

703
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,060
I'm ashamed of ourselves, Mr. Park.

704
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,770
I'm really sorry.

705
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:26,820
I'll resolve it today and make sure
it leaves Incheon tomorrow.

706
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,610
I told you we'll be doing it by the book.

707
00:53:31,635 --> 00:53:33,910
Mr. Park, it's my fault.

708
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,790
It's all my fault.

709
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,580
But we have worked
with One International for years.

710
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,550
Mr. Park.

711
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,910
Your boss and I go way back.

712
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,700
We have a long-standing
business relationship.

713
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:03,790
Wouldn't it be a waste
for that trust to be broken?

714
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:07,210
Let's keep things positive.

715
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:10,050
Let's work things out smoothly.

716
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,930
So, this is how they treat me.

717
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:18,390
I was such a pushover to them.

718
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:20,100
Do you have anything more to say

719
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,100
to embarrass me further?

720
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,560
How low do you intend to drag me down?

721
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,030
Mr. Park, please accept
my sincere apologies.

722
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,950
Despite our long relationship,
we clearly made a mistake.

723
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,040
You said we'll do it by the book.

724
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,910
Does that mean

725
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,420
contract termination or loss compensation?

726
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:51,840
I will

727
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,930
discuss it back at headquarters

728
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,260
and then let you know.

729
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,720
You bunch of idiots!

730
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,350
Turning our old partner into enemies.

731
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:08,230
Just to earn a few extra bucks?
How are we going to resolve this?

732
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,360
Because of me,

733
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:12,690
a ten-year partnership
is going down the drain.

734
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,530
-That's ten years!
-If only I had overlooked the issue.

735
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:18,410
We're about to lose
a precious, loyal client

736
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,030
because of your follies!

737
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,080
-I thought you were a man of integrity.
-Excuse me,

738
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,460
-Sir.
-I've never been this embarrassed

739
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,410
in my life!

740
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,880
A risky move you take
when things don't look good.

741
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,590
Are you guys crazy about money?

742
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,590
The move you make to turn the tables.

743
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,920
You only love money?

744
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,680
In the game of go,

745
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,430
it's called a "clever move"
or a "clever trick."

746
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,350
Ask for his forgiveness.

747
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,020
If the clever move is seen
as brilliant in the game of go,

748
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,140
it just proves that you were
at a disadvantage all along.

749
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,560
-I apologize, sir.
-Please calm down.

750
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,320
Mr. Park didn't think things
would escalate to this level.

751
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,280
The reason they're shocked
and persistently trying to persuade him ...

752
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:59,570
is because Mr. Park was never
like this before.

753
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,790
It's like
looking one way and rowing another,

754
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,870
He's looking at them,
but criticizing Mr. Park...

755
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,000
I don't think I have a choice.

756
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,090
-I'll go and beg for pardon.
-Please, sir. Calm down.

757
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,170
Mr. Kim, please give me a call.

758
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,380
-Please, sir. Calm down.
-Let me go!

759
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:19,720
-We'll take care of it now.
-I said, let go!

760
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,970
Please, sir.

761
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,430
Please excuse me.
I need to take a call from headquarters.

762
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,560
-Okay.
-Let go.

763
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:29,150
Gosh, we're running really late.

764
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,690
What if you get into trouble?

765
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:33,940
What trouble? I'm here on business.

766
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,780
Furthermore, I'm with you, Mr. Park.

767
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,490
Yes, Mr. Kim. We're still here.

768
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,780
Yes, sir.

769
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,540
Hello?

770
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:46,950
You can't hear me clearly?

771
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,500
When will we be returning?

772
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:54,550
I think it will take a while.
There's a bit of a problem here.

773
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:58,010
Their president said he would visit us
and explain the issue himself.

774
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,180
In order to counter

775
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:02,640
- a clever move or trick,
-Yes, he directly said so himself.

776
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,180
you need to take a "direct proper move".

777
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,680
Yes, I'll report it to you
once we get things settled here.

778
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:08,140
Okay.

779
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,490
-There's an issue with Youngsung?
-Yes, I got a call from Mr. Park.

780
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,820
Their president and executives
are on their way here.

781
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:23,990
I checked our records.

782
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,660
It seems there were several
delivery problems.

783
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,040
What the heck is this?
It's more than just a few.

784
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,790
Call the risk management team,
the evaluation team and the legal team.

785
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,130
I'll report this to the executives.

786
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,130
-Mr. Han, come here.
-Okay.

787
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:43,890
Organize these please.

788
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,850
Did you call the forwarding agency?

789
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,020
This is the IT sales team speaking.

790
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,930
Can we get files for our Canton...

791
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,600
Please get the contract ready for us.

792
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,900
Don't forget the data
on shipment dates and schedule.

793
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,690
There's been a problem with Youngsung.

794
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,240
Check the credit limit given to them now.

795
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,530
Aren't they a reliable company
with good credit scores?

796
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:04,240
Can you prepare a brief report
on what happened?

797
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,580
Hello, sir.

798
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:29,890
I'll be damned.

799
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,900
Hello, Mr. Park and Geu-rae.

800
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,030
What's going on?

801
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,370
Which floor?

802
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,330
Hello, Mr. President.

803
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:33,750
Hello, Mr. Kim.

804
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,830
I offer my sincere apologies.

805
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,500
Please wait in the guest room.

806
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,170
Show them the way.

807
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,630
Mr. Park, you should come with me.

808
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:49,050
Who are you?

809
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:51,970
I'm Geu-rae Jang from sales team three.

810
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,310
Mr. Kim.

811
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,690
May Mr. Jang come with us?

812
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:05,280
How can I Mr. Park?

813
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,120
It will be a good learning
experience as a newcomer.

814
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,460
And we need him as he played

815
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,420
an important role in this issue.

816
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:28,930
Hey, Baek-ki.

817
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,970
Youngsung is here right now.

818
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:35,180
Our risk management, legal
and all teams are here too.

819
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,220
That's a surprise.

820
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:46,720
-I didn't think Mr. Park had it in him.
-But the more surprising thing is

821
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,140
that Geu-rae is going to that meeting.

822
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,613
-What?

823
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:04,480
-Young-yi.

824
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:07,490
Great to run into you.
The big event of the day.

825
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:10,830
Geu-rae is participating
in a critical client incident meeting.

826
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:17,120
How could a newbie get in there?
Will he get promoted before any of us?

827
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,510
You know that.

828
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,850
High school graduate legend!

829
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:24,220
I don't know how he's going
to be of any help in there.

830
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,980
They must have taken him in
since he had something to offer.

831
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,980
No, Baek-ki is being patient.

832
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:33,770
Experiencing such meetings
is very helpful for newbies like us.

833
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,360
Baek-ki,

834
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:38,450
why did you come back?

835
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:43,660
-I didn't think I should be there.
-Honestly.

836
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,160
You don't like Mr. Park, do you?

837
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,040
Well, yes.

838
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:54,710
Yes, he's indecisive,

839
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,550
soft and weak-minded.

840
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,590
Clients don't prioritize him either.

841
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,010
Still, Geu-rae stayed until the very end.

842
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,930
Maybe he's the nosy type of guy.

843
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:08,310
Anyway, Youngsung is in big trouble now.

844
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,020
It's over for them.

845
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:12,650
Well, I'm not so sure.

846
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,940
It all depends on Mr. Park's testimony.

847
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,900
But I think they will probably
just let it go.

848
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:22,030
Because people like Mr. Park
just want to avoid complications.

849
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,370
He doesn't have...

850
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,950
what it takes to solve problems.

851
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,460
Were there similar cases like this before?

852
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,090
Yes, there were.

853
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,550
They weren't situations to secure
products from other locations.

854
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,470
Also, there were no penalties,
so the financial loss is minimal.

855
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,890
The items don't require prompt
delivery, so the risks are low too.

856
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:49,180
Regardless of compensation,
a review of the contract is inevitable,

857
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,480
as there have been seven delays.

858
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,650
However, it's not worth taking to trial.

859
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,690
Why did this happen?

860
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:58,440
Mr. Park will explain the details,
since he's the one in charge.

861
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:08,490
I will explain...

862
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,620
how this happened.

863
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,130
Mr. Park, who is overwhelmed
by the gravity of the issue,

864
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,670
is concerned about
the other company's crisis.

865
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,800
That's foolish, isn't it?

866
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,350
Mr. Park, for your reference.

867
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,640
Thank you.

868
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:49,120
I'll explain what happened.

869
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,120
When in a crisis,

870
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,540
skip all unnecessary parts
and go straight to the point.

871
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,130
Be irresponsible!

872
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,590
Remove all unnecessary thoughts.

873
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,380
You have to get rid of them.

874
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:07,050
You can't take care of everyone.

875
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,850
It's you who needs to survive.

876
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,530
I'll report...

877
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:25,570
everything that happened.

878
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:29,910
I'm sorry, sir. We're to blame.

879
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,410
No, it's not your fault but mine.

880
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,790
-There have been...
-I'm so sorry.

881
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:39,040
seven freight delays.

882
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,050
And I found out the cause today.

883
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,840
Youngsung was focused
on building a new clientele list

884
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:48,430
and intended to appease the new clients.

885
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,850
As such, our shipments
were delayed in the process.

886
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:55,180
I found out about this today
and asked them

887
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,100
to take responsibility.

888
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,560
If you hadn't been there,
we would all still be in the dark.

889
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:01,480
Absolutely.

890
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:03,440
You should always keep
a watchful eye on them.

891
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:20,670
However,

892
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:24,460
I have identified some issues
about this project.

893
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:28,470
While those seven delays occurred,

894
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,390
I didn't take direct action
even though I was the one in charge.

895
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,850
I also didn't realize

896
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,230
how serious the issues were
in the early stages.

897
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:42,940
And I was...

898
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,860
never confident with tasks
put in front of me.

899
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,370
I am the one...

900
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,620
at fault here.

901
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,460
I was the one...

902
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:04,550
who allowed them...

903
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,460
to take advantage of me.

904
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,840
I neglected my responsibilities.

905
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:20,810
I am the one to blame...

906
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,570
for this issue.

907
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,160
When the industry increased freight costs
due to the rise in oil prices,

908
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,670
our company tried to reduce costs.

909
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,710
I couldn't persuade them
as my company's representative.

910
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,670
As a result,

911
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,010
they searched for new profit schemes.

912
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,810
All I thought about was quitting...

913
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:02,020
because of these frustrations at work.

914
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,860
Therefore, due to my shortcomings,

915
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,070
these issues manifested.

916
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,870
I will take full responsibility.

917
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:18,410
And please...

918
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,120
pardon those people.

919
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,420
Please continue doing business with them.

920
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,920
Please don't...

921
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:34,340
Please don't penalize them.

922
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,980
When did you start working here?

923
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:54,320
Excuse me?

924
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,870
He's been here for four years.

925
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:02,160
You're such a peculiar employee.

926
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,250
Hold on.

927
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,840
Do you think we'll abandon
a ten-year partnership over this?

928
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:12,510
What are you going to do?

929
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,800
How do you intend to take responsibility?

930
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,930
How will you?

931
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,260
Still, it's good
to resolve those worries now.

932
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:22,100
The longer you delay,
the worse it will be for you, your family,

933
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,810
and in the long run, the company.

934
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,900
Those types of worries
are a good thing, so keep worrying.

935
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,400
Just settle your worries well.

936
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,780
It was more miserable than any game
of go I've ever played.

937
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:42,910
Everyone has their own game.

938
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,250
How did I...

939
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,380
dare...

940
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:51,380
to give contemptible advice?

941
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,090
Baek-ki Jang.

942
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,640
-Yes.
-They say everything has worked out.

943
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,850
-What?
-You know Mr. Park from IT sales team.

944
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,810
Youngsung is still a client,
and Mr. Park wasn't reprimanded much.

945
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:07,600
They say the meeting went really smoothly.

946
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:10,110
I don't know how,
but I heard Mr. Park was great in there.

947
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:14,070
Why are you telling me this?

948
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,150
You're curious about it, aren't you?

949
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:21,600
- I thought you were really curious.
-Hey, Seok-yul.

950
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:31,770
Yes, sir?

951
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:33,960
That case?

952
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,880
- Let's hang up. I have work to do.
-Wait.

953
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,680
Darn it.

954
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,240
Why are you so down
when Mr. Park's project went well?

955
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:10,080
I heard you went to the meeting too.

956
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:11,700
Did something go wrong?

957
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,000
I wasn't of any help.

958
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,920
You're so ignorant.

959
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:22,510
You realized that only now?

960
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:26,800
There is nothing we can do yet.

961
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,600
Geu-rae!

962
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:40,400
Thank you, Geu-rae.

963
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,990
You helped me get out
of my miserable shell.

964
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,420
I'm sorry.

965
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,550
Thank you.

966
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:13,390
-I hope this goes well.
- Youngsung promised

967
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:16,270
to sign a new contract
that was beneficial to our company.

968
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:18,150
As for Mr. Park,

969
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,060
he was tasked with finding
operation issues

970
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:23,360
and writing a report
on possible preventive measures.

971
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:40,810
I thought Mr. Park would be reprimanded
for this ordeal.

972
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,850
That's how it works here.

973
01:12:43,884 --> 01:12:47,010
Our line of work
has so many risks to consider.

974
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:51,520
No matter how much we prepare,
accidents happen.

975
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:55,560
So you can't ask employees
to take responsibility for every issue.

976
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:02,450
So the company focuses on finding
solutions for these issues.

977
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:09,200
-But when you were punished last time...
-That's why that was nonsense.

978
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,830
Even if the company protects
its employees,

979
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:14,670
that particular employee suffers.

980
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,800
If you don't write
a thorough, unbiased report,

981
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:23,930
they can ask you to take responsibility
if something similar happens again.

982
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:25,720
Sir.

983
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:29,310
Shall I draw up the Willmart
process report?

984
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,220
It's okay. I'll write it.

985
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:33,230
Okay.

986
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:40,280
Willmart Ramen Import Case
Really, really, really...

987
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,280
Goal: Really, really, really...

988
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,500
Willmart Ramen Import Case

989
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:07,470
MY WIFE

990
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,310
I sent you an e-mail.
I'm at a loss for words.

991
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,190
Next.

992
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,530
What's a "trader"?

993
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,780
The "trader"

994
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:50,370
is the ultra super duper best hero

995
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:52,210
in the world.

996
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:56,000
He travels around the world

997
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,500
to buy and sell products
for everyone in the world.

998
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:03,180
-It's him.
- He can make poor countries rich

999
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:06,260
and supply water to those
countries without it.

1000
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:08,140
He can sell

1001
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:11,060
Superman, Ironman

1002
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,770
Batman and Spiderman.

1003
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:16,770
-That's a lie!
-It's not a lie!

1004
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,020
No, it is a lie!

1005
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:22,030
Hey, Ironman!
I'm going to tell my Dad to sell you!

1006
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:24,950
No, stop it...

1007
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:34,170
Your son is one of a kind!

1008
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:37,050
He should be a second-generation "trader".

1009
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:38,850
He's the same. Do it!

1010
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:40,810
Do it now! You!

1011
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,430
He's totally like you!

1012
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,350
Yes.

1013
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:48,310
This is why I continue working here.

1014
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:54,900
He's exactly like his father.

1015
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:56,240
- Right.
-He's just like you.

1016
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:59,200
Everyone has their own game of go.

1017
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:19,590
