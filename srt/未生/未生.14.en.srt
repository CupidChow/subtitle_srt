00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,090
2013 ONE INTERNATIONAL
NEW YEAR'S KICKOFF MEETING

2
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,170
EPISODE 14

3
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,220
We had a New Year's kickoff meeting.

4
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,060
It was a large-scale kickoff meeting
attended by all employees.

5
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,140
They introduced

6
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,480
the best performing teams last year
and awarded them prizes.

7
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,120
I also got to learn
how well other teams performed.

8
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,990
I was filled with excitement
after the Jordan project,

9
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,000
but for a moment, I got ashamed of myself.

10
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,670
You did a good job today.

11
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,550
Hey, Mr. Kang.

12
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,640
I may feel like I'm important.

13
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,940
But if I step a little bit aside,

14
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,360
I'd realize I'm only a tiny part of it.

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,450
In regard to the stainless steel coil

16
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,540
that you inquired about last December,

17
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,960
I recommend you steel grade 444.

18
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,550
This grade is used for water tank,
and water heater.

19
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,220
That's right.

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,590
Let me send you brochures.

21
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,390
When you let me know
the quantity you want,

22
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,180
I'll give you the quotation
that best suits you.

23
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,980
Yes, thank you.

24
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,810
Goodbye.

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Baek-ki.

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,240
Wa.

27
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,370
What?

28
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,620
In German, you pronounce the sound
of letter W like the English V.

29
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,410
Wassertank. Wasser.

30
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,330
Instead of pulling the sound
to your nose and mouth like the English V,

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,840
as if you're retching when you put
your toothbrush deep inside your mouth,

32
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,170
you have to roll your W, like  Wasser .

33
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,760
Okay, repeat after me.

34
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,430
All right.

35
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,720
Wa. Wasser.

36
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,390
Wagen. Weis.

37
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,060
Wurst.

38
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,780
Wa. Wasser. Wagen.

39
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,450
-Wurst.
-Wurst.

40
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,040
That's it.  Wa.

41
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,850
Wasser...

42
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,560
But I majored in German.

43
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,690
YOUNG-YI'S ACCOUNT

44
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,900
APPROVAL

45
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,070
-Excuse me, Mr. Jung.
-Yes?

46
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,480
The project for the Norwegian
mineral resources has been approved.

47
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,360
Yes!

48
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,660
Then, proceed with the Norway project.

49
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,280
-Young-yi, help with the Canada project.
-Yes, sir.

50
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,740
Mr. Yoo, have you checked
on the finance there?

51
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm still working on it.

52
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,210
I'm afraid it will take some time
to choose a constructor.

53
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,210
If you're talking
about the solar and wind power

54
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,590
in regard to the development complex,

55
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,960
I have a list
of constructors that I have studied.

56
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,090
Okay, then. You take care of it, Young-yi.

57
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,640
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

58
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,600
Then, let me send you
a sample of citron-flavored rice wine.

59
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,360
Please take a look.

60
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,940
As the situation stands at the moment,

61
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,570
I'm afraid we don't have a plan
to release low-alcohol wine.

62
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,410
I'll check it out again,

63
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,540
and let you know.

64
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,540
Yes, right. Thank you.

65
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,830
Yes. Bye.

66
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,710
Goodbye.

67
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,340
He's looking for low-alcohol rice wine.

68
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,970
Why would he want to drink rice wine
if he doesn't want to get drunk?

69
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,430
In Japan, cocktails made
of whiskey and carbonated water,

70
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,180
or vodka and juice are popular nowadays.

71
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,440
There may be an increasing preference
for low-alcoholic drinks or beer in Japan.

72
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,150
Geu-rae.

73
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,730
Are you getting any tutoring nowadays?

74
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,820
Are you seeing a Japanese girlfriend?

75
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,990
No.

76
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Have a look at this.

77
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,700
The orders are falling off dramatically.
I'm in trouble. Save me.

78
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,120
Well, I can't.

79
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,830
You're not getting tutoring.

80
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,880
You're not getting tutoring at all.

81
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,170
Not at all.

82
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,600
Hello, Mom.

83
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,730
A blind date? Again?

84
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,100
I'm too busy to get married.
Is that why you called me?

85
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,770
Is she pretty? Then, send me her picture.

86
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,360
Now I should get going.

87
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,030
Yes, right. I'll call you back. Bye.

88
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,950
Geu-rae, I'm going to the Finance Team.

89
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,990
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,720
Where is Mr. Oh?

91
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,510
-Hello.
-Hello.

92
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,430
I'm Mr. Ham of the IT sales team.

93
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,970
I see. Hello.

94
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,770
He's at a meeting.

95
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,640
Gosh, this is urgent.

96
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,270
We're balancing the books.

97
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,730
Some data of Sales Team Three
have been missing.

98
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,820
I need to know the purchasing price
of the nuclear reactor in the TF project,

99
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,740
which you worked on with my team
in the second quarter.

100
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,280
Can you find it?

101
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,570
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,050
Here it is.

103
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,420
Do you want me to copy this?

104
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,970
Yes, this is right.

105
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,770
Yes, please.

106
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,320
-Here you are.
-All right.

107
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,660
Well, I heard a newbie proposed

108
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,790
that idea for the Jordan business.
Is that you?

109
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,080
Well, yes.

110
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,710
I see.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,790
You look quite capable.

112
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,090
Thank you, sir.

113
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,210
-Hello, Mr. Ham.
-Hi, Mr. Kim.

114
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,130
I had some business with Sales Team Three.

115
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,640
-He took care of it for me.
-Oh, did he?

116
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,640
-I'll see you later.
-Goodbye.

117
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,520
-Geu-rae.
-Yes.

118
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,110
Didn't he say anything else?

119
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,900
No. He just talked about the work.

120
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,650
I don't trust him.

121
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,990
He used to work for the Planning Team.

122
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,990
He's a sly old fox.

123
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,410
I heard he requested for extra staff
since they're short of manpower.

124
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,380
Anyway, Geu-rae.

125
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,460
Since the rumor about you
spread in the company,

126
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,050
people may come and see you.

127
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,470
Someone like me?

128
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,680
Of course, they want to get close to
a newbie who Mr. President praised.

129
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,390
They say they no need to worry
even if you become useless.

130
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,150
Let me make your coffee.

131
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,440
Okay.

132
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,440
Thanks.

133
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,070
-It'll be ready soon.
-All right.

134
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,040
Of course, they want to get close to
a newbie who Mr. President praised.

135
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,000
They say they no need to worry
even if you become useless.

136
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,920
Because I'm a temporary employee.

137
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,230
Okay, here.

138
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,230
-Geu-rae.
-Yes.

139
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,650
-Was Mr. Ham here?
-Yes.

140
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,400
Don't show materials to anyone
when the person in charge is away.

141
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,410
Don't do anything
that you can't take responsibility for.

142
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,950
I understand, sir.

143
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,290
Jeez.

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
How dare he come to my team and...

145
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,970
I'm back.

146
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,800
-Anything happened?
-Well.

147
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,970
Mr. Ham came and talked to Geu-rae.

148
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,770
He's trying to get extra staff.

149
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,650
He's so rude.
He's trying to steal our team member

150
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,400
at the beginning of a new year?

151
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,450
Yes. I think you'll have to wait
five or ten minutes more.

152
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,700
What?

153
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,660
I really have to confirm the receipt.
I don't have enough time.

154
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,500
Okay, I got it.

155
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,800
I'll send it by 5:00, no, 5:30 p.m. today.

156
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,300
By fax. Bye.

157
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,470
Mr. Oh. What brings you here?

158
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,390
I received the material
that I needed. Mr. Kim.

159
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,930
-Yes.
-You're very busy.

160
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,230
Goodness. We're understaffed.

161
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,100
You should request staffing.

162
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,360
They won't listen to me.
You know the strict measures...

163
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,110
-That's why you're after my team member?
-What?

164
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,820
What are you talking about? No way.

165
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,400
Don't mess with Geu-rae Jang.

166
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,160
-Okay.
-It's the same as messing with me.

167
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,450
Yes, sir.

168
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,960
Then, I'll get going.

169
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,630
All right.

170
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,880
What happened to this employee?

171
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,890
She quit because the company refused
to renew her contract.

172
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,930
What's the use of training people?

173
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,060
There's no other way if the company
refuses to renew the contract.

174
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,940
Here's coffee for you, sir.

175
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,860
Put it here.

176
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,210
Mr. Jung!

177
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,040
Yes, sir.

178
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,630
What happened to the Tunisian bidding?

179
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,090
You lost it to Samjung, right?

180
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,760
-That's...
-You know,

181
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,140
the director of the future resources
head office is my college friend.

182
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,060
I was too embarrassed to show my face.

183
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,850
Actually, it's not that we lost.
The Tunisian already chose Samjung...

184
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,770
Hey!

185
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,940
Stop making excuses.

186
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,480
Is your mouth only functioning
when you make excuses?

187
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,910
A trading man should show
his ability only with contracts.

188
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,740
Why are you making endless excuses?

189
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,540
Make it happen. By all means.

190
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,410
Jeez.

191
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,610
He gave us the information too late.
What should we do then?

192
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,730
-His nonsensical attitude never changes.
-Jeez.

193
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,950
I really hate it when he pokes people.

194
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,610
I wasn't treated that way
even in my school days.

195
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,330
Let's just have some coffee.

196
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,750
Would you like some coffee?

197
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
-What?
-What?

198
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,210
-Well, yes.
-Okay.

199
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,880
Yes, thanks.

200
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,060
Here it is.

201
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,650
New employees, come to the meeting room
on the fifth floor by five o'clock.

202
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,860
Young-yi.

203
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,900
Everything is good with you?

204
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,410
Yeah. Since I attacked him first,
everything seems fine.

205
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,530
He's bluffing like a man.

206
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,160
"I'll show you what responsibility is."

207
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,700
But he's never shown it to me.

208
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,670
-Hey!
-Hello.

209
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,590
Hello.

210
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,670
Did you enjoy meeting Ms. Ha?

211
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,930
Why should I meet her?

212
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,640
Baek-ki, did you pick up a girl
in the ski resort?

213
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm not into such a thing.

214
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,600
Didn't you spend
the end of the year with Ms. Ha?

215
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,770
-Young-yi.
-In the ski resort,

216
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,310
you're supposed to pick up a girl.

217
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,270
Why are you talking such nonsense?

218
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,320
-Come on!
-Come on!

219
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,190
Okay.

220
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,030
He's so...

221
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,920
Did you go outside?

222
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,630
No, sir. I had a visitor here.

223
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,010
Is the Jordan project going well?

224
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,850
Yes, all thanks to you, sir.

225
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,680
-We're preparing for shipping now.
-Good.

226
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,890
In both Mr. Park's incident
and the Jordan project,

227
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,850
the newbie did a great job.

228
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,860
Yes, sir.

229
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,570
I guess he's full of spirit and smart.

230
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,570
You're fortunate enough
to work with good people.

231
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,950
Isn't it all thanks
to your discerning eye?

232
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,620
You may go.

233
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,750
Don't mind Mr. Park's incident.

234
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,970
You did what you had to do.

235
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,180
-Thank you, sir.
-However.

236
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,390
When that happened,

237
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,230
couldn't you have told me in advance?

238
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,820
I guess you could have, right?
You could have done that.

239
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,570
You should have done so.

240
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,270
Please use up your welfare points
from last year since they'll expire soon.

241
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,850
Your annual leave as well.

242
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,230
You know your volunteer activities will
be reflected on your performance review.

243
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,360
I like volunteer activities.

244
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,820
But I'll just donate my blood.

245
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,320
Blood donation can't be counted
more than twice.

246
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,610
From this year, new employees
will have a mileage education program

247
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,370
where you should complete
more than 30 hour classes.

248
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,370
English, trade, and
data processing can be included.

249
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,210
When you score more than 80 percent
on your exams or attendance,

250
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,920
you'll be acknowledged
to finish the classes.

251
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,170
If you fail, your education expenses
will be deducted from your salary.

252
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,050
English.

253
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,590
That's okay. There's a beginner's course.

254
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,890
Executives will be there, too.
Don't worry.

255
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,350
Lastly, fill out your salary agreement
form and bring it to the HR team.

256
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,180
Your names are in each envelope.

257
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,560
YOUNG-YI AN

258
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,440
-Well...
-Right.

259
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,910
I'll excuse myself first.

260
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,330
That HR person.

261
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,080
Did he do that on purpose?

262
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,930
Hey, Mr. Kim. Did you fill out
the salary agreement form?

263
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,470
Don't take a look.

264
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,770
Mr. Ha and Mr. Yoo, sign the salary
agreement and give it to me by today.

265
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,980
-Yes.
-Yes.

266
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,480
January is time
for salary review and pay raise.

267
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,610
Of course,
a temporary worker is an exception.

268
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,910
When the senior manager reviews,
the manager approves,

269
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,620
and the employee signs,
the new agreement will be valid.

270
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,630
In the performance review done
by alphabetical order,

271
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,590
I'm not counted in.

272
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,970
How much incentive did you get?

273
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,260
Not much. Less than ten million won.

274
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,680
Your performance was pretty good.

275
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,930
I don't know. Even if it's good,
my manager wouldn't...

276
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,520
I want to become like them.

277
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,780
Goodness! I work my butt off,
but the company doesn't acknowledge it.

278
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
Why don't we have a leave?

279
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,290
My family keeps pestering me
to get married.

280
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,790
I wish there's no such thing as
New Year's Day or Thanksgiving.

281
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,670
I have another blind date this month.

282
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,000
Mr. Kim looks fine,
but why does he keep getting rejected?

283
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,510
Will you do research
and make presentation slides,

284
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,720
then email them to me?

285
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,930
Look here. Isn't she nice?

286
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,350
Oh, she's pretty.

287
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,680
She's nice.

288
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,720
Who received the highest incentive?

289
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,060
After Mr. Kang, who?

290
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,440
-It's me.
-Jeez.

291
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,110
Like them.

292
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,320
-Come on.
-This guy...

293
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,280
-I'm getting married soon.
-I don't think you can make it this year.

294
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,380
Geu-rae.

295
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,340
Yes.

296
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,090
Your meeting
with the HR Team finished long ago.

297
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,890
Where have you been?

298
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,890
I'm sorry.

299
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,730
Where is the cost list
that I asked you to sort out?

300
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,950
What are you doing?

301
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,620
Don't act like you did a great job.

302
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,540
Get back to being normal!

303
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,540
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,330
You saw at the kickoff meeting, right?

305
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,540
What we did was nothing
but average performance.

306
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,760
Of course, it's quite an accomplishment.
But you need to snap out of it.

307
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
Go back to your usual self.

308
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,510
-Sir.
-What?

309
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,190
If I do what I usually do,
will it be okay?

310
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,440
Like I usually do.

311
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,900
If I do what I usually do,
can I become a regular employee?

312
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,120
You won't.

313
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,670
Background.

314
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,050
That tells a lot.

315
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,720
Four years at college.

316
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,180
There are many people
who learned English abroad.

317
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,430
Unable to find work,
they're suffering, too.

318
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,480
Considering the cost and effort
that they invested,

319
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,360
it may be natural for you
to fall behind in the job market.

320
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,030
Since companies want
to have higher caliber workforce,

321
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,740
they review candidates' education,
GPAs, and specialties.

322
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,790
Still, it's hard to assess a human being.

323
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,420
So, they consider other traits
and give them extra points.

324
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,790
They review everything that they can.

325
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,220
A company's manual is like Fort Knox.

326
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,020
There would be no spot for you.

327
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,910
What are you doing sir?

328
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,920
Well...

329
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,710
What?

330
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,910
Let's get off work early today.

331
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,390
Early?

332
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,990
I thought this was my infrastructure.

333
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,290
But I only borrowed it for a while.

334
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,070
Geu-rae.

335
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,800
What were you doing there?

336
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,100
Nothing. Are you going home?

337
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,010
Yeah.

338
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,220
Bye, sir.

339
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,440
We finished work early.
Shall we have a drink?

340
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,440
What?

341
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,790
Here.

342
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,500
You know...

343
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,390
Do you know what I enjoyed most at work?

344
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,350
I don't know.

345
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,230
Learning how to drink.

346
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,820
While drinking,

347
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,240
I overcame my loneliness
and forgot my suffering.

348
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,330
I was able to lick the boots off
someone that I hate.

349
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,450
All thanks to alcohol.

350
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,130
But what I regret the most

351
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,920
is also learning how to drink.

352
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,420
I don't think
I've ever enjoyed my routine.

353
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,050
I've never enjoyed doing nothing, either.

354
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,180
I've never been idle.

355
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:15,715
Slow down, sir.

356
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,850
Alcohol

357
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,980
and drinking happily

358
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,970
could be poisonous.

359
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,710
Have you heard of  Suseunghwagang ?

360
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,380
Raise the cold, but lower the heat.

361
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,190
Keep your head cool and your heart warm.

362
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,430
Alcohol drives heat upward.

363
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,610
Suseunghwagang.

364
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,490
If you play the game of baduk,
you hear this several times.

365
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,250
Keep your head cool and your heart warm.

366
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,330
Starting today,

367
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,710
I'll quit drinking.

368
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,300
What?

369
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,090
Thanks to you, I really enjoyed working
after a long time.

370
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,470
I felt like my heart was warm.

371
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,600
Don't mention it.

372
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,980
I know you suffered a lot because of me.

373
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,400
I couldn't even apologize to you
because I felt too guilty.

374
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,450
Doing a lot of work
is actually not suffering.

375
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,190
To let you work there.

376
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,450
To let you help them

377
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,190
and make Sales Team Three successful.

378
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,650
In your opinion,

379
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,660
should the affected tooth be pulled out?

380
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,320
Or leave it as it is?

381
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,830
If I do what I usually do,
will it be okay?

382
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,210
If I do what I usually do

383
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,170
can I become a regular employee?

384
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,390
Really? Is she pretty?

385
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,850
Sure, I should go.

386
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,560
Mr. Sung.

387
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,730
I'll call you back. Yes, sir.

388
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,610
-You have a meeting at 9:30 a.m., right?
-Yes.

389
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,190
Organize the materials
so we can start right away tomorrow.

390
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,280
Yes, sir.

391
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,820
Seok-yul, you heard that, right?

392
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,820
You should finish it by tonight.

393
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,160
What?

394
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,030
Check whether One Research Center
updated the data.

395
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,450
Check whether there's some overseas
news and KOTRA materials.

396
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,790
Add the credit check reports
of the companies sent by K-Sure.

397
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:04,000
The page order should be press release,
KOTRA, K-Sure, research center,

398
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,130
and our team's report.
Make it within 15 pages. Got it?

399
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:13,140
Be responsible.

400
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,510
If you teach him one by one,
when can he work on his own?

401
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,560
-Too much kindness is not good.
-You're right,

402
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,400
but he'll cause trouble
if I don't guide him, like last time.

403
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,400
Our Seok-yul is still a newbie, isn't he?

404
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,740
Let me spoil him a little bit more.
Please excuse me.

405
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,400
Then, I'll get off work
after I make the final confirmation.

406
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,490
Seriously. You're really meticulous.

407
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,120
-Goodbye, sir.
-See you tomorrow.

408
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,040
Goodness.

409
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,170
Hey, it's me. Right.

410
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,800
I'm sorry, but I can't make it today.
I need to work overtime.

411
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,220
I'm sorry.

412
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,850
I'll treat you a lot better next time.

413
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,060
Okay. Bye.

414
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,570
What's up? You're not going home?

415
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,900
Today, Jae-kyun will buy us drinks.

416
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,030
Of course, you should hurry.
Let's have a drink.

417
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,370
I'll see you at our spot.

418
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,290
Text me when you're done, Seok-yul.

419
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,980
MR. JUN-SIK SUNG

420
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,830
You may leave work.

421
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,960
If I'm going to fight a filthy dog,

422
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
I should be ready to get filthy too

423
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,550
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS FILE?

424
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,090
I said there's a meeting at 9:30 a.m.
What time is it now?

425
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,640
-I'm sorry.
-Seok-yul.

426
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,230
Didn't you prepare the meeting materials?
You haven't heard about the meeting?

427
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,940
Yes, I prepared them.

428
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,360
What's with you? He said he prepared.

429
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,610
Why didn't you tell me that?

430
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,990
Because you texted me to get off work.

431
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,120
You should've uploaded the file
on the intranet.

432
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,170
Because of the intranet checkup,
I couldn't upload it.

433
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,260
Then, you should have printed it.

434
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,010
The printer was out of order.

435
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,640
But

436
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,850
why can't I find it in the computer?

437
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,640
What? You can't?

438
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,400
The Internet connection was very unstable
yesterday. I guess it wasn't saved.

439
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,610
What?

440
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,820
Please don't worry.

441
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,450
I have a backup file.

442
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,710
So you couldn't confirm
the file yesterday?

443
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,210
I'm sorry, sir.
I had an unexpected visitor yesterday.

444
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,790
I was away for a second.

445
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,340
Gosh.

446
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,970
What bad timing.

447
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,050
Confirm the materials and send them to me.

448
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,550
Yes, sir. Please don't worry.

449
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,310
This isn't right.

450
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,480
Seok-yul.

451
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,450
-Is this number correct?
-Yes.

452
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,240
What's wrong with spacing here?

453
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,910
What do you think will happen
if I hand this over as it is?

454
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,950
You still can't make a file.

455
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,330
This isn't right.

456
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,540
I'll edit it right away, sir.

457
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,460
Okay.

458
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,290
Seok-yul, write an apology for being late.

459
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,760
-I'll be at the meeting.
-Yes, sir.

460
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,180
This isn't right.

461
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,760
Send the file to my email right now.

462
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,650
A fight starts from waiting

463
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,270
when your opponent is strong.

464
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,230
He's not strong at all.

465
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,910
We have a meeting
with the Jordanian buyer, don't we?

466
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,780
Where? Here?

467
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Yes, after they visit their embassy,
they will arrive at 4 p.m.

468
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,540
After the meeting, we'll introduce
the domestic firms to them at 5 p.m.

469
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,330
Afterwards, we'll have dinner together.

470
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,790
Are we having a meeting
with Foreign Investment Team tomorrow?

471
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,710
Yes, sir.

472
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,010
-Geu-rae.
-Yes.

473
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,510
Did you sort out the materials?

474
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,760
I'll finish it by tonight.

475
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,220
-Mr. Cheon and Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

476
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,930
Attend the meeting
with the Foreign Investment Team at 2 p.m.

477
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,720
You know, right?

478
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,890
Tell them not to be fussy
about something weird.

479
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,610
Mr. Oh is in a bad mood today.

480
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,240
Here's the picture of your blind date.

481
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,960
Wow, she's pretty.

482
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,540
You should get married this time for sure.

483
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,470
I know. I have no problem with my job.

484
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,180
With my height, either. And my weight...

485
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,740
Is that because of my weight?

486
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,010
Isn't it because of your hair?

487
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:36,760
By any chance, is it because of my voice?

488
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,890
It would be better
if I had a deeper voice.

489
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,560
Jeez, I'm screwed up.

490
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,850
In regard to the Netherlands project,
I reserved Shema CC for you to play golf

491
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,390
with Samjung's director, Mr. Lim.

492
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,060
I've never heard of that place.

493
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,230
Doesn't it suck?

494
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,070
You know how fabulous it was

495
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,690
last time when Samjung reserved.

496
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,860
This is the hottest country club
these days.

497
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,570
When the Thai prime minister
visited Korea a while ago,

498
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,580
he enjoyed playing a round of golf
with invited entrepreneurs.

499
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,490
Is that so?

500
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,410
We also prepared a ball mark
repair tool for their gift.

501
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,170
We chose it because it symbolizes
environmental concerns.

502
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,120
-The golf course traffic...

503
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,817
-Hey.

504
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:42,190
We don't need anything else
but pretty caddies.

505
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,630
Then, everything will go smoothly.

506
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,930
It would be great if they're pretty,

507
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,180
but you're going to talk about business.

508
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,810
So, I asked for calm and neat caddies.

509
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,060
By the way, Young-yi,

510
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,900
what relationship do you have

511
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,150
with Mr. Shin of Samjung?

512
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,030
When I attended Korea's
Businessmen Meeting,

513
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,400
people were talking
about you and Mr. Shin.

514
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,950
Be prudent with your behavior,
otherwise...

515
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,870
That's irrelevant to work, sir.

516
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,790
What?

517
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,630
What the...

518
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,840
Hello, Mr. Park. Coffee?

519
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,340
Okay, let's have some.

520
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,890
Bitch.

521
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,180
Young-yi.

522
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,140
Is something wrong?

523
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,850
Nothing.

524
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,190
Mr. Ma...

525
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,820
It's nothing.

526
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,440
Hey! Young-yi!

527
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,910
Hey.

528
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,240
You.

529
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:55,250
Are you on cloud nine
after talking back to your boss?

530
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,910
Are you flirting with this guy?

531
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,670
Since you're flirting with anyone,

532
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,340
I told you to be prudent
with your behavior.

533
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,960
I'm your boss.

534
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,130
I warned you because I didn't want you
to be the victim of such a vicious rumor.

535
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,680
How dare you talk back to me?

536
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,350
Do you think you'll be able to marry
with that attitude?

537
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,350
I'm worried about you
because you're like my daughter.

538
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,690
Why am I like your daughter?

539
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,520
What?

540
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,520
Hey!

541
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,780
Then are you like my son?

542
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,320
You're such a jerk.

543
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,450
Why are you staring at me?

544
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,160
What?

545
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,250
Are you accusing me of sexual harassment?

546
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,750
Goodness... Why did you cut in?

547
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,380
You should have stood still
and listened to your boss.

548
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,260
That's all because you talked back to me!

549
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,720
Hey! Mr. Kwak!

550
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,220
Are you okay?

551
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,850
Shouldn't you get ointment in the clinic?

552
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,060
I'm fine.

553
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,810
Wait for a second.

554
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,500
Wipe with this.

555
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,410
Okay.

556
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,380
I should get going.

557
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,550
I need to wash it off.

558
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,560
What are you doing here?

559
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,400
You said, you wanted
to have lunch, mister.

560
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,910
MR. S IS A DEVIL.

561
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,950
Seok-yul.

562
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,870
SAVED

563
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,790
Is he strong?

564
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,170
What do you think
about this kind of coworker?

565
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,080
Okay.

566
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,880
Let's go and eat with Young-yi.

567
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,130
Call her.

568
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,670
Hello.

569
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,140
Young-yi.

570
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,270
Is your neck all right?

571
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,600
Yes.

572
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,690
I'm totally fine.

573
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,400
Seok-yul was looking for you.

574
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,730
He said you would have lunch together,
but you disappeared.

575
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,410
Change your clothes.

576
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,740
It was my fault.

577
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,920
How much is it?

578
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,510
It's a bit expensive.

579
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,010
How much is it?

580
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,970
It's 50 million won.

581
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,890
What?

582
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,520
Thanks for your help earlier.

583
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,860
We should help our coworkers.

584
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,530
You won't.

585
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,410
Four years at college.

586
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,450
There are many people
who studied English abroad.

587
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,580
Unable to find work,
they're suffering, too.

588
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,460
Considering the costs and efforts
that they invested,

589
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,420
it's natural for you
to fall behind in the job market.

590
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,420
A company's manual is like Fort Knox.

591
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,680
There would be no spot for you.

592
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,370
-Mr. Kim.
-What's up? It's Saturday.

593
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,250
I'm at home.

594
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,880
Do you have any plans today?

595
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,920
-No.
- That's good.

596
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,130
-You're my backup plan.
-What?

597
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,130
I have a blind date today.

598
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,970
As usual, I will get rejected today.

599
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,430
How would you feel if you're rejected
at the beginning of a new year?

600
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,430
Come on, it wouldn't happen.

601
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,480
What? You said
I would get rejected because of my hair.

602
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,440
That's...

603
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,900
Be on a standby for an hour.

604
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,110
If I don't call you back within one hour,

605
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,070
you're free to go
and your bro will get married.

606
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:57,780
Bro?

607
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:07,290
Then, do you want to eat?

608
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:10,090
No, I'm fine. Maybe next time.

609
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:13,130
Shall I arrange something fun next time?

610
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,260
No, you're not my Mr. Right.

611
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,510
I'm sorry.

612
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,180
Who is your Mr. Right, then?

613
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,850
I see, I need to lose some weight.

614
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,600
Right. I don't dress fashionably either.

615
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,810
I see. I should straighten my hair.

616
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,190
Isn't this right?

617
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,780
I have a shallow voice.

618
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,110
I wish it would be deeper.

619
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,950
My coworkers picked on me like this.

620
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:43,950
Well...

621
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,120
I don't like you
because you don't look self-centered.

622
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,540
What?

623
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,830
People may compliment you
on your personality,

624
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,250
but someone who lives with you
may feel heavy.

625
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,380
Well, you don't know me well.
I'm terribly self-centered.

626
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,590
I only care about myself.

627
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,140
I'm the most self-centered man
in my company.

628
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,890
I'm sorry, but my father is like that.

629
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:07,680
Because of that,
I saw my mom suffer all the time.

630
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,730
It's just my problem.

631
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,940
I apologize.

632
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,570
Wait.

633
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,450
What was that?

634
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:25,080
It's not because of
my weight, hair, nor voice.

635
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,080
She doesn't like me
because I'm not self-centered?

636
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,130
Not being selfish could be the reason
why I can't be loved by someone.

637
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,810
I guess it's working well.

638
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,410
Yes, Mr. Kim.

639
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,960
Yes, I got it. Take your time.
I'll be there soon.

640
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,840
I think you already drank a lot.

641
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,170
Okay, I got it. Bye.

642
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,600
I didn't ask him where he was.

643
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,100
So which bar is it?

644
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,400
Wow, we're finally drinking together?

645
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,860
How did you know that
I was going to call you?

646
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:39,530
Well...

647
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,950
I get it.
You were just playing hard to get.

648
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,240
You were waiting for my call, right?

649
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,870
BONG-JA OH'S SALON

650
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,040
What's wrong with me?

651
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,380
What's the problem with not being
self-centered? What's wrong with me?

652
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,750
-What's her name?
-Ms. Ha.

653
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,380
Okay, Ms. Ha.

654
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,380
Once upon a time, employees
working for conglomerates were

655
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:07,050
considered the best future husbands.

656
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,310
You know,

657
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:13,640
both men
and women are quite cunning nowadays.

658
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:16,610
The virtues
which used to be highly regarded

659
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,320
don't work anymore.

660
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,490
No, they don't.

661
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,860
I guess.

662
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,780
As male chauvinism is weakening,

663
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,700
sacrifice is gone, too.

664
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,750
Men don't like women who depend on them.

665
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:35,210
As women have their own careers now,

666
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,630
if they can't lead a comfortable life,

667
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,460
they don't open their hearts.

668
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:48,140
It doesn't matter how good the person is.

669
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,720
What do you think, Geu-rae?

670
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:54,940
What?

671
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,440
Your view on marriage.

672
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,440
I'm a temporary employee.

673
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,070
Thanks for your good news.

674
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,780
Cheers!

675
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,030
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

676
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,430
Yes.

677
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,600
I couldn't get a train ticket.
I should use the express bus.

678
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,360
I was too busy at work
to reserve a ticket.

679
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,530
Luckily, I got a bus ticket
at the last minute.

680
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,160
Yes.

681
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,830
Jeez, don't worry. I'll definitely go.

682
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,960
Yes.

683
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,960
Goodnight.

684
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:43,260
EXPRESS BUS TICKET

685
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,400
Mr. Sung.

686
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,860
Isn't he

687
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,950
Jun-sik Sung,

688
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:12,960
the deputy manager of Textile Team One?

689
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,040
POST

690
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,920
Mr. Sung.

691
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,130
You'll be humiliated in public.

692
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,180
I'm Jun-sik Sung of Textile Team One.

693
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,470
I'm sorry for causing a stir.

694
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,930
It's all my fault that I couldn't train
a new employee well.

695
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,940
Hey, you newbie. You shouldn't do this.

696
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:42,320
Even if you hate your coworker, you should
solve the problem within the team.

697
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,240
He doesn't have basic manners.

698
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,110
Who's the newbie in Textile Team One?

699
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,820
Fire him. We have lots
of aspiring candidates.

700
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,870
Do you want to fight with him?

701
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,000
How can a newbie fight?

702
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,870
Don't you think you should wait and see?

703
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,080
A fight starts from waiting.

704
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:59,710
When your opponent is strong...

705
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:19,730
Hello.

706
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,070
What's wrong with you?

707
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:27,360
Hello.

708
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:28,950
Hello.

709
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,280
Are you sick or something?

710
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,740
-Hello.
-Hello.

711
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,000
We receive a new year's gift today.

712
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,500
I gave Mr. Sung a ham gift set

713
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,720
that I received last Thanksgiving.
Why did I do that?

714
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,220
Why did I do that?

715
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,010
Why?

716
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:56,600
Did you read the bulletin board?

717
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,810
Who's that punk, Seok-yul Han?

718
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,940
Textile Team. Mr. Sung's subordinate.

719
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,310
Gosh.

720
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,780
Newbies are so cheeky nowadays.

721
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,530
They got a lot of nerve.

722
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:11,030
It's more like they're just dumb.

723
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,290
Did he really think
it's an anonymous bulletin board?

724
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,250
Mr. Sung is too mild.

725
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,460
He's more like wishy-washy.

726
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,960
If he were on my team,
I would seriously...

727
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,130
Do you want to bet on
how long he would last?

728
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,450
Hello.

729
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:52,780
-Hello.
-Hello.

730
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,420
Hello.

731
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,550
We always receive the same thing.
I haven't used up the previous one, yet.

732
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,390
Jeez. Cooking oil for years.

733
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,350
Do they want to cook their ham with this?

734
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,270
Enough!

735
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,190
Not every temporary employees
receive this.

736
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,360
Let's go.

737
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,780
-Bye.
-See you.

738
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:33,820
COOKING OIL

739
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,540
I said, "Don't ask for too much."

740
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,790
Hello.

741
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:47,710
Don't ask for too much.

742
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,180
Do I need your permission
when I ask for something?

743
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:58,680
What?

744
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,270
Temporary or permanent employee.

745
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:04,850
It's not a matter of status.

746
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:07,650
It's not that.

747
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,900
It's not that?

748
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,320
It's not that.

749
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,830
I just want to keep working

750
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,910
with you, Mr. Cheon, and Mr. Kim.

751
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:26,500
Us.

752
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:29,130
Together.

753
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,300
Forever.

754
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,020
How was your blind date?

755
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,480
Well...

756
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,570
You should have done better. Jeez.

757
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,120
Did something happen?

758
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:04,410
No, sir.

759
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,080
Hey, it's ham!

760
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,860
It's not that.

761
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,490
I just want to keep working

762
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,530
with you, Mr. Cheon and Mr. Kim.

763
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:42,870
Us.

764
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,450
Together.

765
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:48,670
Forever.

766
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:56,880
-Sir.
-Yes.

767
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:04,390
I didn't even ask you. How did you do it?

768
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,310
You taught me everything.

769
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,150
Not everyone, even if taught them,
can do it like this.

770
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,980
Anyway, it's all thanks to you.

771
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:15,940
Thank you.

772
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,070
Wow.

773
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,780
Can I continue working here
if I keep working like this?

774
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:25,330
What?

775
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,610
What are you doing?

776
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,320
Well...

777
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,330
Hello.

778
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:59,910
-Hello.
-The meeting has been moved.

779
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:02,040
I need to leave now.
You buy a gift for Henry.

780
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,170
You better buy it at lunchtime.

781
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,090
-What would be good?
-Of course, red ginseng. Take the receipt.

782
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,290
Yes, sir.

783
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:12,170
Shall we go together at lunchtime?

784
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:14,590
-Well, really?
-Yes.

785
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,180
But

786
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,140
can't you buy a gift on your own, Geu-rae?

787
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:25,980
I need to buy one for my team, anyway.

788
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,330
I think this is the best,
considering its price and quality.

789
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,090
Yes, this is good.

790
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,670
Since it represents Korea's image,

791
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,640
we recommend this product
as a gift for foreign buyers.

792
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,890
Whose gift is Baek-ki looking for?

793
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,770
I don't know. Maybe for his parents?

794
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,350
We'll take this.

795
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,020
-Please wait at the counter.
-All right.

796
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,030
What products are you looking for, sir?

797
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,570
Well, I...

798
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,450
I want something good
for the health and easy to take.

799
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,500
All of our products are good
for your health and easy to take.

800
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,590
If you're done, let's go back.

801
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,130
-Hey, you're back.
-Yes.

802
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,340
Thank you.

803
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,430
Let's get off work early today.

804
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,390
Are you going to drop it at King's?

805
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,100
-Yes.
-Say hello to Henry.

806
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,060
Yes, sir.

807
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,810
Geu-rae, come over here.

808
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:51,560
Yes, sir.

809
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:56,030
Here you go.

810
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,490
Happy Lunar New Year.

811
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,700
I'm fine.

812
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,000
You should just say thank you and take it.

813
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,920
That's right.

814
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:15,420
Thank you, sir.

815
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:17,730
Is this a new year's bonus?

816
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,110
Do they still put it in an envelope?

817
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,620
No, Mr. Oh gave it to me
to celebrate the new year.

818
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,450
That's so kind of him.

819
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,080
Did you thank him?

820
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:32,670
Yes, I did.

821
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,110
You should massage harder.

822
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,690
Like a real man.

823
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,150
I said, "Don't ask for too much."

824
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:42,650
Don't ask for too much.

825
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,910
Do I need your permission
even when I ask for something?

826
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:52,790
What?

827
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:56,250
Temporary or permanent employee.

828
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,790
It's not a matter of status.

829
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:01,420
It's not that.

830
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,880
It's not that?

831
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,680
It's not that.

832
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:12,100
I just want to keep working

833
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,270
with you, Mr. Cheon, and Mr. Kim.

834
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:20,770
Us.

835
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:23,440
Together.

836
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,780
Forever.

837
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,460
Nosy people will rush in tomorrow.

838
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,090
You better rest somewhere else.

839
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:49,090
What?

840
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,450
Mom gave me freedom,

841
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,200
when I gave up on go.

842
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,240
My mom defended me.

843
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,290
She yelled back at some nosy relatives.

844
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:20,330
With what kind of story

845
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,880
will they torture my mom?

846
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:26,880
The story about quitting my first job

847
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:28,760
and escaping to the army?

848
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:32,300
About being a temporary
employee with a two-year contract?

849
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:36,350
On holidays,

850
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:40,850
we experience the bad temper
of other family members.

851
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,820
It kept troubling my mind

852
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,110
that I left my mom alone there.

853
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,030
But it would be better if I'm not around.

854
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:53,780
Nevertheless.

855
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:56,990
I have nowhere to go.

856
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,290
I lived such a pitiful life.

857
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,000
I have no friends

858
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,960
to have a cup of coffee with,

859
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,800
go to movies with,
or walk by the riverside with.

860
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,990
-Where should I put this?
-Here.

861
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:38,450
Hey, take this. It's heavy.

862
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,650
May I help you?

863
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,400
Hey, you're Geu-rae Jang
of Sales Team Three?

864
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:49,700
-Yes.
-Why did you come on a holiday?

865
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,680
You're a temporary employee.

866
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,390
Don't work too hard.
This won't make you a regular employee.

867
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:02,020
Damn temporary employee.

868
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:04,900
Today,

869
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,910
I have nowhere to stay.

870
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,840
Wait, I'm wrong.

871
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,310
I wasn't thinking straight.

872
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:47,570
I shouldn't have left the house,
leaving my mom alone.

873
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,380
My Geu-rae.

874
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:08,470
He already had a bright future
when playing the game of  baduk .

875
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:10,940
-My boy...
- Please...

876
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,570
-Please don't make an excuse for me.
-I...

877
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,820
I realized very early

878
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,120
that he's so talented.

879
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,330
He comes back home very late.

880
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,170
He's got a lot of work
because he's so capable.

881
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:30,090
A higher-up of his company
once visited him in the middle of night

882
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:32,380
and stayed here for a long time.

883
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:37,180
You know, when he played  baduk ,
people swarmed around him.

884
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:42,430
So many people wanted
to ask him this and that.

885
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:46,100
You know how great he looks in a suit?

886
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:49,270
Even when he wore his father's suit
which didn't even fit him,

887
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,030
he still looked so fantastic.

888
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:54,780
As if he was born to be an office worker,

889
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:58,030
he looked awesome in a suit.

890
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,910
Besides, is his company
just an ordinary one?

891
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:06,710
It's one of the top five
trading companies in our country.

892
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:09,750
Come on, we get it.

893
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:13,840
He's a temporary employee,
but you're bragging so much.

894
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,880
What will happen
if he becomes a regular employee?

895
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:21,640
Hey, you. Do you think
a temporary employee is nothing?

896
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,770
My Geu-rae.

897
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:26,890
Going through all sorts of hardships...

898
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:32,480
Why are you crying?

899
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:38,740
After he failed in  baduk ,
I always treated him with a smile.

900
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,950
I was worried that he would get depressed.

901
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,910
But he smiles back at me.

902
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,920
Although he's suffering a lot,
he smiles at me.

903
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:54,000
My Geu-rae is that kind of person.

904
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,010
I understand. Please have a drink.

905
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,700
Don't forget.

906
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:28,960
I am

907
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,170
Mom's pride.

908
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,130
I'm not a disappointment to her.

909
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:54,900
Hello.

910
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:57,690
Hello.

911
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,540
Isn't it all thanks
to your discerning eye?

912
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,170
Mr. Oh.

913
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:30,090
Let's have some tea.

914
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:47,890
Geu-rae.

915
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:51,010
I'm going to have coffee.
Do you want some?

916
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:52,890
-Let me make mine.
-All right.

917
01:09:58,190 --> 01:09:59,730
It's time to start
on a new project, right?

918
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,820
Yes, we're working on it.

919
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:03,610
Will he make it work again?

920
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:05,820
I mean, Geu-rae Jang.

921
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,610
Have a seat.

922
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:18,920
It's interesting. Quite interesting.

923
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,960
Without any concern or calculation,

924
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,300
he solely focuses on work.

925
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,170
Like a daredevil.

926
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:29,340
Like you-know-who.

927
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:34,270
Speaking of which, he reminds me of you
when you were at his age.

928
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:38,230
Wasn't it fun searching for business
items and learning work?

929
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:41,060
Do you remember?

930
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,740
When we first dug germanium
in the East Sea.

931
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:51,700
We went here and there to find a refinery.

932
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:57,370
Even without insurance,
we handled lots of projects.

933
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,870
When that company notified us

934
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:03,840
of not producing the items,

935
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,460
they even asked for compensation.

936
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,630
So some people took responsibility
and got fired.

937
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,220
We withstood it at that time.

938
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,640
You know what, Mr. Oh?

939
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,150
Sang-sik.

940
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:30,230
Sometimes.

941
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,190
I wonder

942
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:38,240
why you became distant from me.

943
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:40,950
We

944
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,200
were close like fellow soldiers.

945
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,080
The one who took responsibility
and got fired

946
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,710
at that time was Eun-ji Lee, only one.

947
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,670
Who?

948
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:59,140
The one who died?

949
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,180
I think she committed
some improper actions.

950
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,270
Now it makes sense why you're still stuck

951
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:16,440
in Sales Team Three.

952
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,070
What an idiot.

953
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,240
Back in those days,

954
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,160
you bent over backwards
to help temporary employees.

955
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:34,210
Are you going to do the same thing
for Geu-rae Jang?

956
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:43,050
I'll have to drink tea later, sir.

957
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,180
That's right. Back then,

958
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,190
didn't you say you
would take responsibility?

959
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,730
Didn't you?

960
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,690
Or did you say
you won't take responsibility?

961
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:01,700
I can't remember well.

962
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:30,060
Instead of Eun-ji Lee,

963
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,730
will you take responsibility?

964
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:33,810
Will you?

965
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:35,770
Will you take responsibility?

966
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,250
Take a deep breath.

967
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:06,970
Mr. Choi.

968
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:11,310
He couldn't even remember Eun-ji.

969
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:19,570
-He probably pretended not to.
-No, he really can't remember her.

970
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,280
Because she's not worth
remembering to him.

971
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,530
He can calculate that by instinct.

972
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,240
From that incident,

973
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:33,540
he completely removed his involvement.

974
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,130
It was so perfect that
he even convinced himself.

975
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,260
It's not his intention but his instinct.

976
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,720
That's why he's a scary man.

977
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,020
Every day,

978
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,360
I gave advice to Eun-ji,

979
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,190
like self-help books.

980
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:06,490
"Attend college at night."

981
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:08,620
"Pursue your dream."

982
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:14,000
"Your hard work will pay off."

983
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:16,000
"If you work hard, you'll find a way."

984
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:20,210
She was smart.

985
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,510
She would still be alive now
if not for me.

986
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:34,930
She could have worked
without any problems.

987
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,190
She could have gotten married
to a nice guy.

988
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:42,110
She could have lived a happy life.
She was a good girl.

989
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,410
She smiled and said,

990
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:54,500
"Thank you, sir."

991
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,090
"Can I continue working here
if I keep working like this?"

992
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,350
Geu-rae asked me

993
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,060
the same question.

994
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,690
If I do what I usually do,
can I become a regular employee?

995
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,860
I said he can't.

996
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:25,570
Mr. Oh.

997
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:29,070
His situation is more difficult
than Eun-ji's.

998
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:31,570
What's the use of giving him

999
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,040
false hope or irresponsible consolation?

1000
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,000
I'm...

1001
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:47,590
I'm more horrified to learn

1002
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:50,590
we're living in a world
where we can't even give false hope

1003
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,930
or irresponsible consolation.

1004
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,180
Even if it's a word of false hope,

1005
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,480
there are many people desperate for that.

1006
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:14,530
Nonetheless,

1007
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,290
he can't.

1008
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,360
I can't even drink water
in front of you, Seok-yul.

1009
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,310
Do it again.

1010
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,280
Mr. Oh has treated Geu-rae differently
since beginning of this year.

1011
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,280
Isn't it still true
one of us was sacrificed for him?

1012
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,280
-You're making your life harder.
-If you have time to butt in,

1013
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:55,740
work on your weaknesses.

1014
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:59,330
One step forward today,
two steps backward the following day.

1015
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:00,960
-A 100 thousand won for Geu-rae?
-Maybe.

1016
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,160
Tell him to take Baek-ki, too.

1017
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:03,920
You said you would sell it,
whatever it may be.

1018
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,380
