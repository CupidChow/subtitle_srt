<i>This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.</i>

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,120
<i>All characters and events are fictitious
and have no historic basis.</i>

00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,520
Episode 14

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,030
<i>Shaman Wol, although you have been
cleared of false charges,</i>

7
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:27,100
<i>you have acknowledged using sorcery
to seduce a member of the royal clan.</i>

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,930
<i>Therefore, you shall be exiled outside
the capital to the western sick ward,</i>

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,879
<i>where you shall care
for the sick and the nomads.</i>

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,869
<i>In order for you to never use
wicked sorcery again,</i>

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,450
<i>the Euigeumbu* will watch your every move.
(*Royal Investigation Bureau)</i>

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,240
What do you think?

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,150
Doesn't the tea have a refined scent?

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,789
It does, indeed.

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,609
What tea is this?

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,920
Tea made with dried mandarin orange peel.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,509
This tea is not only effective
against colds,

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,530
but also has an intense attribute

19
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,999
that circulates warmth
throughout the body, I hear.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,350
I have heard that, as well.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,550
Unlike other teas, this tea's effects
are said to become stronger over time.

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,200
Doesn't it resemble you, Your Highness?

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,820
So, even though I age,

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,580
my capabilities don't fade.

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,679
I know you are just flattering me,

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,579
but I admit it's not a bad feeling.

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,919
I am not uttering empty words
just to please you.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,060
Because of your recent efforts,

29
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,159
I have been able
to maintain my honor as monarch.

30
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,470
Do you sincerely think that, Your Majesty?

31
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,460
Yes.

32
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,140
Then Your Majesty

33
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,360
now owes this grandmother a debt.

34
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,550
Isn't that so?

35
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,470
Yes.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,310
In the future,

37
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,670
if there is cause for me
to make a request of Your Majesty,

38
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,290
then Your Majesty

39
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,390
must fulfill that request.

40
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,050
Could there be any doubt?

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,539
According to the forecast of Gwansanggam,

42
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,819
on the first of the month,
there will be a solar eclipse.

43
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,350
This particular one will be a total eclipse
and will completely obscure the sun.

44
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,619
Therefore, we request that you show caution
and take part in an eclipse ceremony.

45
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,849
Thus, I have ordered Gwansanggam
to prepare the eclipse ceremony.

46
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,569
Traditionally, this sort of phenomenon
of nature has been considered

47
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,399
an admonition from the heavens
for a grave mistake made by the King.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,969
Therefore, with modest posture, you will
need to denounce your own inadequacies

49
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,929
and restrain your actions with caution.

50
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,299
That is so, Your Majesty.

51
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,709
A solar eclipse is considered among
extraordinary natural phenomena.

52
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,120
A vile energy blocks the sun,

53
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,769
while the sun's energy is clouded.

54
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,049
It is the heaven's warning that Your
Majesty's wisdom and judgment are clouded.

55
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,939
The mere fact that a crafty shaman
was kept beside him,

56
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,840
isn't that to be blamed on clouded judgment?

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,899
We ask that Your Majesty

58
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,179
humbly accept the Court's counsel.

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,199
Restrain your actions
and continue to restrain your actions.

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,530
Restrain your actions.

61
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,949
If a monarch fears nothing,
it shall lead to misgovernment,

62
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,520
and that shall bring forth
calamity and disaster.

63
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,230
And now that a natural phenomenon
comes to find us,

64
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,910
you must assent to its proper significance.

65
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,050
I will give the matter proper consideration.

66
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,080
Generally, disasters
do not happen for no reason,

67
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,290
so this was the result of my unworthiness.

68
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,630
As such, I shall begin to show
more restraint in my actions.

69
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,040
The imprisoned shaman

70
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,569
will be sent out of the province.

71
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,989
However, Prince Yang Myung,
who has sullied the royal family's name,

72
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,930
must be subject to disciplinary punishment.

73
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,309
His innocence has already been established.
Why should he be punished?!

74
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,439
In my opinion,

75
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,940
Prince Yang Myung should be
confined to his home for the time being

76
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,550
and be cautious in his behavior.

77
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,189
I believe that is
the proper course of action.

78
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,180
Therefore, The Ministry of Military Affairs
has already sent over soldiers.

79
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,450
Who's path are you blocking right now?

80
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,659
Do you all truly want to die?!

81
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,390
There is a royal order prohibiting you
from leaving your home.

82
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,300
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

83
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,370
<i>it's not enough to shackle me
with the title of King's kin</i>

84
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,060
<i>that now you must tie up my feet, as well?</i>

85
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,099
Did you see His Majesty's face today
in the royal palace?

86
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,990
He was completely subdued like a child
facing a parent with whip in hand.

87
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,449
A phenomenon of nature as cause for
introspection is a long held traditional view,

88
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,969
so how could His Majesty contradict?

89
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,150
However,

90
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,779
knowing full well the implied meaning,
he kept quiet about it.

91
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,670
He must have been churning
with anxiety within.

92
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,179
We must keep pushing forward
with this momentum.

93
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,680
So that he can never again
throw his weight about like a wild stallion.

94
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,770
Why are you smiling so lasciviously?

95
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,739
I daresay a spring breeze
is blowing in my heart.

96
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,190
Spring breeze?

97
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,910
Ahh.

98
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,059
Which gisaeng* is it this time?
(*female courtesan/entertainer)

99
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,249
It's not a gisaeng.

100
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,810
If it's not a gisaeng...

101
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,460
Even smeared and splattered with blood,

102
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,619
how could she be so pretty?

103
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,680
Then, are you talking about
the butcher's daughter?

104
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,480
She's the first girl
that ever spoke defiantly to me.

105
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,880
That haughty
and righteous gleam in her eyes...

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,280
I can't forget it.

107
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,260
Isn't there a way I could take her
and keep her at my side?

108
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,900
[Immoral]

109
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,760
Your Majesty.

110
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,650
Why have you come to this sordid place?

111
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,540
I came to ask one thing

112
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,200
and answer one thing.

113
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,010
Will you answer first?

114
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,960
Or will you hear my answer first?

115
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,840
Dare I ask Your Majesty
to make your statement first?

116
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,980
I said to you,

117
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,220
that until I put my confusion to rest,

118
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,290
that until I understand what it is I feel,

119
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,080
you were not to go far from me.

120
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,660
Do you remember when I issued such an order?

121
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,180
I remember.

122
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,830
Now,

123
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,630
I want to tell you
that I've found the answer.

124
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,010
You were correct.

125
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,730
It was not you I was looking at.

126
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,090
I was just seeing...

127
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,010
that child through you.

128
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,080
Therefore now,

129
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,110
you may go far from me.

130
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,790
I shall follow your order.

131
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,830
Now,

132
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,600
will you answer?

133
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,860
Please ask your question.

134
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,960
Do you have any final words...

135
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,840
you'd like to say to me?

136
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,300
I do not have any.

137
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,850
Even if you have words
of bitterness and resentment,

138
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,630
please say what you like.

139
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,080
Those,

140
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,850
I do not have, either.

141
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,070
Your Majesty.

142
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,320
To...

143
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,880
that girl who gave me warm words of solace,

144
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,690
I...

145
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,200
was unable to leave her
a single word of tenderness.

146
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,060
However,

147
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,370
in your way,

148
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,210
you have protected her.

149
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,950
I have hurt her so deeply...

150
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,130
and this...

151
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,080
can this also...

152
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,650
be protecting her?

153
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,320
<i>All of this</i>

154
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,530
<i>is my lot to endure.</i>

155
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,660
<i>I pray...</i>

156
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,600
<i>I pray you stand firm in your resolution.</i>

157
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,259
<i>I'm certain I have seen her somewhere.</i>

158
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,870
<i>I'm certain.</i>

159
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,529
I have absolutely never practiced
such sorcery.

160
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,719
You bastard!

161
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,599
You must have thought
I was the only one that saw.

162
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,419
You must think it will end
if you just get rid of me.

163
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,319
You're wrong, you bastard.

164
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,939
The heaven's moon was watching you.

165
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,779
<i>That man's blood wasn't the only thing
that was soaked into your blade that night.</i>

166
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,479
<i>Wait and see, you bastard!</i>

167
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,210
<i>There will be a day when that moonlight
will certainly cut your lifeline!</i>

168
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,909
Why are you acting like that again,
Your Highness?

169
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,530
Do you not hear that strange sound
of a girl crying?

170
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,310
Why do you keep doing this?

171
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,210
Court Lady Park.

172
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,169
Did you just hear something like
the sound of crying?

173
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,370
The sound of crying?

174
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,880
I don't hear anything.

175
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,210
<i>It's Eunweol Pavilion.</i>

176
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,120
<i>The sound is certainly coming
from Eunweol Pavilion.</i>

177
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,220
<i>The bonds that were severed by people</i>

178
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,910
<i>are being reconnected by the heavens.</i>

179
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,639
<i>After this phenomenon of nature,</i>

180
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,469
<i>all creation will return
to its proper place.</i>

181
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,970
<i>And, the winds will soon bring blood.</i>

182
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,170
<i>No one...</i>

183
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,280
<i>will be able to escape it.</i>

184
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,280
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>

185
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,790
<i>a man came by...</i>

186
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,870
<i>asking about the lady.</i>

187
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,970
<i>Oh, dear! Have you been frightened?</i>

188
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,510
Now, you will be able to obtain
what you want, Princess.

189
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,020
Princess.

190
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,390
Please wake up.

191
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,220
The Prince Consort...

192
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,900
What about my husband?

193
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,149
Has he been affected by some illness?

194
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,019
That's not the case.

195
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,369
He heard of His Majesty's illness
while traveling

196
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,800
and has returned suddenly.

197
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,059
Where is my husband right now?

198
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,469
After he paid his respects to Madam,
he has gone to his quarters...

199
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,539
What are you doing? You must not.

200
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,099
The Prince Consort is a dignified gentleman.

201
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,360
Please maintain your dignity...

202
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,450
Oh, my goodness!

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,760
Pri... Princess.

204
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,140
You came...

205
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,580
You came back so soon...

206
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,660
Why did you not come and let me see you?

207
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,020
I was going to come and see you
after I had washed.

208
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:58,210
I missed you very much.

209
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,990
I missed you so very much...

210
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,020
Did you say the sound of crying?

211
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,289
That's right.

212
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,060
Crying, which has been heard from
the closed Eunweol Pavilion.

213
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,710
It may be due...

214
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,229
to the eclipse coming in a few days.

215
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,890
The eclipse...

216
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,860
that's been forecasted for a long time now.

217
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,149
How is that connected to the strange rumors?

218
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,619
In an eclipse,

219
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,619
the yang energy of the sun is veiled
by the yin energy of the moon.

220
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,240
Thus, the weak-minded begin to feel
a sense of uneasiness.

221
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,930
Is that so?

222
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,819
Has Your Highness
heard the sound of crying, too?

223
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,510
What a ridiculous thing to say!

224
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,950
Am I such a weak-minded person?!

225
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,830
For... forgive me, Your Highness.

226
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,780
Using this strange story as an excuse,

227
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,520
people are tittering about,
saying things they should dare not.

228
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,140
That must be corrected.

229
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,510
What else could be my intent?

230
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,419
Th-then, you must make a plan
with the High Shaman of Seongsucheong...

231
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,339
That cannot happen!

232
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,129
Excuse me?

233
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,969
Wh- why...

234
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,950
If Gwansanggam and Seongsucheong
both step in,

235
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,120
the strange story gains power.

236
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,060
Therefore,

237
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,770
the Eunweol Pavilion situation must be
addressed by Gwansanggam...

238
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,590
No...

239
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,300
Must be addressed by you,

240
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,210
alone, in secret.

241
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,070
If... if you insist,

242
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,610
what if we perform a dead spirit comforting
ritual during the eclipse ceremony?

243
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,770
Dead spirit comforting ritual?

244
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,200
Then,

245
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,219
would the sound of the crying girl go away?

246
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,650
As the term implies, the ritual
is for comforting the spirit of the dead.

247
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,639
The result depends on whether the spirit
is readily comforted or not.

248
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,420
Isn't that Seongsucheong's competency?!

249
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,260
Is there no other way?

250
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,350
We... well,

251
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,590
there is one last resort.

252
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,300
What is that?

253
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,200
Th... th... that...

254
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,689
Ay, you sure are being a stickler.

255
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,050
You could just look away this once.

256
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,200
Ahjussi, I'm begging.

257
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,169
Just let us see our unni this once.

258
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,129
Seriously. I'm telling you it's impossible,
it's not up to us.

259
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,500
Nothing is impossible!

260
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,710
Seol.

261
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,830
Really, I shouldn't do this.

262
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,360
All right, then just one of you
and make it quick.

263
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,019
Seol, you take Jan Shil
back to Seongsucheong.

264
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,530
I don't want to. I'm going in.

265
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,850
Go on. Do you not hear me?!

266
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,180
[Immoral]

267
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,290
Child.

268
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,420
How do you feel?

269
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,740
Is it bearable?

270
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:44,090
I'm sorry to have worried you.

271
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,739
Seol and Jan Shil are also very worried
because of me, aren't they?

272
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,470
Who are you worrying about at this moment?

273
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,790
Mistress, are you crying?

274
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,020
A long time ago,

275
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,070
I had a very close friend.

276
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,420
She was a pitiable and honest friend.

277
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,410
The last time I saw her...

278
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,230
was right here.

279
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,910
And that friend's last request to me

280
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,070
was to take care of you.

281
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,870
To protect you in her place.

282
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,830
To protect you no matter what happened.

283
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,040
She asked me in utmost earnest.

284
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,760
Was she perhaps my mother?

285
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:55,490
But, I was shortsighted.

286
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,670
I was trying to protect you,

287
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,709
but rather, I put you in more danger.

288
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,170
Mistress, you have always protected me.

289
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,490
You accepted me,

290
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,980
abandoned by my own parents,

291
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,010
raised me, and protected me up to now.

292
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,890
Do you remember?

293
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,530
When I said I didn't want to be a shaman

294
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,340
and was going to kill myself,

295
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,780
that time I made such a ruckus?

296
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,330
It was then you said to me,

297
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,440
if the gods chose me,

298
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,960
that there must be a reason why.

299
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,040
And, whether I felt pain or misery,

300
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,940
they have given me the ability to bear it.

301
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,190
Ever since then I've believed this,

302
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,410
that there is no pain without meaning.

303
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,920
The pain I'm feeling right now, too...

304
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:07,070
there must be a reason why
the gods have brought it to me.

305
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,200
Mistress.

306
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,719
I knew that wench
would get into some big trouble.

307
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,049
She has some nerve.

308
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,329
How could she have set her sights
on His Majesty's kin?

309
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,409
Still, thanks to that grand family,
she managed to avoid death.

310
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,229
Death would have been better.

311
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:06,049
Wearing the symbol of immorality on her chest,
she was exiled to the sick ward.

312
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,629
Could that really be considered living?

313
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,680
Hey!

314
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,680
Say one more word. Just one more.

315
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,650
I am ready to wreak proper havoc today!

316
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:33,139
Miss, you will be confronted
with yet another heartbreak.

317
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,750
Why are you acting this way, Mistress?

318
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,719
What do you mean "Miss"?

319
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,210
What is it you need to protect
and what is it you need to cast aside?

320
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,260
The only one who knows the answer to that
is you, Miss.

321
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,450
Therefore,
do not look for answers externally.

322
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,630
Rather, you must find the answers
within yourself.

323
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,220
What are you saying?

324
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,890
Can you explain?

325
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,200
Whatever truth you come face to face with,

326
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,410
please keep one thing in mind.

327
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,960
You are stronger than anyone.

328
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,900
Your wisdom will lead you
to the right decision.

329
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,020
The strength of your will shall prevail.

330
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,480
Mistress.

331
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,720
Therefore, just have faith in yourself

332
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,770
and follow your instinct.

333
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,190
<i>And also,</i>

334
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,219
ultimately,

335
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,530
<i>you must not forgive me.</i>

336
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,770
Are you really
going to just leave her like that?

337
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,399
I'm asking you if you're going to just
give up and leave her!

338
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,559
Lower your voice.

339
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,259
Why should I?

340
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,500
I've trusted you
and did as you directed up to now.

341
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,799
You've told me to keep quiet
to save her life, so I did!

342
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,109
Every time the poor miss
asked about her past,

343
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,700
I lied as naturally as if I were eating.

344
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,529
But, what is this?

345
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,180
The sick ward?!

346
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,209
It's not enough she had to act as
a human talisman,

347
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,420
now she has to go to the lowest
of the low places, the sick ward!

348
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,650
I can't even stay by her side and
protect her anymore!

349
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,940
It is her destiny.

350
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,590
What?

351
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,350
Just because it's not happening to you,
is it right for you to speak of it so lightly?!

352
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,130
Even if there is darkness all around,

353
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,220
if a moon emerges from the darkness,
there is no way to block its light.

354
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,759
Until it can emerge and shine its light
on its own, all we can do is wait.

355
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,570
What does that mean?

356
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,730
Speak in a way I can understand!

357
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,190
The truth will be revealed soon.

358
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,200
So, all we can do is await her response.

359
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,350
Everything is in her hands now.

360
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,880
In half an hour,

361
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,470
they are taking her to the sick ward.

362
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,660
Your Majesty.

363
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,280
Why do you call me?

364
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,220
I shall...

365
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,610
make a snowman.

366
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,360
However,

367
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,680
this will be the last time.

368
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,650
When spring comes,

369
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,440
the snow will melt away.

370
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,259
But,

371
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:41,320
right now I shall gather only clean,
white snow that has not been tread upon,

372
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:48,430
and make for you one last snowman.

373
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,379
Tell me right now!

374
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,510
Why did you send away our girl in
the King's quarters without my permission?!

375
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,319
I didn't think it was something that
Your Highness should be subjected to hear.

376
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,180
Shall I call her here myself
and ask her directly?

377
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,130
That...

378
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,720
His Majesty,
in the middle of the night last night,

379
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,510
said he was taking a walk
and left his bed chambers.

380
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,790
He ordered all to stay

381
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:28,419
and asked only Swordsman Woon
to accompany him...

382
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,470
Asked Swordsman Woon to follow him and?

383
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,880
He headed for the *Eigeumbu prison.
(*Royal Investigation Bureau)

384
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,529
He was probably just going to
confirm the prisoners.

385
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,310
So, please do not get angry...

386
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,210
<i>The girl should not have been
allowed to live.</i>

387
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,790
<i>She should not have been allowed to live.</i>

388
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,579
The ph-physician...

389
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,259
call the physician! Quickly!

390
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,740
The physician!

391
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,399
Where are you hurrying to?

392
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,040
That is...

393
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,280
The Queen...

394
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,850
The Queen...

395
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,480
I told you not to let anyone in!

396
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,210
Give it to me.

397
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,040
Is it only your love that is agonizing?

398
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,520
Is my love insignificant?

399
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,640
Your Majesty

400
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,770
was my first love.

401
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,620
Your Majesty knows better than anyone...

402
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,580
how it feels to lose someone you love.

403
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,920
So, how can you be so cruel?

404
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,490
A beggar could not be more wretched than me!

405
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:26,820
<i>It is too cruel and sad, is it not?</i>

406
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,840
<i>Myself,</i>

407
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,470
<i>the Queen,</i>

408
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,850
<i>Hyungnim,</i>

409
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,490
<i>and</i>

410
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,180
<i>that child.</i>

411
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,589
Yeon Woo.

412
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,520
Madam. Madam!

413
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,729
Madam, why are you doing this?

414
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,990
Madam, Madam!

415
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,689
- Yeon Woo!
- Please, Madam.

416
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,960
Please move out of the way.

417
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,120
Yeon Woo.

418
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,050
Aigoo. Aigoo. Just a moment, please.

419
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,740
- Oh Madam, please.
- Please move. Please.

420
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,660
Yeon Woo!

421
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,779
Please watch out!
Move out of the way!

422
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,060
<i>Oh, Madam! Madam!</i>

423
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,150
<i>Madam.</i>

424
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,280
Please move away.

425
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,180
<i>Madam, Madam.</i>

426
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,399
Oh, Madam.

427
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,090
Aigoo, Madam. Aigoo.

428
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,179
From here on, follow those people.

429
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,940
Was I not to go to the sick ward?

430
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,580
Take her.

431
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,290
Just a moment.

432
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,950
What?!

433
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,379
Where are you going to take me?

434
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,729
You'll know when we get there.

435
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,400
Are you going to break strict royal law?

436
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,539
I'm abiding by a law
more frightening than royal law.

437
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,800
Follow me!

438
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,119
Did you just say the
prisoner disappeared on the way?

439
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,909
I went to the sick ward as you ordered,

440
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,409
and that is what I heard.

441
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,760
Where?

442
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,629
Which direction did they say she went?

443
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,100
Well,

444
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,959
they must have taken side roads because
people were heckling her so much.

445
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,250
It is presumed that
they then ran into a band of burglars.

446
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,840
Lord! Lord!

447
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,710
What are you doing here?

448
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,449
Where are you planning to go?

449
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,459
I have asked why you are here.

450
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,190
Shouldn't you remain cautious still?

451
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,760
Please go back inside.

452
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,880
Have you come as a friend?

453
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,190
Or have you come by royal order?

454
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,490
These days,

455
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,420
I often hear the crying of this sword.

456
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,310
It may feel stifled as it has not been
unsheathed for quite some time.

457
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,680
It cries so sorrowfully.

458
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:20,790
So, I fear I may swing this sword
recklessly and make a mistake.

459
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,619
My skills are not what they once were.

460
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,389
Lord.

461
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,469
If you cross swords with me,

462
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,580
my forgotten swordsmanship may return to me.

463
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,110
Will you accept?

464
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,390
Ah,

465
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:37,350
you are Swordsman Woon
who protects His Majesty.

466
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,699
I suppose you cannot swing your sword
at will without a royal order.

467
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,400
At times, a false wicked act is
more dangerous than a false virtuous one.

468
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,309
What are you going to do?

469
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,260
Are you going to wait for a royal order?

470
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,850
A sword held out of anger is dangerous.

471
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,680
A sword held out of love
is even more dangerous.

472
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,940
Who is that anger directed at?

473
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,200
If I knew that,

474
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,420
I probably would not have even
leapt at you like a mad man.

475
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,609
Why can you not consider
what His Majesty is feeling?

476
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,570
Then, why can you not consider...

477
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,440
what your friend is feeling?

478
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,590
Are you going to report it?

479
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,430
Report what?

480
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,140
Since I brandished a sword at Swordsman Woon
who came on a royal order,

481
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,750
I suppose it's tantamount to treason.

482
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,470
Here today,

483
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,790
neither Swordsman Woon...

484
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,470
nor His Majesty's kin stood in this spot.

485
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,620
It was just...

486
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,450
two long-time friends...

487
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,310
that were here.

488
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,980
This is the palace, is it not?

489
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,330
<i>We use a receptacle for the soul.</i>

490
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,239
A receptacle for the soul?

491
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,819
Yes.

492
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,669
Just as the term implies,
one receives the soul with one's entire body.

493
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,899
But,

494
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,899
it is only possible with one who's body
can take in the gods, a shaman.

495
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,579
A spirit, a soul is taken in by a human?

496
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,359
It is a sort of sacrificial offering.

497
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,169
The person is locked in with the soul
at the place where a grudge is held,

498
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,359
and takes in that grudge into her body.

499
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,559
Is that really possible?

500
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,240
It is.

501
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,489
On top of that,

502
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,799
there will be a total eclipse.

503
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,370
At the point when the moon veils the sun
and the yin energy is strong,

504
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:26,019
if we bring in a receptacle for the soul
as a sacrificial offering,

505
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,549
the effect will be doubled.

506
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,730
Then,

507
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:34,929
will the sound of crying vanish
from Eunweol Pavilion?

508
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,740
It will.

509
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,729
However...

510
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,020
However?

511
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,529
If a shaman
becomes a receptacle for the soul,

512
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:46,819
her own soul may be driven out
in order to receive a strange soul,

513
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,649
and grave danger may follow.

514
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,290
Danger?

515
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,279
Could she die?

516
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,770
If the soul's grudge is strong,

517
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,180
I have heard eight or nine times out of ten,
the soul embeds itself,

518
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,369
and the shaman either faints
or loses her life.

519
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:05,509
So, there will likely be no shaman
willing to be the sacrificial offering.

520
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,890
How timely.

521
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,010
A girl that is perfect for this job...

522
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,770
comes to mind.

523
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,759
You probably know,

524
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,829
that this is a closed building.

525
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,339
There is no use in screaming,

526
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,740
so don't waste your energy
and just quietly carry out your duty.

527
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,350
I will return tomorrow.

528
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,220
[Talisman]

529
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,120
<i>Have you taken her there?</i>

530
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,340
Yes, Your Highness.

531
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,979
Did you explain in a way
she could understand?

532
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,919
I told her it was her duty
to comfort the soul in Eunweol Pavilion,

533
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,109
so that is what she thinks.

534
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,530
This...

535
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:38,719
must never get out.

536
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,130
Particularly,

537
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,200
the King must never know.

538
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,990
Yes, Your Highness.

539
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,840
I knew I'd be using her someday
in a big way,

540
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,880
but I didn't know
I'd be using her like this.

541
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:03,560
If her life is spared, take her
to the sick ward for the time-being.

542
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,340
There will be another need to use her later.

543
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:14,030
I will carry out your order.

544
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,870
[Talisman]

545
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,570
[Talisman]

546
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,780
[Talisman]

547
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,599
<i>Even now, at night,</i>

548
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,589
<i>from Eunweol Pavilion
that was used by the Crown Princess,</i>

549
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,729
<i>they say you can hear the crying of a ghost.</i>

550
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,739
<i>Is that the crying of the late Maiden Heo?</i>

551
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,489
<i>Why? What would she be so upset about?</i>

552
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,059
Anyhow, after a healthy Crown Princess
died suddenly,

553
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,629
some people conjectured whether
it could have been poisoning or murder.

554
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,330
<i>Inside the palace,
it was a hot topic for a while.</i>

555
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:10,300
<i>The soul I am to comfort</i>

556
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:14,270
<i>is none other than the girl
so dear to His Majesty?</i>

557
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,700
As you all know,

558
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,330
in the courtyard of the Throne Hall today,
there will be an eclipse ceremony.

559
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,500
Therefore,

560
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,990
security must be
taken more sternly than ever.

561
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,240
If you notice anything suspicious,
immediately...

562
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,979
Where is Hong Gyu Tae?

563
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,839
Ah, really!

564
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,050
Where has that
no-good Hong Gyu Tae gone now?

565
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,760
Hey.

566
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:21,780
Hey.

567
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,140
Hong Gyu Tae.

568
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,100
You derelict.

569
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:30,660
What are you doing?

570
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,190
You derelict.

571
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,349
Have you finally gone mad?

572
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,670
Is that it?

573
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,820
Hyungnim.

574
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:41,990
Is there a situation where one dies,

575
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,130
but one's temperature doesn't drop?

576
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,169
What?

577
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,689
If you hold a dead person for a long time,

578
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,150
can his temperature be maintained
like a living person?

579
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,080
How can a dead person have
the same temperature as a living person?

580
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,469
That's why I'm asking!

581
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,019
Hypothetically, what if
there were such a situation?

582
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,530
If there were such a situation,

583
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,090
the person's not dead, yet.

584
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:13,950
Not dead, yet?

585
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,769
According to the physician that frequented
the late Chief Scholar's home,

586
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,400
he could not fathom the exact illness,

587
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:27,430
but that the patient complained of
difficulty in breathing and pain in her chest.

588
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,259
<i>In the Royal Secretariat's records, as well,</i>

589
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,159
<i>it is only referred to
as an unknown illness.</i>

590
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,360
What about the possibility
that she was murdered?

591
00:49:35,361 --> 00:49:39,309
According to the physician,
there were no traces of poison or assault.

592
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,770
No possibility of murder.

593
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,230
Were there any other particular peculiarity?

594
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:46,670
Well...

595
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,279
The fact that
after she had ceased to breathe

596
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,479
the body was warm for over 2 hours

597
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,990
is extremely peculiar.

598
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,629
The physician at that time was certain
that her pulse was gone.

599
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,819
<i>There was no trace of murder,</i>

600
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,019
<i>but maintained her body temperature.</i>

601
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:06,910
After I probe further into that detail,
I shall report to you.

602
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,610
<i>Your Majesty, it is me, Hyung Sun.</i>

603
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,030
Come in.

604
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:22,239
Your Majesty,
the eclipse ceremony will begin soon.

605
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,929
So you must hurry and get properly dressed.

606
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,340
I understand.

607
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,589
You may leave.

608
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:30,669
Investigate in detail the actions
of those around the late Chief Scholar,

609
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,139
including the actions of each party
inside the palace, and report.

610
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,180
I will carry out your command.

611
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,950
You've come?

612
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,360
Your Majesty, Gwansanggam's
professor of astronomy is here.

613
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,069
Are the preparations complete?

614
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,360
Yes.

615
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,019
As the ceremony begins in half an hour,

616
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:58,030
please come out to the palace courtyard
in 15 minutes.

617
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,580
I shall do so.

618
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:05,040
What was it that caused you to cry so?

619
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,900
Were...

620
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:15,010
you crying because
you longed for His Majesty?

621
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,990
Is there a message...

622
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,870
you want to relay to His Majesty?

623
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,850
Please tell me.

624
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,560
I shall listen.

625
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,980
I shall cry

626
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,630
together with you.

627
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,560
So, whatever the situation is,

628
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,620
please tell me.

629
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:47,089
<i>The sun shall wane.</i>

630
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,940
<i>We supplicate...</i>

631
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:52,539
<i>We pray thee...</i>

632
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,700
<i>merge together, show your will.</i>

633
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:03,250
The sun shall wane.

634
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,430
<i>We kneel.</i>

635
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:10,789
<i>The sun shall wane.</i>

636
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,179
<i>We kneel.</i>

637
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,059
<i>We pray thee...</i>

638
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:19,610
<i>merge together, show your will.</i>

639
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:49,350
<i>At the sound of the pounding on the door
to the next world,</i>

640
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:55,010
<i>the sun and moon shall meet,</i>

641
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,439
<i>and the bonds severed by people,</i>

642
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,780
<i>will be reconnected by the heavens.</i>

643
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:03,720
<i>So, after this phenomenon
of the heavens happens,</i>

644
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,170
<i>may all of creation
return to its rightful place.</i>

645
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,440
<i>An illness of an unknown source.</i>

646
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,310
<i>A killing that leaves no trace.</i>

647
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,890
<i>A spell.</i>

648
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,020
<i>The lady...</i>

649
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,510
has a divination illness from the gods.

650
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,280
Mistress.

651
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,849
<i>Yeon Woo, please get up.</i>

652
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:24,590
It's time to take your medicine.

653
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:40,850
Yeon Woo?

654
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:45,580
Yeon Woo!

655
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,610
Yeon Woo, my child! Yeon Woo.

656
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,330
Father.

657
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,460
Mother.

658
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,380
Mother...

659
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,789
Mother.

660
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,480
<i>Have you...</i>

661
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,450
ever met me before?

662
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,740
<i>Do you really not know me?</i>

663
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:46,750
<i>You're cutting off
all memories and bonds from the past?</i>

664
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:56,119
<i>Do you recognize me?</i>

665
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,310
In your previous life, am I...

666
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,590
am I not there?

667
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,000
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

668
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,099
As long as I recognize you, that's enough.

669
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:13,610
<i>Then could you relay this to that girl?</i>

670
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,620
That I truly,

671
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,070
very much,

672
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:23,040
loved her.

673
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,980
<i>Sorcery.</i>

674
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,380
<i>If it was black sorcery,
then anything is possible.</i>

675
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:45,420
<i>At long last, she has figured it out.</i>

676
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,780
<i>I suppose another hurting will begin now.</i>

677
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,340
<i>I pray</i>

678
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:55,560
<i>you watch over them.</i>

679
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,969
Hyung Sun.

680
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:10,649
Yes, Your Majesty.

681
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,799
Secretly summon the High Shaman
of Seongsucheong at once.

682
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,469
Excuse me?
Why the High Shaman of Seongsucheong?

683
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:18,110
What are you doing?
Did I not tell you to summon her at once?!

684
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,150
Yes, I shall carry out your command.

685
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,340
<i>Could it be possible
to kill someone with sorcery?</i>

686
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,179
<i>The High Shaman Jang,</i>

687
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,280
<i>whose divine powers
are unmatched in all of Joseon,</i>

688
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:39,520
<i>can certainly give me the answer.</i>

689
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:56,590
We shall determine if she is dead or alive,

690
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,529
and if she is no longer breathing,

691
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,339
then you will have to take her out
the refuse door without anyone knowing.

692
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,670
Do you understand?

693
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,760
Yes, sir.

694
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:32,590
Go check to see
if she is dead or alive.

695
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,870
R... r... right.

696
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:06,300
Did you comfort the soul?

697
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,410
Yes.

698
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,480
That maiden...

699
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,780
shall never cry again.
