Episode 6

2
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,967
Within Chief Scholar's arms,

3
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:49,343
as if she were sleeping...

4
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:52,289
Your Highness...

5
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,947
You musn't, Your Highness.

6
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:12,048
Queen Dowager ordered us to keep you within your quarters.

7
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,000
Let go.

8
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:16,229
Let go.

9
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:20,155
I said let go of me!

10
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,068
Let go!

11
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:28,292
 They say the king is the sun, 
and the queen is the moon.

12
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:34,752
 This hairpin shows a white moon 
embracing a red sun.

13
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:39,355
 So I named this "the moon that embraces the sun".

14
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:41,505
Yeon Woo!!

15
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:46,743
Let go of me!

16
00:01:46,743 --> 00:01:49,872
I still have something to tell her!

17
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:52,517
Yeon Woo!

18
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:57,831
Yeon Woo!!

19
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:58,797
Mother

20
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,625
- Child! Child! 
 - Mother...

21
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:58,267
Welcome home.

22
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,000
Welcome back.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It looks like you'll be entering the 
Crown Princess' palace.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,888
Get ready to leave.

25
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,047
Crown Princess' palace?

26
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:13,328
Then does that mean our Bo Kyung is going to be the Crown Princess?

27
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:16,266
Did she die?

28
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,652
 Did you kill her?

29
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:25,342
Today...she left this world.

30

31
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:53,520
 Did you say you want to receive 
Crown Prince's feelings?

32
00:03:54,907 --> 00:04:03,023
 Then from now on you must forget about
silly feelings like sympathy and guilt.

33
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:07,893
 Remember the anger and humiliation
you felt when something of yours 
was taken away from you.

34
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:11,361
 If you're not prepared to do so,

35
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:14,591
 then, never again desire that position.

36
00:04:18,145 --> 00:04:21,965
 Crown Princess...

37
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:29,531
 Everything is my fault.

38
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:34,032
 It is not your fault, Your Highness.

39
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:40,837
 No matter what happens, 
do not blame yourself, Your Highness.

40
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:00,635
Hyungnim

41
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:05,968
How is Teacher doing?

42
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:17,736
That child...Crown Princess' final farewell...

43
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:22,059
did you see it as well?

44
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:28,031
Why are you curious to know?

45
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:33,704
What did you do, Your Highness, that gives you the right to ask about that child's final farewell?

46
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:35,087
Hyungnim...

47
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:40,544
When that child was kicked out of the palace as if she were a criminal, what did you do, Your Highness?

48
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:47,397
When that child was on the borderline between life and death, what did you do, Your Highness?

49
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:49,708
Please stop.

50
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:53,891
When that child was buried in the cold ground, what did you do, Your Highness?!

51
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:55,717
When that child's father and brother's

52
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:59,485
potential exile are being discussed even now, what have you done, Your Highness?!

53
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:00,764
Hyungnim!

54
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:03,934
You are His Highness that has everything!

55
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,608
Father's sincerity, loyalty of Chief Scholary, 
who was like a father to me,

56
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:15,835
and even Teacher Heo's, who was like a brother to me.  You had it all !

57
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:20,592
One...just one thing...

58
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:23,720
couldn't it be mine?

59
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:25,556
Hyungnim...

60
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:30,853
To me, it was only her.

61
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:34,439
She was the one thing that I deeply desired.

62
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,337
Couldn't you let me have just one thing?

63
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:44,441
If it was me, I would have protected her.

64
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:50,700
I would have risked all that I had.
I would have risked my life to protect her!

65
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:58,121
Your Highness, you couldn't protect her.

66
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:16,673
 In the next life, she will be mine.

67
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:23,413
 In the next life, I will definitely protect her.

68
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:35,959
You did well.

69
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,429
I was nervous because she was holding onto her life longer than I had expected

70
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:42,699
but I see that your skills weren't based on false representations.

71
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:48,208
I will continue to be of great support to Seongsucheong

72
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,407
so don't worry.

73
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:53,043
I'm gravely sorry to say this

74
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:56,914
but I have one request to ask you, Queen Dowager.

75
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:58,215
Is that so?

76
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:00,717
Do tell me.

77
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:06,456
I'm thinking of temporarily leaving Seongsucheong..

78
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:09,593
Leave Seongsucheong?

79
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:15,300
The dark powers related to one's life is a taboo.

80
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:21,138
Through this event my body and powers have been greatly damaged.

81
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:23,407
So I'm thinking of wandering the mountains

82
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:27,076
to energize my body and heart.

83
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:34,785
However there is no other that is as talented as you so it's difficult for me to allow it.

84
00:08:34,785 --> 00:08:41,563
My very existence can potentially ruin everything.

85
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,900
Then will you return?

86
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,034
Of course.

87
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,068
You must hurry.

88
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:27,938
Soon the effects of the medicine will run out.

89
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:10,848
Who's there?!

90
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:34,096
 Father!

91
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:36,307
 Mother!

92
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:39,543
 Orabeoni!

93
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:42,580
 Your Highness! Your Highness!

94
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:50,687
 Yeon Woo!

95
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:51,788
 Yeon Woo!!

96
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:59,763
 Yeon Woo, wake up. The medicine is still hot.

97
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:07,771
Turn away.

98
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,700
 Yeon Woo!

99
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,800
Who are you?

100
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:56,838
Me?

101
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:58,295
I'm Jan Shil.

102
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:01,446
Jan...Shil?

103
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:05,628
Oh right! Spiritual Mother! Spiritual Mother!

104
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:11,131
Miss!

105
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,037
Miss, have you come back to your senses now?

106
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,248
Yes?

107
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:28,303
Who are you?

108
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,300
Who are you?

109
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:45,478
Where am I?

110
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:54,310
And...who am I?

111
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:04,038
Unnie, you have quite a pitiful life too.

112
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,000
You'll live your entire life as that unnie's shadow.

113
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,100
If snowflakes come too close, 
the fire will melt them.

114
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,700
So you must not go near it.

115
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:29,232
Miss, you are...a shaman.

116
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,300
You went unconscious during the ritual to accept the gods (into your body).

117
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,300
And you've finally woken up today.

118
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,400
Since you've accepted such a great god into your body

119
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,100
it looks like you lost your memory from the after effects.

120
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,400
So, from now on, think of me as your spiritual mother.

121
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:50,950
My family...

122
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:56,624
My family...

123
00:13:56,624 --> 00:13:59,247
Where are they?

124
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,099
I don't know.

125
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:05,064
You were wandering the streets, and within your stare

126
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:08,585
I read an unusual spiritual aura

127
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:11,835
so I performed a ritual to accept the gods.

128
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:17,246
Was...I abandoned?

129
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:19,336
They knew I had spiritual powers

130
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:22,886
so did my family abandon me?

131
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:28,104
Since you're now a shaman, 
it's best to forget about the past.

132
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:34,486
The gods may have torn out your memories so that you can forget about the past

133
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:39,931
and live your life as a shaman.

134
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,700
Your Highness

135
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:59,669
You must have felt great worry these past few days.

136
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:02,515
Worry?

137
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:07,366
It is all our faults for not carefully selecting a bride.

138
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:13,858
Deadly illnesses are controlled by the heavens so what can human beings do about it.

139
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:16,311
We don't know what to do with ourselves

140
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,155
for we are grateful that you said that.

141
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,823
Do you think there's not a single place to put your bodies in this entire country?

142
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,598
But when looking for a place...

143
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:34,288
you'll even bring someone down to put yourself in their place.

Yeon Woo

146
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:03,626
I heard the place to be exiled has been decided.

147
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:12,727
Though we are now the status of a criminal, this is a sentence we must bear.

148
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:15,742
So you must not blame His Majesty.

149
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,600
How could I have such feelings?

150
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,900
It's just that I'm worried about Crown Prince who is now all alone.

151
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,500
Even if your body is outside,

152
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:29,118
you must not forget that you are Crown Prince's subject.

153
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:34,157
Until the day you serve by his side again,

154
00:17:34,157 --> 00:17:36,435
you must not be lazy in educating yourself.

155
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:37,559
I will mark your words.

156
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,696
Sir

157
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:40,830
you need to come out for a bit.

158
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,100
What's the matter?

159
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:51,398
That is...Madame is at it again...

160
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,400
Eat this too.

161
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,200
It's your favourite pumpkin dish.

162
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,800
Wife

163
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Where were you wandering outside of your home?

164
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,417
Wife!

165
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:07,757
Are you okay?

166
00:18:07,757 --> 00:18:11,094
I will pack you some food and clothes so let's leave.

167
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:16,783
Wife

168
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:17,534
Yeon Woo

169
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:18,419
Until when will you...

170
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,055
Where you going without finishing your meal?

171
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,105
Please stop!

172
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,504
Our Yeon Woo is already dead.

173
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:29,990
She is dead, Wife.

174
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,315
Our Yeon Woo...

175
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,820
Aigoo, my baby...

176
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:45,572
Yeon Woo!

177
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,272
Oh, you're here. You're late so I was worried.

178
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:57,607
And the children?

179
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,800
Come out!

180
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,200
Spiritual Mother!

181
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,218
Spiritual Mother!

182
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:12,655
Quickly!

183
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:21,698
Quickly.

184
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:23,766
Quickly get on.

185
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:30,840
You need to hurry.

186
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,743
Get on the boat now.

187
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
What's the matter?

188
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:43,186
Are you still not feeling well?

189
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:44,621
No.

190
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:50,743
The family that abandoned me might be here.

191
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:55,899
But if I leave, I feel like I won't be able to see them again.

192
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:58,067
You need to hurry.

193
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:01,738
Get on the boat now.

194
00:20:15,552 --> 00:20:17,654
Sorry for causing you so much trouble.

195
00:20:17,654 --> 00:20:20,456
If you ever need help, come and find me.

196
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:22,559
Will you be returning to the Taoism Office?

197
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,597
The vacation time His Majesty allowed me is now done so I need to return.

198
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:31,134
When are you thinking of returning to Seongsucheong?

199
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:35,071
How could I dare return to be the Head Shaman again?

200
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:36,739
Don't say such a thing.

201
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:40,376
There are things that you need to do for the royal family and this country's people.

202
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:42,479
Are you not leaving?

203
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,882
I have to leave now.

204
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:49,018
Please stay well.

205
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:51,387
Be careful.

206
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:54,023
As long as you are with Miss,

207
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:57,093
you can't be sure that you will be safe.

208
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,400
Farewell!

209
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:24,187
Please stay well, Miss!

210
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:30,727
When we meet next time, show me your smiling face!

211
00:21:31,861 --> 00:21:36,599
 Since the moon is hidden, this country's darkness will grow deeper.

212
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:43,000
 However, if it waxes, it will wane. And if it wanes, it will wax again. That is how the moon is.

213
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,500
 One day it will return to its rightful state.

214
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,215
 And until then, I wish her to be safe.

215
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:58,454
What's wrong?

216
00:21:58,454 --> 00:22:01,591
Why do you keep calling me "Miss"?

217
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:03,226
Pardon?

218
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,261
That is...

219
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:08,064
Because you're the moon.

220
00:22:08,064 --> 00:22:09,866
Moon?

221
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:12,936
Since you've accepted such a great god

222
00:22:12,936 --> 00:22:15,705
we're calling you by that title.

223
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:20,176
That's right, you said I'm a shaman.

224
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,100
 Is this it, Ari?

225
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:27,483
 Two. People. Labour.

226
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:33,790
 Shaman

227
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,700
What's wrong?

228
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,800
Why are you crying?

229
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,600
It's nothing.

230
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
It's nothing...

231
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:47,220
Don't cry.

232
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,287
Don't cry.

233
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,903
 Whether I return as Chief Shaman or whether she continues to live her life as a shaman,

234
00:22:58,903 --> 00:23:02,486
now it all depends on that child's fate.

235
00:23:56,388 --> 00:23:58,942
Oh my!

236
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,800
It looks as if a heavenly angel came down.

237
00:24:07,148 --> 00:24:10,163
Though we faced many hardships 
before the royal wedding

238
00:24:10,163 --> 00:24:14,850
you, Your Highness, are now this 
country's Crown Princess.

239
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,648
Mother

240
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:20,226
When you enter the palace, you must remember this.

241
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:23,618
From the very beginning, the Crown Princess position was yours, Your Highness.

242
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:27,471
You're not replacing anyone but just taking what was originally yours.

243
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:32,400
So, regardless of what happens, stay strong.

244
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,370
I will mark your words.

245
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,482
You must not show signs of weakness.

246
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:39,613
I will not.

247
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:45,586
Now no one can even tempt to have 
your position, Your Highness.

248
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:49,483
Now no one...

249
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:52,963
will be able to take away my position.

250
00:24:57,267 --> 00:25:03,231
Crown Prince, please place down your wild goose and get ready.

251
00:26:04,768 --> 00:26:08,095
 Do not worry.

252
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:12,809
 Now you will gain what you want, Princess.

253
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,100
Subtitles brought to you by the Eclipse Team @ viki.com

254
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:39,763
Please lift the hanging screen.

255
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,637
Crown Prince,

256
00:27:47,637 --> 00:27:52,475
lift the hanging screen so that Crown Princess can get in the palanquin.

257
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:04,821
 Your name Yeon Woo, does it mean "light rain"?

258
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:09,276
 Yes, I use those Chinese characters.

259
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:14,140
 Then I guess it can mean "misty rain" too.

260
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,366
 It's a pretty name.

261
00:29:03,246 --> 00:29:04,735
Your Majesty

262
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:07,026
you will catch a cold.

263
00:29:07,026 --> 00:29:10,587
Quickly head over to the lecture hall.

264
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:18,347
Should I order for a hot drink?

265
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:22,591
If not that then should I order for wine?

266
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:24,184
Hyung Sun

267
00:29:24,184 --> 00:29:26,226
Yes, Your Majesty.

268
00:29:27,204 --> 00:29:29,868
You always...

269
00:29:33,776 --> 00:29:36,887
talk too much.

270
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:41,443
However it's almost time to take part in the banquet.

271
00:29:41,443 --> 00:29:43,353
Tell the court officials to come outside.

272
00:29:43,353 --> 00:29:47,157
Why bring the court officials outside?

273
00:29:47,157 --> 00:29:50,247
The weather is nice.

274
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,697
So it will be nice to play a game of golf.

275
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:03,795
Amazing!

276
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,887
Amazing.

277
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:09,603
Your Majesty's skills get better by each day that it's reaching beyond the skies.

278
00:30:09,603 --> 00:30:13,779
Your praise is the one that's reaching beyond the skies.

279
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,653
It is now your turn, Minister of Finance.

280
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:10,922
You truely are talented.

281
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:12,323
You must have been busy with work

282
00:31:12,323 --> 00:31:14,700
so how did you build up your skills?

283
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,500
Not at all.

284
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:22,723
It's just that this hole is slightly bigger than others.

285
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,800
Then you must know where the biggest hole in the palace is.

286
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:43,740
How would I possible know that too?

287
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:50,446
Then I will lead you the way.

288
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:32,555
Your Majesty, you musn't do this.

289
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:38,745
People who were subject to forced labour, didn't have clothes to wear and food to eat.

290
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:42,508
They barely managed to survive

291
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:46,792
but there are many cases where
 they just froze to death.

292
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:52,064
Unfair loans were given and when payment was demanded those who couldn't pay, 
their land was taken

293
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:55,165
and their daughters were taken as concubines.

294
00:32:56,658 --> 00:33:00,114
The number of concubines this person took was 20.

295
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,000
He's better than me, the King.

296
00:33:07,957 --> 00:33:10,761
I can understand why this was reported.

297
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:18,100
This is about bribes made by Court Official Yoon Su Il to get his way into office.

298
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,600
Yoon Su Il? Isn't he your cousin, Minister of Finance?

299
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,506
It's slander, Your Majesty.

300
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,460
Food rationed for the people was secretly taken.

301
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:36,100
Constantly tormenting innocent people for his own crimes.

302
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,200
Took from people's livelihood and raised prices.

303
00:33:40,242 --> 00:33:46,061
And the royalties who conscripted the people to forced labor and  doubled, tripled their difficultes..

304
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:52,226
Aren't these all documents that can't be read without shedding tears?

305
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:58,141
However why were these not reported to me?!

306
00:33:58,141 --> 00:34:01,006
After prior review we were going to gradually report them to you.

307
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:05,181
Can't you see the dates marked on these reports?

308
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:07,364
They are already over a month old.

309
00:34:07,364 --> 00:34:09,052
They are petty things

310
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:09,936
so we were going to judge...

311
00:34:09,936 --> 00:34:12,713
Who said that these are petty things?

312
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:19,104
And who ordered you to judge the people's sufferings?

313
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:22,200
Do you now understand?

314
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,800
This place is the biggest hole inside the palace.

315
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:31,060
This very Seungjowon!

316
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:35,154
It is the biggest hole

317
00:34:35,154 --> 00:34:38,162
that blocks my communication with my people!

318
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:52,362
He's all grown up now.

319
00:34:52,362 --> 00:34:55,999
It seems like it was just yesterday he was receiving orders from Queen Dowager.

320
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:59,197
But now he's clinging his claws onto everything.

321
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,376
What in the world.

322
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:04,407
We were concerned he was weak

323
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,200
but it looks like we were wrong.

324
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,200
From what I saw today, he's overflowing with energy.

325
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:11,381
No.

326
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:14,934
He should save his energy for the night he shares a bed with the queen.

327
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:17,749
Why is he wasting away his energy?

328
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:23,048
One thing is for sure, he refuses to consummate his marriage with the Queen

329
00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:25,732
by faking an illness...

330
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,903
He's not faking an illness.

331
00:35:33,903 --> 00:35:36,839
Though he quickly tried to hide it,

332
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:41,611
he couldn't hide the change in colour of his face.

333
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:46,066
Then let's send him away some place far to recuperate his health.

334
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:50,354
And make it seem like we care by telling him to leave all of the work to us.

335
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,300
You really don't know His Majesty?

336
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,600
Just earlier he took all the documents saying that he'll read through them throughout the night.

337
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:59,362
I too would rather let a cat take care of a fish

338
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:01,525
than let you take care of the palace.

339
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:02,999
What's that you're saying?!

340
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,500
Not a bad idea.

341
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,800
Look here!

342
00:36:05,802 --> 00:36:09,490
It looks like everyone is looking down on me because I was promoted through my family status,

343
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,308
but, as you can tell, I have a good brain.

344
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:14,312
On top of that

345
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:19,282
it is a great opportunity

346
00:36:19,282 --> 00:36:22,706
to secretly settle the corvee construction issue.

347
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:31,360
If you put the leash on too tight on the dog you raise, it becomes vicious.

348
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,044
Every now and then you need to loosen the leash

349
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:39,735
so that it obeys the owner.

350
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:44,807
What did you just say?

351
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:48,011
There is a rise of documents requesting the king to accept a royal concubine?

352
00:36:48,011 --> 00:36:54,017
I stopped it at Seungjowon so it hasn't reached higher offices yet.

353
00:36:54,017 --> 00:36:57,820
But it won't be long for His Majesty to find out.

354
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,096
If by chance he has a change of heart

355
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:04,594
and gains a successor through the concubine...

356
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:07,197
That can't happen.

357
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:11,072
The successor must come from Queen.

358
00:37:11,072 --> 00:37:17,340
But with the excuse of illness, it's been a long time since he's refused

359
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,475
to consummate the marriage with Queen.

360
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:23,246
If this continues then it's impossible to see a successor.

361
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:28,017
Whenever it's time to consummate he becomes ill.

362
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:33,156
I'm sorry to say this but there are already

363
00:37:33,156 --> 00:37:38,094
many supporters gathering to Prince Yang Myung.

364
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:39,929
What did you say?

365
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:45,835
If His Majesty passes away without leaving a heir...

366
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:48,271
Watch what you say, Minister!

367
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:50,139
His Majesty is well!

368
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:54,444
That is why he needs to show the entire world that he is well.

369
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:57,547
What do you think is the reason for him becoming ill

370
00:37:57,547 --> 00:38:00,683
when it looks like he's perfectly healthy?

371
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:06,155
It's because he's overworked.

372
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:10,893
So do you have a plan?

373
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:15,999
We need to relieve him from his duties for a while.

374
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:23,239
Though I'm not perfect, I need to step in and relieve His Majesty from his duties.

375
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,100
However, do you think His Majesty will do so?

376
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,500
No.

377
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,917
That is why you need to step in.

378
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:41,358
You're the only person that can overcome His Majesty's stubbornness.

379
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:47,130
The temporary palace, you say?

380
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,998
That is correct.

381
00:38:48,998 --> 00:38:53,770
Due to your health, you were unable to consummate.

382
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:58,541
You should leave behind your hectic duties and recuperate your health.

383
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:02,679
Even if I only have a small "booboo" you, court officials,

384
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,615
you immediately discuss matters about an heir.

385
00:39:05,615 --> 00:39:10,320
Whether you're worried about my current state or my state after death,

386
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,355
I'm unsure.

387
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:15,892
How can you say such a thing?

388
00:39:15,892 --> 00:39:19,362
Then will you go with me?

389
00:39:19,997 --> 00:39:23,481
Oh that's right. I forgot.

390
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,800
When the king is absent from the palace, his father-in-law temporarily takes over

391
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,239
and takes responsibility of the palace, correct?

392
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:35,478
It would be a good opportunity to manage politics as you wish, without me,

393
00:39:35,478 --> 00:39:40,049
so I guess you would pick to stay than go to the hot springs.

394
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:41,714
Am I wrong, Minister?

395
00:39:47,724 --> 00:39:51,661
Your Majesty, Queen Dowager is requesting to meet you.

396
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:53,096
Oh no.

397
00:39:53,096 --> 00:39:56,366
There are many people wanting to see me today.

398
00:39:56,366 --> 00:40:02,872
I feel like Grandmother will say the exact same thing you said, Minister.

399
00:40:02,872 --> 00:40:05,708
What do you think, Minister?

400
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,000
I see you've arrived, Your Majesty.

401
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:52,355
Subtitles brought to you by the Eclipse Team @ viki.com

402
00:40:53,523 --> 00:40:58,161
Your Majesty, this is your dear grandmother's request.

403
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:00,830
Please stay at the temporary palace

404
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,066
and relax for a while.

405
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:04,300
I'm deeply sorry

406
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,236
but I'm behind on my duties so I cannot.

407
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:08,471
You can delay your duties for a while

408
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:12,341
but we can no longer delay the birth of a heir.

409
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:15,945
A king's trip requires many attendants and it is a waste of the country's resources.

410
00:41:15,945 --> 00:41:18,214
It is for His Majesty's health.

411
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:22,885
The rise and fall of the country and 
the fortunes of the people all rely on
 Your Majesty's health.

412
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:25,888
That's why I don't agree to do those things.

413
00:41:25,888 --> 00:41:29,325
It's nothing to fret about so both of 
you do not need to worry.

414
00:41:29,325 --> 00:41:34,497
Then why is the birth of a heir being delayed?

415
00:41:34,497 --> 00:41:36,900
I am deeply sorry.

416
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,770
Because of my lack of virtue and earnestness

417
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:44,207
I've given you two deep worries.

418
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:47,744
How is it only your fault, Queen?

419
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:52,715
Because of His Majesty's illness, you spend more nights alone.

420
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:55,318
No.

421
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,300
It is my fault for not being able to properly assist His Majesty.

422
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,400
Oh dear. How pitiful our Queen is.

423
00:42:05,629 --> 00:42:09,966
Your Majesty, you do know that neglecting your health and the birth of a heir

424
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:13,069
is a way of neglecting your royal duties, correct?

425
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:16,572
However the heavens decide that.

426
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:18,675
You need to make an effort.

427
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:24,380
Duties can be done by Minister and also me, who acted as regent till not too long ago.

428
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,749
Leaving my duties to others

429
00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:29,586
is also a way of neglecting my royal duties.

430
00:42:29,586 --> 00:42:36,426
Your Majesty, those words are to lecture whom?

431
00:42:36,426 --> 00:42:38,261
Lecture?

432
00:42:38,261 --> 00:42:40,697
It's just an ordinary statement.

433
00:42:40,697 --> 00:42:46,369
If you continue to refuse my request like this then I have no other choice.

434
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,405
Court Lady Park!

435
00:42:49,405 --> 00:42:51,574
Starting today do not bring me my meals.

436
00:42:51,574 --> 00:42:52,875
Grandmother!

437
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:55,945
His Majesty doesn't understand his grandmother's feelings

438
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
so what's the point in an old and uselesss person like me continuing to live?

439
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,800
Starting today I will not eat and I will just count the days to my death.

440
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,523
Mother-in-law, why're you doing this?

441
00:43:07,523 --> 00:43:08,858
Please do not be angry.

442
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:11,694
Grandmother, you musn't.

443
00:43:11,694 --> 00:43:14,030
Please take back your order.

444
00:43:18,755 --> 00:43:22,112
Please follow Grandmother's sincere request, Your Majesty.

445
00:43:22,112 --> 00:43:28,028
The previous king did all he could to be a filial son, am I not right?

446
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:30,951
A king's travel arrangements aren't that simple.

447
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:34,137
You can make it a small-scale affair.

448
00:43:34,137 --> 00:43:35,053
However, Mother...

449
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:39,100
You've already brought worry to Grandmother with your poor health.

450
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,347
So why are you trying to carry out more unfilial acts?

451
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,600
Your Majesty,

452
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,151
it is I.

453
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:49,099
Come inside.

454
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,844
Your Majesty, you need to come outside for a bit.

455
00:43:54,844 --> 00:43:56,161
What is the matter?

456
00:43:56,161 --> 00:44:02,545
That is...Queen has...

457
00:44:02,545 --> 00:44:06,385
Please do not be angry, Queen Dowager.

458
00:44:06,385 --> 00:44:15,872
This is all my fault for not being able to properly assist His Majesty.

459
00:44:15,872 --> 00:44:19,062
Please direct the crime towards me

460
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,800
and stop your hunger strike.

461
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,900
Stand up, Queen.

462
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:31,693
Your Majesty

463
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:33,436
It is cold.

464
00:44:33,436 --> 00:44:35,245
Get up now.

465
00:44:35,245 --> 00:44:42,127
Until Grandmother stops her order of a hunger strike,

466
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:44,053
I will not get up.

467
00:44:44,053 --> 00:44:47,531
I am going to ask Grandmother for forgiveness and get ready to go to the temporary palace.

468
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:49,813
So get up now.

469
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,996
Your Majesty

470
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,179
In the inside you use Grandmother,

471
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:13,765
and in the outside you use Minister of Personnel.

472
00:45:15,093 --> 00:45:19,855
You're lucky that you have such
 strong backing, Queen.

473
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:26,863
Do you remember what I told you previously?

474
00:45:26,863 --> 00:45:30,560
If you've forgotten then I will tell you again.

475
00:45:32,902 --> 00:45:34,637
You

476
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:38,908
and your family's clan will gain everything they want

477
00:45:38,908 --> 00:45:42,011
but don't expect to have my feelings too.

478
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:48,181
You will never be able to have it.

479
00:45:57,184 --> 00:46:16,917
Subtitles brought to you by the Eclipse Team @ viki.com

480
00:46:22,485 --> 00:46:27,456
 Have you still not forgotten her?

481
00:46:27,456 --> 00:46:29,459
 That child is already dead.

482
00:46:29,459 --> 00:46:32,194
 Do you understand?

483
00:46:32,194 --> 00:46:38,768
 The owner of the queen's quarters is not her but me.

484
00:46:42,272 --> 00:46:46,876
Queen, Princess is here.

485
00:46:51,064 --> 00:46:53,440
Let her in.

486
00:47:04,126 --> 00:47:06,996
Have you been well, Queen?

487
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:09,065
Welcome Princess.

488
00:47:09,065 --> 00:47:11,937
What brings you here?

489
00:47:11,937 --> 00:47:14,570
I came to pay my respects to Mother

490
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:18,508
but she told me to console you.

491
00:47:18,508 --> 00:47:23,713
I heard you kneeled for forgiveness.

492
00:47:25,782 --> 00:47:31,988
Due to my lack of virtue, the birth
 of a heir was delayed.

493
00:47:31,988 --> 00:47:34,591
So it is something I should ask for forgiveness.

494
00:47:38,795 --> 00:47:42,198
It's not the lack of virtue,

495
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:44,601
but the lack of affection.

496
00:47:44,601 --> 00:47:46,675
Pardon?

497
00:47:46,675 --> 00:47:50,393
Virtue is useless between a man and a woman.

498
00:47:50,393 --> 00:47:53,131
It's affection over virtue.

499
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:56,312
The reason Orabeoni isn't visiting the Queen's quarters

500
00:47:56,312 --> 00:47:58,247
is probably because he has no affection for you...

501
00:47:58,247 --> 00:48:04,020
However for what reason did you enter the palace today?

502
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,055
Pardon?

503
00:48:11,027 --> 00:48:13,463
The truth is...

504
00:48:13,463 --> 00:48:21,871
the Office of Physiogomy decided on a date for my husband and I to consummate.

505
00:48:23,306 --> 00:48:25,975
I need to leave now.

506
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:30,592
My husband feels uneasy when he can't see me.

507
00:48:30,592 --> 00:48:33,716
Then stay well Queen.

508
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,500
Close the door for a second.

509
00:49:21,397 --> 00:49:22,832
What is the matter?

510
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:24,901
Did you forget something inside?

511
00:49:24,901 --> 00:49:29,405
Do you, Court Lady Min, think of me as a woman that always loses things?

512
00:49:29,405 --> 00:49:32,800
Yes I do.

513
00:49:44,687 --> 00:49:48,189
(writing additional dates)

514
00:49:56,132 --> 00:49:57,534
Husband!

515
00:49:57,534 --> 00:50:00,436
It is I.

516
00:50:00,436 --> 00:50:03,973
Why aren't you answering?

517
00:50:03,973 --> 00:50:06,442
Then I am coming inside.

518
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,393
Husband

519
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:47,717
It's not often you decide to sleep instead of finishing your readings.

520
00:50:47,717 --> 00:50:53,856
How did you know I was coming? And you already laid out the blankets.

521
00:50:53,856 --> 00:50:59,162
Truth is I went to pay my respects to Mother

522
00:50:59,162 --> 00:51:07,103
and she especially asked a fortune teller to pick a date for us to consummate our marriage.

523
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:12,675
It's a date you received after begging Her Majesty over and over again.

524
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:18,825
Why are you so surprised?

525
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,517
Why are you here?

526
00:51:21,517 --> 00:51:24,487
I'm back from getting some books from the book store.

527
00:51:24,487 --> 00:51:30,160
Then who is Princess talking with right now?

528
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:42,600
As you can see, today is the day. And the blankets are already out...
and like they say, "carry out the fine details at once".

529
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,800
It's not "at once" but "while you're at it".

530
00:51:45,808 --> 00:51:47,844
Who are you?!

531
00:51:50,814 --> 00:51:52,215
I'm your brother.

532
00:51:52,215 --> 00:51:54,951
Yang Myung Orabeoni!

533
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:57,453
Give it!

534
00:51:57,453 --> 00:51:59,389
Give it to me!

535
00:52:01,357 --> 00:52:05,594
From the looks of it the dates here were added by you.

536
00:52:05,594 --> 00:52:06,996
How...how did you know?

537
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:10,400
If one can't tell from this obvious forgery

538
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,534
then aren't they stupid?

539
00:52:11,534 --> 00:52:13,569
Orabeoni!

540
00:52:17,207 --> 00:52:19,989
Are you two fighting?

541
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:26,831
Fighting? No. Why would I think of fighing with a woman who says, "carry out the fine details at once"?

542
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,900
I hate you, Orabeoni.

543
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,100
This is what you get for betraying me.

544
00:53:15,198 --> 00:53:19,536
Aigoo. How did I become rivals with my sister?

545
00:53:19,536 --> 00:53:22,205
Why are you always like this?

546
00:53:23,907 --> 00:53:24,841
Huh... what's wrong with me?

547
00:53:24,841 --> 00:53:28,678
When you come, you always make the princess angry.

548
00:53:28,678 --> 00:53:33,083
Didn't I tell you already?
 As rivals, it's a battle tactic...

549
00:53:34,284 --> 00:53:36,586
It's because I despise her.

550
00:53:38,021 --> 00:53:41,257
What do you despise about Princess?

551
00:53:41,257 --> 00:53:44,060
She made you become an Uibin (Prince Consort).

552
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,562
Your Excellency

553
00:53:45,562 --> 00:53:52,802
When the former king was still alive, he wanted you to help the current King.

554
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:57,874
But why did they have to break off the wings of such a talented person like you?

555
00:53:57,874 --> 00:54:01,945
I feel resentful against the former king and Princess Min Hwa.

556
00:54:01,945 --> 00:54:03,646
Don't say that.

557
00:54:03,646 --> 00:54:06,716
If I don't say it like that,

558
00:54:06,716 --> 00:54:08,284
then should I beat around the bush?

559
00:54:08,284 --> 00:54:13,256
The Princess is my family's saviour

560
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:19,300
My family was able to avoid eradication 
and I am safe today

561
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,100
because of her grace of taking me under her wing.

562
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:30,840
What grace? Your great ambitions and vast knowledge, can only be buried like this.

563
00:54:49,158 --> 00:54:50,439
What's wrong with you?

564
00:54:50,439 --> 00:54:53,041
A cute stray cat took away my shoes.

565
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:54,163
What?

566
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:59,568
How could that happen? then you can wear mine first.

567
00:54:59,568 --> 00:55:01,283
It's okay,

568
00:55:03,205 --> 00:55:06,196
Travellers must always have an extra pair of shoes with them.

569
00:55:06,196 --> 00:55:09,581
So you've been travelling recently?

570
00:55:09,581 --> 00:55:14,750
Well, there are flies always buzzing at my door.

571
00:55:17,476 --> 00:55:22,925
His Majesty's illness doesn't improve.

572
00:55:37,673 --> 00:55:42,057
Please stop staring at the room.

573
00:55:42,057 --> 00:55:44,127
Wouldn't you like to know?

574
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,820
Like to know about what?

575
00:55:46,595 --> 00:55:48,779
If she were still alive,

576
00:55:51,508 --> 00:55:53,329
what would she look like.

577
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:54,737
Your Excellency

578
00:55:54,737 --> 00:55:59,508
You and I grew up.

579
00:55:59,508 --> 00:56:02,396
In my memories, your sister...

580
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:09,749
...will remain thirteen years old.

581
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:20,551
What are you thinking about?

582
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,095
I'm thinking of you.

583
00:56:27,697 --> 00:56:30,612
Why don't you return to the place to visit?

584
00:56:30,612 --> 00:56:33,137
Did Yeom ask you to say this?

585
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:35,356
No, he didn't.

586
00:56:35,356 --> 00:56:38,925
I just feel that he's waiting for you.

587
00:56:38,925 --> 00:56:41,613
Who will wait for me?

588
00:56:41,613 --> 00:56:43,939
His Majesty himself.

589
00:56:43,939 --> 00:56:47,111
After I caused him so much pain,

590
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:49,823
why would he still wait for me?

591
00:56:51,193 --> 00:56:55,205
He's waiting for you.

592
00:57:00,031 --> 00:57:02,892
You only talk about His Majesty.

593
00:57:02,892 --> 00:57:07,663
There is no one in the palace he can share his feelings with.

594
00:57:07,663 --> 00:57:10,393
He must be really lonely.

595
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:13,002
His Majesty has Woon by his side.

596
00:57:13,002 --> 00:57:16,271
Prince Yang Myung,

597
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:19,341
please protect him.

598
00:57:21,072 --> 00:57:31,720
I hope you, Your Excellency, Yang Myung will protect His Majesty.

599
00:57:46,993 --> 00:57:49,041
Your Excellency, Yang Myung.

600
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,669
Your Excellency, Yang Myung!

601
00:57:50,669 --> 00:57:56,964
- What is the matter? 
 - Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

602
00:57:57,751 --> 00:58:00,344
Your Excellency, Yang Myung!

603
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:02,113
Your Excellency, Yang Myung!

604
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:05,754
Your Excellency, Yang Myung!

605
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,305
Your Excellency, Yang Myung!

606
00:58:26,609 --> 00:58:28,253
Are you satisfied now?

607
00:58:29,545 --> 00:58:35,117
This is how I will protect His Majesty.

608
00:58:57,439 --> 00:59:02,475
Your Highness. This is all my fault.

609
00:59:03,445 --> 00:59:07,249
It's not your fault.

610
00:59:07,683 --> 00:59:14,788
Whatever it may be, you can't blame yourself.

611
00:59:14,788 --> 00:59:17,169
If that child becomes miserable

612
00:59:17,169 --> 00:59:19,461
 then it's because of you, Crown Prince.

613
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:21,764
While that child was buried in the cold ground,

614
00:59:21,764 --> 00:59:24,700
What did you do?

615
00:59:26,402 --> 00:59:31,774
It is because of you. And that too is because of you. It is all because of you, Crown Prince.

616
00:59:31,774 --> 00:59:35,144
If it was me, I would've protected her.

617
00:59:35,144 --> 00:59:41,735
With everything I have, including my own life, I would've protected her!

618
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,400
Your Highness, You weren't able to protect her.

619
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,769
Unable to protect her.

620
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:01,770
Unable to protect her!

621
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,379
Was it the same dream?

622
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:13,849
Is it you, Woon?

623
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:15,818
Yes, Your Majesty.

624
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:21,521
Let's go and get some fresh air.

625
01:00:39,141 --> 01:00:41,510
Woon.

626
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,800
Please give me your order.

627
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,516
Do you know why this place is called the Hidden Moon Pavillion?

628
01:00:47,516 --> 01:00:51,053
It uses the Chinese characters "eun" for hidden and "wol" for moon.

629
01:00:51,053 --> 01:00:54,289
Doesn't it mean "hidden moon"?

630
01:00:54,289 --> 01:00:55,958
Your guess is almost right.

631
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:59,261
But there is another meaning.

632
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:03,399
There is another hidden meaning?

633
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,905
When Father first built this place,

634
01:01:08,905 --> 01:01:15,277
the moon in the pond was so beautiful, so he wanted to have it forever.

635
01:01:15,277 --> 01:01:21,409
So that even when there is no moon in the sky, he could still see the moon.

636
01:01:21,409 --> 01:01:24,487
So that's why he named this place the Hidden Moon Pavillion.

637
01:01:25,454 --> 01:01:29,525
He secretly hid the moon that reflected on the pond

638
01:01:29,525 --> 01:01:33,262
and quietly he looked at the pond on nights when the moon was not in the sky.

639
01:01:36,265 --> 01:01:39,301
This the real meaning of tthe Hidden Moon Pavilion.

640
01:01:39,301 --> 01:01:41,203
I'll remember that.

641
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:49,278
I have also secretly hidden a moon here.

642
01:01:52,548 --> 01:01:54,850
Whenever I miss it,

643
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:58,720
I can take it out to see.

644
01:02:01,423 --> 01:02:04,093
Have a look.

645
01:02:04,093 --> 01:02:08,697
Although the sun and the moon cannot be in the sky together,

646
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:13,769
at least in this pond, they are together.

647
01:02:55,277 --> 01:02:57,012
Spiritual Mother!

648
01:02:57,012 --> 01:02:58,780
Spiritual Mother!

649
01:03:02,384 --> 01:03:04,153
Why are you here?

650
01:03:04,153 --> 01:03:07,323
This is a letter from the Taoist priest.

651
01:03:08,391 --> 01:03:10,626
Light a candle, Jan Shil.

652
01:03:10,626 --> 01:03:15,831
Don't tell me you haven't lit the light yet when you came to pray.

653
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:22,838
The flow of the universe has changed.

654
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:24,907
The time has come,

655
01:03:24,907 --> 01:03:29,678
in 3 days I'll come meet you.

656
01:03:40,389 --> 01:04:09,218
Subtitles brought to you by the Eclipse Team @ viki.com

657
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:16,558
Child you can go back now.
