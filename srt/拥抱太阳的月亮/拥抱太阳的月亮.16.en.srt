Episode 16

2
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:12,843
Then,

3
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:15,933
who was the one that took my place as the Crown Princess?

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,869
The one who was also a playmate with you.

5
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:20,367
The Minister of Home Office's daughter.

6
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:22,188
Did they conduct another interview process?

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,363
No.

8
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:29,433
I don't know the reason why. The King didn't do a reselection, she was chosen directly.

9
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:44,236
I am prepared to step down from my position of power,

10
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:48,133
and choose that child.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,295
Your Majesty,

12
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:56,557
Are you prepared to lay down your royal name?

13
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:03,265
If I leave that child as you've commanded,

14
00:01:03,265 --> 00:01:07,635
would you be able to protect that child instead?

15
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,996
Hyungnim.

16
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:16,383
You aren't willing to give up anything and 
not willing to have anything taken away from you.

17
00:01:16,383 --> 00:01:19,355
What can you protect?

18
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:20,656
Hyungnim!

19
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:25,433
Aside from inflicting pain, causing an innocent child to be guilty,

20
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:30,133
what can you do?!

21
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,300
Stop.

22
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,500
Please stop.

23
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,446
Can you give up...

24
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:45,994
Yeon Woo?

25
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,867
I...

26
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:57,067
can do that.

27
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,633
But, never

28
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,570
will you be able to do that.

29
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:28,100
You...

30
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:31,900
Why are you here?

31
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,833
I heard that Your Highness

32
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,000
called me here.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,533
Isn't that right?

34
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:52,567
Are you...

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,633
No. It's not so.
That can't be.

36
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:03,533
That can't happen.

37
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:12,367
Heo. 
Yeon. 
Woo.

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,375
Am I that similar to that child?

39
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,833
What?

40
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:31,933
A lot of people mistake me 
for Heo Yeon Woo.

41
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,667
But, this servant

42
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,234
is just Shaman Wol.

43
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:38,967
Right.

44
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:44,400
Okay.
You may leave now.

45
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:52,533
If you allow . . .
May I say something before I leave?

46
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:01,236
This servant,

47
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:03,867
within the Hidden Moon Pavillion,

48
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:07,200
I saw the person, Heo Yeon Woo's, spirit.

49
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,766
The spirit told me . . .

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,400
"If you meet the Queen, say this,"

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,273
'Cast away your fears now.

52
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,767
I wish you

53
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,467
happiness,' she said.

54
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,333
That couldn't have happened!

55
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:42,567
The child has no reason to tell me that!

56
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:46,567
Lady Jo, take this girl out.

57
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:49,000
Hurry!

58
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:12,433
Please do not worry
and go back in.

59
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:15,918
I will leave the Palace quietly.

60
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,967
In the case your presence is revealed...

61
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:23,100
How could I hope to live, then?

62
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,900
Those aren't the eyes of someone seeing an old friend.

63
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,867
You can say those are terrified eyes. Why?

64
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:42,533
Exactly why?

65
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:46,300
Your Majesty,
why are you like this?

66
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,633
No, no!

67
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,833
No!

68
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:55,343
Are you going to kill Yeon Woo?

69
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:01,043
Did you say you wanted to live in the Palace?

70
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:04,309
Do you want the King's heart?
Then . . .

71
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:07,143
Then throw away any feelings of guilt and attachment!

72
00:06:07,143 --> 00:06:10,609
Remember how it feels to get what is yours taken away.

73
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:13,043
Without those resolutions,

74
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:15,809
do not covet that position!

75
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:21,477
No one will be able to take my place now.

76
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:24,377
That's right.

77
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:27,677
There's no way.

78
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:30,543
That child died for sure.

79
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:55,743
From now on, you will live here.

80
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:02,410
It may be hard.  But,
I know that you'll endure it well.

81
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:12,465
Were you possibly crying about the family you left?

82
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,832
If so,
open the window.

83
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:33,761
Why...

84
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,700
are you here?

85
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:40,494
Tell me.

86
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:43,461
When you should be at the medical facility,

87
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,300
why are you here?

88
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:48,761
I came into the Palace

89
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:51,228
on a command.

90
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,900
While I was leaving,
I lost my way...

91
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,528
No.

92
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:04,494
Without knowing,

93
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:07,094
the moonlight led me here.

94
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:11,561
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,900
Since it's a precious place for you,

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,500
I will leave.

97
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,261
Is your...

98
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:33,828
body healthy?

99
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,800
It's well.

100
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:39,494
Staying there,

101
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:42,828
isn't it hard?

102
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,461
It isn't hard.

103
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:50,328
If you want me to,

104
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:54,961
I could move you to another place.

105
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:58,528
If you want to,

106
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,100
I can send you to a place where no one knows you.

107
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:06,961
Why . . .

108
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:12,294
do you try to use your power personally?

109
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,500
Please do not do so.

110
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,100
If you do,

111
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,400
I won't be able to meet you again.

112
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:24,528
Then . . .

113
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:29,494
Are you willing to be punished for a sin
 that you never committed?

114
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:34,061
How can you say...

115
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,261
that I didn't sin?

116
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:39,294
How can I atone for the sin

117
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:41,828
of not recognizing you 
the first time I met with you.

118
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:44,561
Then, did you really . . .

119
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,100
seduce a member of the royal family?

120
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,100
Please brace yourself

121
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,400
and don't weaken

122
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:59,994
out of pity.

123
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:16,361
Leave, then.

124
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,000
Leave and

125
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,700
never meet me again.

[Korean Folk Village Location]

128
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,600
Why did you come here?

129
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,300
Since you didn't visit me,

130
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,100
I came here.

131
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,500
There must have been a reason for not visiting you.

132
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:55,428
Please go back.

133
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,000
Miss.

134
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,800
My thoughts are not ready right now.

135
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Later.

136
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,900
I'll meet you later.

137
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,494
His Majesty

138
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:16,461
has requested to see me.

139
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,700
Before I meet with the King,

140
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
I had to first meet you.

141
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,000
That's why I came.

142
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:37,461
I . . .

143
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:41,428
was forced to do whatever 
the King's grandmother commanded.

144
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:43,861
And, I . . .

145
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:46,500
couldn't ignore my friend's will

146
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
asking me to save you.

147
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:53,661
So,

148
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:56,661
I killed you.

149
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,200
So,

150
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,700
I saved you.

151
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,700
No matter what kind of punishment you give me,

152
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,400
I will gladly accept any punishment.

153
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,328
So.

154
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:10,961
There is one...

155
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:14,428
There is one thing I can't forgive...

156
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,700
And, there is one question for which I can't find

157
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,900
the answer.

158
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,600
Why?

159
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:28,461
Why did you fool my father?

160
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:34,261
He had an unbendingly honest character.

161
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:37,461
If I had told him the truth,

162
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:42,500
he wouldn't have been able to lie to the King.

163
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,800
You should've just killed me.

164
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
Miss.

165
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,594
My father

166
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,700
was tormented by the fact that he killed his daughter.

167
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,800
He killed himself.

168
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,600
No.

169
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,528
The moment he gave me the medicine,

170
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:07,094
my father had already died.

171
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:09,961
The medicine that was given to save me

172
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:12,606
became a poison that killed my father!

173
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,361
Do you know that?!

174
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:16,300
You didn't kill me,

175
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,200
but my father!

176
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,800
My family . . .

177
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,200
His Majesty who has endured 8 years of 
shedding tears of blood . . .

178
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,800
How are you going to compensate for it?

179
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,500
Tell me!

180
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,261
For what reason did you seal your mouth
 for so long?

181
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
In order to cast a killing curse,

182
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:50,528
a sacrifice is needed.

183
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:55,061
When I put the curse on you,

184
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,300
a virgin girl, who had strong tenacity,
 was offered as a sacrifice.

185
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:03,261
That girl,

186
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:05,761
to make her ambitions come true,

187
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:09,000
was willingly involved in cursing you

188
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,628
and, for your death,

189
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:20,794
Is that woman . . .

190
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,800
The Queen?

191
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,794
Then . . .

192
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:38,128
Who was it?

193
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,600
Former court lady Noh said that Princess Min Hwa came to the Hidden Moon Pavillion that night.

194
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,728
For some reason, she didn't enter your room and just asked about your health.

195
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:56,394
Then she left.

196
00:17:56,394 --> 00:17:58,694
Princess Min Hwa?

197
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:05,394
No way...

198
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,328
No way...

199
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:15,028
It is the Princess.

200
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,500
Your Father...

201
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,094
committed suicide.

202
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
The pain of losing his own daughter...

203
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,500
The pain of losing his own daughter...

204
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,494
Who would know?

205
00:18:56,794 --> 00:19:00,961
Which of you is Heo Yeom's younger sister?

206
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:02,594
Is it you?

207
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:06,228
Is it you?

208
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,528
Who is Heo Yeom's sister?

209
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:13,294
It is I.

210
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're pretty like Heo Yeom.

211
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,900
Please get up, Princess.

212
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,528
How long has it been?

213
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,428
Grandmother,

214
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:51,969
let me marry with Heo Yeom.

215
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:54,761
Please make that request to Father.

216
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:55,828
Please.

217
00:19:55,828 --> 00:20:00,261
Do you like Heo Yeom that much?

218
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:01,794
Yes.

219
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,700
If it isn't that person,

220
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,428
I'll die.

221
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,200
The King will not allow, but . . .

222
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,461
What should I do if you are so pitiful?

223
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:22,161
Oh no, oh no,

224
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:25,494
please don't cry.

225
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:29,028
There is one way

226
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:32,495
to have Heo Yeom.

227
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,600
What is...

228
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,294
that?

229
00:20:40,294 --> 00:20:42,294
Then,

230
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:45,794
will you...

231
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:49,061
help me?

232
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:01,543
 Oh no,

233
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:04,477
Are you scared?

234
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,110
Don't worry,

235
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,019
You'll get what you want now.

236
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:20,455
Everything is finished now.
So, release your nervousness.

237
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,737
Princess, are you still sleeping?

238
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:47,444
No, Husband.

239
00:21:57,443 --> 00:21:59,615
Were you crying?

240
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:03,443
No.

241
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:08,753
What are you doing here at this hour?

242
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:11,422
I was told that since visiting Father's grave,

243
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:14,022
your mood has not been good.

244
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:16,651
I was worried.

245
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,220
Why are you crying?

246
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,539
Did I make you feel worse?

247
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:27,190
No.

248
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:30,533
I just...

249
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:33,973
dreamt that you disappeared.

250
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,921
I am just relieved

251
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:41,000
to see you.

252
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,243
I am in a big trouble.

253
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,949
Yes?

254
00:22:55,949 --> 00:23:00,610
Did something bad happen to you?

255
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,543
I told you that you were pretty when you smiled.

256
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:09,543
Now you look pretty even though you are crying.

257
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:12,477
That's why I am in a big trouble.

258
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:22,343
Please forgive me.

259
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,077
Forgive what?

260
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,243
Everything.

261
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:34,610
Everything.

262
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:41,256
I will watch over you tonight, so be at ease.

263
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:44,374
Really...

264
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:47,477
Will you really stay by my side?

265
00:23:47,477 --> 00:23:51,487
I promise you so,
Please sleep.

266
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,010
It's treason to participate in a ceremony that endangers the Crown Princess-elect.

267
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:04,310
If the Princess' sin is revealed,

268
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:09,877
His Majesty will have to punish his own blood.

269
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:14,693
Also, the relatives of the princess including the Prince Consort

270
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:17,490
will become criminals.

271
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,910
So those people. . .

272
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,190
That's why they chose the princess to be the sacrifice.

273
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:31,723
They thought that even if, in the future, 
His Majesty and you were to discover all this,

274
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:36,456
you would have no choice but to cover it up.

275
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,800
Miss.

276
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,000
Then . . .

277
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,456
What should I do?

278
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:56,006
You must choose.

279
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,856
Will you reveal all of these facts and return to the King's side?

280
00:25:02,856 --> 00:25:06,490
Or, will you conceal all of this

281
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:10,463
and just live like this?

282
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:15,156
Is this...

283
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:18,590
why you...

284
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,812
for the past long 8 years...

285
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:26,523
were secretive?

286
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,300
It's also why . . .
 before I go to meet His Majesty tomorrow,

287
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,456
I came to find you.

288
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:42,023
I will do whatever you say.

289
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:23,370
Prince Yang Myung, why are you doing this to me?

290
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,756
It's a misunderstanding!
Why are you like this?

291
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:31,144
I'm going crazy!

292
00:27:31,144 --> 00:27:31,978
Ah really!

293
00:27:31,978 --> 00:27:34,011
Alright then, you choose.

294
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:38,378
One, how much you've embezzled until now,

295
00:27:38,378 --> 00:27:41,734
I won't ask or count.

296
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:46,300
So you're going to send food and medicine
 when I ask you nicely like this.

297
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,500
Or two, I continue on this path to report, 
to His Majesty, your sins.

298
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,500
What were you going to report to me?

299
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:57,567
Your Majesty.

300
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:01,467
Your Majesty, it's just that...

301
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:03,934
Hyungnim, why are you in the Palace?

302
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:05,634
It's nothing very important.

303
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:11,634
This Minister of Finance is so busy 
that he doesn't seem to know 
about the poor conditions of west-Hwal In Seo.

304
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:13,900
So I came here to report

305
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,600
and demand him to correct them.

306
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Not knowing about conditions?

307
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
It is nonsense.

308
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,234
Did you forget that the royal family was not allowed to say anything about politics?

309
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,967
That's right.

310
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:27,267
A political statement from the royal family is prohibited....

311
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:31,467
This is not a political statement.  But a sincere statement  hoping to correct mistakes.

312
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:33,667
To correct it?

313
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:36,034
So what is it that you would like to correct?

314
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:38,634
What does Hwal In Seo mean?

315
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,734
Hwal-save one's life/ In-people

316
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,200
Isn't it a place where you save people?

317
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,534
But these days, Hwal In Seo is . . .

318
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,300
more like Sal In Seo, where people get killed.

319
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,934
The food and medicines 
that should be curing people

320
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:57,234
are being used to stuffed the bellies of the rich.

321
00:28:57,234 --> 00:29:00,234
The doctors and nurses who should be
 caring for the sick

322
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:02,967
are only treating the rich nobles.

323
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:03,400
And-

324
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,067
For Hyungnim, who likes to travel
 and wander around,

325
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,434
I didn't know that you had an interest
 in relief for the poor.

326
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:15,134
You're aware of the wise words of Li Shi Qi, 
who helped Liu Bang establish
 the western Han Dynasty.

327
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:20,334
"The country believes it's citizens to be the god and the citizens believe that the food is their god."

328
00:29:20,334 --> 00:29:23,167
The citizens are starving for food.

329
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:27,767
I am worried that your country will fall because of it.

330
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,500
So, you are saying

331
00:29:30,177 --> 00:29:32,867
that I have failed to act accordingly.

332
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:35,534
And that, in the future, 
this country will fall into turmoil.

333
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:36,767
Is that the meaning?

334
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:39,467
That you would take my words so sincerely,

335
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,734
I am truly grateful.

336
00:29:41,734 --> 00:29:45,500
Please understand their pain.

337
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,500
Subtitles brought to you by The 'Eclipse' Team @ Viki.com

338
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,800
My command was for you to care for the sick
 at Hwal In Seo. 
Who told you to raise rats in it!

339
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,900
It would be better if it had taken food 
from the palace food storage!

340
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:02,809
But a rat stealing from Hwal In Seo!

341
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:05,743
Even without conscience, 
this is just too much!

342
00:30:05,743 --> 00:30:09,309
How can you say that?

343
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,843
Please, we aren't capable of such.

344
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,200
Retract your words.

345
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,300
My words are going too far?

346
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,400
Rocks are mixed with rice when measuring its weight.

347
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,200
And with their decreased share, they have to
 make porridge out of that small amount.

348
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,443
Plus, they say no one is getting better eating that.

349
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,800
Are you telling the people in Hwal In Seo to die of starvation?

350
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,100
Hwal In Seo is a place . . .

351
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,900
that is run with money given 
from the group of shamans.

352
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,000
There isn't enough money.

353
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,700
So how can it

354
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,800
support Hwal In Seo.

355
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,600
The Chief Royal Secretary's words are right.

356
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,200
In order to maintain such a place, 
one needs enough funds.

357
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,276
Then,

358
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:53,400
we need to raise taxes, 
which will also cause problems.

359
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,900
It doesn't make sense to only allow the shamans

360
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,543
to support Hwal In Seo.

361
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,343
Even if I have to use Royal funds and

362
00:31:01,343 --> 00:31:05,500
the Councils', this issue will be corrected!

363
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,700
AND!

364
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,700
If there is anyone who tries to defy it . . .!

365
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,500
That also,

366
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,000
if there is curruption and embezzelment in the process of the relief of the poor,

367
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,509
I will have to set it right!

368
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:36,509
You were asking for me, Your Majesty?

369
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:38,543
The Chief Shaman

370
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:40,743
has gone to the King's palace?

371
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:42,209
That is right.

372
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:45,709
From what I've heard, since the day of the solar eclipse,

373
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,800
the King has constantly sought her.

374
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,200
Go to the King's palace immediately.

375
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,900
The moment she comes out,

376
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,600
bring her here.

377
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,900
Yes, Your Highness.

378
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,600
Answer me.

379
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:06,909
Didn't you say,

380
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:10,000
with your own mouth,
 that you left Seungsucheong for a while?

381
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,500
When was it?

382
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:15,743
It was 8 years ago.

383
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:17,776
8 years ago.

384
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:19,776
that was when the crown princess died.

385
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:23,109
Did you have a special reason to leave Seongsucheong?

386
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,909
That is . . .

387
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,643
At that time, my spiritual powers 
weren't as strong as they had been.

388
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,100
So, I went around the country and prayed

389
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,900
to get my powers back to the level it used to be.

390
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,500
Did anything happen to use up your abilities?

391
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
What is it that you are trying

392
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,543
to ask?

393
00:32:44,343 --> 00:32:46,376
Answer me.

394
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:48,543
Is it possible . . .

395
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,500
to kill people with spell/magic?

396
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:57,909
You cannot kill

397
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,400
anyone using magic.

398
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,000
You cannot . . .

399
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:05,676
kill?

400
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,200
There is no method

401
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,300
of killing someone using magic.  But,

402
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,400
the person who is casting the magic

403
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,776
dies.

404
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:17,409
The black magic used to harm humans,

405
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:20,943
always has a consequence.

406
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:22,243
Therefore, who would

407
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,700
risk their own life to kill someone with magic?

408
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,200
So,

409
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,500
I say there is no such magic.

410
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:32,609
Is there . . .

411
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:35,009
no trace of a lie in your words?

412
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:37,009
This servant

413
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:40,476
is only telling the truth.

414
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,200
If this servant

415
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,700
had killed someone, using magic,

416
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,109
I would already be dead.

417
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,576
Since . . .

418
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:55,709
I am here and alive,

419
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:58,809
there shouldn't be anyone dead

420
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:01,200
because of the magic I conjured.

421
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Please,

422
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,200
do not say anything to the King.

423
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:18,143
Through me,

424
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:22,943
I don't want him to be in pain.

425
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:36,273
The Queen Dowager is asking for you.

426
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Why were you called into

427
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,300
the Grand Palace?

428
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,000
That is . . .

429
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,600
Since there was a new Chief Shaman,

430
00:34:49,643 --> 00:34:52,443
he merely wanted to greet me.

431
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:55,043
Why do you speak a lie?

432
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:57,343
For years, since his reign began,

433
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,400
he's never cared about Seongsucheon..

434
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,600
There must have been a reason
to come to the palace secretly.

435
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,443
Actually,

436
00:35:07,443 --> 00:35:10,943
he mentioned my Spiritual Daughter.

437
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:13,376
Your Spiritual Daughter?

438
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,600
Do you mean the child who was expelled to the medical facility?

439
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:19,809
That is correct.

440
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:23,776
Why did he mention that child?

441
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,109
By chance, does he . . .

442
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:27,000
want her by his side again?

443
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,400
No.

444
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,909
He just wanted to make sure that people are careful of what they say

445
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:34,700
about the incident with that girl.

446
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,676
He just wanted to keep their mouths shut?

447
00:35:38,576 --> 00:35:40,643
Is that it?

448
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:42,209
Why would I . . .

449
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:46,447
speak a lie?

450
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:51,643
Unlike that day when you looked at me with hateful eyes,

451
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:53,643
your personality is very different today.

452
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,100
On that day,

453
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,600
my Spiritual Daughter's life was in danger.

454
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,300
There wasn't anything I wouldn't say that day.

455
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,200
I've committed a deadly sin.

456
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,243
I will offer my whole life

457
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,100
to you.

458
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,600
Please,

459
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,000
with your deep and sincere heart,

460
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,600
forgive me.

461
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,200
Anyway,

462
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,300
there can't be any issue

463
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,676
that will be harmful to the King with that girl.

464
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:25,543
I will, again and again,

465
00:36:25,543 --> 00:36:28,176
keep that in mind.

466
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,400
Do you know?

467
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,300
 The more Your Highness tries to block them,

468
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:42,009
 you are aiding the two of them.

469
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:45,076
 Isn't that ironic?

470
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,600
Jang was working under my grandmother's orders.

471
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,600
Grandmother wanted to put a member of her clan as the Crown Princess.

472
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,700
So,

473
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,243
She made Jang conjure up a spell
that harmed Yeon Woo.

474
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:04,976
If, I . . .

475
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,500
had killed someone with magic,

476
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,400
I would already be dead.

477
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,800
Since, I am here and alive,

478
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,600
there shouldn't be anyone dead

479
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,700
 because of the magic I conjured.

480
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,200
The meaning of those words is that  . . .

481
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,100
the person who casted the spell is alive,

482
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,100
which means the one cursed 
can also be alive as well.

483
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:31,509
After two hours of her heart not beating, 
the fact that her skin was still warm was...

484
00:37:33,881 --> 00:37:36,609
She might be alive.

485
00:37:38,462 --> 00:37:40,043
Why is she like this?

486
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:43,474
We're keeping you alive.  And what do you do?

487
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:44,821
Hey, Shaman.

488
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:49,476
Whether you expel the spirit or calm it down, do something!

489
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,600
Ggeout Sun.

490
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:16,532
Eat some wheat porridge.
You have to come to your senses.

491
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,600
Are you trying to die?

492
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,700
Tell me.

493
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,309
I'll keep the secret.

494
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:36,537
Why are you trying to die?

495
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:41,599
Even if I live,

496
00:38:42,263 --> 00:38:45,746
my parents wouldn't be happy.

497
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:47,800
I . . .

498
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,500
Even if I'm alive,

499
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,400
I can't help support my household,
 I'm worthless.

500
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,163
What are you talking about?

501
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:56,800
That day when he carried your sick body

502
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,542
over 30 leagues.

503
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:03,983
Even if his daughter survived,

504
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,300
he wouldn't care?

505
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,400
If I wasn't here,

506
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,400
there would be one less mouth to feed.

507
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,343
Then,

508
00:39:14,343 --> 00:39:18,576
My parents would have less hardship.

509
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:21,730
I...

510
00:39:22,355 --> 00:39:24,649
understand you very well.

511
00:39:28,316 --> 00:39:30,732
Once, when I was so young . . .

512
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:34,687
If I was gone . . .

513
00:39:35,398 --> 00:39:37,666
My entire family would . . .

514
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:43,092
I thought my family would live very well.

515
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:46,707
I thought, as long as I disappeared,
 it would be over.

516
00:39:46,707 --> 00:39:48,619
But,

517
00:39:49,276 --> 00:39:51,737
one day, suddenly,

518
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:56,899
when the daughter that he loved disappeared . . .

519
00:39:58,053 --> 00:40:02,036
What parent, in the world, would be alright?

520
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:04,780
No matter what, live with them.

521
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,402
Your existence alone is valuable.

522
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:11,456
That's what family is.

523
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,500
Don't ever think about dying.

524
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,600
Please,

525
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
don't tell me

526
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
that you're Heo Yeon Woo.

527
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,258
Just that you're Shaman Wol.

528
00:40:46,258 --> 00:40:48,376
So,

529
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:52,338
 you're of no relationship to the King.

530
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,500
When did you come?

531
00:41:03,258 --> 00:41:05,059
I just came.

532
00:41:08,271 --> 00:41:12,464
My lord, the preparations are ready.

533
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:14,552
Okay.
You've worked hard.

534
00:41:14,552 --> 00:41:16,838
Wait for a moment.

535
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,100
Here.

536
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,300
Bring them here.

537
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,600
I was arguing with the city hall.

538
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:52,199
The process was so complicated. 
They say, you will die knowing the whole process.

539
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,800
It is a little shameful, but

540
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,566
I wanted to brag about my wealth.

541
00:41:59,385 --> 00:42:01,975
What are you staring at?

542
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:05,172
Now that you've seen my wealth,

543
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:09,372
do you have an interest in me?

544
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,403
I also brought something to give to you.

545
00:42:18,053 --> 00:42:20,836
This is a book called "Eui Bang So Chi."

546
00:42:20,836 --> 00:42:23,536
In so many words, this can be what you call
 a medical encyclopedia.

547
00:42:23,536 --> 00:42:26,703
If you read it, it'll be of good use.  
So, take it.

548
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:28,636
In truth,

549
00:42:28,636 --> 00:42:31,442
I thought that it would be good to know 
a few things about medicine.

550
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:34,632
Can I really take this?

551
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:37,070
I brought this for you.

552
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,470
Well . . .

553
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,800
If you don't want it,

554
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,098
then you can use it to start a fire.

555
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:45,845
I'll take it.

556
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:48,539
You should've said that, in the first place.

557
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:49,911
Uh.

558
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:52,147
If you have a question about something,

559
00:42:52,147 --> 00:42:55,536
ask me directly.

560
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:19,471
It took me such a long time trying to get these, 
and now that I need to say farewell to them,

561
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,470
the tears are blocking my sight.

562
00:43:22,836 --> 00:43:25,436
Especially this rascal.

563
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:29,236
When I wear this thing,

564
00:43:29,236 --> 00:43:34,146
all the ladies fall over for me at first sight.

565
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:42,566
Did you used to go undercover as a woman also?

566
00:43:42,566 --> 00:43:44,570
Oh that's...

567
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:46,921
If you want it, you can have it.

568
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:49,336
Really?

569
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:51,003
I can give it to Jan Shil.

570
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,098
You can't!

571
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,003
Actually,

572
00:43:57,581 --> 00:44:01,153
I have somewhere I want to go with you.

573
00:44:01,153 --> 00:44:04,202
It was made to fit your complexion.

574
00:44:04,202 --> 00:44:07,169
So, it won't match another woman.

575
00:44:07,169 --> 00:44:12,369
You have somewhere you want to go with me?

576
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,535
That's right.

577
00:44:15,535 --> 00:44:17,323
If I may,

578
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:20,035
can I ask

579
00:44:20,035 --> 00:44:22,635
where that is?

580
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:28,535
It is a house where my oldest friend lives.

581
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:32,635
It is the house of my Teacher.

582
00:44:55,528 --> 00:44:57,303
If . . .

583
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
she is alive . . .

584
00:45:00,295 --> 00:45:03,828
Why didn't she show herself to me?

585
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:06,495
Why?

586
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:09,795
I was waiting.

587
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:20,661
Why do you come just now?

588
00:45:22,228 --> 00:45:26,095
I will name you Wol.

589
00:45:26,728 --> 00:45:28,528
Wol.

590
00:45:37,328 --> 00:45:39,495
Who are you?

591
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:42,761
Tell me!

592
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:45,661
What is your identity?!

593
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:50,828
It is because I am not the person you want me to be.

594
00:45:50,828 --> 00:45:54,495
Am I not in the past memory?

595
00:45:54,495 --> 00:45:56,695
Please,

596
00:45:56,695 --> 00:46:01,261
Stop asking me.

597
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:04,461
No matter what kind of question you ask me,

598
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:09,061
I cannot give you the answer you want.

599
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:12,861
Then,
 why did she pretend she didn't know me?

600
00:46:12,861 --> 00:46:16,095
Wasn't the gaze telling me that 
she was telling a lie?

601
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:19,428
And the reason why Yeon Woo 
was buried in a grave,

602
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:22,228
Wasn't it confirmed?

603
00:46:22,228 --> 00:46:24,361
It's something that doesn't make sense.

604
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:27,361
It's something that shouldn't happen.

605
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,295
But . . .

606
00:46:29,295 --> 00:46:32,695
The King?
That's right.

607
00:46:32,695 --> 00:46:38,395
I've received a secret command,
to investigate the late Princess' death.

608
00:46:40,795 --> 00:46:45,343
If the King gives you a command
to investigate the Princess' death,

609
00:46:45,343 --> 00:46:49,428
was there something suspicious about our Yeon Woo's death?

610
00:46:51,495 --> 00:46:53,628
I'm sorry, Sir.

611
00:46:53,628 --> 00:46:58,500
Due to orders, I cannot say anything.

612
00:47:02,661 --> 00:47:05,895
Since there aren't many people who still 
remember the incident from 8 years ago,

613
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:08,828
so even though I know it is rude, 
I am here to ask you.

614
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:11,528
Please tell me what you know.

615
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:18,561
As I also was away on a trip,

616
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:22,995
I only saw that child's funeral.

617
00:47:22,995 --> 00:47:26,728
So I wasn't able to be at her side when she left.

618
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:34,728
Forgive me for asking such an inconsiderate question.

619
00:47:34,728 --> 00:47:37,028
Sorry, you say.

620
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:41,528
I'm sorry I can't help you.

621
00:47:51,228 --> 00:47:53,861
Please go safely, Sir.

622
00:47:59,228 --> 00:48:02,795
Why are you like this, Sir?

623
00:48:02,795 --> 00:48:05,861
Don't reject me.

624
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:10,561
I have something to ask you.

625
00:48:10,561 --> 00:48:13,128
Ah, yes.

626
00:48:27,628 --> 00:48:30,495
Is it Prince Yang Myung?

627
00:48:53,828 --> 00:48:58,961
Young Master,
Miss' memory returned.

628
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:06,495
Will we ever live together like before?

629
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:11,077
Mother, it is I.

630
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:24,044
What are you doing?

631
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,077
I'm considering giving away clothes
 that I don't wear anymore

632
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:29,810
to the medical center.

633
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,593
I'm just organizing everything.

634
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:36,010
Is this not something you do every year?

635
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,417
How would you like it if I escorted you there?

636
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:42,944
That would be good.
But,

637
00:49:42,944 --> 00:49:46,744
instead of going to the East Medical Center this time,

638
00:49:46,744 --> 00:49:49,177
I would like to go to the one located in the west.

639
00:49:49,177 --> 00:49:55,510
Is it because of the girl who looked like Yeon Woo?

640
00:50:01,477 --> 00:50:04,710
Even though it's not Yeon Woo . . .

641
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,700
That girl had parents, too.

642
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,500
If her parents saw her like that...

643
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:17,077
how heartbroken would they be?

644
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,810
I want to see her again and

645
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:25,744
day some warm encouragements.

646
00:50:27,918 --> 00:50:32,477
But, Yeom, why are you here?

647
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:35,444
I just happen to come.

648
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:41,210
It seems the King has

649
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:47,437
ordered a private investigation concerning the death of our Yeon Woo.

650
00:50:47,437 --> 00:50:50,200
The King?

651
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:52,531
[Korean Folk Village Location.]

652
00:50:52,531 --> 00:50:56,296
At that time, they were very shocked.

653
00:50:56,296 --> 00:50:59,132
So I didn't say too much.

654
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,800
It would have been too heartbreaking.

655
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,700
There was one thing that I couldn't tell them.

656
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,500
If you keep stalling like that,

657
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,200
people can die.

658
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,565
Don't hesitate and just tell me.

659
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:18,707
The day following the funeral,

660
00:51:18,707 --> 00:51:21,075
I went to the young lady's grave.

661
00:51:21,075 --> 00:51:24,040
It looked disturbed by wild animals.

662
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,196
There were signs of the grave being dug up.

663
00:51:27,196 --> 00:51:31,581
Signs of the grave being dug up?
Poor lady.

664
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,500
Oh, aren't you Seol?

665
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,200
Shaman Wol is being arrested for high treason.

666
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:55,463
You must be mistaken ...

667
00:51:59,527 --> 00:52:02,446
Do you know her?

668
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,500
That is...
I'm not very sure, but...

669
00:52:13,996 --> 00:52:18,482
Did you just say Princess Yeon Woo's grave

670
00:52:18,482 --> 00:52:20,604
had signs of being dug up?

671
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:22,044
Yes.

672
00:52:22,044 --> 00:52:27,491
No one knew but the manager 
of the Yeon Woo's household.

673
00:52:29,265 --> 00:52:32,476
There was one more thing suspicious.

674
00:52:32,476 --> 00:52:34,327
Suspicious?

675
00:52:34,327 --> 00:52:38,542
Whenever I go there, there was a woman that always appeared there.

676
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,400
A woman?

677
00:52:39,412 --> 00:52:40,703
Yes.

678
00:52:40,703 --> 00:52:44,033
I also bumped into her at the house of court lady Noh.

679
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:48,891
And today, I saw her at Prince Consort's 
door step.

680
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:53,816
The manager of the household of
 the Prince Consort said she was

681
00:52:53,816 --> 00:52:56,196
the servant girl of Lady Yeon Woo.

682
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,258
But . . .

683
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,737
But what?

684
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:03,352
That woman

685
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:06,435
was also the servant of Shaman Wol.

686
00:53:12,763 --> 00:53:14,219
Hyung Sun,

687
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:15,705
Yes, Your Majesty.

688
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,200
Bring immediately the

689
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,900
Seongsucheong's Chief Shaman.

690
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:24,727
RIGHT NOW!

691
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:30,155
Incantation, warm dead body,

692
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,200
a hasty funeral without shrouding the corpse,

693
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,600
a grave being dug up, a murder without trace,

694
00:53:36,603 --> 00:53:39,596
incantation, Seongsucheon, 
Chief Shaman Jang.

695
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:43,592
Also, everytime during the investigation
 into Yeon Woo's death,

696
00:53:43,592 --> 00:53:45,367
the appearance of Shaman Wol's servant.

697
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:49,500
Now, only confirmation is needed.

698
00:54:04,063 --> 00:54:06,592
You grace us (with your presence), Your Majesty.

699
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,400
Why are you like this?

700
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,434
What did you just see that you're shaking?

701
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,500
Heo Yeon Woo!

702
00:54:53,345 --> 00:54:57,090
That child is alive!
Mother!

703
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,016
What kind of...

704
00:55:00,915 --> 00:55:04,908
That child has been dead for 8 years.

705
00:55:04,908 --> 00:55:07,663
She is already buried in a grave.

706
00:55:07,663 --> 00:55:10,063
It was definitely that child.

707
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:13,629
Near me...

708
00:55:13,629 --> 00:55:15,922
Near the King...

709
00:55:16,796 --> 00:55:19,563
I never dreamt she would be coming this close to me.

710
00:55:22,263 --> 00:55:26,929
She's going to find me and reclaim her rightful place!

711
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:28,796
Mother!

712
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:32,463
Get a hold of yourself!

713
00:55:34,096 --> 00:55:37,296
The Queen's position was yours in the first place.

714
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:39,163
It wasn't stolen.

715
00:55:39,163 --> 00:55:43,763
Since you're thinking like that,
you keep on seeing illusions.

716
00:55:43,763 --> 00:55:45,963
It's not an illusion!

717
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:49,596
Your Majesty!
Why are you like this?!

718
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,929
I know all of it!

719
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,929
Father...

720
00:55:54,996 --> 00:55:57,796
Father... killed that child...

721
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,996
Yeon Woo.

722
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:08,096
To make me the Queen . . .
 Father killed that child, Yeon Woo.

723
00:56:12,463 --> 00:56:17,163
You just need to close your mouth.

724
00:56:17,163 --> 00:56:19,129
Even if that is true...

725
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:23,863
If that is true...

726
00:56:23,863 --> 00:56:26,363
You must be even more silent about it.

727
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:28,563
Believe in your father.

728
00:56:37,396 --> 00:56:40,529
Go!
Go!

729
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,500
Your Majesty...

730
00:56:57,696 --> 00:57:00,529
The face I've seen somewhere.

731
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:04,263
This servant . . . never . . .

732
00:57:04,263 --> 00:57:06,463
cursed anyone using an incantation.

733
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,600
Whose child are you?

734
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,663
 Daughter of Chief Scholar Heo, Heo Yeon Woo.

735
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:15,196
 The Daughter of Chief Scholar Heo,

736
00:57:15,196 --> 00:57:16,629
Heo Yeon Woo?

737
00:57:17,663 --> 00:57:19,896
That child is alive?

738
00:57:19,963 --> 00:57:21,896
 How is that possible?

739
00:57:23,729 --> 00:57:29,029
 Perhaps . . . 
Perhaps, was it the work of Shaman Jang?

740
00:57:34,596 --> 00:57:37,063
From now on, all I ask

741
00:57:37,063 --> 00:57:39,763
you must answer me without lying.

742
00:57:39,763 --> 00:57:43,596
If you try to evade answering or play with words,

743
00:57:43,596 --> 00:57:46,629
you will be severely punished. 
Do you understand?

744
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:50,163
Please ask me.

745
00:57:51,529 --> 00:57:54,063
Is Shaman Wol . . .

746
00:57:54,063 --> 00:57:55,763
really your Spiritual Daughter?

747
00:57:57,263 --> 00:57:58,929
Yes.

748
00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:01,029
When did she become your Spiritual Daughter?

749
00:58:01,029 --> 00:58:03,596
8 years ago.

750
00:58:04,163 --> 00:58:06,496
A shaman . . .

751
00:58:06,496 --> 00:58:09,363
having to forget their past life,

752
00:58:09,363 --> 00:58:13,329
does it mean that they forget on purpose?

753
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:17,096
Or, does it mean that they can't remember it at all?

754
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,000
For a shaman, a previous life is something that

755
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,496
has to be cut off willingly.

756
00:58:26,596 --> 00:58:31,096
Surviving from the brink of death

757
00:58:31,096 --> 00:58:33,996
and losing all memory of her past life,

758
00:58:33,996 --> 00:58:36,529
I have seen a shaman like that.

759
00:58:37,729 --> 00:58:42,496
Surviving from the brink of death?

760
00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:47,663
In saying that . . .

761
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:53,396
Was someone buried alive in a grave?

762
00:58:56,229 --> 00:59:01,196
What happened to that shaman?

763
00:59:01,196 --> 00:59:04,329
Did she recover her memory or

764
00:59:04,329 --> 00:59:08,496
does she still not remember who she is?

765
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:13,529
I will ask you for the last time.

766
00:59:15,129 --> 00:59:16,596
Is that shaman . . .

767
00:59:19,596 --> 00:59:21,829
Is that shaman's name...

768
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:25,929
Wol?

769
00:59:30,729 --> 00:59:33,363
ANSWER ME!

770
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:35,896
Is Shaman Wol . . .

771
00:59:37,096 --> 00:59:40,463
Heo Yeon Woo who died 8 years ago?!

772
01:00:51,896 --> 01:00:56,129
Who do you think you are to think you can touch me!

773
01:00:56,129 --> 01:01:01,763
 You're not even a person, so how dare you 
 lay a hand on my body.

774
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,000
 Just because I let you stay by my side, do you think you have my heart as well?

775
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:11,529
 You're nothing but a negative-energy absorbing shaman.  Nothing more, nothing less!

776
01:01:15,729 --> 01:01:18,129
Please stay strong.

777
01:01:18,129 --> 01:01:20,429
Please don't be shaken

778
01:01:20,429 --> 01:01:24,729
because of your feelings.

779
01:01:24,729 --> 01:01:25,996
Don't come near.

780
01:01:25,996 --> 01:01:27,963
If you pass the boundaries,

781
01:01:28,529 --> 01:01:30,563
I won't forgive you.

782
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:32,896
Never...

783
01:01:32,896 --> 01:01:35,596
 appear in front of me again.

784
01:01:35,596 --> 01:01:37,863
Is that shaman's name...

785
01:01:37,863 --> 01:01:40,496
Is the shaman, Wol?!

786
01:01:45,229 --> 01:01:48,363
Is she Heo Yeon Woo who died 8 years ago?

787
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:02,000
Yeon Woo!
