00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,600
Episode 3

2
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,700
Although if she gets closer to the sun,

3
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,300
it will only invite disaster,

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,200
she will bring wrath upon her family, but she is destined to protect the sun.

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,300
...

6
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,958
so that she remains safe.

7
00:00:58,315 --> 00:00:59,865
Two moons.

8
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:08,976
What brings you to  the palace?

9
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,527
Don't tell me . . .

10
00:01:10,923 --> 00:01:15,300
You're the princess' companion child too?

11
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,223
Then, you are too?

12
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:24,564
Chief Shaman,

13
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,928
the Queen Dowager is awaiting you.

14
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:29,348
Let's go.

15
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,601
Chief Shaman of Seongsucheong (herself)

16
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,634
has returned from her prayers and 
has come to pay my respect to you, the Queen Dowager.

17
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:55,833
Did things proceed smoothly during the period of your prayers?

18
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,966
The vitality of the heavens

19
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:04,247
has been in much confusion.  
Thus, making for my later than 
scheduled return to the palace.

20
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:07,087
Please forgive me.

21
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:09,357
I won't let such a trivial matter bother me.

22
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:11,641
Speaking of which,

23
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,699
you must have heard about this.

24
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,197
You have to help me look at the prospects
 of the companion children who are about to
 enter the palace.

25
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:23,057
What kind of prospect should I look for?

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,400
who is fated to become the Queen.

27
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,356
You have just returned from settling your mind
 and sending your prayers, 
so your senses should be clearer
 than any other time.

28
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:39,948
Help me determine if either of the two children
 will become the future Queen.

29
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,439
Until the Queen's Palace calls for you,

30
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:50,033
please wait here a while.

31
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:27,545
That...

32
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:31,889
You said you're called Bo Kyung, right?

33
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:36,371
There was some conflict 
during our first meeting.

34
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:40,068
But do you want to forget about the past
and try to get along nicely?

35
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,100
You cannot make enemies in the palace.

36
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,700
Even if there's an enemy,

37
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,792
you cannot show it on your face.

38
00:03:54,814 --> 00:04:00,654
You should never put your trust in others lightly or let others know what you are thinking.

39
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:03,643
That's what politics is.

40
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:11,667
Fine, let's try to get along.

41
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:16,475
I'm so glad. I thought you were really mad.

42
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:19,109
No... I was feeling

43
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,371
'regretful' about what happened that day.

44
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:24,257
I'm feeling more at ease

45
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:26,672
to hear you say that.

46
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,600
Let's try to get along well from now on.

47
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:40,301
Alright.

48
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:19,673
No matter how long I look at it  this doesn't look like a flower.

49
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,038
What is it?

50
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,392
That's right,

51
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:27,491
I can just ask her personally.

52
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,611
Crown Prince...

53
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:36,682
I've confirmed the entrance of those companion children to the palace. 
Oh, then . . .

54
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:41,575
- Did you find out whose daughters they are?
 -  Minister of Office's daughter, Yoon Bo Kyung and

55
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:45,191
Office of Special Advisor's daughter, Heo Yeon Woo.

56
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:47,439
You entered the palace as I've expected.

57
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:49,829
Yeon Woo...

58
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:51,656
So, you're called Yeon Woo.

59
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,630
What a beautiful name.

60
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,519
Do you have a lady

61
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:03,633
that you fancy?

62
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:11,787
-My attendant, you're the only one I have. 
-Crown Prince,

63
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,042
Crown Prince,

64
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,106
Why . . . Why are you acting like this?

65
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:17,727
Why are you like this?

66
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:24,124
-You can't do that, Crown Prince... 
-Why can't I do that?

67
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,116
As the royal Crown Prince,

68
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:31,028
you're trying to meet a lady. 
And, you're doing so in the palace;

69
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:34,415
trying to meet her privately. 
That won't do.

70
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:36,068
And . . .

71
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:41,349
trying to move around after 
shaking off your guards... 
To put it simply,

72
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:45,243
it's impossible.

73
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:47,731
Hyung Sun, isn't that why I'm asking you
 to do me the favor?

74
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:54,487
Did you forget about the incident when you tried to climb over the wall?

75
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:57,526
I was reprimanded for my negligence and

76
00:06:57,546 --> 00:07:01,044
the flesh on my bottom has yet to fully recover.

77
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:04,067
In addition, you have a lot of things to accomplish today.

78
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:07,121
You have to take the place of His Majesty, who's tied up with other matters,

79
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:08,915
to promote the soccer competition that

80
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:14,199
will take place in the palace. Additionally- 
 - My attendent . . .

81
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,319
You were reprimanded during the attendant exam

82
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:21,582
and was feeling despair. Who was

83
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:24,221
the one who sincerely comforted and helped you?

84
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,646
Crown...

85
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:29,833
Crown Prince...

86
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,894
And who tutored you in "The Doctrine of the Mean?"

87
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:34,702
The person who taught you personally...

88
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:38,061
Who was it?

89
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,829
It was you, Crown Prince...

90
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:44,912
You weren't demoted and were even promoted.

91
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:46,938
On whose account was that?

92
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,653
You, Crown Prince...

93
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:57,116
I wasn't able to sleep upon hearing

94
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,352
that you'd entered the palace.

95
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:05,232
I'll send someone soon, so I'll see you then.

96
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:10,964
Lee

97
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:15,431
Hwon.

98
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:23,024
Oh my, that child is...

99
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,248
It definitely...

100
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,522
will happen.

101
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:29,151
You've had a hard journey on your way here.

102
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:33,806
Under the instructions of the Queen Dowager, I've been asked to teach the both of you.

103
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:39,119
I heard that you've long completed primary studies and etiquette teachings.

104
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:41,081
Is that correct?

105
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:43,269
That's right.

106
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:44,203
So,

107
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:47,032
I don't intend to teach that again.

108
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:53,642
You just need to enjoy playing with Princess Min Hwa while you're here.

109
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,600
Mother, have you been in good health?

110
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:04,173
Between the two of you,

111
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,130
who's Teacher Heo's sister?

112
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:09,316
-My princess... 
-Is it you?

113
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:12,204
Is it you?

114
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:17,288
Who's Teacher Heo's sister?

115
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,145
It's I.

116
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,668
Wow... I knew

117
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:27,713
it'd be you.

118
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:32,265
You resemble Teacher Heo and you are also very pretty.

119
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:34,701
Oh right,

120
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:38,784
take this.

121
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:40,581
Just to let you know,

122
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:43,276
there are some accessories inside.

123
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:46,768
Thank You.

124
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:10,870
I'm Office of Special Advisor,

125
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,455
Heo Yeong Jae's daughter,

126
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,875
Heo Yeon Woo.

127
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,338
I'm Minister of Home Office, Yoon Dae Hyeong's daughter,

128
00:11:17,712 --> 00:11:19,428
Yoon Bo Kyung.

129
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:25,171
My Queen and concubine...

130
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:27,018
Yes, Queen Dowager.

131
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:29,756
Don't you find them to your liking?

132
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,924
It feels as if two flowers have come to the palace.

133
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,269
I hope that the two of you

134
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:41,613
will get along fine with the princess. 
I will remember your words.

135
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:57,286
Two moons hanging in

136
00:11:57,737 --> 00:11:59,101
the sky of JoSeon?

137
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:03,141
You just have to make an appearance
at the competition venue.

138
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:06,067
You don't have to take part personally.

139
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:08,321
What if you get hurt or...

140
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:10,026
Even if I die,

141
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:11,664
I can't stand being bored.

142
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:16,220
If His Majesty comes to know about it, my head will roll.

143
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,519
You're talking too much.

144
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:25,040
Have you been well, Crown Prince?

145
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:27,934
Oh! Brother!

146
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:40,521
I couldn't be better. Are you on your way to the Eastern Palace?

147
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:41,258
That's right.

148
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:42,984
I wanted to meet you and

149
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:45,899
take the opportunity to see Teacher Heo.

150
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,934
You know Teacher Heo?

151
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:52,231
He's been a good friend of mine ever since
 I went out of the palace.

152
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:54,375
I see.

153
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,531
I didn't know that.  Teacher Heo 
has never mentioned it before.

154
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:01,897
Ah, we shouldn't just be standing here, we should have some refreshments

155
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,329
I'm sorry, but

156
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,243
you have to rush.

157
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:09,750
It seems like you're busy.

158
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:13,950
I'll be doing some catching up 
with Teacher Heo, so please hurry.

159
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:17,491
That sounds good. Why don't you join us?

160
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:18,965
What?

161
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:21,659
My guards, listen up.

162
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:23,539
As of now,

163
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,706
you will all join forces and with the other team,

164
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:27,355
we'll have a soccer match.

165
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,270
- Crown Prince... 
 - You have to win no matter what,

166
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:31,799
in the name of the Eastern Palace.

167
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:33,239
You got it?

168
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,801
Understood.

169
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:13,814
You know each other?

170
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,410
All of us studied under DaeJae School,

171
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,565
so we're close acquaintances.

172
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,651
He's top military scholar, Kim Jae Eun.

173
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:30,943
Didn't I tell you?

174
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,853
I'm not a thief.

175
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:36,229
 - I'm the top military scholar's younger brother. 
 - Why do you blame others 
whenever you open your mouth

176
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:38,242
and tell lies when you close your mouth?

177
00:14:39,385 --> 00:14:40,980
The top military scholar is

178
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,113
my brother's best friend.

179
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:48,964
You're someone who almost became my brother.

180
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,486
I think this is an interesting fate.

181
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:47,685
I wasn't able to sleep upon hearing

182
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:49,939
that you'd entered the palace.

183
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:52,808
I'll send someone soon,

184
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,853
so I'll see you then.

185
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:07,446
What is that?

186
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,372
It's nothing.

187
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:17,460
This is so boring, I can't do it any longer.

188
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:21,957
Let's go out and play, Yeon Woo.

189
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,662
What? 
--Quick.

190
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:25,334
Quick.

191
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:26,961
Quickly...

192
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:28,898
My princess...

193
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:29,888
My princess...

194
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:31,317
My princess...

195
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:32,846
My princess...

196
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,234
Lee Hwon?

197
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:18,713
Let's go over there... Over there...

198
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:26,851
Come quickly! Quick!

199
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,997
Shall we start?

200
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,144
I'm from the Eastern Palace.

201
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:49,443
I'll send someone soon,

202
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,401
so I'll see you then.

203
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:53,908
Are you Teacher Heo's sister?

204
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:57,103
No, it's not me.

205
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:08,254
She has a resemblance to Teacher Heo.

206
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,635
What did she...

207
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,576
Hyung Sun...

208
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,164
What are you doing here?

209
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,837
Yes...

210
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:34,834
I was just passing by.

211
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:44,038
What is it?

212
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:45,754
Do you have something to tell me?

213
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,405
Is Teacher Heo

214
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,320
at Biyeong Pavilion?

215
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:56,839
Teacher Heo is having a soccer match with the Crown Prince.

216
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:58,957
Oh no...

217
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,941
Teacher Heo?

218
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:07,854
Soccer?

219
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,969
My princess,

220
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:17,586
where are you?

221
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:20,016
At least clap a little.

222
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,240
Teacher Heo is over there! Where?

223
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:15,433
So,

224
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,200
did you find someone with the fate of a Queen?

225
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:23,510
Why can't you answer me?

226
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:26,919
There's no Queen?

227
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:33,026
Congratulations.

228
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,523
You'll get . . .

229
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:36,952
your wish soon.

230
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:39,559
Are you saying

231
00:21:40,086 --> 00:21:41,549
that Minister of Home Office's daughter...

232
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:43,232
She'll become

233
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,100
the owner of Kyotae Palace when the time comes.

234
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:00,888
What kind of

235
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:03,065
a twisted fate is this?

236
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:07,838
Although she has the aura of being the queen,

237
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:11,027
she's not fated to become the owner of Kyotae Palace.

238
00:22:11,842 --> 00:22:13,481
Although she has no aura of being the queen,

239
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:16,208
she's destined to become the owner of Kyotae Palace.

240
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:24,882
Two moons,

241
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,621
two suns

242
00:22:29,841 --> 00:22:30,754
and...

243
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:35,632
The smell of death.

244
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:51,094
Crown Prince!

245
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:55,130
Crown Prince... Crown Prince...

246
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:56,680
Crown Prince!

247
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,336
Tie up that person immediately! Yes!

248
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,229
Crown Prince,

249
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:11,253
- It's a misunderstanding. 
 - Would you let go of him?

250
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,300
Let him go immediately.

251
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,523
Crown Prince,

252
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:22,249
I deserve death.

253
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:25,636
It's a match

254
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:28,824
to decide who will be the winner.

255
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,013
From now on, if you

256
00:23:31,386 --> 00:23:33,256
pass the ball to me on purpose,

257
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,905
let me pass or

258
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:37,336
allow me to score a goal,

259
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,217
you'd be punished severely like soldiers.

260
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:42,854
Do you understand that?

261
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:45,405
Yes, understood.

262
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,528
My princess,

263
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:55,529
why are you doing this?

264
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:58,531
It'd be serious trouble if His Majesty comes to know about this.

265
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,885
Don't worry.

266
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:02,864
My father has

267
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:05,019
always sided with me.

268
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:06,992
Didn't you hear me?

269
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:09,027
Escort the princess back now.

270
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,100
It's fine even if everyone 
becomes the Crown Prince's people,

271
00:24:46,157 --> 00:24:47,036
as long as you,

272
00:24:47,993 --> 00:24:49,961
Heo Yeon Woo, becomes my woman.

273
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:54,756
Father!

274
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,527
It's my princess.

275
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:01,413
Are you having a good time with your companions?

276
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,073
Yes,

277
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:04,426
I especially like her.

278
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:09,980
Whose daughter are you?

279
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:12,289
I'm Office of Special Advisors' daughter,

280
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:13,900
Heo Yeon Woo.

281
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,500
Then, you're Minister of Home Office's daughter?

282
00:25:18,827 --> 00:25:19,949
That's right.

283
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:28,692
Both of you have outstanding daughters.

284
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:32,827
Thank you for your praise, Your Majesty,

285
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,258
I hope that you'll become good friends with the princess.

286
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,270
I will remember your words.

287
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,456
Since you've entered the palace, keep in mind
not to speak of the Onsil Tree.

288
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:45,425
Do you know the meaning?

289
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:49,010
Daughter of Minister of Home Office, 
try answering me.

290
00:25:51,756 --> 00:25:52,866
Please pardon me.

291
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,700
I've always been taught by my father

292
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,585
that talk about politics is the domain of men.

293
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:03,105
And women should focus on learning about innocence and etiquette.

294
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,546
That's why I've only focused

295
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:10,416
on primary studies, etiquette and related matters.

296
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:12,923
As a woman, it should be fine 
having studied just those.

297
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:14,463
Then,

298
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:17,894
daughter of Office of Special Advisor, try answering me.

299
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,462
It means to not speak of things one shouldn't.

300
00:26:25,177 --> 00:26:26,683
It is from a story of Kong Guang,

301
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:28,718
of the Han Dynasty.

302
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:29,433
Really?

303
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,950
What kind of story is that?

304
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:35,377
Kong Guang's friends asked what 
kind of trees grew in the Palace.

305
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:36,807
He refused to give an answer.

306
00:26:37,104 --> 00:26:40,810
Can you tell me what the story means?

307
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:42,712
Matters that happen within the palace or at court

308
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:45,658
should not be disclosed to the outside.

309
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,133
That's a wonderful answer.

310
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,266
It's just as you said,

311
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:54,709
Things that you hear or feel within the palace should not be revealed outside of the palace.

312
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,172
Correct.  So, you understand that?

313
00:26:57,912 --> 00:26:58,649
Yes.

314
00:27:11,393 --> 00:27:12,405
Your Majesty,

315
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:15,594
Prince Yang Myung  requests
the favour of an audience with you.

316
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:17,970
Let him enter.

317
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:33,786
We should expect another bolt from the blue.

318
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:43,311
Your subject, Yang Myung, 
pays his respect to His Majesty.

319
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:50,314
Why are you here?

320
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:51,722
Please pardon me.

321
00:27:53,328 --> 00:27:55,186
Although you've specifically instructed me not to enter

322
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:59,893
the palace according to my wishes... 
 - I'm asking what's the reason for you to look for me.

323
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:02,466
I...

324
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:07,352
I have a

325
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:09,805
request to ask of you.

326
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:11,740
You're asking a favor

327
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:14,676
from me?

328
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:16,645
Yes Your Majesty

329
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:21,792
Tell me.

330
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:27,434
There is a lady that I have feelings for.

331
00:28:30,707 --> 00:28:31,906
No matter when,

332
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:35,425
she's a woman that I want to spend the rest of my life with.

333
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:36,470
However . . .

334
00:28:38,423 --> 00:28:39,567
Perhaps, if . . .

335
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:43,064
you're thinking of arranging my marriage . . .

336
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:46,385
I hope that you can

337
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,300
take into consideration my feelings.

338
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:54,070
This is . . .

339
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:56,445
my humble and lowly . . .

340
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,348
the first and last request

341
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:02,296
that I'll be asking of you.

342
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:12,599
What family is she from?

343
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,500
What?

344
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,098
Didn't you hear me?

345
00:29:19,264 --> 00:29:21,200
I asked whose daughter is she.

346
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:26,566
She's Chief Scholar's daughter,

347
00:29:28,546 --> 00:29:30,602
by the name of Heo Yeon Woo.

348
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:37,710
Alright.

349
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:39,612
I'll think about it.

350
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:43,494
What...

351
00:29:44,162 --> 00:29:45,504
What did you just say?

352
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,967
I said I'll think about it.

353
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:52,674
I...

354
00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:55,478
I'm very grateful.

355
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:24,625
Useless fellow...

356
00:30:27,968 --> 00:30:29,596
I said to be careful

357
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:33,357
when you enter the palace.

358
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,900
I never asked you to sever 
your relationship with me.

359
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:45,976
So,

360
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:50,183
how do you feel about entering the palace
for the first time as a companion child?

361
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,670
I like it.

362
00:30:57,485 --> 00:31:00,201
Don't tell me that's the end of it?

363
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:00,958
Yes.

364
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,455
What is that?

365
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:06,446
I was very worried and curious about

366
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:08,205
how you'd be in the palace.

367
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,834
I was anticipating your return all day.

368
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,600
It's so uninteresting the way you put it.

369
00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:18,617
I saw brother in the palace.

370
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:20,464
Why would you have seen me?

371
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:21,630
That's a secret.

372
00:31:21,894 --> 00:31:22,586
What?

373
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,100
His Majesty has asked us not to talk about palace matters.

374
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,300
So, don't try to ask.

375
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,444
Yeom, you have lots to learn.

376
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:35,972
You're right.

377
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:40,733
And, I was worried about having 
to send you to the palace.

378
00:31:41,305 --> 00:31:43,537
Seems like I worried for nothing.

379
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:48,222
Compared to anyone else's daughter,

380
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:49,860
I think that

381
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:53,299
my daughter is the most virtuous.

382
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:55,707
To me, my father is the best.

383
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:57,709
You're really...

384
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,447
The relationship between father and daughter is so close

385
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,470
that I'm getting jealous.

386
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:03,816
Yeom,

387
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:07,137
compared to anyone else's son,

388
00:32:07,346 --> 00:32:11,799
I think that you're the most dashing. 
 - Yes, Mother.

389
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,200
To me, you're the best too.

390
00:32:21,951 --> 00:32:22,534
Seol,

391
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:23,634
it's me.

392
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,300
I'm sorry, Miss. 
I didn't do it on purpose.

393
00:32:36,173 --> 00:32:38,559
Where did you get that wooden stick from?

394
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:41,221
It's just

395
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,300
something that I made when I had time.

396
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:46,219
But,

397
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:48,693
what are you doing here, Miss?

398
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:49,661
Oh!

399
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:52,729
Actually,

400
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:55,687
there's something I want to ask you about. 
 - What is it?

401
00:32:57,362 --> 00:33:01,387
If someone receives a letter from another person,

402
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:04,213
and, she doesn't understand 
the meaning of the letter . . .

403
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:05,852
What's the content?

404
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,200
"I couldn't sleep because of you."

405
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:11,182
"I'll send someone soon, so I'll see you then."

406
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,800
It sounds like a threatening letter to fight it out.

407
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:18,671
But, did someone sent from his side come to find you?

408
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:21,695
He did come for me,

409
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:27,023
but I told him I'm not the person. 
-What a fool! You've just made things worse.

410
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,600
At a time like that, you have to face things straight up.

411
00:33:30,202 --> 00:33:35,238
-Will something bad happen? 
-It'd be more than that. 
You've avoided the challenge 
by becoming a coward and a liar!

412
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,500
That's the worst situation. I'm afraid that something horrible will happen.

413
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:10,582
Do you think that

414
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,200
I'm threatening you?

415
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,465
Are you not?

416
00:34:19,246 --> 00:34:20,269
Well,

417
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:23,337
what do you think?

418
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:26,834
If I say you're not,

419
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,000
will you send someone again?

420
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,900
If I do so,

421
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,100
will you meet me?

422
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,300
Will you meet me?

423
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:41,957
I want to

424
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:45,861
meet you once.

425
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:50,150
But, will you

426
00:34:51,778 --> 00:34:53,746
send someone again?

427
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,767
Are you having a good time with your companions?

428
00:35:16,207 --> 00:35:16,856
Yes,

429
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,187
I especially like her.

430
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:24,626
Father, it's Bo Kyung.

431
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:26,275
Come in.

432
00:35:42,022 --> 00:35:43,770
- Did you ask for me?

433
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,507
Did you do something which displeased the princess in the palace today?

434
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:53,709
No, I never did such a thing.

435
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,788
Then, why can't you get the princess to like you?

436
00:35:58,152 --> 00:36:00,131
Yet, you still dare to cry?!

437
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,521
That's because I'm not Teacher Heo's sister.

438
00:36:04,027 --> 00:36:04,642
What?

439
00:36:05,236 --> 00:36:08,656
The princess likes Teacher Heo.

440
00:36:09,107 --> 00:36:12,703
That's why she has taken a liking to his sister.

441
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:15,935
It's not just the princess.

442
00:36:17,848 --> 00:36:22,555
Someone from the royal family, by the name of 
Lee Hwon, even wrote a letter.

443
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,172
There isn't anyone, in the palace, on my side.

444
00:36:25,469 --> 00:36:26,800
Everyone is on her side.

445
00:36:27,371 --> 00:36:29,136
- How am I

446
00:36:29,136 --> 00:36:33,203
Just now
what did you say?

447
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,700
What?

448
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,500
Did you say there's someone from the royal family who sent a letter to her?

449
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:42,906
I'm not very sure, but

450
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,400
Lee was written as the surname...

451
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,200
What's the name of the royal person who wrote?

452
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:51,901
Lee Hwon.

453
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:54,249
I am certain that

454
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,000
'Lee Hwon' is written on the letter.

455
00:37:00,243 --> 00:37:01,584
Letter?

456
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,900
The Crown Prince already knows how
to write a love letter at his age?

457
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:08,564
The Crown Prince who has always stayed in the palace,

458
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,390
how could he know her such that 
he would send her a letter?

459
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:12,974
Isn't her brother

460
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
at Sigangwon?

461
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,966
Heo Yeong Jae is

462
00:37:18,457 --> 00:37:20,194
really opposing us in many ways.

463
00:37:20,314 --> 00:37:21,107
But his daughter

464
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:23,537
is indeed smart.

465
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,286
Don't worry.

466
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:31,301
You don't have to worry even if the Crown Prince has a liking for the child.

467
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,555
A marriage for the sake of the nation

468
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,900
is not about whether one likes the bride or not.

469
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,200
I'm telling you this, because it's not just about the feelings of the Crown Prince.

470
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,900
The way His Majesty looks when he sees that child . . .

471
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,100
shows that he likes her, too.

472
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:49,795
What's the reason for him to call for Heo Yeong Jae's son

473
00:37:50,257 --> 00:37:53,633
and daughter into the palace?

474
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,400
He wants to rid external influence.

475
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,900
We have to rush the national marriage.

476
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:01,052
National marriage?

477
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:03,669
We can't tell when

478
00:38:04,307 --> 00:38:07,001
Kyotae Palace will have a change in ownership.

479
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:09,410
Since the time is perfect,

480
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,334
we have to strike now.

481
00:38:13,516 --> 00:38:15,430
The time is perfect?

482
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:19,180
That's such a nice word.

483
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:23,161
You will instruct the other officials.

484
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,242
I shall instruct the internal attendants.

485
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,900
I accept your order.

486
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,900
Nanny, help me to arrange my hair.

487
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:53,646
You've already spent a long time
dressing up yourself.

488
00:38:53,855 --> 00:38:56,505
- You can't be any later. 
 - Don't worry.

489
00:38:57,858 --> 00:39:00,739
My father said that he would speak to them.

490
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:02,565
It's fine now, Miss.

491
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:05,005
Come and fetch me on time.

492
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:07,865
Let's go.

493
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:15,848
Father,

494
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,211
I...

495
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,521
I want to live in the palace.

496
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
Please help me so I can live in the palace.

497
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:43,830
I'm from the Eastern Palace.

498
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:47,015
The Crown Prince asked

499
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,900
to meet with

500
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,096
you privately.

501
00:40:20,035 --> 00:40:24,906
The Crown Prince's back is where his charm lies.

502
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,900
You should show your back to the door

503
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,300
and slowly turn to face the door.

504
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,000
And then put on a smile on your face.

505
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:39,687
You'll be able to conquer

506
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,700
the heart of any woman.

507
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,600
I finally get to see you.

508
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:43,860
That's right.

509
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:46,455
I think you should know

510
00:41:47,577 --> 00:41:48,863
that I'm not an official,

511
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,300
but this country, Joseon's

512
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,200
Crown Prince.

513
00:42:14,904 --> 00:42:17,170
Although I don't know what happened,

514
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,700
I haven't been able to forget how

515
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,700
you look since that day.

516
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:26,931
Upon hearing that you're entering the palace,

517
00:42:27,513 --> 00:42:28,481
I wanted to try to

518
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,000
meet you

519
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:32,495
again, somehow.

520
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,300
You're thoughtless.

521
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,700
It's so difficult for us to meet,

522
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
won't you let me see your face?

523
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,646
Who are you?!

524
00:42:57,072 --> 00:42:58,006
What?

525
00:42:58,446 --> 00:43:00,756
Didn't I ask who are you to be here?

526
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,300
I'm Minister of Home Office, 
Yoon Dae Hyeong's daughter,

527
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,826
Yoon Bo Kyung.

528
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,000
Your attendant said you asked for me.

529
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:12,032
I thought...

530
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:13,451
I'm sorry.

531
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,693
Yes?

532
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,500
It was a mistake.

533
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,000
Crown Prince...

534
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,000
How's it?

535
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,500
The bracelet I made is prettier, isn't it?

536
00:44:20,386 --> 00:44:20,914
That's right.

537
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:24,862
The bracelet that you made is much prettier.

538
00:44:27,117 --> 00:44:28,095
This...

539
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:30,358
Ask me who am I

540
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:31,810
giving this to.

541
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:34,724
Who are you giving it to?

542
00:44:38,914 --> 00:44:41,300
- Teacher Heo. 
 - What?!

543
00:44:42,357 --> 00:44:44,788
For whom did you make yours?

544
00:44:45,107 --> 00:44:45,997
I wanted to

545
00:44:46,327 --> 00:44:48,043
give it to my brother too.

546
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:51,474
No,

547
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:53,124
I want to give it

548
00:44:53,508 --> 00:44:54,729
to your brother.

549
00:44:55,773 --> 00:44:57,731
You give it to my brother.

550
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,826
Won't that be fair then?

551
00:44:59,826 --> 00:45:04,120
Crown Prince?
Crown Prince? How dare I?

552
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:05,968
I will pass it to him,

553
00:45:06,392 --> 00:45:07,667
so give it to me.

554
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:10,548
I will redo this again.

555
00:45:11,747 --> 00:45:13,705
This is so badly done.

556
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:15,640
Up to you.

557
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:28,443
Hi!

558
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,300
Upon hearing that you're entering the palace,

559
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,800
I wanted to try to

560
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,600
meet you again somehow.

561
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,300
What? The Crown Prince met 
Minister of Home Office's daughter?

562
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,286
Are you sure it's the Minister 
of Home Office's daughter?

563
00:45:59,406 --> 00:46:00,430
Not the Chief Scholar's daughter?

564
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,488
I saw it clearly with both eyes;
the two of them exiting Eunwol Pavilion.

565
00:46:05,434 --> 00:46:07,468
I don't think he's just being concerned.

566
00:46:07,908 --> 00:46:09,855
Then, could it be that they knew each other previously?

567
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:12,981
If it's the Minister of Home Office's daughter, isn't she the Queen Dowager's relative?

568
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:15,929
It could be that the Queen Dowager introduced them previously.

569
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,200
What did you just say?

570
00:46:21,064 --> 00:46:23,198
Won't you tell me immediately?

571
00:46:25,078 --> 00:46:27,585
Are you finding an excuse now?

572
00:46:27,705 --> 00:46:30,101
I'm really being wronged.

573
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:32,309
When I asked her, she specifically said herself

574
00:46:32,429 --> 00:46:34,629
that she's not the sister of Teacher Heo.

575
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:37,558
Why would she tell such a lie?

576
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:39,564
If you ask that,

577
00:46:40,206 --> 00:46:42,092
I don't have an answer.

578
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:44,353
She has no reason to avoid me.

579
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,547
If you're really asking that...

580
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,725
What's that?!

581
00:46:57,927 --> 00:47:00,048
I drew out the thoughts that

582
00:47:00,573 --> 00:47:02,341
a young lady, such as Heo Yeon Woo, would have.

583
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:03,705
Her thoughts?

584
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:04,470
Yes.

585
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:06,564
First, it's her brother,

586
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:07,840
Teacher Heo.

587
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:10,065
I'm sure he occupies 70% of her thoughts.

588
00:47:10,481 --> 00:47:11,801
70%?

589
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:17,194
She grew up with someone, who's a rare talent and is good in many respects.

590
00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:19,103
So, any regular man would not

591
00:47:19,472 --> 00:47:21,592
be able to catch her attention.

592
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,004
And, you can't belittle the charm of Prince Yang Myung

593
00:47:25,124 --> 00:47:26,940
and Kim Jae Woon who studies in

594
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:32,715
the same school as Teacher Heo. 
Prince Yang Myung who has a cool character,
and is always cheerful would stand 20%.

595
00:47:33,155 --> 00:47:36,199
And the cold man, Kim Jae Woon, 
who's good at whatever he does,

596
00:47:36,594 --> 00:47:38,011
stands 10%.

597
00:47:39,242 --> 00:47:40,272
Cold man?

598
00:47:40,392 --> 00:47:43,245
That's the shorten version of the nickname,
given by the palace maids.

599
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:46,809
for a cold man who stays in the palace.

600
00:47:54,817 --> 00:47:55,574
But,

601
00:47:56,928 --> 00:47:58,996
what's that dot over there?

602
00:48:06,442 --> 00:48:07,753
It's the Crown Prince.

603
00:48:09,873 --> 00:48:12,433
What? You're saying that my presence,

604
00:48:12,697 --> 00:48:14,641
in Yeon Woo's thoughts,
is just that small dot?

605
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:16,567
That... That...

606
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:20,103
That's because geographically, 
you're too unreachable for her.

607
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:24,810
On your first meeting, she mistook you for a thief. And, you even said that you were an official.

608
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:27,170
So, her first impression of you was that of

609
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:30,953
either an official or a thief. 
It'd be nothing more or less than that.

610
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,633
Shut up! Shut up! Shut that mouth of yours up!

611
00:48:39,152 --> 00:48:41,422
I don't want to see you, so face the wall for now.

612
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:48,943
Crown Prince,

613
00:48:49,629 --> 00:48:51,195
I'm His Majesty's attendant.

614
00:48:52,048 --> 00:48:52,787
Come in.

615
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,595
Crown Prince,

616
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:06,123
His Majesty commands your presence.

617
00:49:08,848 --> 00:49:09,965
His Majesty?

618
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:22,463
Why are the guards here

619
00:49:23,457 --> 00:49:25,050
at the Eastern Palace?

620
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:25,859
It's an order.

621
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:29,912
Crown Prince...

622
00:49:30,229 --> 00:49:30,933
Crown Prince!

623
00:49:31,223 --> 00:49:32,129
Crown Prince!

624
00:49:32,728 --> 00:49:33,871
Crown Prince!

625
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:39,157
Crown Prince!

626
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:42,544
Is the rumor true?

627
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:46,195
Is it true that you met Minister of Home Office's daughter?

628
00:49:46,476 --> 00:49:47,919
It's true that I met her.

629
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:50,008
It was a mistake.

630
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,400
No, it was my misunderstanding.

631
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,500
Are you finding an excuse now?

632
00:49:53,879 --> 00:49:54,574
I know that . . .

633
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,014
I shouldn't make any excuses.

634
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:00,857
I just wanted to clear up 
a misunderstanding I had.

635
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:02,608
What kind of misunderstanding is that?

636
00:50:06,523 --> 00:50:07,614
I'm sorry, but

637
00:50:09,552 --> 00:50:11,294
I have someone who I like.

638
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:12,869
What?

639
00:50:13,634 --> 00:50:15,605
I knew that she entered the palace.

640
00:50:16,036 --> 00:50:17,382
And it's true that I asked to

641
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,900
meet her in private.

642
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,800
But, she isn't the Minister of Home Office's daughter.

643
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:25,917
The woman that I like is

644
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,311
Chief Scholar's daughter.

645
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:35,548
I have a woman I like.

646
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,941
She's Chief Scholar's daughter

647
00:50:39,718 --> 00:50:41,328
by the name of Heo Yeon Woo.

648
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,500
Although I can't tell you what happened in detail,

649
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,400
my feelings for her are...

650
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,400
I'll act as though I didn't hear it.

651
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:51,230
But, Father.

652
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,667
You can't forget that you're this country's son.

653
00:50:54,432 --> 00:50:56,060
Because of your recklessness,

654
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,600
this child could be entangled 
in political conflict. 
Why didn't you think about that?!

655
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,532
I will let you off this once.

656
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:08,330
Don't ever disappoint me again.

657
00:51:09,298 --> 00:51:10,010
You understand?

658
00:51:12,124 --> 00:51:12,836
I will

659
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:16,373
remember that.

660
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,200
A department will be created 
to manage your marriage soon.

661
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,500
Just take note of that and return now.

662
00:51:38,523 --> 00:51:39,183
Bo Kyung,

663
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:41,461
are you fine to ride the palanquin now?

664
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,300
Didn't you have dizzy spells riding 
palanquin in the morning?

665
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,500
What has that got to do with  . . .

666
00:51:51,185 --> 00:51:52,610
Ah, that...

667
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:55,568
I'm grateful that you're worried about me.

668
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Actually,

669
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,300
I didn't arrive late because of my dizzy spells.

670
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,400
Why then?

671
00:52:03,127 --> 00:52:04,552
This is a secret.

672
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,200
I met the Crown Prince

673
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,300
at Eunwol Pavilion just then.

674
00:52:17,357 --> 00:52:19,750
He said that he was looking at me from afar.

675
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,400
He wanted to

676
00:52:23,299 --> 00:52:25,965
meet me somehow.

677
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:33,408
You have to keep this a secret.

678
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,200
Recently, the Queen Dowager has been wanting a wife
 for the Crown Prince.

679
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,300
Lee Hwon, the Crown Prince, 
is already 15 years old.

680
00:52:58,106 --> 00:52:59,971
It's time he is wed.

681
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,300
Give me your thoughts, my subjects.

682
00:53:02,734 --> 00:53:05,849
What you say is correct.

683
00:53:06,262 --> 00:53:08,145
I think so too.

684
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,900
We need to hurry a national marriage 
and tidy up national ties.

685
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,100
Minister of Rites, hear my command.

686
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,600
No matter what family they are from, 
as long as they are ladies between
ages 12 to 16,

687
00:53:21,246 --> 00:53:23,639
issue an order banning all marriages.

688
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,776
As you have commanded.

689
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,200
And, there will be a ghost haunting ceremony tonight,

690
00:53:30,492 --> 00:53:32,261
everyone is invited.

691
00:53:32,718 --> 00:53:34,574
Yes, Your Majesty.

692
00:53:36,803 --> 00:53:37,753
Crown Prince,

693
00:53:38,113 --> 00:53:40,102
the ceremony will soon begin.

694
00:53:40,506 --> 00:53:42,287
-You have to rush to get yourself changed and...

695
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:43,183
Hyung Sun.

696
00:53:43,183 --> 00:53:44,122
Yes, Crown Prince.

697
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,800
What kind of flower is this?

698
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,700
First, let me take a look at it.

699
00:54:03,316 --> 00:54:04,152
This is

700
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:06,782
not a flower,

701
00:54:08,146 --> 00:54:09,430
but lettuce.

702
00:54:11,797 --> 00:54:12,685
Lettuce?

703
00:54:13,556 --> 00:54:13,970
Yes.

704
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,219
Lettuce?

705
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:23,947
Why did she send me selada?

706
00:54:29,714 --> 00:54:30,418
Now,

707
00:54:31,694 --> 00:54:33,814
I'll never be able to find the answer.

708
00:54:37,764 --> 00:54:38,468
Discard it.

709
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:40,667
What?

710
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,000
Because of your recklessness,

711
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,600
this child could be entangled
in political conflict. 
Why didn't you think about that?!

712
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:25,480
For the rites,

713
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,100
we have to enter the palace soon.

714
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,600
Although I have permission from the Queen Dowager,

715
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:33,972
we have to be cautious and ensure that we're not spotted by others.

716
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:35,433
Yes, Mistress.

717
00:56:43,726 --> 00:56:44,474
But,

718
00:56:44,747 --> 00:56:47,236
for whom are we doing the offering?

719
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,900
Prince Hwi Sung's mother.

720
00:56:50,062 --> 00:56:52,270
I heard that a couple of years back,

721
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,942
there was a ghost at the place 
where she used to live.

722
00:56:54,241 --> 00:56:56,344
That's why, every year,

723
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,300
we perform this ritual, as ordered by the Queen.

724
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,200
Please run away.

725
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,300
This is not a fate that

726
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,300
you can bear.

727
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,900
Don't build up any more feelings for him.

728
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,000
The chance for you to escape is now.

729
01:01:31,246 --> 01:01:33,621
Don't build up any more feelings for him.

730
01:01:37,105 --> 01:01:39,410
The chance for you to escape is now.

731
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,078
You have to run

732
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:45,729
as much as you can, while you can escape.

733
01:03:28,068 --> 01:03:28,711
Can you

734
01:03:30,593 --> 01:03:31,887
tell who I am?

735
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,295
Tell me who

736
01:03:44,063 --> 01:03:45,339
I am.

737
01:03:48,842 --> 01:03:50,628
You're this country, Joseon's...

738
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:56,478
Crown Prince,

739
01:03:57,543 --> 01:03:58,026
Lee

740
01:03:59,357 --> 01:04:00,078
Hwon.

741
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,600
You asked me to forget you . . .

742
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,000
You hope that I'd forget you . . .

743
01:05:01,378 --> 01:05:02,407
I'm sorry.

744
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,400
Though I tried to forget you . . .

745
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,300
But, I coudn't forget you.
