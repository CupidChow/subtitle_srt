1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,600
Do you recognize me?

2
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,500
Who are you?

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,600
Arrest him.

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,200
Yes!

5
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,310
Who are you to dare touch me?

6
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,110
I, am the former king's eldest son,
Prince Yang Myeong.

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,920
Your Excellency.

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,920
Do you recognize me?

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,620
We met at the market previously...

10
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,630
Please let go, sir.

11
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,530
Quickly, take her away.

12
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,740
Wait!

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,640
Wait a minute.

14
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,550
Do you know whose way
you are blocking?

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,760
<i>It can't be! Can't be!</i>

16
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,680
My lord, please go back.

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,580
You shouldn't be doing this.

18
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,380
What are you saying I can't do?

19
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,590
She's only a living talisman
who blocks evil energy.

20
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,290
How can you have feelings
towards a talisman?

21
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm a person whose existence is no better
than a piece of paper, so it doesn't matter.

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,400
This girl is not fated to be with you, my lord.

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,600
Who determined this fate?

24
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,310
As the Head Shaman, I am only
conveying advice from God.

25
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,510
That is not for God to decide, but me.

26
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,520
Not only you My Lord,
the girl will also be in danger.

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,230
That girl could become the target of the politicians.
My Lord, can't you understand that?

28
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,930
Please do not come to find her again.

29
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,630
Please don't be infatuated with her.

30
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,140
If you have any feelings for her...

31
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,540
please just stay away from her.

32
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,050
Answer me!

33
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,860
Did you not hear me?
Tell me where were you born.

34
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm not sure but,
I heard I was born far away from the city.

35
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,170
Then, have you lived in Hanyang
from childhood?

36
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,470
I've followed my Godmother to
many different places.

37
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,470
Your parents, brothers.
Where are they?

38
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,680
I don't have any family.

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,580
The people I have grown up
with are my only family.

40
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,780
Then, you're an orphan.

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,390
I might have been one in the past, but...

42
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,290
to become a shaman,
one must forget about their past life.

43
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,590
I have already forgotten.

44
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,700
Then you weren't an orphan
in the first place.

45
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,900
Can you remember what kind
of people your family were?

46
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,700
Do you remember?

47
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,510
A shaman... when she receives
that gift from God,

48
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,310
she ought to forget her past life.

49
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:11,320
I don't think of my past life,
or past memories.

50
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,830
Then you've forgotten all of your memories?

51
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,530
That's right.

52
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,330
Then, break that seal.
Try to remember your past.

53
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,840
Where did you grow up?

54
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,240
What was your name before
becoming a shaman?

55
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Your Majesty.

56
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
When did you get your gift,
from who and where?

57
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,540
Who gave it to you?

58
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,750
Could it be that I didn't exist
in the memories of your previous life?

59
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,250
Please don't ask again, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,360
I humbly request Your Majesty...

61
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,260
I beg Your Majesty,
please do not ask anymore.

62
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,270
Regardless of what Your Majesty has asked,

63
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,670
I can't give the answers that you seek,

64
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:08,180
because I'm not the person
Your Majesty thinks I am.

65
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
I don't know how much I resemble her,

66
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,990
but if you insist on asking,

67
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:25,100
please, ask her directly.

68
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,010
Didn't you hear.
I told you to leave immediately.

69
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,210
Shinmu, I know I was wrong.

70
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,910
I know I was wrong.

71
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,410
Since you went out, you shouldn't return.

72
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,620
How dare you come back
after disobeying me.

73
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,320
I don't have anywhere to go.

74
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,120
Please don't cast me out.

75
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,630
I've always told you not to
use your power casually.

76
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,830
Why is it...
why is it that you never listen.

77
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,530
You... are no longer
a shaman in the palace.

78
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,840
Leave the Celestial Hall immediately.

79
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,540
Do you hear?

80
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,440
Please forgive me, Shinmu.

81
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,740
Please forgive me!

82
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,750
This isn't the first time Jan Shil
has acted like this.

83
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,550
Why can't you just forget it?

84
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,850
I did it because orabeoni was so pitiful.

85
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,360
Just once...

86
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,060
Just once I wanted to give at
least one thing to him.

87
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,570
His Majesty gets everything, but orabeoni...

88
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,480
<i>Wol, you actually met the King first.</i>

89
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,180
<i>You even chose to stay by
the King's side.</i>

90
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,990
Leave this place immediately.

91
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,890
Immediately!

92
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,510
Mother, why?

93
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,820
Why do you always let me
live only for others?

94
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,840
Prince Yang Myeong.

95
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,940
Why are you here at this late hour?

96
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,350
What about you, Mother?
It's so late, what are you still doing here?

97
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,660
As always, I am praying for the
King's health and safety.

98
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,760
Prince Yang Myeong.

99
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,860
Just once, can't you put aside the King,

100
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,670
and call my name first?

101
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,970
How can you say such disloyal words?

102
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,870
It's disloyal. Hold back. Give it up.
Hide it. Don't waver!

103
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,180
Mother, haven't you said that enough?

104
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,980
Why are you like this?

105
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,880
Even once.

106
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,280
Just once.

107
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:42,090
You can do whatever you want.
You can be selfish at least once.

108
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:46,100
Can't you say that to me just once?

109
00:08:51,400 --> 00:09:00,710
From now on, your son will not
live for other people anymore.

110
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,310
I'll laugh when I want to laugh.

111
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,120
Get angry when I want to.

112
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,020
Steal when I want to.

113
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,620
That's how I will live from now on.

114
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,530
Shinmu.

115
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,030
Let's run away.

116
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,240
Let's run away together.

117
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,140
Jan Sil.

118
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,540
If it were me, I would have
protected you.

119
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,940
If it were me, I wouldn't have
let you become this way.

120
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,640
If it were me...

121
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,350
If you don't shut your mouth,

122
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,350
I will shut it for you.

123
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,460
Shinmu.

124
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,570
What are you all doing?
Quickly, take Jan Shil away now.

125
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,370
Yes, Head Shaman.

126
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
Shinmu. Shinmu.

127
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,080
Shinmu!

128
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,780
Why must you do this, Shinmu?

129
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,190
Whoever dares to let Jan Sil
enter the Celestial Hall,

130
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,190
will be punished according to the
Spiritual Law. Do you understand?

131
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,190
Yes, Head Shaman.

132
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,200
Do you want to be kicked out too?

133
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,400
Shinmu.

134
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,510
Shinmu.

135
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,720
Why are you so harsh on her?

136
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,720
She can't control her power well just like me.
Just accept she made a mistake.

137
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,320
Even if it was a mistake,

138
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,120
don't think about arguing with me.

139
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,730
When you're finished,
go back in and rest.

140
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,630
Shinmu.

141
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,330
Don't bother.

142
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,030
She's trying to teach Jan Shil a lesson.

143
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,430
This is the only way she will learn.

144
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,540
She is a child who can't forget her past.

145
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,540
She has nowhere to go.

146
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,240
We can't let her wander
around in this cold weather.

147
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,240
She'll definitely come back in the end.

148
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,150
Then, Shinmu will let her in.

149
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,250
This isn't the first time this has happened.

150
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,570
Shinmu.

151
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,480
If it's about Jan Sil,
don't talk about it anymore.

152
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,180
Then, I'll also have to leave
the Celestial Hall.

153
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,890
Are you threatening me?

154
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,990
It is not a threat.

155
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,200
Then, are you seriously going to
leave the Celestial Hall?

156
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,300
In the past, you told us you would
protect us if we wanted to go.

157
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,810
You would let me run away with Seol.
You said that once.

158
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,310
Why are you telling me this?

159
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:26,620
I just feel that Seol, Jan Sil

160
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,820
and me...

161
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,620
I've always felt the three of
us don't belong here.

162
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,430
So I am asking this.

163
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,530
Why did you make this decision?

164
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,640
How can you think of leaving?

165
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,350
You were right.

166
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:04,560
I shouldn't have chosen to stay by
His Majesty's side with such a weak resolve.

167
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,370
Now I understand that there's
nothing I can do for him.

168
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,870
I was trying to help to ease
his burden and pain

169
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,270
instead of making him more confused.

170
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,980
I didn't expect my presence

171
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,780
would make him even more confused.

172
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,990
The person he needs,

173
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,390
is not me.

174
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,600
I must leave His Majesty.

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,400
I think this is best for him.

176
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,920
Your Majesty.

177
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,030
You should rest for a while.

178
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,230
You didn't sleep at all last night.

179
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,230
How will you attend the
morning meeting?

180
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,830
<i>I don't know how much I resemble her,</i>

181
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,340
<i>but if you insist on asking,</i>

182
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,340
<i>please, ask her directly.</i>

183
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:36,050
<i>How do I ask a person who
has already died?</i>

184
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:41,750
<i>Father will bring my medicine soon.</i>

185
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:48,060
<i>Afterwards, I'll never be able
to see you again.</i>

186
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,560
Her Father brought her the medicine.

187
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,170
"Afterwards, I'll never be able
to see you again."

188
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,470
Un, what does this mean?

189
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,180
Isn't she writing that she
felt she was going to die?

190
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,180
Initially, that's what I thought.

191
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,380
But...

192
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,680
When you think about it,

193
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,090
don't those words mean that when her father
brought her the medicine, she would die?

194
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,190
But...

195
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,190
her father was well known for
his warm personality,

196
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,790
and had pride in himself.
For someone who was like that,

197
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,600
how could he... to his own daughter?

198
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,200
That's why I think it's strange.

199
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,900
As a matter of fact this isn't
the only strange thing.

200
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,910
For a healthy child to suddenly
die like that.

201
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,010
He didn't even try to investigate,

202
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,810
and just covered it up.

203
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,320
Your Majesty, what do you suspect?

204
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,520
The Crown Princess' death,
wasn't simply because of an illness.

205
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:04,740
Then... Heo Yong Jae became a murderer
and killed his own daughter?

206
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,140
Wouldn't the Uibin know something

207
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,740
about the medicine that Yeon U drank?

208
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,540
He wouldn't know.

209
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,950
At the time, he'd been sent out of town.

210
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,150
He felt very guilty about not being able

211
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,450
to be there for his sister when
she passed away.

212
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,050
Also,

213
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,060
even if he knew, asking him,

214
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,560
would be too cruel.

215
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,180
<i>You want to travel?</i>

216
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,890
<i> Why shouldn't you.</i>

217
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,390
<i>Take a slow tour of the
Yongnam District and take in the scenery.</i>

218
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,390
<i>Take a moment to appreciate the mountains and rivers,
and at the same time sort out your feelings.</i>

219
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,890
<i>There is no other meaning.</i>

220
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,100
<i>Can I come in?</i>

221
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,600
Please do enter, Mother.

222
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,110
Have you prepared enough
clothes for your trip?

223
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,210
Yes.

224
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,310
If you leave now,

225
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,020
I won't see you again for a month.

226
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Yes.

227
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,220
Oh yes, have you bid farewell to
the Princess and His Majesty?

228
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,630
Not yet.

229
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,030
How could you be so thoughtless?

230
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,230
She must be anxiously waiting for you.

231
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,240
Quickly, go and comfort the Princess.

232
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,340
Yes, Mother.

233
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,880
Are you deliberately avoiding me?

234
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,280
I must leave soon, why aren't
you willing to look at me?

235
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,380
Can't I accompany you?

236
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,690
You are a princess.

237
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,190
The journey is too long,
you won't be able to endure it.

238
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,790
But,

239
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,600
if you go, it will be a long time
before I see you again.

240
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,600
I know that you'll be anxiously waiting.

241
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,710
I'll complete my mission as quickly
as possible and hurry back.

242
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,210
What's wrong?

243
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:06,320
I only know how to complain every day,

244
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,520
you must hate me.

245
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
I don't hate you.

246
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,930
Because of me you can't take
up an official post,

247
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,830
and you can't leave home.

248
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,630
Do you find being a Uibin hateful?

249
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,830
Not at all.

250
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,440
You are lying.

251
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,050
You're my family's saviour.

252
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,550
After Yeon U's death,

253
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,850
the one who brought laughter back
into this desolate house,

254
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,650
wasn't it you?

255
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,260
Just based on this one point,
in my heart

256
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,360
I am truly, very thankful.

257
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,060
Then,

258
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,770
you're not going to abandon me?

259
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,370
How can you think that way?

260
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,270
You must promise me.

261
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,670
I've given my whole life to you.

262
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:08,280
What else do you want from me?

263
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,980
I need nothing.

264
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,190
Even if you don't give me anything,

265
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,590
I will still trust you.

266
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,290
The promise that you won't
ever leave my side,

267
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,700
and the promise that you'll
return quickly,

268
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,900
I believe them.

269
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So, even if I cry every night,

270
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,910
I'll stay strong until you come back.

271
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,720
I heard that the Uibin is going
on a trip to Yeongnam.
(Uibin - Princess' Consort)

272
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,920
His Majesty is too much.

273
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,920
Why didn't he send me instead?

274
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Yeongnam is like no other place.

275
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,720
They say the mountains and
rivers are pretty.

276
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,730
Especially Jinju. Their prostitutes are
famous for being both skilled and beautiful.

277
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,630
It is a pity. What a pity!

278
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,140
To have the old-fashioned Uibin
visit that kind of place.

279
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,340
This is completely wasted on him.
How can he understand the
essence of romance?

280
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,150
If the Uibin was as lecherous as you,

281
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,450
we wouldn't have to be this nervous.

282
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:27,260
His Majesty must have told him
to go there and gather the scholars again.

283
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,460
Have you prepared the
things that I asked for?

284
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,270
I will find some documents accusing the Uibin
of misconduct, and send them to the palace.

285
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:43,470
No! There are really documents accusing the
perfect genius Heo Yeom of misconduct?

286
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,980
Where did you get such rare items?

287
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,980
Ah... fabricated?

288
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,890
Everything is good about His Majesty,

289
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,490
it's just that he is too eager.

290
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,290
If we teach him a lesson once,

291
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,300
then it will let him understand what politics is.

292
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,000
Please revoke your royal command
on the Uibin, Your Majesty.

293
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,300
As the saying goes, rumors can
spread a thousand miles in a flash.

294
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,610
It really is fast.

295
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,410
The Uibin has already been
informed of this matter.

296
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,310
Is there a problem?

297
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:27,620
Since ancient times, the Uibin has not
been allowed to participate in politics.

298
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,120
Now, documents accusing the Uibin of participating
in political activities are appearing one by one.

299
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,230
I'm asking Your Majesty to
rescind your order.

300
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,730
The Uibin hasn't left his home
for several years.

301
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,030
This has really worried the Princess.

302
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,430
That's why I let him go on a trip,
to get some fresh air.

303
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:48,340
If it's like that, please order him to
change his destination.

304
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,940
Why is that?

305
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:55,250
For the Uibin to travel to Yeongnam
is extremely dangerous.

306
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,650
Why?

307
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,950
Don't tell me you're afraid
the Uibin's journey

308
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:05,160
will become a political maneuver
to gather Yeongnam's scholars?

309
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,860
We're only thinking of the
Uibin's safety, Your Majesty.

310
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,660
The safety of the Uibin?

311
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,770
Although it's said that the Uibin's
trip is insignificant,

312
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,370
people are still looking for a powerful leader to
follow and may see this as a golden opportunity.

313
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,480
If these people try to join with him
in order to expand their power...

314
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,380
Then he will become a political figure.

315
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,780
Of course, rumors are fearful things.

316
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,990
Throughout history, those people
who flaunt their beliefs,

317
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,990
in the end become the ones who most criticize
the scoundrels of the current political situation.

318
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm just worried about the
country and the people.

319
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,400
I have heard,

320
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,810
that I'm just a puppet who does
as his ministers wish.

321
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,920
This is disloyalty, Your Majesty.

322
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,520
The person that dares to speak such
nonsense should be arrested immediately,

323
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,420
and be punished severely for his crime.

324
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,330
People can say all kinds
of things in private.

325
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,030
Officials also say inappropriate things
when they have a drink together.

326
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,030
Isn't that right?

327
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,550
<i>It wasn't enough to break
off his wings.</i>

328
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:42,150
<i>Now they are threatening
me with his safety.</i>

329
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,760
Your Majesty,

330
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,860
what's wrong?

331
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,360
Un.

332
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,870
Let's get ready to put on a show.

333
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,390
What brings you here,
Your Majesty?

334
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:25,900
Since the last time I came here, the documents
presented to me have decreased rather than
increased. Why is that?

335
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,400
With the severe cold and heavy snow,

336
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,700
the letter that was sent didn't
arrive on time.

337
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,110
Didn't arrive on time?

338
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,210
It seems like it.

339
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:42,010
But how did the documents accusing the
Uibin of misconduct arrive so quickly?

340
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,920
Could it be that a messenger doesn't
carry messages and only carries rumors?

341
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,420
Your Majesty, this is because of...

342
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,430
Although I've participated in
politics for 3 years,

343
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,430
the documents that I've managed,

344
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,130
will never be more than
you've processed.

345
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,540
Your majesty, you have to look
at the political institutions record.

346
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,440
Please give another royal decree...

347
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,640
With my situation this way,

348
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,150
it's not difficult to understand as
to why you would ignore my order!

349
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,150
But...

350
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,550
If my children were to see these
records, what would they think of me?

351
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,350
Tell me!

352
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,860
How will they describe me?

353
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Your... Your Majesty.

354
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,970
<i>As an over-enthusiastic,
incompetent sick person,</i>

355
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:43,470
<i>or a powerless figurehead wrapped
around his ministers' little fingers?</i>

356
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,480
<i>Tell me!</i>

357
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,280
<i>In the records that will be handed
down to future generations,</i>

358
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,780
<i>how will I be evaluated?</i>

359
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,590
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

360
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,290
It isn't enough that you turn
a blind eye and a deaf ear,

361
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,590
you openly defy a royal order?

362
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,100
Not only is this a matter of disrespect,
but also an issue of loyalty.

363
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,000
You must be clear on this.

364
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,550
Did you find any clues?

365
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,660
No. None.

366
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,860
That's strange. How could there
not be even a single clue.

367
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,660
I thought that if I searched the records
detailing Yeon U's death 8 years ago,

368
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,370
I would have been able to find something.

369
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,670
The only information was that
she died of an illness.

370
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,980
But thinking back on this again,
she fell ill too suddenly,

371
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,180
and the timing was too coincidental.

372
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,980
If she had fallen sick before
the selection process,

373
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,590
then the Chief Scholar's family wouldn't
have suffered or been implicated.

374
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,390
If she had fallen sick after the
conferment ceremony,

375
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,700
then she wouldn't have been so
cruelly chased out of the palace.

376
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,100
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

377
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,000
<i>Your Highness, Crown Princess.</i>

378
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,410
Why?

379
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,510
Why did it happen exactly at that time?

380
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,120
Why?

381
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,420
<i>What did you just say?</i>

382
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,720
The shaman resembles someone?

383
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,220
Yes, I am not completely certain,

384
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,130
but that's what I have heard.

385
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,230
Tell me more about this matter.

386
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:26,140
His Majesty was furious and
questioned the shaman intensely,

387
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,840
hoping for a reply from her.

388
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,440
"I don't know whether I look like that her,

389
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,040
but I am not that girl.

390
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:37,150
If there's anything else that you want to ask,
please go and ask that girl."

391
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,050
That's what she said.

392
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,170
What's wrong, Your Highness?

393
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,570
Court Lady Jo.

394
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:11,580
Just now, did you hear the sound of a woman
crying in the Secret Moon Pavilion?

395
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,700
Who is inside?

396
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,010
The Celestial Hall's Shaman is inside.

397
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,410
Celestial Hall's Shaman?

398
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:59,930
As you ordered, I have brought the
consummation date forward.

399
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,830
Really? That is good.

400
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,740
Your spiritual daughter has contributed well.

401
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,940
When the consummation matters
are settled, I will reward her well.

402
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,340
I have something to tell you
about this matter.

403
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,350
Tell me quickly.

404
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:21,850
I was thinking of letting that shaman...
leave the palace.

405
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,650
It's almost the date of
the consummation,

406
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,560
how can we remove the
talisman right now?

407
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,360
This is ridiculous.

408
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,360
His Majesty will slowly recuperate.

409
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,870
He no longer needs the talisman.

410
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,670
Also, if the talisman who blocks evil
continues to stay by his side,

411
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,970
it may have the opposite effect.

412
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,180
But to suddenly remove
that shaman girl,

413
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,680
what if His Majesty's health
begins to decline again?

414
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,480
The most important thing now

415
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,980
is to help His Majesty recover
his health

416
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,790
and to successfully produce an heir.

417
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,990
So, does this mean you have
another method?

418
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:05,600
The talisman to protect His Majesty and
the talisman for a successful consummation,

419
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,400
it can be said that there's a big difference.

420
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,900
So starting tonight,
I would like to give it a try.

421
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,810
I would like to try a talisman that
will allow His Majesty and the
Queen's successful consummation.

422
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:21,410
Consummation talisman?
Is there such a thing?

423
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:28,520
It was a talisman prepared for the
future consummation date.

424
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,830
I understand.

425
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:40,130
As long as it allows the success of the
consummation, anything can be done.

426
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,230
Just do as you see fit.

427
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:48,740
I'll obey your command, Your Highness.

428
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,670
You have come, Your Majesty.

429
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,470
The Great Queen Dowager informed me
that you had returned to the palace.

430
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,270
I heard that ever since your
shaman entered the palace,

431
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,170
His Majesty's health has somewhat improved.

432
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,680
I don't deserve your praise.

433
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:36,390
But, does that shaman resemble
the deceased Heo Yeon U?

434
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,990
Why would you ask that?

435
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:47,200
You can't hide secrets in the palace.

436
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:54,810
His Majesty, who has never looked
any girl straight in the eye,

437
00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:00,310
would never keep her so
easily by his side.

438
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:05,720
Do they really look alike?

439
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,020
In my eyes,
she is just an ordinary girl.

440
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,730
I wish to meet and personally reward her.

441
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,030
When would be a good time?

442
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:25,440
Your complexion isn't so good,
it looks as if you've many worries.

443
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:33,440
How long have you been hearing the sound
of crying coming from the Secret Moon Pavilion?

444
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,350
Please do not worry.

445
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:44,350
My shaman will be leaving
the palace soon.

446
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,560
The consummation date will
also be brought forward.

447
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,960
Everything will be as you desired.

448
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:02,470
You won't need to make any more
requests to the Great Queen Dowager.

449
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,880
The Great Queen Dowager has
already agreed.

450
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,880
From today onwards, you won't have
to enter the main palace.

451
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:23,490
Now everything is as you have wished for.
Why do you look slightly disappointed?

452
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,000
It's not like that.

453
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,300
I just feel that I've always
given you nothing but trouble.

454
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,900
Then go and gather up your things.

455
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,210
Wait until tomorrow morning
and then leave with Seol.

456
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,810
I understand.

457
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,920
Who gave you this?

458
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,520
Do I report to you?

459
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,830
<i>Wol eonni. It's me, Jan Sil.
(Eonnie - older sister)</i>

460
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,630
<i>Were you worried about me?</i>

461
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,240
<i>I was lucky to have the help
of a good person,</i>

462
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,640
<i>and I'm living well now.</i>

463
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,240
<i>What sort of person is he?</i>

464
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:18,650
<i>He's elegant and unconventional,
a good and honest person.</i>

465
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,650
<i>He is a man among men.</i>

466
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,960
<i>He is bold and free-spirited,</i>

467
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,360
<i>but one look at his face and it's certain
that he's a lonely, world-weary traveler.</i>

468
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,260
<i>It doesn't matter. Thanks to him</i>

469
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,670
<i> I'm now staying in a small
tavern in the town.</i>

470
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:40,870
<i>Therefore, could you please help me
and bring my clothes for me.</i>

471
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,070
<i>But you must keep it a
secret from Shinmu.
</i>

472
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,480
<i>Also, don't bring Seol along.</i>

473
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,080
<i>This morning she looked like she
was on the same side as Shinmu.</i>

474
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,120
<i>At the time Father must also
have had his doubts</i>

475
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,930
<i>He must have sent people
to secretly investigate.</i>

476
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:42,430
<i>There must be a secret left by the
political institutions that has yet to be revealed.</i>

477
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,940
<i>We urge you to have the Crown Princess
escorted out of the palace, Your Majesty.</i>

478
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,040
<i>Also, the family members who hid her illness, and
listed her for selection, Minister Heo Young Jae...</i>

479
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,640
<i>...along with Sigangwon Scholar Heo Yeom,
who concealed her illness...</i>

480
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,250
<i>...must take responsibility for their crime.</i>

481
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:01,750
<i>Father will bring my medicine soon.</i>

482
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,060
<i>But now my father is no
longer in this world.</i>

483
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,060
<i>The physician who treated Yeon U,</i>

484
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,160
<i> killed himself with poison
after Father passed away.</i>

485
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,260
<i>Yeon U drank unknown medicine
given by the Chief Scholar,</i>

486
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,370
<i>who has also passed away
due to illness.</i>

487
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,070
<i>All the people who knew the
facts are no longer around.</i>

488
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:25,180
<i>None of them are still alive.</i>

489
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,980
<i>The only one who is still alive,</i>

490
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:41,690
<i>is the official who was serving
meals by my father's side.</i>

491
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:45,400
Un.

492
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:03,210
Suddenly asking me to build a snowman.

493
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,520
Your Majesty.

494
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,320
It's me, Hyeong Seon.

495
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,930
I have followed your orders.
The snowman is ready.

496
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:26,040
Your Majesty.

497
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:40,650
Your Majesty!

498
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,950
What's wrong?

499
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,560
You still don't understand?

500
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,860
Is the house of the former official over there?

501
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

502
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:03,370
What? Did  His Majesty send you here?

503
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,180
Is the Master at home?

504
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:13,680
The... master isn't feeling well and
has gone out to receive treatment.

505
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,490
How could he be this disrespectful?

506
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:19,390
His Majesty already informed him that
he has urgent matters to discuss with him.

507
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:25,400
<i>So, how long will your master
be receiving treatment?</i>

508
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,300
Will he be gone a long time
or returning immediately?

509
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,600
That... I'm not sure.

510
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,210
Well, when your master returns,
let him know

511
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:42,410
that no matter how much he tries to hide,
the truth will eventually come out.

512
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:48,420
Even if he's able to hide now,
in the future he'll have to assume
responsibility for an even greater crime.

513
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,420
Today we'll just go back.

514
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,220
If he doesn't come to the
palace to see me tomorrow,

515
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,930
it won't be him coming into the palace to see me,
but him being dragged into the palace for punishment.

516
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,630
Pass this on to him on my behalf.

517
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,940
You're fully aware that he's in the house.
Why didn't you just speak to him?

518
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,750
For 8 years he has kept his
mouth closed tightly.

519
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:19,550
If a loyal servant like him has been
hiding from me for this long,

520
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,550
it must have been father that
ordered him to hide the truth.

521
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,060
If we had been aggressive
and provoked him,

522
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,860
we wouldn't have been able to
get the information we wanted.

523
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:37,570
I only came today to confirm if
my guess was right or wrong.

524
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:44,170
Can I ask what you're thinking?

525
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:51,380
Miss Yeon U's death was definitely
not simply because of illness.

526
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,090
Father must have some hidden
records or notes somewhere.

527
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,690
Hidden records...

528
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,490
If it wasn't death from illness but murder,

529
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:08,300
then why would Father hide
the truth about it?

530
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,500
He certainly had his reasons.

531
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:20,110
Therefore, he decided to bury
these reasons somewhere.

532
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:24,510
Un, right now my head hurts.

533
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:30,120
It's not easy to come out on a trip.
Let's take a walk.

534
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,230
Please come again.

535
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:52,240
After you've finished eating,
just return to the Celestial Hall.

536
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,640
Are you all right?

537
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:59,050
Orabeoni, I don't know whether
I can return to the Celestial Hall.

538
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,350
You can't just wander the
streets because you're scared.

539
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,360
Listen to your Orabeoni. Go back now,
kneel down and beg sincerely.

540
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,160
This method will definitely work.

541
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,460
Even if I want to, I don't think I'll be
able to kneel and beg for forgiveness.

542
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,770
Once I return, I'll definitely be torn to pieces.

543
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,470
You have such a beautiful face, why do
you say things that are unpleasant to hear?

544
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,380
Shinmu, she is definitely someone
who does what she says.

545
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,380
No matter how I think about it, I don't
think I can come away unscathed from this.

546
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,990
Since you're such a coward,

547
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,590
why did you risk being torn to pieces
to come and help me?

548
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,190
Because you're the first...

549
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:52,700
Because you're the first person
to risk your own life to save mine.

550
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,810
My parents abandoned me,
I don't remember their faces at all.

551
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:05,620
But you, Orabeoni, who helped me escape,
I have never forgotten your face.

552
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,620
At this point, you and I have
had a similar experience.

553
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,830
So you were also abandoned
by your parents, Orabeoni?

554
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,330
Do you also have someone you can't
forget even after their death?

555
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,830
That... almost.

556
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:26,240
The person whom Orabeoni can't forget even after her death,

557
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
What kind of person is she?

558
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,350
Extremely bright,

559
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,350
and very beautiful.

560
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,560
Just by seeing her my heart
would feel at ease.

561
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,560
Although she made me feel great pain,

562
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:02,670
she was also the one who made me happy.

563
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,680
If I'd known earlier, I wouldn't have
asked Wol eonni to come here.

564
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,780
What did you just say?

565
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,690
I wanted both of you to meet,
so I asked Wol eonni to come.

566
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,410
<i>Why are you suddenly looking at letter papers, agassi?</i>

567
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,920
<i>Do you want to write a letter?</i>

568
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,620
<i> It's not a letter, but a reflection of fault.</i>

569
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,120
<i>What? What type of reflection needs
to be written on such expensive paper?</i>

570
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,830
<i>Wouldn't it be alright as long as you go find him, and beg for forgiveness?</i>

571
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,040
<i>I'm sorry, Agassi.</i>

572
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,240
<i> I'm going to the blacksmith for a bit, I'll be back in a moment.</i>

573
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,350
<i>Hurry and escape.</i>

574
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,760
<i>It's not a fate that you can endure.</i>

575
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,060
<i>Don't form any more ties with him.</i>

576
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,160
<i>Do you recognize me?</i>

577
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,970
<i>Did you hope I'd forget you?</i>

578
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,610
You are all walking too slowly.

579
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,210
Quickly, quickly.

580
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:30,820
Who said that when you're in Jinju you
must see the number 1 famous courtesan.

581
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,120
With a spacious wine room, an open lodge
and a magnificent wine table,

582
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:39,030
if there's really a human paradise,
then there's no other place then there.

583
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,030
With the current political situation,

584
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,530
you still think of going there?

585
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,740
You really are optimistic,
Minister of Finance.

586
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,640
If you don't want to come,
Minister of Military Affairs,
you can always leave.

587
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,050
But this type of road isn't
a place that's just for drinking.

588
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,650
In a completely new atmosphere,
maybe I can come up with a new idea.

589
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,850
Let us just go and have a look.

590
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,960
Then I will go first to inquire.

591
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,060
You should all come soon afterwards.

592
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,270
Why are you here?

593
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,280
Ah, you said you came out
because you had business.

594
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,280
I'm on a private undercover visit.

595
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,590
I think I said that earlier.

596
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,490
You didn't even bring your guard,
did you leave the palace alone?

597
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,700
Although we can't see him, Un is
always watching from somewhere.

598
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,700
But..

599
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:58,410
As a talisman, can you wander around
the streets like this during the day?

600
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:59,610
Pardon?

601
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:05,620
No wonder I ached all over
when I woke up today.

602
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,920
Finally I know the reason.

603
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,720
The shaman who is my talisman goes around
everywhere and infects me with bad air.

604
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,420
How can I not have a headache?

605
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,530
Does Your Majesty feel ill?

606
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,040
I was only joking.

607
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,840
Can't you tell that I'm joking?

608
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:36,250
That's a relief.

609
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,060
I may be disrupting your private visit,
so I shall leave first.

610
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:56,870
Wait a minute.

611
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,590
Minister Yun and his people
are coming this way.

612
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,990
Before we run into him,
please return to the palace immediately.

613
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,690
I know.

614
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,620
You disrespectful brat.

615
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,320
What are you going to do?

616
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,620
What should I do?

617
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,520
Do you know how expensive
this robe is?

618
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,630
It's made from the highest quality
silk meant for the royal palace.

619
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,730
How exactly will you compensate me?

620
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,530
Sorry, please forgive me.

621
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,230
There you go again.

622
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:07,540
I hate people who hope to
solve problems with their mouths.

623
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,640
Don't just use your mouth,
use your body to repay me.

624
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,540
Bring him back. Let him
chop firewood or something.

625
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,350
Chop a lot.

626
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,050
Yes.

627
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,450
Please release that child.

628
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,750
In such a busy and crowded marketplace,

629
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,360
it's inevitable that people bump
into each other.

630
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,760
This child didn't do it deliberately.

631
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,660
Please forgive him.

632
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,470
This robe is priceless,
you cannot wash it using water.

633
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:42,570
That's why I want him to compensate me. If he can't,
then he should become my household servant.

634
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,680
What exactly is the problem?

635
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,180
You seem to be a respected nobleman.

636
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,480
You have sharp eyes.

637
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,180
I am the Minister of Finance.

638
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:59,090
Since you are so highly respected,
you should be more compassionate and kind.

639
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:00,990
You, this woman...!

640
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,290
I thought you were pretty and was
originally thinking of letting you go this time.

641
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,500
How dare you speak nonsense
in front of me.

642
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Also these clothes.

643
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,600
As a high-ranking official of this country,

644
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,100
you don't even use material
made in this country,

645
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,210
but imported silk.

646
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,010
What would the common people think?

647
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,010
What did you say? This woman...

648
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:26,020
What are you standing around for?
Hurry up and get her!

649
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:26,620
Yes.

650
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,020
Please let go!

651
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,220
This brat!

652
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,830
Grab hold of him!

653
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:39,630
Grab hold of him!
Grab hold of him!

654
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,150
What is it?

655
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,750
<i>His Majesty.</i>

656
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,560
You are just an ordinary woman,
how can you be so bold?

657
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,470
How dare you argue with him?
If you were caught and taken away,

658
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,170
you think you can still live?

659
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:21,970
So if I see something wrong
should I turn a blind eye?

660
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,970
That child made the
Minister's clothes dirty,

661
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,880
it's understandable he asked
for compensation.

662
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,180
Do you know how expensive silk is?

663
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:38,090
Isn't it true that the higher a noble person ranks,
the more frugal and unassuming he should be?

664
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:41,390
That is correct.

665
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:48,000
But, rather than respecting social status, a person
should maintain a basic to give an example.

666
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,200
During the reign of King Sejong,
there was a bureaucrat named Yu Gwan.

667
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,700
Although he held a high position
in the palace,

668
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,510
he lived in a hut without a fence.

669
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:01,310
For his sake, King Sejong built a wall.

670
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:07,520
Being officials in the court,
they cannot refuse to open the door.

671
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,220
What were his intentions?

672
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:17,130
It means to lead by example,
to have the people together and to be frugal.

673
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,030
You, this shaman...

674
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:26,540
Why is it that all the words you speak are true,
but unpleasant to hear?

675
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,140
A sturdy tree can be broken by the wind.

676
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,840
If you continue on like this,
be careful of your life...

677
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,550
I am talking to you.
How dare you look elsewhere...

678
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:58,070
Come. Come. Come. Don't secretly look.

679
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,770
Come over and watch the show for yourself!

680
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:02,470
Or else your eyes may end up slanted.

681
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:05,380
It's a new hit about the
first love of a servant girl.

682
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,380
In fact, the front seats are still available.

683
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,780
How is it? Do you want to see it?

684
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,480
Do not hesitate any longer.

685
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,590
If you continue to hesitate,
the good seats will be taken.

686
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:20,290
Come with me. You won't regret it.

687
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,600
Move aside! Move aside!

688
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,400
What do you think?

689
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,300
This is a good seat.

690
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,500
Then...

691
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:36,510
5 nyang.

692
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:40,810
5 nyang.

693
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,420
This is for you.

694
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,020
Thank you...

695
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,320
All in all, 10 nyang, that's correct.

696
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,030
Both of you, please enjoy the show!

697
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:23,450
How unlucky, now I am in your debt.

698
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,060
Once I return to the palace,
I will pay you back.

699
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,960
Do not worry.

700
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,670
I've committed a wrong.

701
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,770
Please don't be like this.

702
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:47,580
What wrong have you commited?

703
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,980
I didn't recognize His Majesty,
who is as royal as the heavens, at first sight,

704
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,590
yet I fell in love with you.

705
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:56,490
That's the first one.

706
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:00,690
When I knew of your status,
I was unable to control my affection
and I even entered the palace.

707
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,190
- That is the second one.
- Please remove your hat.

708
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,900
Please remove your hat.
We can't see anything.

709
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,300
We can't see anything because we're sitting behind you.
How can you be like this?

710
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,100
- Don't say anymore, don't say anymore.
- I can't watch anymore, shaking from side to side like this.

711
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,810
- Do you want to cut all ties,
forget it all and break my heart?
- Put your arm down.

712
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:20,510
How could this only be your fault?

713
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:21,910
Do you know who I am?

714
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:25,520
Just because you're a nobleman,
does that make you great?
You've got to let us watch the show!

715
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:33,820
<i>Dong Ju... if I could
give up everything, if I could...</i>

716
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,130
<i>Why would His Majesty say that?</i>

717
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:40,030
No, even if I were to sit on this royal position
above thousands of others,

718
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:44,230
if I am unable to have you, my love,

719
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:48,840
<i>what meaning does this royal position have? </i>

720
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,040
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

721
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,640
<i>I am terrified.</i>

722
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,750
Do you think such vulgar performances
and play is interesting?

723
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,950
- <i>Your Majesty, these words...<i>
- Yes, it is nice.

724
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:04,660
<i>I will forever remember it.</i>

725
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:08,560
<i>Your Majesty, please protect your royal health.</i>

726
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,960
<i>I wish you a 100 years of long marriage,
Your Highness the Queen.</i>

727
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:40,990
It's already so late.
Why isn't she here yet?

728
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:45,100
Could it be that the road directions
were not clearly stated?

729
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,930
Third,

730
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:27,240
<i>Speak no further.
Do not say anything more.</i>

731
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:33,840
Have you met her yet?

732
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:44,050
Ever...have you ever met her?

733
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:51,760
I was unable... to meet her.

734
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:55,270
Why couldn't you meet her?

735
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:07,080
Why... aren't you able to meet her?

736
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:15,590
Because she... is no longer in this world.

737
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,890
How could this...

738
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,300
It is all my fault.

739
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,800
Although I was determined to protect her,

740
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,610
I failed to do so.

741
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:41,110
There are so many things
that I wanted to tell her.

742
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:46,520
But I was unable to tell her.

743
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,320
Therefore,

744
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,520
until now...

745
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,330
I was unable to let her go.

746
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:08,040
I heard that shamans can
communicate with the dead.

747
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,540
Is that true?

748
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:17,650
As far as I know, yes.

749
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,350
Could you

750
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:25,760
help me to tell her?

751
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,760
What do you want to tell her?

752
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:37,770
Tell her that I really...

753
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:43,370
really...

754
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,180
liked her.

755
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:36,430
-= Preview for the next episode. =-

756
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:40,630
Tonight, I won't be able to protect and be by your side, Your Majesty.

757
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:43,230
Seeing other people giving you looks of affection,

758
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,240
I can't endure it any longer.

759
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,740
Do you mean that I can't?

760
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:51,140
The person that I have
always been looking at...

761
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,340
is you.

762
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,500
Who gives you the permission to leave the palace?

763
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,450
Who has allowed you to leave the palace?

764
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,250
Who says you have completed any of this...

765
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,450
I am very confused.

766
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:02,150
I have not been able to understand these mass of feelings.

767
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,950
How dare you...

768
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:06,060
Don't leave my side.
