00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,200
Episode 17

2
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:10,667
You don't have to see me out.

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,600
Then, leave safely.

4
00:00:16,753 --> 00:00:18,700
You,

5
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:22,667
won't leave suddenly,

6
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:26,533
or something like that, right?

7
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:29,652
Even if I wanted to . . .

8
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:32,603
Since I am a criminal, where can I go?

9
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:34,343
That's right.

10
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,200
You are a sinner.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,969
You are sinner and Shaman Wol.

12
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:43,267
Aren't you too much?

13
00:00:44,113 --> 00:00:45,767
Never mind.

14
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:49,267
I like it so much that,

15
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,615
you are a sinner and Shaman Wol.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,820
Then go in and rest.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,700
Assassins . . .

18
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:01,325
Yeon Woo.

19
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:05,433
Yeon Woo.

20
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,967
Is this real?

21
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,533
What is?

22
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:44,867
You aren't a spirit?

23
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,859
Are you really...

24
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,899
The King?

25
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,986
It's not an imagination.

26
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,155
I really...

27
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:04,135
came to find you, Yeon Woo.

28
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,100
At last, I recognize you.

29
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:15,933
I am a fool.

30
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,200
Hyungnim!

31
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,770
Prince Yang Myung!

32
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,500
Hyungnim.

33
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,367
I'm fine.

34
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,933
Where are we going?

35
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,867
Where are we going?

36
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:51,156
Excellency, Excellency!

37
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,433
A vacant mud hut is over yonder.

38
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,200
We had decided to meet there, taking YeonWoo,
 if it became dangerous.

39
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,333
You lost the woman?!

40
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:44,033
Woon and the King appeared.

41
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:47,390
Also, Prince Yang Myung came

42
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,600
and completely disappeared somewhere with the girl.

43
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,733
No matter how you do it,

44
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,274
you have to find that girl.

45
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,100
Also,

46
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,567
kill Chief Shaman Jang of Seongsucheong

47
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,267
without a trace.

48
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:13,300
You are the only eyewitness, as well as 
the main culprit, of the Crown Princess' death.

49
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:15,867
Until this case is disclosed,

50
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:20,233
you must stay alive. It is the King's command.

51
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,600
Hide yourself somewhere for now; 
until we call for you.

52
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,599
If, by chance, you flee or

53
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,533
try to commit suicide,

54
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,499
there will be dire consequences.

55
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,267
Unni, where are you going?
Let's go together.

56
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,133
Let her go.

57
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,267
We all know where she's going.

58
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,233
What if she goes

59
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,233
and doesn't come back?

60
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:55,633
It is also obvious that she will be back.
So don't worry, just follow me.

61
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,300
Your Majesty!

62
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,767
Bring the royal physician!

63
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,767
DON'T!

64
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,600
Today,

65
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:44,500
about me leaving the Palace, 
has to be kept secret.

66
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,733
But, Your Majesty . . .

67
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,567
Yoon Dae Hyeong.

68
00:09:57,233 --> 00:10:00,200
Hyungnim.

69
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:12,752
Prince Yang Myung.

70
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:15,626
Prince Yang Myung!

71
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:17,187
What...

72
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:23,710
Mother . . .

73
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,208
Yang Myung!

74
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,795
-Sir
-Yang Myung.

75
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:30,881
I don't know who you are, 
but I need to get him inside. 
So please help me.

76
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,862
Please rely on me.

77
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:33,062
Yang Myung.

78
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:36,018
Your Excellency.

79
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:53,590
I'm Chief Scholar,
	Heo Yeong Jae's daughter,

80
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,034
Heo Yeon Woo.

81
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,528
By any chance,

82
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:22,528
are you the daughter of the

83
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:24,895
former Chief Scholar?

84
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:34,872
Yes, I am.

85
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:46,064
What is it?

86
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:57,528
Why do you hold someone in your heart
 that will hurt yourself.

87
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:08,364
I don't know how you are alive.

88
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:11,995
And, I won't ask the details.

89
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:14,910
However,

90
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,443
I can guess how.

91
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:24,202
Yang Myung visited me once

92
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,820
and asked if I believed in reincarnanation.

93
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,000
He said he can throw away power, loyalty,

94
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,595
and everything else.

95
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:40,828
But that one person,

96
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:43,828
is something he couldn't let go of.

97
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:50,276
He probably wanted me to see.

98
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:53,628
To show me what kind of person

99
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:56,662
he held dearly in his heart.

100
00:12:58,095 --> 00:13:01,413
He calls a mother, such as I, a mother.

101
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,528
Bringing his injured body

102
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:06,623
all the way here.

103
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:26,828
They weren't even at Jung Eung Temple.

104
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:29,028
Yes.

105
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,462
Follow me.

106
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,928
I've prepared it as you commanded.

107
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,995
Everyone, except Hyung Sun, get out.

108
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:19,728
Give me your sword.

109
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:38,062
Yo . . . Your Majesty, why are you like this?

110
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:40,262
Take off your clothes.

111
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:48,862
This.... 
 isn't fun.

112
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:51,195
If I brandish a sword at you, you should, 
at least, pretend to be surprised.

113
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:53,228
Or else it isn't fun.

114
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:56,762
Your Majesty,
why are you like this?

115
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,562
My liver almost dropped.

116
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:04,628
Since you were investigating 
in the cold weather,

117
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:07,100
you must be tired.

118
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,795
Go in.

119
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:11,295
I've ordered this to be prepared for you.

120
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,028
I cannot.

121
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:15,195
Go in.

122
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:17,028
It's a command.

123
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:18,562
Your Majesty.

124
00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:22,495
Not obeying a command is treasonous.

125
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:27,595
It would also be disloyal if all the evil aura
that is in you comes to me.

126
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,795
Also,

127
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:33,995
being torn between my brother and I

128
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:37,262
is revolting.

129
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:43,562
Make sure he goes in.

130
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:45,995
And if he comes out within two hours,

131
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,944
strike him with that sword.

132
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:51,728
Your Majesty . . .

133
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:54,328
Woon,

134
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:59,695
Although, I cannot give you a higher position.

135
00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:03,062
I treasure you above all others.

136
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,762
So please don't be sick/hurt.

137
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:09,995
If you have a cold,

138
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:13,195
I will have it, too.

139
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,862
So this is how it is done.

140
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:15,595
That is made out of Hyang Gam.

141
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:31,562
Are you awake now?

142
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:42,328
I'll see if the breakfast has been prepared.

143
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:51,328
Has your body recovered?

144
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,895
I...

145
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:59,062
thought that you would have left 
and wouldn't be here any longer.

146
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:01,895
I thought I should see you before I left.

147
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:04,628
I waited till you woke up.

148
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:08,762
Can you walk for a moment?

149
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:11,400
Yes.

150
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:20,036
Since when

151
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,000
have you known?

152
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:27,669
Subtitles brought to you by 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

153
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:30,003
Was it really

154
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:34,169
because of the problem-solving rock?

155
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,500
Wouldn't it be more weird if I hadn't known?

156
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,200
'Hea Woo Suk' (problem-solving rock)

157
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,000
was the name I made up

158
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,300
before I gave you the rock.

159
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,200
There is no one else who knows it.

160
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:56,169
But, why did you act like you didn't know?

161
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,500
I didn't want to know.

162
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:11,469
I wanted to act like I didn't know
to the end.

163
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,503
Since you came back to life,

164
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
I was extremely glad to see you.  And yet,

165
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,700
at the same time,

166
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,900
the moment I accept that truth,

167
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,700
it seemed like everything would all fly away.

168
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,200
Do you know?

169
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,600
When I open my eyes in the morning . . .

170
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,800
Knowing there is a place to go . . .

171
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,400
And there are things for me to do there . . .

172
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,603
And, there are people who need me . . .

173
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,600
And, I am able to see the person I long to see . . .

174
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,000
I was so happy.

175
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,400
During that time, I . . .

176
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:21,669
was happy, too.

177
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:25,803
Whenever I had to face the dark reality,

178
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,200
you

179
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,600
were a light for me.

180
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:41,969
Thanks to you, even for a while, 
I was able to set aside my worries.

181
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,200
I was able to smile.

182
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:53,136
Both as Shaman Wol and Heo Yeon Woo,

183
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:56,536
I was always thankful.

184
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,469
And,

185
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,000
I was always

186
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,800
sorry.

187
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,400
However,

188
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
to you, Excellency,

189
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,900
I am not able to give you

190
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,000
So please be free now.

191
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,400
Find a new destiny and

192
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,900
be happy, is my wish.

193
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:39,103
This is the only thing I can give you,

194
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,400
sincerely from my heart.

195
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,900
Then...

196
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,900
Please be healthy.

197
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:04,636
In the past life,

198
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:09,603
you were his person.

199
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,500
At least, in this life,

200
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,600
can't you be...

201
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:23,836
by my side?

202
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:31,369
That can't happen.

203
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:43,503
Escort Princess Yeon Woo away.

204
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,700
Hyungnim,

205
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,800
do you know what you are doing now?

206
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Fleeing with the King's woman

207
00:23:32,603 --> 00:23:34,936
is an act of treason.

208
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:55,336
Are you trying to get rid

209
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:57,703
of a person who has commited treason?

210
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:00,436
If I wanted your neck,

211
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:03,436
I could have used my power as a King.

212
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,500
What does that mean?

213
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:12,769
I am giving you a chance

214
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:17,103
to kill me.

215
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,136
The sword you are holding in your hand

216
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:23,336
is a real sword.

217
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,000
If you now

218
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:29,636
kill me here,

219
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,503
you will become the ruler of this country.

220
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:28,503
When you finally sit on the throne . . .

221
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:32,736
Do you think you will have everything?

222
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:36,836
If I sit on the throne, at least,

223
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:42,569
I won't be charged with treason.

224
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:45,969
Then,

225
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:49,569
kill me.

226
00:26:00,203 --> 00:26:03,203
Why are you hesitating?!

227
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:06,086
Kill me!

228
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,400
Today . . .

229
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,100
It is you who lost the chance.

230
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:35,836
So never,

231
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:40,503
look for another chance.

232
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:21,036
Did you rest?

233
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:23,303
Yes.

234
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,700
Can I ask

235
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,874
one thing?

236
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:30,358
Please ask me.

237
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,100
Did I . . .

238
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:38,198
bring you here,

239
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,600
when you didn't want to come?

240
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:44,476
If I didn't want to,

241
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:47,548
will you send me away?

242
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400
When my heart already belongs to you.

243
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,079
What is there to be so worried about?

244
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:03,206
Can I . . .

245
00:28:03,206 --> 00:28:05,622
open the door?

246
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:09,546
Do as you please.

247
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:15,235
Open it.

248
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:26,220

Come closer.

250
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:04,601
Come even closer.

251
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,100
Why are you like this?

252
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,000
You may leave.

253
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:46,927
Yeon Woo.

254
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:49,144
Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,672
Yeon Woo.

256
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:57,666
Yes, Your Majesty.

257
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeon Woo.
Yeon Woo.

258
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,500
When my heart is already yours.

259
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:15,784
What are you so worried about

260
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,013
Your Majesty,
To where are you headed?

261
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:51,245
I am returning to my palace for a rest
 after conducting some work.

262
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:53,374
Do you have something to tell me?

263
00:30:53,374 --> 00:30:56,005
I heard that lately

264
00:30:56,005 --> 00:31:00,275
you encountered some big trouble 
when you were out in disguise.

265
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:04,411
Are you unhealthy somewhere?

266
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:09,055
It is certainly strange.  The only people who knew

267
00:31:09,055 --> 00:31:12,630
about my disguised undertakings

268
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,759
are the assassins and me.

269
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,617
How is it that you know about it?

270
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:21,779
How can a person serving the King not know
 what is going on?

271
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:26,400
Everything that happens to you is the council's business.

272
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,583
Anway,
thank you for your concern.

273
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:33,185
Oh I forgot.

274
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,700
I heard you like to hunt.

275
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:43,583
Why are you asking that?

276
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:46,803
Isn't there military training coming up soon?

277
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:50,091
I would like to learn how to hunt that day.

278
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,015
Would you like to teach me your secret method?

279
00:31:55,255 --> 00:32:00,835
I am not that good.  However  . . .

280
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,908
Once I choose a quarry,

281
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:07,208
I chase it to the last without giving up

282
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,975
and capture it. This could be a kind of secret.

283
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:14,675
So then . . . Once, a quarry is chosen,

284
00:32:14,675 --> 00:32:17,562
chase without giving up,

285
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:20,838
finally capturing and killing it?

286
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,500
Ahhhh, I won't forget that.

287
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,047
What are you doing?

288
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:12,276
I'm reading a book.

289
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:14,808
When I asked earlier, didn't you say the you were reading a book?

290
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:16,775
Aren't you bored?

291
00:33:18,342 --> 00:33:21,401
I don't get bored.

292
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:26,270
So please focus on your work.

293
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,653
What book are you reading?

294
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:31,608
It is written by Han Feizi
(a philosopher and legalist).

295
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,135
Is that book so interesting?

296
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:38,689
Yes.

297
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:41,911
It's very interesting.

298
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,334
Your Majesty.

299
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:43,925
Is that book so interesting 
that you didn't notice me coming in?

300
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:47,375
When did you come in?

301
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:52,562
I meet you again after an 8 year separation 
and I am not more important than Han Feizi?

302
00:34:53,863 --> 00:34:56,928
Are you

303
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,343
jealous of Han Feizi?

304
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:01,875
Jealous? Yea right.

305
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,482
I just feel frustrated.

306
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:07,142
Why do you feel a sense of frustration?

307
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:12,834
I didn't even look at anyone else for the past eight years.

308
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:17,208
While living in a palace full of flowers,

309
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:20,898
do you know how hard it was to control myself for that long?

310
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:25,842
Do you really need strength in order to keep your virginity?

311
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:28,275
Of course!

312
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:32,800
How can you know how a man feels at night.

313
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,008
Exercising is a MUST! A must!

314
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:43,942
However, about you saying that you didn't look 
at any other woman.

315
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,242
isn't it a lie?

316
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:51,734
A lie?

317
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,275
Who did I ever look at?

318
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:57,021
Weren't you shaken by

319
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,793
Shaman Wol who stayed by you every night?

320
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:04,375
Nonsense! I was shaken very briefly.

321
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:08,500
That is...
Wait...

322
00:36:10,814 --> 00:36:13,008
Isn't Wol you?

323
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,100
But still, you were interested in Wol who wasn't really me.

324
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,542
So you were shaken.

325
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:30,388
Why are you laughing?

326
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:34,604
Are you being jealous by any chance?

327
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,775
Jealous? Nonsense.

328
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:43,475
Why do you keep laughing?

329
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:47,067
Isn't it funny that you're jealous of yourself?

330
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:49,908
I said I'm not.

331
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,508
Anyway,

332
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:57,142
I am going to finish reading my book.
 So you should focus on your petitions.

333
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:21,575
It is funny that you're jealous of yourself, but

334
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:25,675
since I fell for the same woman twice,

335
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,500
That's not quite normal either.

336
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,742
Heo's daughter is still alive?

337
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:55,608
What kind of nonsense is this?!

338
00:37:55,608 --> 00:38:00,242
How can a girl who was buried 8 years ago
be alive?

339
00:38:00,242 --> 00:38:02,208
8 years ago . . .

340
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:05,975
What did you believe of me 
to have me send a curse?

341
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,600
Who did you think that evil spirit will go to?

342
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:18,675
Nok Young you...
You dare...

343
00:38:18,675 --> 00:38:20,800
You dare...

344
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,600
The King must have already known.

345
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:32,100
How would the King know her whereabouts?

346
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:37,908
Ever since Jang met the King at his palace,

347
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:44,575
Heo's daughter has hidden herself
 from the medical relief center.

348
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:47,142
What do you think this means?

349
00:38:47,142 --> 00:38:52,075
Both of them have been hidden by the King.

350
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:54,375
I'm sure of it.

351
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:59,242
But if he knows the whole truth and

352
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:03,208
hasn't done anything yet.  It means

353
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:08,575
he is covering up the truth that he's found.

354
00:39:09,508 --> 00:39:14,542
He might be waiting for the right time.

355
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:19,375
Or he hasn't found out about

356
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:22,808
the last part of the truth.

357
00:39:22,808 --> 00:39:29,142
Whichever it is, we need to find both of them
 and silence them fast.

358
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:35,500
Even if the King does find out . . .

359
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,475
If the two people who bares witness
 to the truth isn't alive,

360
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,000
the truth will be buried forever.

-Open the door now!

366
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,900
I am exercising.

367
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,000
What brings you here,

368
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,400
Grandmother.

369
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,600
There was something I had to tell you.

370
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:54,366
Why didn't you just call me over?

371
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,500
King.

372
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,700
Yes Grandmother.

373
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,873
Do you remember that time

374
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:13,467
when I saved Shaman Wol?

375
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:16,600
How could I forget that?

376
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,500
I remember.

377
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,900
Then,

378
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,848
do you remember

379
00:42:22,848 --> 00:42:26,934
when you said you would grant me

380
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:30,775
a favor for helping you?

381
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,200
How would I forget?

382
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,800
This Grandma,

383
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,500
came today to request the favor.

384
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Please tell me what you want.

385
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,234
Seongsucheong's Jang and

386
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:50,883
her Spiritual Daughter, find them.

387
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,900
And, give them to me.

388
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,300
Why are you looking for them through me?

389
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,900
That is because . . .

390
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,700
you are hiding them, of course.

391
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,600
Why are you thinking that way?

392
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,200
What makes you think that I...

393
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,900
I heard you are investigating the incident 
from eight years ago.

394
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That . . .

395
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,600
don't do it.

396
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:28,300
And just cover it up.

397
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,200
Do you remember what I said eight years ago?

398
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,406
Just stay still.

399
00:43:39,406 --> 00:43:42,942
And keep it a secret.

400
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:47,145
When the previous King covered up this case,

401
00:43:47,145 --> 00:43:51,167
there was a reason.

402
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,670
What are you...

403
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,867
trying to hide?

404
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,534
That is,

405
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,700
I am trying to hide what you are trying to find out.

406
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,223
Why are you trying to hide it?

407
00:44:07,223 --> 00:44:10,734
It is all for your sake.

408
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,000
To speak more clearly,

409
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,488
it is to save the people you treasure.

410
00:44:21,488 --> 00:44:24,460
If it is someone I treasure,

411
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,367
who are you talking about?

412
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:29,667
That is

413
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,700
something you already know.

414
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,300
Think about it carefully.

415
00:44:35,334 --> 00:44:38,300
Who do you

416
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,700
want to protect the most?

417
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,600
Now,

418
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:54,669
will you give me the answer about my request?

419
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,167
Why is there no answer?

420
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:05,934
You quoted "A man's word is as good as bond".

421
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:08,934
Of course,

422
00:45:08,934 --> 00:45:11,734
I should grant your favor.

423
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,000
But,

424
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,700
it will take some time to find them.

425
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:23,200
If you just wait and believe in me,

426
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:27,834
I will make you meet them,
so don't worry.

427
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,400
However, that will be in the Court.

428
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:41,500
As a witness, an assailant, and a victim.

429
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,500
Orabeoni.

430
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,300
I was ordered to secretly investigate the incident 
from eight years ago.

431
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,300
Yeon Woo is in there sick.  How can you tell me
 to stay away from her?

432
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,600
How can I protect the Crown Prince when 
I cannot even protect my own sister?

433
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,618
Yeon Woo.

434

435
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,900
Who are you? 
Why are you prowling  about?

436
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:55,600
If you don't show yourself, I will raise an alarm.

437
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,734
You.
Who are you?

438
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:23,500
This lowly girl is Seol, Young Master.

439
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,267
Seol?

440
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Ah..

441
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,734
You were Yeon Woo's servant, that child, right?

442
00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:35,367
Yes.

443
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,500
What you said is correct, Young Master.

444
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:42,834
Why did you jump over the wall like a stray cat,
 instead of using the front door?

445
00:47:43,534 --> 00:47:45,067
I was just

446
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,600
passing by, while walking,

447
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,071
and thought of the old days and...

448
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:53,800
It was pretty late, so...

449
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,200
Right.

450
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,767
How have you been?

451
00:47:57,767 --> 00:48:00,234
I am...

452
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:03,767
living well

453
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,800
with a new master,  sir.

454
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:12,100
That's right. I am no longer your master 
due to my status.

455
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:17,634
But, in my heart, you are always my master.

456
00:48:17,634 --> 00:48:23,500
Just like that time when you gave me
 the name of Seol.

457
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,100
Why are you like that?

458
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,800
Do you have something to tell me?

459
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,300
Yeom, what are you doing there?

460
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:39,100
Oh mother, the girl who used to help Yeon Woo is...

461
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,700
I heard you talking to someone.
Who came by?

462
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,000
It was nothing.
But why did you come out here?

463
00:48:52,534 --> 00:48:59,434
Ever since the Princess went to see your father, 
she has been sick for three days.

464
00:48:59,434 --> 00:49:04,325
I was thinking about taking her into the Palace
and having her see the royal doctor.

465
00:49:04,325 --> 00:49:06,734
I wanted to know what you think about that.

466
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:09,567
Do you want me to take her?

467
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:11,134
No.

468
00:49:11,134 --> 00:49:14,967
I haven't replied to the letter that I received from the Queen.  So, I will take her.

469
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:17,600
Yes, then please do it that way.

470
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,400
I was about to go see the Princess.
Would you like to come with me?

471
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,583
Yes, Mother.

472
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:24,900
I will take you to her.

473
00:49:40,467 --> 00:49:43,967
When the King Former covered up that incident,

474
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,200
there was a reason.

475
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,700
It was all for your sake.

476
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,600
To say it more clearly,

477
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:56,600
It was for you and

478
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:03,300
everyone you treasured.

479
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,567
Your Majesty.

480
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,600
Your Majesty.

481
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:16,600
Yes.

482
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,500
I'm sorry.

483
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,600
I was thinking.

484
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:26,967
It is late, you should go to bed.

485
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:29,234
Same for you,

486
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,967
why aren't you asleep?

487
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:36,967
Because you aren't asleep.

488
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,400
I am sorry for

489
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,400
putting you in a stifling room all day.

490
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,167
I am with you.

491
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:55,834
As long as I am with you,

492
00:50:55,834 --> 00:50:58,834
even if it is in a secret room or

493
00:50:58,834 --> 00:51:03,434
in hell, I do not care.

494
00:51:05,034 --> 00:51:06,700
Come out.

495
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,827
Let's take a walk since it is dark outside.

496
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:24,680
Subtitles brought to you by Eclipse Team @ viki.com

497
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:30,903
The last time I met you in the Hidden Moon Building,

498
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:34,200
why didn't you tell me you had regained your memory?

499
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:39,216
Why did you hide it?

500
00:51:39,216 --> 00:51:41,995
Even if you had told me . . .

501
00:51:41,995 --> 00:51:46,739
I didn't have the heart to tell you.

502
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:54,007
The Queen is at your side.

503
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,833
Why are you like this?

504
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,600
Did you have a nightmare again?

505
00:52:17,645 --> 00:52:20,245
Isn't it strange?

506
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,100
What is?

507
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,200
I don't hear a cry from the Hidden Moon Building,

508
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:30,467
anymore.

509
00:52:30,467 --> 00:52:35,067
That is probably because the Seongsucheong shamans are using talismans to stop it.

510
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:39,100
I think that is why it has disappeared.

511
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,233
No, that's not it.

512
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,489
The owner of the Hidden Moon Building

513
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:50,167
is back!

514
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,567
Your Majesty.

515
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:53,633
Heo Yeon Woo, that child,

516
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:58,790
is somewhere in the Palace.

517
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:02,667
Please stay strong.

518
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:05,406
My father . . .

519
00:53:05,406 --> 00:53:09,500
I told my father to make that child disappear-

520
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,041
No, it isn't.

521
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,034
If father sees me in this state,

522
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,600
he'll be disappointed.

523
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:32,111
Lady Jo.

524
00:53:33,267 --> 00:53:36,367
That court lady of the King's chamber,

525
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:38,600
bring her here.

526
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,167
Yes?

527
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:43,667
At this late hour?

528
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:46,033
What are you doing?

529
00:53:46,033 --> 00:53:49,533
Bring her here immediately.

530
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,779
When I am known to be dead,

531
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,600
and reappear alive again,

532
00:54:04,433 --> 00:54:09,567
I know it will bring chaos to the palace.

533
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:14,300
And also,

534
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:19,000
it was foolish of me to not remember you.

535
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,833
So, how could I proudly tell you that it was me?

536
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,433
What are you trying to say?

537
00:54:27,328 --> 00:54:32,133
The reason you went through all the suffering
was because of me.

538
00:54:32,133 --> 00:54:37,698
When you were going through pain and death,

539
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,200
it was my fault that I didn't do anything.

540
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,285
No, it isn't.

541
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:50,000
For you to not forget a girl, 
such as me, for eight years,

542
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,067
I have no complaint.

543
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,200
So,

544
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,267
During all the days I have left,

545
00:54:58,267 --> 00:55:02,067
even if you forget me,

546
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,900
I will remember you even more,

547
00:55:07,575 --> 00:55:11,600
and live with eagerness.

548
00:55:15,533 --> 00:55:18,033
I . . .

549
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:21,467
will never forget.

550
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:25,233
The people who have caused you this much suffering.

551
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:27,714
I will find and punish them.

552
00:55:27,714 --> 00:55:33,333
Also restore the innocent people and 
return things to as they should be.

553
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,795
Your Majesty,

554
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:42,967
please let the past stay in the past.

555
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:52,067
When the previous King covered up the truth,

556
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:55,600
there must have been a reason for it.

557
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,700
"I believe in you."

558
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,900
"I believe that you will find out the truth."

559
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,367
Weren't you the one who encouraged me like that?

560
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,600
But, why?

561
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,100
I believe in you.

562
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,400
But,

563
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,033
I'm afraid of the truth that might hurt you.

564
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:22,400
I . . .

565
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,500
don't have anything more to expect
than being by your side. So,

566
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,600
You are in a room that barely has light.

567
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,700
Do you like being there that much?

568
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,560
Since I am next to the sun,

569
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,867
I don't need any other light.

570
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,700
Where are we going?

571
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,700
This place...

572
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,300
This place

573
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,000
is where this nation's politics start.

574
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,367
In this place,
I hear the nation's stories and

575
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,100
I think about what I should do for my nation.

576
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,000
Why did you bring a person like me

577
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,800
to a sacred place like this?

578
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:38,200
When I first met you, you told me 
about the flaws and the wrongdoings

579
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:42,600
of the Kings.

580
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,400
That then, I was so young...

581
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,900
"In a child's eyes,

582
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,600
the whole world can become a problem,

583
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:56,300
the whole world can become an answer."

584
00:57:57,785 --> 00:58:00,733
Your brother,

585
00:58:00,733 --> 00:58:04,533
my teacher,

586
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:08,567
that was the first warning(teaching) he gave me.

587
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,300
So,

588
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,400
if something is making a child feel unsafe,

589
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,767
there is a problem.

590
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:24,367
So ever since I became a King and
 had to face making a decision . . .

591
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:26,965
If it was you . . .

592
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:29,367
If it was Teacher . . .

593
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:33,567
What would they have said?

594
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:36,353
I tried to think of it.

595
00:58:46,895 --> 00:58:49,500
Do you see that?

596
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,200
In my Princely days,

597
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,833
I commanded a man to create a hairpin

598
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:04,600
that resembled the meaning of that view.

599
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,100
To give to you...

600
00:59:13,433 --> 00:59:17,533
A request . . .

601
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:21,467
for you to be my moon.

602
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,700
This hairpin . . .

603
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,633
'The Moon Embracing The Sun.'

604
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,800
And of the two,

605
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,800
I gave one to you.

606
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,933
The other one . . .

607
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:57,577
When you became my official wife,

608
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,900
I was thinking to give it to you here.

609
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,000
Your Majesty.

610
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,300
All your personal belongings 
in the medical relief center,

611
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:40,633
I've ordered that they be brought here.

612
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:56,700
Now,

613
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,533
we have become one.

614
