1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,404
Just... whose memories are these?

2
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:03,607
Whose memories are these?

3
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:14,919
Die down.

4
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:17,421
Please die down.

5
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,426
Please reduce the swelling.

6
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:24,728
Please, quickly reduce the swelling.

7
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,745
Since I yearn for him so much, now I see hallucinations.

8
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:44,849
Do I look like an apparition to you?

9
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:57,561
Why are you always avoiding me?

10
00:01:58,062 --> 00:02:00,965
My face... looks terrible...

11
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:02,266
It does not look terrible.

12
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,667
You are lying.

13
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,569
You just laughed.

14
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:07,872
I laughed because you're pretty.

15
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:11,075
am i pretty?

16
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:14,178
Have you ever seen me lie?

17
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:17,581
Then you're not going to abandon me?

18
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:19,183
How could you say such a thing?

19
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:21,085
Then promise me...

20
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:25,189
that no matter what happens,
you will not abandon me.

21
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:28,392
If I say that, I'll put my life on the line.

22
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:30,494
Will you believe me if I do?

23
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:34,899
Pri...Princess!

24
00:02:58,222 --> 00:03:01,125
The innkeeper made some pancakes...

25
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:05,029
So while I was away to eat a few...

26
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:07,631
I think she went to look for Seol Unni.

27
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,533
What about me?

28
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:10,734
Where were you instead of protecting the child?

29
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:12,636
What are you running around for?

30
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:14,038
Haven't I told you countless times that

31
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:15,339
you must not go to the North Village!

32
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:18,542
What? Did something happen to Agassi?

33
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:21,445
There is something, look here.

34
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:23,747
Someone asked me to pass this letter to you.

35
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:30,554
<i>Since you refuse to come,</i>

36
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:33,256
<i>I will take your spiritual daughter instead.</i>

37
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:38,062
If you want to find your spiritual daughter,
then you will need to enter the palace.

38
00:03:39,163 --> 00:03:40,564
What's wrong?

39
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:41,966
What exactly happened?

40
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:43,367
Hurry and pack your belongings.

41
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,069
We need to go to the capital city.

42
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,070
Are we moving again?

43
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,371
What about Agassi?

44
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:49,073
Stop babbling and quickly
pack your belongings!

45
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:50,274
Quickly!

46
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:34,718
Bad news, my Lord!

47
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:38,222
It looks like she's dead.

48
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:46,330
She's still alive.

49
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,132
Quickly get some water, quick.

50
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:49,533
Yes.

51
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:15,159
Both your nostrils are bleeding!

52
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,062
Catch her quickly!

53
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:20,764
Catch her quickly!

54
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:21,265
Stop right there!

55
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:22,566
Catch her! Quickly!

56
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:28,873
Stop right there!

57
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:30,674
Quickly! Quickly catch her!

58
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,076
Stop!

59
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:34,378
Stop right there!

60
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:41,185
Prince Yang Myeong Gun.

61
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:43,587
Prince Yang Myeong Gun.

62
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,192
Prince Yang Myeong Gun.

63
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:52,296
They sure are tenacious.

64
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:04,508
<i>My Lord!</i>

65
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:06,310
Prince Yang Myeong.

66
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,312
My Lord.

67
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:10,714
Please, just give us some of your time.

68
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:14,418
We are not bad people.

69
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:17,621
Where in the world did he go?

70
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:21,425
What are you doing? Go and find him!

71
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:25,229
You are too quick...

72
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,643
Prince Yang Myeong Gun.

73
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,348
Prince Yang Myeong Gun.

74
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:46,650
How did he know?

75
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,452
He is Prince Yang Myeong.

76
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:50,754
<i>My Lord!</i>

77
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:52,356
<i>My Lord!</i>

78
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:05,769
Great Master!!

79
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:06,871
I'm being chased.

80
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:09,073
Please help me!

81
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,976
Great Master!

82
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:13,377
Over there!

83
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:14,979
What are you doing?

84
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,781
Go and catch her!

85
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,802
What exactly are you doing?
You are being disrespectful.

86
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:46,310
Do you not recognize me?

87
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:14,939
Do you really not know who I am?

88
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:26,150
What a beautiful sight.

89
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,753
In broad daylight, a shaman girl and
a monk are sticking close together.

90
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:32,056
What are they doing?

91
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:34,658
Step aside.

92
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,563
Anyone who dares to lay a finger on this woman

93
00:08:39,563 --> 00:08:40,865
will face death.

94
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:43,367
Aigoo, do you know where this is?

95
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,369
What is this fake monk mumbling about?

96
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:49,473
Monks and shamans are prohibited from
entering and leaving the capital city.

97
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:09,393
Are you really a shaman?

98
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:11,195
That's right.

99
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:15,299
<i>Do you really not recognize me?</i>

100
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,103
I'm sorry, but this is the first time I saw you.

101
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,206
If you leave through the back
gate and follow the road,

102
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:24,008
after awhile you'll see a greenhouse.

103
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:27,511
<i>Will you wait for me there?</i>

104
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:31,415
<i>Will you?</i>

105
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:34,218
I will wait for you.

106
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:35,719
Stop right there!

107
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:28,873
It seems like the professors have caught the shaman.

108
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:30,174
Let's go.

109
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:36,881
Leave.

110
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:06,310
What? She refuses to return to the palace?

111
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,312
T..Th..that is right.

112
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:11,315
And you clearly told her that
I'm requesting her return?

113
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:14,118
Of course I told her.

114
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:18,823
She really is ungrateful to ignore my friendship and goodwill.

115
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:23,727
So, you came back empty-handed?

116
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:26,330
Although I was not able to change
Head Shaman Jang's mind,

117
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,134
I brought Shaman Jang's spiritual daughter instead.

118
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:33,037
How can that girl ever replace Shaman Jang?

119
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:38,742
If we capture the child, then we can lure Shaman Jang here.

120
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:43,247
Then, is she a hostage?

121
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:44,949
Not only that,

122
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:47,351
Not only that,

123
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:54,158
Forgive me if I offend you, but have
you heard of a living talisman?

124
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:55,860
A living talisman?

125
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,062
That's right.

126
00:11:58,062 --> 00:11:59,964
It's when a living person
turns into a talisman,

127
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:04,068
and uses oneself to stop the
misfortunes and deaths of others.

128
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:09,773
As far as I know, there is no talisman
that is stronger or more effective.

129
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:16,580
If we can use the shaman girl as a talisman
and send her into His Majesty's chambers...

130
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,781
But...

131
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:22,086
how can we allow a lowly shaman to enter the palace?

132
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:24,288
Furthermore,

133
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:26,690
his Majesty would never allow it.

134
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,292
All this...

135
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:31,195
will be done after His Majesty has fallen asleep

136
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:34,198
and will be executed in secret.

137
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:36,500
That girl's powers

138
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:38,602
are unreliable.

139
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:41,005
Her face and His Majesty's

140
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:44,708
are flawless complements of each other.

141
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:46,911
One month.

142
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:49,113
Pardon?

143
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:51,515
The auspicious day for His Majesty
to consummate his marriage

144
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:53,717
happens in one month's time.

145
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:59,723
If she can help His Majesty regain his strength...

146
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:05,429
then the matter of consummating
the marriage is also solved.

147
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:10,534
An amulet to absorb evil, you say...

148
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,944
Are you Nok Young's apprentice?

149
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:21,345
Who are you?

150
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:25,549
You should know what is your task tonight.

151
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:27,651
I was dragged here without an explanation.

152
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:29,954
So how would I know?

153
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:32,256
Of course.

154
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:34,859
What is the point of knowing?

155
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,560
All you need to do is obey your orders.

156
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:38,662
Are you outside?

157
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:40,764
Yes, Shaman.

158
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:44,768
Take her away and proceed with the preparations.

159
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:46,370
- Yes.
- Yes.

160
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:50,274
Let go of me!

161
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:55,880
Please allow me to see the head shaman.

162
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,082
Without the head shaman's permission, I won't...

163
00:13:58,782 --> 00:14:01,485
You insolent girl.

164
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:04,488
Do you think you're a daughter of a noble family?

165
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,093
Remember,

166
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:10,194
if

167
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:12,596
you dare make a sound,

168
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:14,999
or move a finger,

169
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:18,702
your life will be on the line.

170
00:14:28,612 --> 00:14:30,815
She vanished?

171
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,416
That's right.

172
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:36,020
Just as I thought.

173
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,422
She really was a ghost then.

174
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:43,127
If she was a ghost, then she is probably a
wandering soul with an unresolved grudge.

175
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:46,130
I was thinking of listening to her pitiful story,

176
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,532
and resolving her grudge.

177
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:52,636
She didn't even give me a
chance to be a proper monarch.

178
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:55,940
I will look for her again.

179
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:58,342
No.

180
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:00,044
There is no need for that.

181
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:05,449
In the end it was only a scene from a
dream, it was just my an illusion.

182
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:09,153
It is better this way.

183
00:15:10,554 --> 00:15:13,657
From now on we won't ever meet again

184
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:17,061
and we will not create any more hate.

185
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:21,165
Your Highness, the palace physician is here.

186
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:22,867
Enter

187
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:56,400
What kind of tea is this?

188
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,602
It is chrysanthemum tea prepared by the royal physician,

189
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:00,504
Seeds of a jujube and thuja orientalis have
been added which help with your sleeping.

190
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:02,706
It is a medicinal tea meant to bring you a restful sleep.

191
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:07,511
What's the reason for using
medication to put me to sleep?

192
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:13,017
The Office of Physiognomy is in
charge of that, so I'm not sure why.

193
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:17,521
The Physician is just in charge of putting Your Majesty to sleep.

194
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:20,324
Recently, Your Majesty has had difficulty falling asleep.

195
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:23,227
There is no reason for you to refuse it.

196
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:27,131
A tea that gives you deep sleep.

197
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:32,735
My status is that of a lowly female
shaman.

198
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:35,439
There is no way I would have
previously met you, Your Majesty.

199
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,242
Then,

200
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:41,145
Perhaps I won't be snared by fanciful dreams again.

201
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:58,522
<i>When the bell that brings in energy is sounded,</i>

202
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:02,526
<i>the officer from the Office of Physiogomy
will bring in the talisman.</i>

203
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:43,968
Who dares to cover their face with
a cloak within the palace wall?

204
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:46,070
She is not a person but a talisman only.

205
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,571
Then please let it pass.

206
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,482
If the energy is broken,

207
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:01,585
the power of the talisman can disappear.

208
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:30,774
~ <i>The light that is fading in the clouds</i> ~

209
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:37,181
~ <i>the wandering rain falls outside my window.</i> ~

210
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:44,088
~ <i>The cooling memory is just
like the sound of the rainwater</i> ~

211
00:20:44,088 --> 00:20:51,395
~ <i>Capture my heart, refuse to leave</i> ~
Yeon U... Yeon U...

212
00:20:53,597 --> 00:21:01,005
~ <i>Sunk in the longing that gets
heavier as the time passes</i> ~

213
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:07,611
~ <i>Can I travel back to that time?</i> ~

214
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:10,815
~ <i>If you hug me</i> ~

215
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:14,518
~ <i>like when you did before</i> ~

216
00:21:14,518 --> 00:21:18,422
~ <i>then I will be better</i> ~

217
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:20,224
Yeon U...

218
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:22,126
Yeon U...

219
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:23,827
Your Majesty.

220
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:29,733
~ <i>I follow the wet and rainy road</i> ~

221
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:36,540
~ <i>and look back at our memories</i> ~

222
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:43,447
~ <i>The blurry rain...
reminds me of you</i> ~

223
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:49,553
~ <i>and you fill up in my tears</i> ~

224
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:56,861
~ <i>Sunk in the longing that gets
heavier as the time passes</i> ~

225
00:21:56,861 --> 00:22:03,567
~ <i>Can I travel back to that time?</i> ~

226
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:06,870
~ <i>Even if just this once,</i> ~

227
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,174
~ <i>even if its the last,</i> ~

228
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:17,181
~ <i>then I will be better.</i> ~

229
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:33,898
<i>My Lord!</i>

230
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:36,000
Lord Yang Myung!

231
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,002
<i>My Lord!</i>

232
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:39,904
Are you awake?

233
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:43,908
You were lying outside the entrance.
It was the physician who brought you in.

234
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:46,310
Do you remember?

235
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,313
My Lord! Lord Yang Myung.

236
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:53,417
My Lord! My Lord!

237
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:03,687
Did someone come by my side lastnight?

238
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:06,190
From the Office of Physiogonomy,
the Professor of Prophecy

239
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,894
came in for a while to write a talisman charm.

240
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:13,898
Did you sleep well last night?

241
00:24:13,998 --> 00:24:16,500
A charm talisman?

242
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,602
This is truly amazing.

243
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:21,705
Spells can be very annoying.

244
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:25,509
But my body feels much lighter.

245
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:39,623
Are you the chef's palace?

246
00:24:39,824 --> 00:24:42,126
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

247
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:45,229
The soup on my eating table
this morning was very delicious.

248
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:48,332
I ate well.

249
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:00,644
His Majesty was always cold-hearted,

250
00:25:00,744 --> 00:25:03,447
Why is His Majesty like this today?

251
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:06,550
Let's give His Majesty soup tomorrow too.

252
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,153
If I can see that smile again,

253
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:12,756
then I'm going to give him soup everyday.

254
00:25:12,957 --> 00:25:14,558
While I was lying in my chamber,

255
00:25:14,658 --> 00:25:17,361
I read the reports that you all handed in.

256
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:19,463
You probably did not have a lot of time but,

257
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:22,867
it was prepared quite well.

258
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:27,671
These petitions did not have a single trace of error.

259
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:31,675
Someone might think it's forged, or even fabricated.

260
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:41,585
I'm just joking.

261
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:48,993
Regarding the issue of heads of households,

262
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:51,896
whose famillies are having a hard time
surviving from these circumstances

263
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:54,298
being exempt from corvee, it eliminates the
liturgical and repatriation heroic measures.

264
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:55,299
How did it go?

265
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:57,001
Through the project leader's assistance,

266
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,003
we have obtained a list of the names.

267
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:00,905
For now, we have returned them to their household.

268
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:02,606
They have all returned to the countryside.

269
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:05,109
What about Pi Han Dol
that I asked you to find?

270
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:06,911
He is waiting outside.

271
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:09,413
Oh, really?

272
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:12,116
I thought our Ministry of Finance
was only good at golf,

273
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:15,219
but you are quick to act too.

274
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:17,922
Bring in Pi Han Dol.

275
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:30,334
Are you Pi Han Dol?

276
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:34,238
Yes, Your Majesty.

277
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:36,440
You must have had a hard time.

278
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,642
Was the work not difficult?

279
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:42,546
Compared to other laborious work,

280
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:45,149
it was quite easy to handle.

281
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:46,650
That's a relief.

282
00:26:46,851 --> 00:26:50,354
What were you in charge of during the
construction of the buildings and villages?

283
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:52,957
Yes?

284
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:59,663
I was responsible for building bridges.

285
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:02,967
Oh really?

286
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:13,377
Then I presume that you saw the
lotus flower pattern on the bridge, correct?

287
00:27:13,577 --> 00:27:16,280
Lot...Lotus Flower...

288
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,884
I remember it.

289
00:27:19,984 --> 00:27:24,088
How was it? Isn't it beautiful?

290
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:26,190
That's right.

291
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:30,494
It was very very beautiful.

292
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:35,299
Yes, it really is beautiful pattern.

293
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:37,701
The reason I looked for you,

294
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:41,305
was because of your son's request.

295
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:42,606
Yes?

296
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:46,810
Is Your Majesty talking about my son?

297
00:27:46,911 --> 00:27:48,112
Correct!

298
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:50,714
It was admirable seeing how he stepped in
as a parent to care for his younger sister.

299
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:52,917
A very well-behaved son.

300
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:56,720
Even a child knows how to make
the effort to protect his family.

301
00:27:56,921 --> 00:28:00,424
What have I recently done for my people?

302
00:28:00,524 --> 00:28:02,326
I will reflect on this deeply.

303
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:03,928
I am grateful.

304
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:06,931
I will grant you a small piece of land to farn.

305
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:10,734
Go back home, and live a peaceful life with your children.

306
00:28:10,835 --> 00:28:17,441
I am humbled by your grace, Your Majesty.

307
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:27,051
As promised, you followed the instructions very well.

308
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:29,854
This money is yours.

309
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:39,363
If you tell anyone about this matter,

310
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:42,967
The first step will be to kill your children.

311
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:45,469
Remember that.

312
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:52,476
Yes.

313
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,815
Why are you doing this?

314
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:48,632
That person called Pi Han Dol,
has he been sent back safely?

315
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:49,633
Yes.

316
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:56,040
I've already prepared a good place so that it will
be a safe and sound return to the countryside.

317
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,343
You've worked hard.

318
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:01,245
How did Your Majesty know?

319
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:03,047
About what?

320
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:07,651
How did you know that you needed to send me?

321
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:09,954
That person's hand.

322
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:14,058
The callus on that person's hand
didn't happen because of labor.

323
00:30:14,258 --> 00:30:20,764
That type of callus can often be seen on a
person that first starts practicing swordplay.

324
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:24,568
That's why I threw out a bait.

325
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:26,770
I didn't expect he would be this
stupid and take the bait in one bite.

326
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:29,473
What bait did you use?

327
00:30:29,573 --> 00:30:31,275
A lotus flower design.

328
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:35,779
The Bridge to the buildings
does not have a lotus pattern.

329
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,984
Therefore, what did you gain?

330
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:41,585
Questions.

331
00:30:41,785 --> 00:30:43,687
You asked a question?

332
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:48,392
Yes. A question.

333
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:53,898
Why did he talk about how beautiful the
lotus design was when it doesn't even exist?

334
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:59,403
Why did they send assassins to kill that naive man?

335
00:30:59,503 --> 00:31:02,907
And through his death,

336
00:31:03,107 --> 00:31:05,910
what are they trying to hide?

337
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,313
Then, did you get your answer?

338
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:12,016
I sure did.

339
00:31:12,116 --> 00:31:15,519
Pretending to be a corvee, they gathered all the strong and able men.

340
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:18,722
Using the story of a fake construction plan, they collected funds.

341
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:21,125
and instead of building the Buyeong Palace, they are secretly...

342
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:24,728
Holding military practices.

343
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:26,730
Does that make sense?

344
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:29,433
I think it fits perfectly.

345
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:31,936
If that is true,

346
00:31:32,136 --> 00:31:34,138
then that would be high treason.

347
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:36,740
I know.

348
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:39,944
My life is also threatened.

349
00:31:40,044 --> 00:31:41,145
Your Majesty.

350
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:42,847
No need to worry.

351
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:45,950
It's not time for me to die yet.

352
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:52,256
Until they get what they want from me,

353
00:31:52,456 --> 00:31:55,960
I'll remain alive...

354
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,074
Although his Highness had a fever,

355
00:32:10,274 --> 00:32:12,376
We were able to put out the fire.

356
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:13,878
But we don't know when he will be attacked again.

357
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:16,680
A (Son) heir is an urgent matter.

358
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,584
We've put in so much effort yet there is no outcome.

359
00:32:20,784 --> 00:32:22,987
If we don't think of some other options then...

360
00:32:23,187 --> 00:32:24,688
There are many other options out there.

361
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:30,895
First of all, we should stick talismans that are good for fertility at the king and queen's quarters.
.

362
00:32:30,995 --> 00:32:36,000
And tell the queen
to learn the art of seduction.

363
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,802
Why do you always do this to me?

364
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:43,407
We should do that to create a heir. Even if it was for just the first birth.

365
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:46,710
We should let him rest for awhile.

366
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:51,315
His Majesty has worked excessively
on national affairs these days.

367
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:57,822
So wherever or whenever he faints due to that,

368
00:32:57,922 --> 00:32:59,723
It won't look suspicious, right?

369
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:00,825
That's right.

370
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:03,027
But that is something...

371
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:06,330
To think about after there is an heir to succeed His Majesty.

372
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,531
Pi Han Dol,

373
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:09,433
Did you get rid of Pi Han Dol without any problems?

374
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,535
Of course.

375
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,741
What happened?

376
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:19,143
Sn.. sneak attack!

377
00:33:19,343 --> 00:33:21,245
Who attacked you?

378
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:23,046
His face was covered by a mask,

379
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:24,747
so I could not tell who it was.

380
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,249
But all I can say is
that seemed like a ghost's sword.

381
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,452
Ghost sword?

382
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:30,854
Woon's sword!

383
00:33:34,057 --> 00:33:37,861
Was he really that skilled?

384
00:33:50,874 --> 00:33:55,079
Is this a warning, your Majesty?

385
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:57,581
Yes?

386
00:33:57,781 --> 00:34:01,785
Has His Majesty recovered so much that he could
attend to the politics in the side palace hall?

387
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:03,287
That's right.

388
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:04,688
Even the breakfast too.

389
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:06,990
His Majesty tasted all the dishes once.

390
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:11,394
The meals that were retreated were less than before.
-= to retreat meals : The leftover food by the King =-

391
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:15,900
Seems like it's indeed effective to have a shaman talisman!

392
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,701
I'm sure of it.

393
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:21,105
In just one night she can make His Majesty's body recover,

394
00:34:21,305 --> 00:34:23,607
She is really amazing!

395
00:34:23,707 --> 00:34:29,313
I'm personally want to meet the girl and reward her.

396
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:35,319
Yeon U...

397
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,923
Misty rain...

398
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:44,528
Does it mean soft rain?

399
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:48,732
Yeon U...

400
00:34:57,341 --> 00:35:01,645
What kind of person

401
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:06,951
was able to shake him?

402
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,465
If I were that person...

403
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:26,070
If I were not a shaman...

404
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:31,775
If I was Yeon U,

405
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:37,581
would he be comforted?

406
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:43,787
Your Highness!

407
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:45,789
How dare you be so preposterous?

408
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,791
How dare you block my way!

409
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:49,593
Are you not going to get out of my way?

410
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:53,197
She's a shaman who has just dispelled evil with her body.

411
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:56,300
How can you personally come and visit here?

412
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,102
Why are you all just standing there?

413
00:35:58,302 --> 00:36:01,305
Quickly get her...

414
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:05,910
Great Queen Dowager.

415
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,414
I was planning to visit the Queen Dowager's palace to pay my respects.

416
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:15,219
Why did you personally come here?

417
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:22,026
It's really difficult.

418
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:25,329
You ignored my request when
I called you back to the palace.

419
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:28,232
So what brings you here now?

420
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:30,534
It is a misunderstanding, Your Highness.

421
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:33,437
How could I forget Your Highness' kindness and

422
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:35,940
disobey Your Highness' command?

423
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,046
It is because it took a long time to clean
my polluted body and expel the bad luck.

424
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:45,950
Thus, I was unable to come and greet Your Highness.

425
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:51,055
I wanted to greet you after cleansing all the bad luck away from my body, so I asked them to wait awhile longer.

426
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:54,258
Looks like the astronomical observatory professors have distorted my intentions.

427
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:58,262
Please understand me.

428
00:36:58,462 --> 00:37:01,165
I'm happy to hear that.

429
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:04,768
You came because you were afraid that we would take away your spiritual daughter.

430
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,372
That girl, before being my spiritual daughter,

431
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:13,077
She was a shaman whom you personally allowed to be registered in Celestial Hall shaman registry.

432
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:17,281
If she were to be taken away, how could I dare to argue?

433
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:22,987
So, during this time, why did you hide her?

434
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:26,190
Please speak and tell me.

435
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:30,694
8 years ago,

436
00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:34,999
My spiritual powers were damaged because of an incantation that took someone's life.

437
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,204
After that day I was afraid that I would be a hindrance to you, Great Dowager Queen.

438
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:44,408
So I have been observing the universe's movements, waiting for the fortunate time.

439
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,410
You were waiting for the right time.

440
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:50,314
So you are saying that this is the right time?

441
00:37:50,314 --> 00:37:51,816
Exactly.

442
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:56,921
Great Dowager Queen, you will see great fortune soon.

443
00:37:56,921 --> 00:38:00,124
Then I will be able to see an heir?

444
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:02,226
Absolutely.

445
00:38:05,629 --> 00:38:12,236
<i>But no heir will come from the present Queen's body.</i>

446
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:17,141
So you will not leave the Celestial Hall again, right?

447
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:23,247
As long as Your Highness is willing to take me in,
I will stay in the Celestial Hall until the day I die.

448
00:38:24,748 --> 00:38:25,850
But...

449
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,651
But what?

450
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:32,256
One vessel doesn't need two boatmen

451
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:37,361
There is only an eavesdropper who's worried about herself
.

452
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:42,266
Her heart has no loyalty towards the royal family,
please order her expulsion.

453
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,069
She is very brave to do that.

454
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:46,570
Hear that?

455
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:50,975
The Celestial Hall's leader has returned. So, move out immediately.

456
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:57,381
Are you satisfied now?

457
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,783
Thank you, Your Highness.

458
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:04,288
Now, bring your spiritual daughter.

459
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:08,692
Why do you want to see that child?

460
00:39:08,692 --> 00:39:11,495
Since she became the talisman,

461
00:39:11,495 --> 00:39:14,098
His Majesty's health has greatly improved.

462
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:18,002
I want to reward her.
Quickly, tell her to come.

463
00:39:18,502 --> 00:39:21,105
You don't need to do that.

464
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:22,706
Why not?

465
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:27,912
She is a talisman who spent the whole night receiving bad energy.

466
00:39:28,812 --> 00:39:31,715
If you were to meet her before she has to cleansed herself of the bad energy,

467
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:35,820
the bad energy may be transferred to you.

468
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,025
Furthermore, if the talisman was allowed to roam freely, it would reduce its effectiveness.

469
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:45,229
Until His Majesty's health has improved and until the marriage has been consummated,

470
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:49,433
we have to be very cautious.

471
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:54,438
Please, just until her task is finished.

472
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:56,640
Don't meet her.

473
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,552
Are you really not hurt?

474
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:11,255
Seol, I'm starting to get dizzy.

475
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:15,960
That is why we asked you to simply not go outside.

476
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,162
Agassi, you're not a 7-years old girl anymore.

477
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:20,664
Why don't you listen?

478
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:25,469
If I wasn't looking for you, this would have never happened.

479
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:30,274
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

480
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:32,376
Why are you like this?
I'm just joking. Just joking.

481
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:34,879
I am sorry.

482
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:36,981
Sorry, eonni.

483
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:41,385
It's all because I went to eat that fried cake.

484
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:43,487
Jan Sil, I'm all right.

485
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:50,794
Seol and Jan Sil...

486
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:54,298
Okay, okay. We'll go out.
Both of you can talk.

487
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:07,411
Oh my, is the Head Shaman's spiritual daughter?

488
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:11,215
No wonder she held her nose up in the air.

489
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:12,917
But it seems like she has some pretty good spiritual powers.

490
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:14,919
Seeing as Great Dowager Queen came all the way here.

491
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:18,122
If that's because of her spiritual powers or her backing,

492
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:19,323
Who knows?

493
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:22,626
What bad luck! How could a newbie enter the king's quarters?

494
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:23,327
You wrench!

495
00:41:24,628 --> 00:41:27,231
Don't you know how much trouble
a loose tongue can cause?

496
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:32,236
You all know very well who she is, and yet you
dare to utter such foul words?

497
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:34,538
That person is actually the mo...

498
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:42,046
Our agassi's name is Wol.
Wol as in the moon.

499
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:44,348
This child still does not understand
Chinese characters well.

500
00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:47,551
Anyway, please take care of our agassi.

501
00:41:51,455 --> 00:41:53,557
Why are you doing this, Head Shaman?

502
00:41:54,558 --> 00:41:57,761
Leave this place immediately!

503
00:41:57,761 --> 00:42:01,665
What? Don't tell me you didn't know that
disobeying the royal family's order is a crime?

504
00:42:01,665 --> 00:42:03,667
I will think of a way to resolve it.

505
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,470
You and Seol must escape immediately!

506
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,272
I cannot do that.

507
00:42:08,772 --> 00:42:12,376
I cannot allow everyone to become criminals because of me.

508
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:15,179
Then, do you want to continue to do this?

509
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:16,780
It's only for one month.

510
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,285
I only need to stay by his side for a month.

511
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:24,688
This doesn't seem like your style, Godmother. Why are you creating such a big hassle out of this?

512
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:31,095
I will be alright.
It's not a bad thing to be doing.

513
00:42:31,695 --> 00:42:35,900
Even though my powers are weak,
but if my presence can help that person

514
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:40,004
or lessen that person's pain by a little...

515
00:42:40,004 --> 00:42:44,708
It looks like you did not listen to my warning.

516
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:46,310
Pardon?

517
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,312
I told you to hide.

518
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:53,417
I asked you not to form any emotional
attachments or connections.

519
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:12,336
Head Shaman.

520
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:16,340
A female shaman who dispels evil

521
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:20,244
is not a human being, but only a talisman.

522
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:26,550
She has eyes, but she cannot see anything.

523
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:31,655
She has a mouth, but she cannot speak a word.

524
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:38,662
To sneak in after his sleep and disappear
without a trace once he is awake...

525
00:43:39,763 --> 00:43:46,971
To be right next to him but unable meet...

526
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:53,177
That is... the fate of a shaman talisman.

527
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:56,580
Even so, do you still want to do it?

528
00:43:57,882 --> 00:43:59,483
Tell me!

529
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,685
Even so, do you still want to do it?

530
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:04,188
Aren't female shamans

531
00:44:08,993 --> 00:44:12,496
supposed to relieve other people's pain?

532
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:16,100
How can we choose to help
either the noble or the lowly?

533
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,204
Even if I have eyes, I will not see.

534
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:25,409
Even if I have mouth, I will not speak.

535
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:30,214
I will make sure my presence will not be discovered.

536
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:35,019
I know what the Head Shaman fears...

537
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:37,321
That person is the one above all people.

538
00:44:39,123 --> 00:44:42,426
I am only a lowly shaman girl.

539
00:44:43,727 --> 00:44:47,031
The thing that you are worried about will never happen.

540
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:05,349
Mother! Mother!

541
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,852
Ah yes, Princess Min Hwa.

542
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:10,955
What are you thinking so deeply about?

543
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:13,557
It's nothing, but why...?

544
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:16,260
Mother, please take a look at this.

545
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,064
This is...what insect is this?

546
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:23,667
It is not an insect,

547
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:26,570
but a crane.

548
00:45:28,873 --> 00:45:32,076
Crane... so it's a crane.

549
00:45:33,477 --> 00:45:35,679
I wanted to embroider a pair of flying cranes.

550
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,084
I do not know why...but I have embroidered a couple of quail instead.

551
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:46,190
It seems that I'm still lacking.

552
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:51,395
I initially wanted to personally embroider the crest on my husband's official clothes.
-= crest: In Joseon era, the King, Royal Crown Prince, civil and military officials
had clan symbols decorated on the chest and back of their official clothes.=-

553
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:55,799
Oh no, I'm only making a small joke.

554
00:45:55,799 --> 00:45:59,003
It obviously... looks like a crane.

555
00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:03,807
- Only...
- Only what?

556
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:11,115
The legs need a little more embroidering.

557
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:14,318
Open both wings to raise their majestic air.

558
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:16,620
Then they'll become even more majestic cranes.

559
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,424
Then, will they really become the
elegant cranes that match my husband?

560
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:21,725
Of course.

561
00:46:22,726 --> 00:46:26,230
If you feel that it is difficult,
how about letting me help you?

562
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:31,135
That's not necessary. This is a gift for my husband
so I must embroider it with my own hands.

563
00:46:31,135 --> 00:46:36,440
Then, if you encounter any difficulties, do not hesitate to find me.

564
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,742
I will always help you.

565
00:46:38,742 --> 00:46:39,944
Yes, Mother.

566
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:03,968
Why are you here?

567
00:47:04,468 --> 00:47:06,570
Hus...husband.

568
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:08,472
Did I scare you?

569
00:47:08,472 --> 00:47:10,274
No, husband.

570
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:12,576
You didn't scare me.

571
00:47:13,277 --> 00:47:15,179
But why are you here?

572
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,181
Orabeoni is...

573
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:22,887
You're too much.

574
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:26,090
What's wrong with you?
What have I done this time?

575
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,094
Why do you always ask me
what I am doing here?

576
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:34,798
'I miss you'... can't you even say this to me?

577
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:38,202
I am sorry. I didn't think about that.

578
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:40,304
If you are sorry,

579
00:47:40,604 --> 00:47:41,505
then...

580
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:46,110
please give me a hug.

581
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:46,810
Pardon?

582
00:47:48,312 --> 00:47:54,618
Tonight. Can you come to my room?

583
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:59,123
Yang... Isn't Prince Yang Myeong here?

584
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:02,526
Orabeoni is not around,
so what does it matter...

585
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:11,836
Don't mind me. Please continue.

586
00:48:11,836 --> 00:48:16,841
I... didn't see anything at all.

587
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:18,843
Orabeoni, you are really...!

588
00:48:19,944 --> 00:48:21,245
I really hate you!

589
00:48:21,946 --> 00:48:25,649
But, where have you been?
Why don't you rest a bit?

590
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,652
Now it's time for the third party to disappear.

591
00:48:28,652 --> 00:48:32,156
Everyday, I have to tolerate her tantrums.

592
00:48:32,156 --> 00:48:33,457
I really can't stay here any longer.

593
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:35,860
How can you leave when you're still not well yet?

594
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,761
You've nagged me long enough.

595
00:48:38,262 --> 00:48:40,564
I will take my leave now.

596
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:43,767
Both of you may continue.

597
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,771
<i>My Lord!</i>

598
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:50,875
Don't go, Orabeoni.

599
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:51,876
What is it?

600
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:56,080
Don't tell me you are using me as
an excuse to come here everyday!

601
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,983
Where are you going with your injuries like this?

602
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:00,584
If you just leave like that,

603
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:03,387
my husband will worry.

604
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:08,392
Wait till you are healed and then leave.

605
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:09,994
In the time that you are here,

606
00:49:09,994 --> 00:49:12,296
I give you my word that I'll not enter the inner chamber.

607
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:16,800
I am a sick person.

608
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:19,803
Can't you treat me gently? Gently!

609
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,011
Your Majesty.

610
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:28,712
It's the time of "hai" (9-11pm).

611
00:49:28,712 --> 00:49:30,614
Before the tea that was brought by the pharmacy turns cold,

612
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:32,516
please drink it while it's hot.

613
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:34,518
This is my unique way of taking care of my heath,

614
00:49:34,518 --> 00:49:36,220
there's no need for you to bother.

615
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,622
If anything is unwell with Your Majesty's  health...

616
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:42,827
Right now, I'm at my healthiest.

617
00:49:43,327 --> 00:49:45,029
This sturdiness, makes me feel strange too.

618
00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:47,832
The ancients said that too fari is as bad as not enough.

619
00:49:47,832 --> 00:49:49,733
It has already been 1/2 an hour.

620
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:51,635
The energy that has finally returned,

621
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:54,038
if it dissipates again, then...

622
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,142
You talk too much.

623
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:01,245
Covered in blood is due to very disturbed internal organs.

624
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:03,147
If I practice this kind of exercise,

625
00:50:03,147 --> 00:50:03,948
the vital energy

626
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:05,149
Gets vigorous.

627
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:09,453
I am now healthier than anyone.

628
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:10,554
Only like that,

629
00:50:11,055 --> 00:50:13,057
can a broad ambition be achieved.

630
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:14,458
<i>Ambition?</i>

631
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:15,960
<i>Could it be...</i>

632
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,962
<i>Pregnant?</i>

633
00:50:17,962 --> 00:50:19,563
<i>An heir.</i>

634
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:29,273
Why are you looking at me like that?

635
00:50:30,374 --> 00:50:32,676
It'll surely be achieved.

636
00:50:32,676 --> 00:50:34,278
You'll definitely,

637
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:36,580
achieve your ambition.

638
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,884
Your Majesty and Jung Jeon will definitely bred an heir that

639
00:50:39,884 --> 00:50:41,886
looks the same as you both.

640
00:50:41,886 --> 00:50:44,388
What nonsense are you spouting?!

641
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:46,991
Hyeong Seon, you

642
00:50:47,892 --> 00:50:51,195
can't you be a bit more understanding?

643
00:50:51,695 --> 00:50:54,398
You only know how to think of vulgar things.

644
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,402
This is why I'm not willing to talk to you these days.

645
00:50:59,103 --> 00:51:01,505
I don't wish to see you! Turn over there!

646
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,219
Are you crying?

647
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:17,621
You wouldn't be crying now, are you?

648
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:20,124
Did I do something that has wronged you?

649
00:51:21,725 --> 00:51:23,427
It's not like that.

650
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:25,229
It's just that...

651
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:29,433
I feel that I'm seeing His Majesty
in his younger days again.

652
00:51:30,534 --> 00:51:32,036
I'm begging you...

653
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:33,037
You must always,

654
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:34,839
be like now

655
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,741
and stay healthy, Your Majesty.

656
00:51:38,442 --> 00:51:39,443
Really...

657
00:51:40,644 --> 00:51:43,347
You have a way of making me listen to you.

658
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,952
I will follow your intentions, Hyeong Seon.

659
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:50,254
Let's prepare to go to bed now.

660
00:51:50,454 --> 00:51:51,856
Don't cry anymore.

661
00:51:57,061 --> 00:51:59,363
Why is the chrysanthemum tea so hot?

662
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:03,067
Cold water... Quickly!
Towel. Towel.

663
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,781
Turn around.

664
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:04,328
Are you well today?

665
00:53:05,529 --> 00:53:08,132
Your Majesty's complexion is better than yesterday's.

666
00:53:08,132 --> 00:53:09,733
<i>That's a relief.</i>

667
00:53:11,836 --> 00:53:13,737
<i>Please do not frown.</i>

668
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:16,040
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

669
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:19,643
A smile suits you better.

670
00:53:38,262 --> 00:53:40,664
Just ask directly when you meet.

671
00:53:41,966 --> 00:53:42,867
To Miss Yeon U,

672
00:53:42,867 --> 00:53:44,168
my presence

673
00:53:44,168 --> 00:53:46,270
is of no significance.

674
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:48,672
<i>My first reason is that I don't want to lose you.</i>

675
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:50,474
<i>The second reason is that I...</i>

676
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:54,678
<i>I like Teacher Heo's sister.</i>

677
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:56,280
I really like her.

678
00:55:13,357 --> 00:55:15,459
When the two are together,

679
00:55:15,459 --> 00:55:17,661
they really look like a painting.

680
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:22,366
Do you think the rumours are really true?

681
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:23,267
Rumour?

682
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:24,468
What rumours?

683
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:30,074
That His Majesty doesn't sleep with the Queen

684
00:55:30,074 --> 00:55:32,076
because of Un?

685
00:55:32,676 --> 00:55:34,078
Well, even for me,

686
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:36,080
if there was such a handsome person by my side,

687
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,882
how would other people be visible in my eyes?

688
00:55:38,682 --> 00:55:39,683
Rotten girl.

689
00:55:41,285 --> 00:55:42,186
Let's go.

690
00:55:59,503 --> 00:56:01,005
That's a smile,

691
00:56:01,906 --> 00:56:05,109
that I have never seen before.

692
00:56:07,311 --> 00:56:08,312
Your Highness!

693
00:56:08,312 --> 00:56:10,414
Where are you going?

694
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:11,816
I am going to see His Majesty.

695
00:56:11,816 --> 00:56:13,217
No, you mustn't Your Highness.

696
00:56:14,518 --> 00:56:16,020
How dare you! Let go of my hands right now!

697
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,223
How long do you want me to wait?

698
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:21,125
I can't wait any longer.

699
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:22,927
I want to personally go and look for His Majesty.

700
00:56:22,927 --> 00:56:24,428
What is the matter, Court Lady Jo?

701
00:56:31,735 --> 00:56:34,338
How can you be so rash?

702
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:38,442
In the palace, the walls have eyes and ears.

703
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:42,446
I have already warned you to be
cautious and careful of your actions.

704
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:47,051
I have been having nightmares lately.

705
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:49,453
If it's because of the nightmares

706
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:51,555
that cause you to act so rashly,

707
00:56:51,555 --> 00:56:54,658
then what is the difference between
you and the ladies at the winery?

708
00:56:54,658 --> 00:56:57,761
His Majesty's health has just gotten better,

709
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,064
with you making a fuss at the King's Quarters,

710
00:57:00,664 --> 00:57:03,267
if his health worsens,

711
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:06,871
how are you going to clean up the mess?

712
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:11,075
You need to restrain yourself and then restrain yourself more.

713
00:57:13,277 --> 00:57:14,879
Before you consummate the marriage,

714
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:20,184
you absolutely must not go
near the King's Quarters again.

715
00:57:22,586 --> 00:57:24,488
Do you understand, Queen?

716
00:57:28,492 --> 00:57:30,794
I will keep that in mind.

717
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:32,796
So many years have passed,

718
00:57:33,898 --> 00:57:37,401
And you still are unable to capture a man's heart.

719
00:57:38,302 --> 00:57:40,104
If you had given birth to an heir,

720
00:57:40,104 --> 00:57:43,307
then things wouldn't have been so troublesome.

721
00:57:45,209 --> 00:57:47,111
Please ask Mother to pay a visit to the palace.

722
00:57:49,513 --> 00:57:52,917
I want to see Mother.

723
00:58:10,134 --> 00:58:13,737
I haven't seen you wearing
these clothes for a long time.

724
00:58:13,737 --> 00:58:17,241
I just finished watching the martial arts exhibition
of the new staff at the Propaganda Hall.

725
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:18,542
Do you like it?

726
00:58:20,845 --> 00:58:23,047
Even though your body has
already started to recover,

727
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:25,349
it's still better to rest.

728
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:27,251
Please don't set your schedule too tightly.

729
00:58:28,252 --> 00:58:32,056
Even if the schedule is tight, and worse comes to worst, I will just lie sick on my bed.

730
00:58:32,056 --> 00:58:34,959
Moreover, to you it might
not be such a bad thing.

731
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:37,461
What are you saying?

732
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:40,664
Ah, I forgot to thank you.

733
00:58:41,465 --> 00:58:43,267
Last time when I went to the residence at Onyang,

734
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:45,469
the gift that you sent to the temporary residence,

735
00:58:45,469 --> 00:58:47,371
I've received it.

736
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:57,882
Thanks to you, my whole body has perspired

737
00:58:57,882 --> 00:58:59,783
and exercised well.

738
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:04,989
It has already been said that it will have
great effects if it's placed in the water,

739
00:59:05,289 --> 00:59:07,691
so I prepared some ginseng.

740
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:09,793
Now that I hear that you liked them,

741
00:59:09,793 --> 00:59:12,296
it is really fortunate.

742
00:59:12,296 --> 00:59:13,497
Ginseng?

743
00:59:14,498 --> 00:59:15,900
You said ginseng?

744
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:19,503
Well yes, both characters have the word "human" .

745
00:59:19,503 --> 00:59:23,908
Both have the effect of increasing internal body heat.
It's not a big difference.

746
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:27,912
No matter what, thank you.

747
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:32,316
I'm fortunate to be able to do
something for Your Majesty.

748
00:59:33,117 --> 00:59:38,022
I will certainly prepare it well so that it
can be offered to Your Majesty again.

749
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:41,025
I will look forward to it.

750
01:00:17,261 --> 01:00:19,663
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

751
01:00:20,664 --> 01:00:24,668
Do you feel unwell somewhere?

752
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:30,274
Your Majesty, the physician has arrived.

753
01:00:30,274 --> 01:00:39,984
Let him in.

754
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:44,388
I will certainly prepare it well so that it
can be offered to Your Majesty again.

755
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:48,192
Please let me observe the color for poison.

756
01:00:48,492 --> 01:00:51,795
Are you still brooding over what I said earlier?

757
01:00:51,795 --> 01:00:56,700
Don't worry. Didn't I say that I'm still alright?

758
01:01:03,107 --> 01:01:05,809
Your Majesty. Are you alright?

759
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:09,613
It just got caught in my throat, there's no need to fuss about it.

760
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:38,342
The Sirius star is being covered by darkness...

761
01:01:41,846 --> 01:01:45,349
Have you been well today too?

762
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:49,353
I heard His Majesty's health has recovered a lot.

763
01:01:49,653 --> 01:01:52,656
That is such a relief.

764
01:01:53,457 --> 01:01:57,761
I am not sure if Your Majesty knows,

765
01:01:58,162 --> 01:02:03,868
but this is the first time where I am
glad that I am a female shaman.

766
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:09,673
Because I can be of help to you, Your Majesty.
Because I can be by your side and protect you.

767
01:02:09,673 --> 01:02:12,076
If I say it's a relief,

768
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:17,581
would that be disrespectful?

769
01:02:48,312 --> 01:02:50,314
Who are you?

770
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:53,517
Quickly! Tell me!

771
01:02:53,717 --> 01:02:56,120
Who exactly are you?
