Episode 15

2
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:54,599
Miss!

3
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,783
What happened, Miss?

4
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:07,002
I heard that on the way to Hwal Yin Seo, you disappeared.

5
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:09,684
Do you know how much I worried?

6
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:13,285
I lost consciousness.  So, they took me 
to a place where I could get treated.

7
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,071
Yes?

8
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:17,697
Are you alright now?

9
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,537
Yes.

10
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,400
But, Seol,
when I lost consciousness

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,839
I thought about the past.

12
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:28,875
The past?

13
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,986
That's right, the past.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,700
A long time ago,

15
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,300
when I received my blessing from the god,

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,800
that's when I lost my memory.

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,350
You remember, right?

18
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,389
Yes?

19
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:48,515
I wasn't there.

20
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,005
Was it like that?

21
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,060
Then when did you first meet our Spirit Mother?

22
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:59,858
Was that before I got my blessing?

23
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:02,308
Or after?

24
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:05,366
I told you.

25
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:09,978
I was sold to another owner and
while running away . . .

26
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:12,446
Then,

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,900
I met Spirit Mother and you,

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,000
Since then.

29
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,630
Seol.

30
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,666
Yes?

31
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,931
Why did you lie to me?

32
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
What?

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,600
I...

34
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:33,191
saw it.

35
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:36,512
When I was taken out of the grave,

36
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:39,234
you were there looking at me.

37
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:47,315
Then, that child was alive?!

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Yes.

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,500
It's the first time I've seen a shaman unscathed and normal,

40
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:58,174
after taking in a spirit.

41
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:03,072
It seems like her skills are very powerful.

42
00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:06,041
If things hadn't gone as they had,

43
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,088
I would've kept her by my side.

44
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,006
What a waste of spiritual power.

45
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:15,782
So, have you sent her to the medical center?

46
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:19,483
Actually . . .

47
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:22,063
That is...

48
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:24,339
I'm sorry, but I . . .

49
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:27,293
I have one request.

50
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:29,718
Request?

51
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:32,984
Because I have received an upset spirit,

52
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:36,952
my own spirit is shaken and mad.

53
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:40,946
 If that anger is not soothed,

54
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:44,543
Not only I, but . . .

55
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:48,330
everyone who sent me here . . .

56
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:53,021
The anger will spread onto them.

57
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:59,996
So...
What is your request?

58
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:03,305
I and the spirit in my body

59
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,195
We need time to console.

60
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:09,278
I am asking for a favor.

61
00:04:09,278 --> 00:04:13,872
Please let me pray at Sungsucheong.

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,300
So,

63
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,600
you allowed it.

64
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,075
She was a different person from before 
and then, after she went in there.

65
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:29,312
If we, by chance, upset a shaman 
when she is already holding a grudge,

66
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,087
its curse can affect all of our familys through three generations..

67
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:33,906
But . . .

68
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,756
What if she tries to run away?

69
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:38,635
Please do not worry about that.

70
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:42,358
I put a person at her side,
so nothing will happen.

71
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,454
Regardless,

72
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:48,395
you must make sure everything is cleaned up without any repercussions.

73
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:51,906
Of course.

74
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:57,943
I did wrong, Miss.

75
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:03,556
I don't have time.
I'll forgive later.

76
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:06,306
Just tell me the truth that you know.

77
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,171
What did Spirit Mother say?

78
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:09,900
What did she say

79
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,300
to make you close your mouth for 8 years?

80
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:18,667
His Excellency, and Spirit Mother, 
in order to save you from your magical illness,

81
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,600
gave you medicine,

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
and planned to take you out from the grave.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,868
She gave me medicine to save me?

84
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:32,087
They thought suggesting you be the Crown Princess, when you had a magical illness was treasonous.

85
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:35,929
So they had no choice,
 but to hide your magical illness.

86
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:41,876
So the only option was to live without an identity.

87
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:47,959
Then, Father knew that I was alive?

88
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:52,153
Yes.

89
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:55,324
To protect his family, and save his child,

90
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:58,780
he said this was his only choice.

91
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,674
Therefore, I couldn't reveal that you were alive to anyone.

92
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:07,721
Then,

93
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:10,064
it must be true that I had some type of magical illness.

94
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,100
That's right.

95
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,301
But . . .

96
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:18,998
But what?

97
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:21,665
From our own words,

98
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,914
and my own intuition,

99
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:28,800
I couldn't believe that it was magical energy.  
But, whenever I asked the Spirit Mother...

100
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
When you asked her...?

101
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:33,732
She either said it was because your powers
 weren't fully developed.

102
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:36,190
Or, because you couldn't control it.

103
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,357
And, that was why you lost your memory.

104
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,946
That's how she answered.

105
00:06:40,946 --> 00:06:43,361
At least, to my family...

106
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:47,738
At least, to my family . . .

107
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:49,982
She should have said I was alive.

108
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:54,000
If she had, she said your life 
would have been endangered.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,300
If she told my family,

110
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,373
my life would have been in danger?

111
00:06:58,373 --> 00:06:59,998
Yes.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,200
There were a lot of times when I doubted the situation. 
But each time, she would say don't try to pry more.

113
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,000
And, not knowing is the way of life.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,247
If I wanted to protect you,
keep my mouth shut.

115
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,425
I'm sorry, Miss.

116
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:18,366
There was nothing I could do other than to keep my mouth shut.

117
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:20,733
But, Seol,

118
00:07:23,316 --> 00:07:25,772
isn't it strange?

119
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:27,941
What is?

120
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:31,249
I have no memory of receiving any blessing
 from the spirits.

121
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:33,517
Yaa?

122
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:40,329
The Spiritual Mother has never given me the blessings.

123
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
What is that?

124
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,900
If one doesn't receive the blessings, 
one cannot become a shaman.

125
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:53,586
And yet she brought me here as Sungsucheong's shaman.

126
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:58,223
And also, as a talisman shaman

127
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:00,592
and even made me enter the palace.

128
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,514
Eight years ago, Spirit Mother was the Chief Shaman at that time.

129
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:10,000
Everyone knew that she had

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,700
the favor of the Queen Dowager.

131
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,184
Isn't it strange?

132
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:19,666
Why is it that just when I became the Crown Princess, 
I received the magical illness.

133
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,600
Why was the person who saved me
 the Chief Shaman?

134
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,300
All the things I thought were from my spiritual power,

135
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
they were actually all my past memories.

136
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,591
If . . .

137
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:35,333
If it wasn't a magical illness,

138
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,119
what was it?

139
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,687
Why did Spirit Mother save me?

140
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:48,525
Was I...

141
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:52,611
really sick because I had a magical illness?

142
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:56,184
Should I ask Chief Shaman Jang directly?

143
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:58,920
No!
You can't.

144
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,199
I cannot trust anyone right now.

145
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,529
I cannot just move recklessly . . .

146
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:09,430
until I can find out

147
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,675
who the enemies are.

148
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,650
Is anyone in there?

149
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,800
Head Enunch, what brings you all the way here?

150
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,700
Is Shaman Jang

151
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,093
inside?

152
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:37,641
Spirit Mother left yesterday to pray up on the mountains.

153
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:40,000
To pray in the mountains?

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,642
How many days will she be there?

155
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,425
Pray in the mountains.

156
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:50,390
She went to pray in the mountains.

157
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,494
Yes.

158
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:57,942
She said it will take a few days since she will also be visiting the grave of her dead friend.

159
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:02,700
Just in time . . .

160
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,008
She left Sungsucheong.

161
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:07,616
It seems too suspicious

162
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,475
to call it just a coincidence.

163
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:13,278
Why are you like that?

164
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,550
I would like to get some fresh air.

165
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,932
Subtitles brought to you by the'Eclipse' Team @ viki.com

166
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,000
Your Majesty, where are you going?

167
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I was just . . .

168
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:45,199
going for a walk.

169
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:49,799
Can I...

170
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,400
prepare and share some tea with you?

171
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,800
I've already drank some.

172
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:03,732
Then . . .

173
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:06,866
Should we walk together?

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,200
A few days ago, it was very cold.

175
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,066
Now, I feel the Spring coming from the wind.

176
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,900
Wouldn't you agree?

177
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,500
Your Majesty.

178
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,866
Your Majesty.

179
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,500
What did you say,

180
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,900
Queen?

181
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:02,166
Why are you like that?

182
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,800
I . . .

183
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
will wait.

184
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,000
For what?

185
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,632
I will wait

186
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,866
for you to finally look at me.

187
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:20,399
I will not even say

188
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,566
to forget that child.

189
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,966
The King is the sun.

190
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:34,000
And I heard that the Queen is the moon.

191
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,100
Since the sun and the moon have their rightful place,

192
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:41,599
if the King wants to look at me,

193
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,299
I will

194
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:48,332
always be wherever that place may be.

195
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,600
What is...

196
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,832
this?

197
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:03,366
It's the moon embracing the sun.

198
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,800
The King is the sun,

199
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:15,399
and the Queen is the moon.

200
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,200
The white adornment is the moon.

201
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,466
It is showing that the white moon

202
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,273
is embracing the fiery sun.

203
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:26,499
I named this,

204
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:30,332
'Moon Embracing the Sun'.

205
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:35,399
Moon embracing the Sun.

206
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
 You're the only one true wife

207
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,700
in my heart, Yeon Woo.

208
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,766
Miss.

209
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,499
I'm coming in.

210
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,899
Now that you're dressed like this,

211
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,699
you look like a beautiful woman.

212
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,800
It's pretty.

213
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,500
Was I ever a man?

214
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
When you've accomplished the favor I asked,

215
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,300
come to the medical relief center.

216
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,400
Let's go.

217
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes.

218
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:12,466
Am I free now?

219
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:20,032
The King was able to persuade the council

220
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:23,132
and issued an order to remove the guards 
from your place.

221
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,899
That's what he commanded.

222
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,666
My, oh my,

223
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:30,399
How can I be so thankful.

224
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,799
Where are you going?

225
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:54,332
You must not...

226
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:56,032
go.

227
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:58,866
Why are you stopping me,
without knowing where I'm going.

228
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:01,366
Are you not . . .

229
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:03,632
going to the medical relief center?

230
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:06,166
Oh,

231
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,799
An old friend is certainly different.

232
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,366
But . . .

233
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:13,532
why can't I go?

234
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,400
Because that child is also the King's person?

235
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,399
Your Excellency!

236
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,332
Heo Yeon Woo.

237
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,566
If it's that child, it might be.

238
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,700
But,

239
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,332
since it's Shaman Wol,

240
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:31,699
it is a different story, isn't it?

241
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:36,232
The King might have kept her close 
because she reminded him of her.

242
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:37,732
But, not I.

243
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,400
I...

244
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:42,632
I just . . .

245
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,500
like that . . .

246
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,866
Shaman Wol, for herself.

247
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:53,000
Isn't it better to see her as my person, 
rather than the King's?

248
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,666
Isn't that right?

249
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:01,299
You are a prince, Your Excellency.

250
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:06,099
That burdensome title . . .

251
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:10,299
The freedom to disregard  it . . .

252
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:14,232
is not something privy to the King.

253
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:17,366
But, I alone have it.

254
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
You still haven't found her?

255
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,832
Hasn't it been four days?

256
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:31,832
Even if she's a criminal, shouldn't you at least make an effort to find her?

257
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:32,999
Then,

258
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,399
just to find one escaped lewd shaman,

259
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,732
does the entire nation have to look for her?

260
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:42,200
If a criminal has disappeared,

261
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,768
that's under the Judicial department's jurisdiction.

262
00:18:44,768 --> 00:18:47,901
Why are you harassing an innocent person?

263
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:50,662
My Lord!

264
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,198
What is the problem?

265
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:56,132
Our daughter is dying!
Please help me!

266
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:59,111
Just wait patiently till the doctor comes.

267
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:02,162
It's been a long time since

268
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:04,394
there has been a doctor here.

269
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,572
Please get a doctor from another area.

270
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:08,963
Our daugher will just die!

271
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:12,650
Another doctor?  Hey, if you have money, then why don't you get another doctor.

272
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,599
What are you doing when someone is dying?

273
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
Aren't you ashamed as a government official?

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,900
This guy now really, meddling in other people's business!

275
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,932
If you've done your business, hurry up and leave.

276
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,166
Stop annoying me.

277
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:32,376
The palace stopped supporting us,
 so more people are dying!

278

 Subtitles brought to you by The 'Eclipse' Team @ Viki.com

280
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:10,131
Straighten your back.

281
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:12,800
Can you breath?

282
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,000
This isn't simple vomiting and diarrhea
 but an intestinal convulsion.

283
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,478
Bring some salt water and ginger. We must regurgitate the rotten food to unblock the clogged vessel.

284
00:21:27,478 --> 00:21:28,376
Yes.

285
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:29,886
Do you know acupuncture?

286
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,905
Then, estimulate her Wi Jung point.

287
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:33,345
Yes.

288
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,300
Please wait.
The pain will soon go away.

289
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:46,138
Hold her!

290
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,555
Please hold her tight.

291
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,635
You have to drink it!

292
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:58,286
What are you doing?
Why aren't you helping?! 
She has to drink it. Hold her nose.

293
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:13,210
Gu Sul Ah! 
 Finally you're still alive.

294
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:17,042
Gu Sul Ah!

295
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,400
Did all the stains come out?

296
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,361
I did clean the dirty parts,
But it didn't clean all the way.

297
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:56,155
Since when did you start practicing medicine?

298
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,138
Practice medicine?  You can't even call it that.

299
00:22:58,138 --> 00:23:02,363
There are plenty of fake doctors like me out there.

300
00:23:02,989 --> 00:23:05,225
My teacher, from long ago,

301
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:06,905
taught me a few things about medicine.

302
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,400
He said that knowledge could save many people.  
So I read a few books on medicine.

303
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:19,300
So my fellow classmates and I have 
some basic knowledge of medicine.

304
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:22,856
The Teacher . . .

305
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:26,571
must have been a good person.

306
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,500
Best of all,

307
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,588
he was a good person.

308
00:23:36,588 --> 00:23:40,907
He was like a father figure to me.

309
00:23:40,907 --> 00:23:45,405
Academically and emotionally, he was my mentor.

310
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:48,291
He helped guide me to the right path.

311
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:53,585
He was very strict, but taught me 
how to be free-willed.

312
00:23:53,585 --> 00:23:56,664
Not just to me as a noble,
 but also to the poor,

313
00:23:56,664 --> 00:24:01,338
he always treated them with respect and honesty.

314
00:24:11,913 --> 00:24:15,890
It was a chaotic day.

315
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:21,008
You helped a lot of people today.

316
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:23,978
I'm glad to have met you again.

317
00:24:25,473 --> 00:24:27,872
It must have been hard . . .

318
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:32,207
It must have been unspeakably painful . . .

319
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:34,615
Yet, I'm thankful you're alive.

320
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:36,997
Thank you.

321
00:24:38,572 --> 00:24:43,106
Don't worry.
I won't come again.

322
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:47,798
I was just worried when I heard the news
that you were missing.

323
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:50,342
Since I see that you're alive

324
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:52,849
and well,

325
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:56,279
even including your ugly face . . .

326
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:00,712
So, I'm satisfied now.

327
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,770
Then . . .

328
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,346
Stay well.

329
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,781
Wait, Sir!

330
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:14,303
Wait!

331
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Why are you like this?

332
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,300
Thanks to you, we've received so much help.

333
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:29,300
I'm sorry,
but can you come again?

334
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,200
Me?

335
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,700
Why?

336
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,200
There's a dearth of capable doctors in the medical office.

337
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:40,418
They keep getting assigned to other places.

338
00:25:40,418 --> 00:25:42,900
But, I'm...

339
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,200
Sir.

340
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,700
Ah... wherever I go, I'm always so popular.

341
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,400
What should I do?

342
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:57,965
You're still the same.

343
00:25:57,965 --> 00:25:59,994
Your name "highly distinguished"

344
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:03,652
matches well with you.

345
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:21,355
So, then . . .

346
00:26:21,355 --> 00:26:23,082
Is she doing well?

347
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,700
In my eyes,
she is.

348
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,900
What about her health?

349
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
Has she recovered well?

350
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,600
In my eyes,

351
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,400
it looked like she was overcoming it well.

352
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,900
What about my older brother?

353
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,300
Is he well?

354
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
Didn't you stop off at  his house?

355
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,400
No, I did.

356
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,264
He looks well after releasing from house arrest.

357
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:58,539
Woon.

358
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:00,538
Yes, Your Majesty.

359
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:03,810
There's something you're hiding from me.

360
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,405
You're clumsy when you lie.

361
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:11,600
Whenever you try to lie for my sake,

362
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,900
your eyes betray you first.

363
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:18,887
Is my older brother

364
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:24,606
with that child?

365
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,600
Why would the special investigator meet with the King?

366
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,400
He wouldn't be calling him in just to become friends with him.

367
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Something fishy is going on.  Don't you agree?

368
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,700
If we ask the King why,

369
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,400
he would say it was to discuss the suicide of the former head eunuch.

370
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
That's also something strange.

371
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,400
This case should be investigated and conducted
by the Ministry of Justice.

372
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,572
However, the King asked the Royal Investigation 
Bureau to investigate it . . .

373
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,800
Having the Royal Investigation Bureau investigate something unrelated to rebellion or treason,

374
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,310
there's definitely a hidden agenda behind it.

375
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:43,738
There was something he wanted to know about his father's  personal assets.
So he goes and ask to the previous enunch.

376
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:49,105
But instead of coming to the palace,
the enunch commits suicide.

377
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,100
About the nation's coffers, it may be possible but
[The eunuch managed the personal funds of the king]

378
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:59,800
It is impossible to find out about how the king's personal funds were used unless you are an eunuch.

379
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,305
So, only the Royal Investigation Bereau is 
able to conduct an investigation...

380
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:11,872
Why is it that our King doesn't have any weak spots.

381
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:14,372
It makes it harder for us to do anything.

382
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:16,438
The issue about the secret fund

383
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:19,272
is probably just an excuse for what is really going on.

384
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:21,772
The truth is that

385
00:29:21,772 --> 00:29:26,972
he must be investigating the incident
 from 8 years ago.

386
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,900
On the surface, he makes it seem like he is 
investigating the personal funds.
But, in reality,

387
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,400
is he chasing something else?

388
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:39,707
For that Hong Gyu Tae guy,

389
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:43,300
we need to get someone to spy on him.

390
00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:49,472
I'm sorry, but because the case was so long ago, 
it is hard to get information about the case.

391
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:53,372
It is hard to find anyone who was involved in the case.

392
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:57,300
If you have anyone you know will be able to testify,
 I will try to meet them and-

393
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,227
For a curse that could be able 
to curse the Crown Princess,

394
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:03,900
unlike the usual, there must have been 
something special that went on.

395
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,100
Court Lady Noh

396
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,172
Yes?

397
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,205
Go and look for Court Lady Noh.

398
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:12,744
She was responsible for the Princess' training.

399
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,351
She must know about something.

400
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:17,991
The night the Princess fainted,

401
00:30:17,991 --> 00:30:20,871
ask about the details.

402
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:24,900
Also, since the Prince Consort is back
 from his travels.

403
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,900
If there was something you overlooked in your investigation about the Crown Princess,

404
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:31,596
you need to look into it again.

405
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:33,997
I will heed the command.

406
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:36,807
Your Majesty, it is I, Woon.

407
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:38,762
Come in.

408
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,900
There seems to be some movements from the Supreme Judge (Young Sang).

409
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,100
Did you hear?

410
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,600
Yes, I did.

411
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,400
You must be careful of your surroundings.

412
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,979
I am the Special Investigator.

413
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:02,204
I may not be able to match Woon, 
but I am able to protect myself.

414
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,870

415
00:31:11,571 --> 00:31:17,400
Please find Court Lady Noh who taught
etiquette at the Eun Wol Gak.

416
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,023
She must know something

417
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:23,563
about what happened to me.

418
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,300
I'm asking this of you, Seol.

419
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:38,875
She was smart, beautiful

420
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:42,285
and a warm-hearted person.

421
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:45,886
The day she had to leave the palace . . .

422
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:47,840
In front of the palace annex,

423
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,700
the two looking at each other

424
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,700
with such sad looks on their faces.

425
00:31:54,449 --> 00:31:56,678
I still see it.

426
00:31:56,678 --> 00:32:00,518
Was there anything unusual back then?

427
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,100
Such as the palace maids being changed.

428
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,300
Or, the food changed.

429
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,900
Or, if someone came to see her.

430
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,614
Please tell me everything you remember.

431
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:14,686
Well...

432
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:17,930
Nothing unusual that I remember...

433
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:24,621
Ah, that night the Princess came

434
00:32:24,621 --> 00:32:27,411
to see the Crown Princess.

435
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:30,015
The Princess?

436
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:34,444
Since she was once the little Princess' playmate,

437
00:32:34,444 --> 00:32:37,678
I just thought that she came to visit to see
 how the Crown Princess was doing.

438
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:40,811
So did she meet the Crown Princess and leave?

439
00:32:40,811 --> 00:32:43,418
No.

440
00:32:43,418 --> 00:32:47,844
She seemed lost in thought.

441
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:51,749
For some reason, she did not go inside.

442
00:32:51,749 --> 00:32:54,678
But, after asking about the Crown Princess' health,

443
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:57,244
she left.

444
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:14,611
May I ask you something?

445
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:18,044
I am looking for ex-court Lady Noh's house.

446
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:21,578
I heard she lives somewhere here.
Do you know where?

447
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:23,578
Did you say court lady?

448
00:33:23,578 --> 00:33:25,682
It's at the end.

449
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:28,011
Over there?
Yeah.

450
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:30,511
Thank you.

451
00:34:29,544 --> 00:34:32,652
Another person's life...

452
00:34:33,631 --> 00:34:35,111
has ended.

453
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:38,811
Please punish me who has not fulfilled your command.

454
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:41,511
Why is it your fault?

455
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:43,244
Just realize that . . .

456
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:45,944
You could have lost your life too.

457
00:34:45,944 --> 00:34:48,544
This is all my fault.

458
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,892
I left everyone concerned in this matter in danger.

459
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,978
Nonsense.

460
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:56,615
Your life is now in danger.

461
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:02,344
If you want to quit, say it without hesitation.
I will allow you to.

462
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:05,411
I've already given my life to you,

463
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:08,911
No matter how dangerous it is, I . . .

464
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:12,344
will not stop.

465
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,811
Thank you.

466
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:19,331
I will never forget you.

467
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:22,844
Thank you, Your Majesty.

468
00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:26,544
It's true that the deeper we delve,

469
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:29,478
the more it leads us to nowhere.

470
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:33,311
Through this, there is one thing I'm sure of,

471
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:37,144
There may be no factual evidence, but

472
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:40,844
there is one live enemy.

473
00:36:00,513 --> 00:36:02,011
Did you visit the library just now?

474
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:05,111
I visited the library to read some books,

475
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:07,111
in order to find a theme.

476
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:10,344
So, have you found the theme?

477
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:15,178
Fortunately I discovered one interesting book.

478
00:36:15,178 --> 00:36:17,811
Interesting book?

479
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:21,044
I am curious about the contents.

480
00:36:21,044 --> 00:36:23,479
May I hear it?

481
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:27,063
Since Your Majesty has asked,

482
00:36:27,063 --> 00:36:30,530
then I have to explain it.

483
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,130
There is a saying "Myung Bul Sang Cha,"

484
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,663
"Jik Bul Gak Gyu Ha Myun"

485
00:36:36,663 --> 00:36:38,993
"Si Ee Duk"

486
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:41,359
A smart man is one who should

487
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,226
know when not to blame or point out other's mistake,

488
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:45,959
even though he may be absolutely right.

489
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:49,126
As long he does not protest too strongly 
for the purpose of correcting others,

490
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:51,659
this is a beautiful virtue.

491
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:55,159
You are trying to say: stop investigating 
the Princess' death 8 years ago.

492
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:58,393
Do you now understand, Your Majesty?

493
00:36:58,393 --> 00:37:00,659
It is a well-stated writing.

494
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:02,793
But . . .

495
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:06,429
If one doesn't try to correct the things that are wrong
 and, instead, cover up everything,

496
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:09,196
how can one say that is the action of a man of virtue.

497
00:37:09,196 --> 00:37:12,239
And more importantly . . . 
people saying to ignore the truth...

498
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,863
and to covering up what really happened . . . Being aware of those kind of people

499
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:19,229
Is that what a virtuous man should do?

500
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:21,110
However . . .

501
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:24,143
Not thinking about consequences

502
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:27,276
and relying on just knowledge and arrogance,

503
00:37:27,276 --> 00:37:31,843
can create a horrible situation in the future. 
Who will be blamed?

504
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:34,682
Knowing the right timing to act for adrenaline rush.

505
00:37:34,682 --> 00:37:37,443
Isn't that the meaning of politics?

506
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:40,343
This will be a perfect topic

507
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:44,876
to debate with the Scholars.

508
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:47,510
I will try to use this in tonight's discussion.

509
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,476
I am very grateful.

510
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:55,110
This servant only wishes you to receive great honor.

511
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,636
Please,

512
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:59,403
Do not forget.

513
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:05,069
If you do not stop here,

514
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:07,703
it will become dangerous.

515
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:23,436
The Princess did?

516
00:38:27,636 --> 00:38:31,303
Yes.
Do you remember something?

517
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:34,636
Let's see...

518
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:37,836
You, shaman, over there.

519
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:40,569
go to Hyeminsuh and get some medicines.

520
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,700
Yes.

521
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,000
If you dawdle or are careless,

522
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,269
I won't let you off.

523
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:50,336
Do you understand?

524
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:56,369
I'll go, so you should stay here.

525
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:58,403
No.

526
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:01,636
You have somewhere you should go with me.

527
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:54,236
Father.

528
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:10,069
It's me, Yeon Woo.

529
00:40:10,903 --> 00:40:14,269
Chief Scholar's daughter, you may give 
your answer now.

530
00:40:15,036 --> 00:40:19,836
Compared to all the young ladies in the world,

531
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:25,069
I trust our daughter to be the most 
able and virtuous.

532
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:27,536
I am glad that your embrace is

533
00:40:27,536 --> 00:40:30,769
a reminder orabeoni.

534
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:34,603
Live in my embrace forever.

535
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:43,203
Father . . . Father . . . Father.

536
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:59,200
Father!

537

538
00:41:19,885 --> 00:41:21,742
Are you okay?

539
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:25,934
Yes.
Husband.

540
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,900
It would have been better if you stayed home
since the road is dangerous.

541
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,600
I was the one who decided to come.

542
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:35,242
I'm going to meet Father,

543
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,200
This is nothing.

544
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,400
You are a person whom I can learn many things from.

545
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,800
Yes?

546
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:46,967
Me?

547
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:52,900
You've a skill for making your surroundings more bright.

548
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,100
Thank you.

549
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,100
You're like that again.

550
00:41:57,278 --> 00:42:02,304
You don't need to use the word thank you,
between husband and wife.

551
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,800
Rather than me,

552
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,853
please support mother.

553
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,000
After visiting the doctor a few days ago,

554
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,300
she seems really sad and depressed.

555
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,700
It looks like someone came by.

556
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:13,655
That I can still smell the incense, means someone was here not long ago.

557
00:43:13,655 --> 00:43:18,310
Did Yang Myung come by?

558
00:43:30,745 --> 00:43:32,467
Yeom.

559
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:34,334
Yes, Mother.

560
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:39,267
Your Father . . .

561
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,334
didn't die of disease.

562
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:46,367
Yes?

563
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:48,300
Then . . .

564
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,817
Your Father . . .

565
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,800
committed suicide.

566
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,900
After he sent off

567
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,700
Yeon Woo,

568
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,600
everyday he lived in pain.

569
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,034
After Yeon Woo died,

570
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:22,300
he blamed himself

571
00:44:24,134 --> 00:44:27,300
and was always in pain.

572
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,500
Yeom,

573
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,468
After your wedding ceremony with the Princess,

574
00:44:34,468 --> 00:44:36,434
finally,

575
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,000
it seemed like he had accomplished 
everything he needed to do.

576
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,900
After fighting within himself . . .

577
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,400
He,

578
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:48,586
by himself,

579
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,200
killed himself like that.

580
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,000
For letting his

581
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:02,434
child go before him,

582
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:09,800
the sadness crumbled up his heart.

583
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,300
That heart . . .

584
00:45:14,867 --> 00:45:19,634
Who would know it?

585
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,500
Sir.

586
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,700
Are you well?

587
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,367
Not long ago,

588
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:36,200
I saw a girl that looked like Yeon Woo.

589
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,200
It can't be her, right?

590
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,929
She was being shunned

591
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:46,167
and being stoned.

592
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:50,334
Our Yeon Woo must not be living like that, right?

593
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:53,267
Please say no!

594
00:45:53,267 --> 00:46:00,460
Tell me that our Yeon Woo is there with you,

595
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:07,367
and living in peace.

596
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,900
Sir!

597
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,000
Miss.

598
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:53,267
It was because of me.

599
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:59,934
Because of me...

600
00:47:01,734 --> 00:47:04,734
I made Father die.

601
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:05,900
Miss!

602
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,700
Then, I was so young,

603
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,265
I thought if I died,

604
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,800
I would save everyone.

605
00:47:16,481 --> 00:47:18,834
Back then,

606
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:24,268
I should have begged to live; to be saved.

607
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:26,530
Miss,

608
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,834
Reveal that you're alive right now.

609
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:32,649
At least for Madam's sake.

610
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,372
Seol, you can't either.

611
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:40,504
You said it was to save me

612
00:47:40,794 --> 00:47:44,763
and my family.

613
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:47,753
I am . . .

614
00:47:47,753 --> 00:47:49,934
the same now.

615
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,500
About my death,

616
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,300
there definitely is a hidden dark truth.

617
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,283
Maybe, everyone in my family and even the King

618
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,900
can be in danger because of it.

619
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:09,392
Before the truth is revealed,

620
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,100
Heo Yeon Woo,

621
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,200
must remain a dead person.

622
00:48:35,367 --> 00:48:38,334
Aren't these girls from the Office of Royal Shamans?

623
00:48:38,334 --> 00:48:40,817
For what reason have you come to the Palace?

624
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:43,934
We were told you heard a spirit crying in the Hidden Moon Pavillion,

625
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:47,134
and received the command of the Queen Dowager to attend to you.

626
00:48:47,134 --> 00:48:49,900
Ah, I see.

627
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,134
Work hard all of you.

628
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,000
Wait.
Wait there!

629
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:21,700
Why are you here?

630
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,300
Yes?

631
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,800
You were supposed to be at the charity office doing community service.  So why are you here?

632
00:49:27,877 --> 00:49:32,667
The person that was supposed to go was not me, 
but the bad-energy absorbing shaman.

633
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:35,334
Then are you not that bad-energy absorbing shaman?

634
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:44,610
I was the talisman for only that day in the palace hall,
and Shaman Wol was at the West Infirmary.

635
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,834
What did you say?

636
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,034
Wol.

637
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:12,167
Court Lady Jo.

638
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:13,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

639
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,200
Send someone to West infirmary immediately
 and find her.

640
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,167
Bring the Shaman Wol to me.

641
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:26,104
No one . . .

642
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:30,800
must know.

643
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,634
Yes, Your Majesty.

644
00:50:54,572 --> 00:51:00,269
Since you caught that, there is no choice but
we have become enemies.

645
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:05,134
We are playing grasshopper game right now, and 
you caught our team's grasshopper.

646
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,200
You are now our enemy!

647
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,600
You don't understand me?

648
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,300
I'm telling you to join their team.

649
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,200
Now, let's start!

650
00:52:02,534 --> 00:52:07,234
Hurry!
Hurry!

651
00:52:07,234 --> 00:52:10,300
Hurry!

652
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,100
1, 2, 3!

653
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,000
Wait!
Why did you fool us?

654
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,300
I never fooled anyone.

655
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:37,034
Wet your lips with your saliva and then lie.

656
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:39,900
-Give that to me!
-No!

657
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,200
Come, our turn.

658
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,967
Oh.

659
00:53:38,922 --> 00:53:43,600
Sir, why are you like this?

660
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,100
Sir, why are you like this?

661
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:08,239
I was standing in an awkward position with the stick,

662
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:10,773
so that I was about to fall.

663
00:54:10,773 --> 00:54:13,706
I didn't have any other intentions.

664
00:54:13,706 --> 00:54:16,173
Let's stop playing now.

665
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,839
Your Majesty . . .

666
00:54:39,506 --> 00:54:42,439
Don't say a single word.

667
00:54:42,439 --> 00:54:46,173
Not a single word.

668
00:54:50,273 --> 00:54:52,439
Good Bye.

669
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:55,573
Let's go home!

670
00:55:05,206 --> 00:55:08,006
Are you okay now?

671
00:55:08,006 --> 00:55:09,573
Yes?

672
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:13,639
What were you thinking about just now that made you look so gloomy?

673
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:15,806
Then,

674
00:55:15,806 --> 00:55:19,206
is that why you called me over to play?

675
00:55:21,773 --> 00:55:25,506
Playing with those innocent 
and bright children,

676
00:55:25,506 --> 00:55:27,206
all things that happened in the world,

677
00:55:27,206 --> 00:55:30,206
all worries and troubles,

678
00:55:30,206 --> 00:55:33,773
will disappear. It's the only way to lift away
 all the burdens.

679
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:36,206
Thanks to you,

680
00:55:36,206 --> 00:55:39,242
my heart did get lighter.

681
00:55:39,973 --> 00:55:45,239
And was it not because you were playing with
a handsome man, the awesome me?

682
00:55:46,306 --> 00:55:49,606
It's a relief that you are a shaman

683
00:55:49,606 --> 00:55:52,317
so that you can be by my side,

684
00:55:52,317 --> 00:55:56,806
and for me to see you smile.

685
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:07,373
Use this to play tomorrow.

686
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:09,473
Give it here.

687
00:56:09,473 --> 00:56:10,706
Why?

688
00:56:10,706 --> 00:56:13,373
Are you trying to practice beforehand?

689
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:15,539
No.

690
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:19,139
It's too pretty to be used for games.

691
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:22,806
Something that will relieve my worries, I'll be

692
00:56:22,806 --> 00:56:24,939
using it as problem solving stone.

693
00:56:24,939 --> 00:56:26,539
Really?

694
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,600
That's not a bad idea.

695
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,200
Then, this

696
00:56:37,173 --> 00:56:41,173
is a present for you.

697
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,406
Shaman,

698
00:56:45,406 --> 00:56:48,573
I told you to bring the medicine.

699
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:50,706
Why are you just coming now?

700
00:56:50,706 --> 00:56:52,539
I'll go right now.

701
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:55,273
Thank you for the present.

702
00:56:55,273 --> 00:56:57,973
Please go safely.

703
00:57:12,073 --> 00:57:15,206
Welcome, Chief Shaman.

704
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:23,139
Did anything happen while I was gone?

705
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:26,540
There was a command

706
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,773
for you to come to the King's palace upon return.

707
00:57:28,773 --> 00:57:30,073
Tonight,

708
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:32,139
we will do our celebration prayer,

709
00:57:32,139 --> 00:57:34,406
I will go into the palace tomorrow morning.

710
00:57:37,673 --> 00:57:40,539
Chief Shaman!

711
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:44,673
Seol Unni . . .

712
00:57:46,706 --> 00:57:49,206
dressed like a girl.

713
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,500
Father,

714
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:26,206
Until I know everything,

715
00:58:26,206 --> 00:58:28,239
all my worries and sorrow,

716
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:29,739
I will bury it here .  . .

717
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,039
for a while.

718
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,600
For every step I will take from today onwards,

719
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,200
please watch over me.

720
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,600
Are you the Shaman, Wol?

721
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:55,773
Yes, that is right.

722
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,400
Who are you?

723
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,200
The Queen wishes to see you.

724
00:59:07,306 --> 00:59:09,773
[Korean Folk Village Location]

725
00:59:11,106 --> 00:59:14,039
 Something that will relieve my worries and sorrow,

726
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:17,673
I'm considering to use it as a problem solving stone.

727
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:21,473
Are your worries keeping you from going to sleep?

728
00:59:21,473 --> 00:59:23,715
This stone. Called trouble solving stone.

729
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,000
It takes the place of all your worries.

730
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,200
"Trouble solving stone?"

731
00:59:37,306 --> 00:59:41,206
Thank you for your advice.  But...

732
00:59:54,606 --> 00:59:56,639
Hyungnim.

733
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:37,173
Why are you so...

734
01:00:39,339 --> 01:00:41,373
reckless?

735
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:45,500
What do you mean?

736
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:48,539
I heard that you often go to

737
01:00:48,939 --> 01:00:52,606
the medical facility.

738
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:59,239
I don't go there often,
but everyday.

739
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,200
A woman of my heart has fallen into a hardship
 and is shunned.

740
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,800
How can someone who calls himself a man
just pretend not to notice?

741
01:01:08,506 --> 01:01:09,739
Hyungnim...

742
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:12,839
I told you!

743
01:01:13,373 --> 01:01:17,206
I don't care about my title.

744
01:01:17,706 --> 01:01:21,573
I am willing to throw everything away.

745
01:01:21,573 --> 01:01:24,306
Did you forget?

746
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,873
The command I gave you not to go near,

747
01:01:26,873 --> 01:01:28,739
are you going against it?!

748
01:01:28,739 --> 01:01:29,506
Your Majesty!

749
01:01:29,506 --> 01:01:32,173
Hyungnim!

750
01:01:58,706 --> 01:02:03,839
Queen, I have brought Shaman Wol.

751
01:02:20,706 --> 01:02:22,539
Give your greetings to

752
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:25,806
The Queen.

753
