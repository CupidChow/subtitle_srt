00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,050
Episode 5

2
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:45,105
From now, we will start with basic etiquette.

3
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,250
When you're making your bow, do it slowly so that the candles do not flicker

4
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,150
And, you need to do so quietly.

5
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,150
When you enter the palace for your wedding, your body should be curved like a bow.

6
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,050
maintain your posture and don't drop your chin.

7
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:19,256
Did you have a good night?

8
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:22,798
From today, your intense practice will start.

9
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,250
Although it's a tough and difficult process, I believe that if it's you, Yeon Woo,

10
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,150
you will be able to do it.

11
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,150
Lady No is probably feeling overwhelmed.

12
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,046
These are the snacks that the Crown Prince sent over.

13
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,950
There's a lot of security within the palace, so I won't be able to go and meet you right away.

14
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,050
But I will treasure the moment.

15
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,941
So, I will wait for

16
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,181
the day until you and I meet as husband and wife.

17
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,350
Are you all prepared?

18
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:03,277
Yes.

19
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,050
Did you bring her here? 
Yes.

20
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,250
There's a paper noting the child's birth information and the clothes that she wore at her house.

21
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,114
Let's start then.

22
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,050
Now,

23
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,506
is everything done?

24
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:01,096
That's right.

25
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:06,153
When will we be able to confirm that she is dead?

26
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:14,668
That's...

27
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:18,074
something that's not within my ability.

28
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:20,695
Didn't you perform an incantation ritual to take the life of that child?

29
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:26,530
It's a destiny decided by the heaven. There's no ritual that is able to defy the wishes of the heaven.

30
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:30,467
Do you mean that you can't be certain?

31
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:36,050
Don't worry.  
She will contract an unknown disease

32
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:40,031
and eventually that will take her life.

33
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,904
In any case, if she dies suddenly, people will get suspicious.

34
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,422
That's for the best.

35
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:55,426
Even if he's the King, he won't be able to keep someone who's ill.

36
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:58,395
If it were not for the security of the palace,

37
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,450
that child's life would be in our hands, not decided by the heavens.

38
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:07,162
That's for the best.

39
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,546
But,

40
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,592
if she dosen't die by the time she's supposed to,

41
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:16,085
you'll have to kill her with your own hands.

42
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,583
This...

43
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,949
Are you scared about that?

44
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,550
Everything has ended, so don't be nervous about it anymore.

45
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,119
Don't worry.

46
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:55,531
You'd be able to get whatever you want now.

47
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,450
My lady...

48
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:09,781
Lady Pingong... Go and get the royal physician now. Quick!

49
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,732
Yes.

50
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:14,442
My lady,

51
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:17,750
can you hear me?

52
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,650
My lady!

53
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,716
My lady!

54
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:28,250
Please allow the child who is to be the Crown Prince's betrothed to leave the palace, Your Majesty.

55
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,650
She has been ill for several days and shows no signs of recovery.

56
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,750
This is obviously

57
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,950
not an illness that she contracted recently and not an illness that can be cured easily.

58
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,950
Although there has been no 
wedding ceremony yet, she's no different than 
actually being the Crown Prince's wife.

59
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,150
It's only right that she should stay in the palace while receiving treatment.

60
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,250
You must not allow someone ill to live in the palace.

61
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,550
If the illness spreads in the palace,

62
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,850
how will you be able to handle that adversity?

63
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,850
Oh ho! You're too much! Are you implying
that the Crown Prince's betrothed

64
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,250
has contracted  an incurable disease?!
 - It's not a common disease.

65
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,250
It may be an epidemic disease and
 even the Royal Physician can't tell what it is. 
Are you saying she can't be treated?!

66
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:12,302
If she's able to be treated, she should recover soon.

67
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:16,249
Your Majesty
your subject, Minister of the Interior Yoon Dae Hyeong, has something to say.

68
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:19,307
The Crown Prince's wife is someone

69
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:22,193
who has to serve the Crown Prince.

70
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,750
There's no matter that's more important than this when it comes to serving the royal family.

71
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:32,426
How can we have someone who is unwell to serve the country's son?

72
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,705
Waiting impotently for someone to get

73
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:40,026
treated would have an adverse impact on national affairs.

74
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,650
You have to find a solution soon.

75
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:46,172
So,

76
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,949
what's that solution you have in mind?

77
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,950
You have to make another wiser choice, putting aside the Crown Prince's betrothed,

78
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,950
who has contracted an illness.

79
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:07,036
And, you have to see that Heo Yeong Jae from the Office of Special Councillors

80
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,550
be punished for hiding the fact his daughter was afflicted with an illness

81
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,250
and even offered his own daughter to the Prince.

82
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,050
Why did you come without contacting me in advance of your arrival?

83
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,350
We cannot allow someone who's not well to continue to stay in the palace,

84
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,050
so there was a decree for us to have her removed from the palace.

85
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,750
Why is it so sudden?

86
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,450
Then, give me some time to pack.

87
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,450
It could be a disease which is infectious,

88
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,350
so all the items which have been used here must be destroyed.

89
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,250
Don't leave anything behind and take away everything.

90
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:04,275
Can't you step aside?

91
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:10,037
She's my Crown Princess!

92
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,750
What person has the gall to order that she be sent away?

93
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,450
Step aside!

94
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,150
Your Highness, please preserve your health.

95
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,150
Step aside!

96
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:44,116
Your Highness...

97
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,089
Yeon Woo...

98
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,050
Yeon Woo...

99
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,150
Yeon Woo...

100
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,150
Yeon Woo... Yeon Woo!

101
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:07,307
Yeon Woo!

102
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:09,453
Yeon Woo!

103
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:12,151
Yeon Woo!

104
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:13,960
Yeon Woo!

105
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,150
She's my Crown Princess!

106
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,250
Move aside!

107
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,783
Yeon Woo!

108
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:24,532
Move Aside!

109
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,250
Yeon Woo!

110
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,950
Yeon Woo!

111
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,650
Yeon Woo!

112
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:34,385
Yeon Woo!

113
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,750
Yeon Woo!

114
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,150
You have to take note of the Crown Prince.

115
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,450
I'm sure he will do something about it if the Chief Scholar's daughter

116
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,834
has been sent out of the palace.

117
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,250
He still doesn't know about politics yet.

118
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,150
Do you think so? Love is just love.

119
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,007
When the palace was in much chaos because of the Crown Prince's wife selection,

120
00:13:58,007 --> 00:14:01,662
the Eastern Palace was tranquil. But,

121
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:03,623
Sungkyunkwan has interceded in the matter.

122
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:06,733
Sungkyunkwan has always been neutral,

123
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:10,983
but their involvement in the matter has caused much uproar in the court.

124
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,703
Because of that, it has created a deep impact
 on His Majesty.

125
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:15,802
The same can be said of Sigangwon.

126
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:20,229
Sigangwon which was thought to be a playground by Crown Prince,

127
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:22,897
is a place where all our people come from.

128
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:25,355
And, there's Heo Yeong Jae's son, Heo Yeom,

129
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,315
who has finally been accepted as a teacher.

130
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,160
It's not that the Crown Prince is unaware of politics,

131
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,900
he's just lying low until he gets

132
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,109
the power to change or move things.

133
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,537
Don't you need to cut off a branch

134
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:53,160
when the tree is still young

135
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,172
to shape the tree in the way you want?

136
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:07,116
Crown Prince...

137
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:15,160
Queen Dowager...

138
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:23,169
You should be feeling very upset.

139
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,648
Crown Prince...

140
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,357
Yes, Queen Dowager.

141
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,164
You should forget

142
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:35,710
about that child now.

143
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:40,088
She's someone who was my wife-to-be.

144
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:43,946
How could I forget her easily? 
You need to forget her.

145
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:46,225
Only with that, would the child

146
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:49,611
and the palace be peaceful. 
Queen Dowager...

147
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:52,092
Just be quiet about it.

148
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:56,147
There was a reason for it.

149
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,163
What's that?

150
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,581
Who determined what was reasonable

151
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,786
for me?

152
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,357
Crown Prince,

153
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:17,169
what can you obtain by letting Sungkyunkwan
 create an uproar about it?

154
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:22,994
You'd only get the support of those students. There's nothing that you get out of it.

155
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:26,954
She's a child who would have been able to live an ordinary life

156
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:30,602
if His Majesty and you hadn't been so ambitious.

157
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:34,067
What issue would there be if she has contracted

158
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:38,341
an illness if she hadn't been chosen 
to be the Crown Prince's wife?

159
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,328
She would have been able to recover under

160
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:44,658
the care and concern of her mother.

161
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:46,874
Think,

162
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:48,470
who would be happy, if

163
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,894
you decide to make a fuss out of this issue?

164
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,367
It'd be your fault if the child

165
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:57,110
suffers misfortune.

166
00:16:58,138 --> 00:17:01,275
If the wings of her brother are snapped off,

167
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:03,703
it would be your fault too.

168
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:09,606
It would also be your fault if His Majesty loses his trustworthiness.

169
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:15,064
Everything would be your fault if the family is catastrophically brought down.

170
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:19,760
If something has been violated, 
there would naturally be consequences,

171
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,396
that's being logical.

172
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:22,294
So,

173
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:25,843
they are people who have been through much disaster.

174
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:28,586
It's logic which people try

175
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,818
to follow, so they won't get hurt;

176
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:36,135
so they won't get broken up.

177
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:41,756
So,

178
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:44,149
stay still about it.

179
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:48,165
Be quiet about it.

180
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,650
Only with that

181
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:58,297
will she not be hurt.

182
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,303
Oh really, it's really strange.

183
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:12,197
This is the first time I've come across such a thing in my 30 years of medical experience.

184
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:16,302
All her internal organs and limbs are fine and her heart beat is normal.

185
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,220
Yet, such a strange thing happened.

186
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:20,004
Aigoo...

187
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:24,148
This is something really mysterious.

188
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:28,128
Yeon Woo, what happened?

189
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:33,428
I say, please try to save Yeon Woo.
 If you can save her,

190
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:35,470
I'll agree to whatever you say.

191
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:39,308
For now, I'll try using the medicine,

192
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:40,834
but don't expect much.

193
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,707
Don't say something so irresponsible.

194
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:45,963
She's in much so much pain. Shouldn't you,
 at least, try to ease her pain?!

195
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:48,150
I say, what disrespect is this!

196
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,150
Yeom...

197
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,150
Please calm down, mother.

198
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:54,625
Please save her.

199
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:59,487
I'll agree to anything that you request.

200
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,405
If you want my life,

201
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:06,235
I'll give my life to you. 
So, please save Yeon Woo...

202
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:08,607
Please save Yeon Woo.

203
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:12,820
Mother! 
--My wife!

204
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:16,147
Take her to her room. Quickly. 
Yes.

205
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:24,202
You should follow them too.

206
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,892
- New greetings to you. 
 - Who are you?

207
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:58,824
I'm the Chief Shaman from the
 Office of Royal Shamans,

208
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:01,045
Jang Nok Kyoung.

209
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,341
For a Chief Shaman who should be in the palace,

210
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:05,729
what are you doing here?

211
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:13,171
My magical force brought me to this place. 
Magical force brought you here?

212
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,275
I came here without anyone knowing,

213
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:18,117
don't worry.

214
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:20,622
Can I see

215
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:25,071
you daughter for a moment?

216
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,964
She's been fell

217
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:48,075
by a magical spell.

218
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:58,521
The heaven is helping us.

219
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:01,862
Her illness came about at the right time.

220
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:04,932
Let's submit our proposal from tomorrow onwards.

221
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,714
What do you think of being exiled?

222
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:10,618
How is that? An exile to a scholar is just going

223
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:12,737
down a path by the direction of the wind.

224
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:14,493
Did you say direction of the wind?

225
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:18,483
There are many, nationwide,
 who'd follow Heo Yeong Jae.

226
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,621
If he's being sent into exile,

227
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,459
it's possible that all fallen soldiers who shared the same fate will join forces.

228
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:29,227
His Majesty would lose a trustworthy subject for now.

229
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,078
But, as soon as he's received a Haebae releasing him from the Articles of exile,

230
00:21:33,143 --> 00:21:36,136
His Majesty would get an army.

231
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:39,967
Let's change it to poison then.

232
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,588
Do you think he'd give him poison?

233
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:45,001
It's more sorrowful if

234
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:49,488
you give him a pair of wings,
 but wouldn't allow him to take flight.

235
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:51,468
Slowly...

236
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:56,194
- Let's do this slowly... 
 -  And, if the

237
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,471
Crown Prince's betrothed's illness

238
00:21:58,471 --> 00:22:00,223
suddenly gets better?

239
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:02,147
That child

240
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:07,126
won't be able to return to the palace alive.

241
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:10,752
After she dies,

242
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:14,093
her soul won't even fly out of her tomb.

243
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,765
Will you kill

244
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:38,137
Yeon Woo?

245
00:22:45,474 --> 00:22:48,171
Are you scared of your father?

246
00:22:50,357 --> 00:22:52,363
Or do you find her pitiful?

247
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:56,911
To put it simply, she's someone

248
00:22:56,963 --> 00:23:01,185
who will die when the time is right.

249
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:06,977
We'd have to take action

250
00:23:06,977 --> 00:23:10,113
if she dies slower than expected.

251
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:16,821
What do you think is the reason

252
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,157
that I tell you the truth?

253
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:24,864
You need to realise it.

254
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:26,469
Realise it?

255
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:32,142
Do you know what others

256
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:35,086
called me for a period of time?

257
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:37,147
The stray dog of His Majesty.

258
00:23:37,147 --> 00:23:39,609
The slave of the Queen Dowager.

259
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:45,616
They are names I got because of a certain noble family.

260
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:48,860
I have never forgotten

261
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,169
that shame ever.

262
00:23:52,216 --> 00:23:54,742
So, I want revenge for what I've suffered.

263
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,050
That's why I can

264
00:23:57,055 --> 00:24:00,116
get to my current position.

265
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:04,736
Did you say you want to live in the palace?

266
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:08,001
Did you say you want to win the Crown Prince's heart? If so,

267
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,460
throw away those feelings of pity and remorse.

268
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,060
And, remember

269
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:18,260
the shame that's brought upon you because of that.

270
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:22,374
Remember the happiness you feel when you get what you want.

271
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:29,179
If you don't have the slight inkling of that, don't yearn for that position.

272
00:24:44,472 --> 00:24:47,716
Amulet?

273
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:50,135
Her pain won't end

274
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:53,115
if she doesn't have that.

275
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:55,185
That's impossible.

276
00:24:55,185 --> 00:24:59,384
There isn't anyone who contracted that disease among our family. Why would my child contract it?

277
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:03,484
I have no idea what's the reason that she's being chosen by the gods.

278
00:25:04,477 --> 00:25:06,396
But, it seems like the gods didn't want her to be the chosen one

279
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:08,987
that's why she has contracted such an affliction.

280
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:10,627
How do you want to do this?

281
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:13,082
Will you accept

282
00:25:13,082 --> 00:25:15,102
the amulet?

283
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:18,166
Would there be no

284
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:22,002
option other than that?

285
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:25,878
- There's another option? 
 - What's that option.

286
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:26,965
But,

287
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,347
you'd have to pay for that with death.

288
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:34,169
- I'm willing to pay with my life.
 -  She has to pay

289
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:39,110
with her own life.

290
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:10,279
Please void the status of the Crown Prince's betrothed, Your Majesty. 
Please void the status of the Crown Prince's betrothed, Your Majesty.

291
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:17,350
Please choose a new Crown Prince's wife  to maintain the tranquility of the palace, Your Majesty.

292
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,550
Yoon Dae Hyeong!

293
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:28,851
Crown Prince! Crown Prince, where are you going?

294
00:26:28,871 --> 00:26:30,250
I will go to the court now and

295
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,150
ask for the rejection of all entreaties.

296
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:34,540
Crown Prince, please control yourself.

297
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,350
The matter will get out of hand.

298
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,301
Please control yourself.

299
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:42,497
Please control yourself.

300
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,236
Crown Prince!

301
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:46,593
Crown Prince!

302
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:53,762
People who are the men of Minister of Home Office

303
00:26:53,882 --> 00:26:56,827
and who support him have all come forth to form this opposition.

304
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:59,964
Who exactly is not the supporter of Yoon Dae Hyeong in the palace?

305
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:04,191
How many more man will become his people?

306
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:10,967
Crown Prince,

307
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:13,239
please calm yourself.

308
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:19,913
What a pathetic

309
00:27:20,993 --> 00:27:22,798
position I am in now.

310
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:27,631
What kind of words are those?

311
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,398
My betrothed

312
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:45,170
has been ousted from the palace and 
returned to her birth home.

313
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,672
And Teacher Heo is

314
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,715
within the family of the ill person,

315
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:53,725
so he is barred from entering.

316
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,286
At times like this,

317
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,103
even Yang Myung hyung isn't around.

318
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,483
There's no one who

319
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:10,073
is supporting me in the palace.

320
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,448
Kim Jae Woon,

321
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:25,864
he's not a human.

322
00:28:25,864 --> 00:28:28,950
He's a ghost of the sword,
 a ghost of the sword. 
Does it make sense for someone with 
such looks to be so good with his sword?

323
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,750
His looks come from his mother, a slave in Jangan

324
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:35,275
and his skills comes from his father.

325
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,547
- Isn't that the best of the genes? 
 - It's such a pity.

326
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,550
If it wasn't for his birth right,

327
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,315
he could be someone who would achieve greatness.

328
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:58,224
For what matter has the Crown Prince 
honor us with his presence?

329
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:01,908
I wasn't in a good mood for the whole of today.

330
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:06,395
And I was reminded of the nightmares I had of the game with a ball we played previously,

331
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,191
so my mood became worse.

332
00:29:13,597 --> 00:29:15,725
You... Yes, Crown Prince!

333
00:29:15,735 --> 00:29:17,217
It's weird that

334
00:29:17,217 --> 00:29:20,196
I'm always reminded of you.

335
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:23,804
Were you the one who scored the most that day?

336
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:25,435
No,

337
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,904
I only had the determination,

338
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:29,962
but I don't have good skills.

339
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:33,839
If that's the case,

340
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,647
who's that person?

341
00:29:39,642 --> 00:29:42,110
It's Kim Jae Woon.

342
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:45,635
You and you, the both of you,

343
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:47,982
follow me.

344
00:29:56,624 --> 00:29:58,860
He doesn't seem to be so,

345
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:03,329
but he's such a petty man. It's been so long since that happened.

346
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:05,364
Don't tell me they are

347
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,166
being fired because of that?

348
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:23,143
I have no idea if the size is right.

349
00:30:23,143 --> 00:30:26,171
Wear this for now.

350
00:30:27,987 --> 00:30:29,503
You should be aware that

351
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:31,912
if you speak of this matter,

352
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,416
you won't be able to safeguard your own life.

353
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,156
Yes.

354
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:51,037
Yeon Woo...

355
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:53,809
Yeon Woo...

356
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:58,190
Yeon Woo...

357
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:02,310
Yeon Woo...

358
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,373
Can you tell

359
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:20,112
who I am?

360
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:30,521
It doesn't matter.

361
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,736
As long as I know

362
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:40,066
who you are.

363
00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:56,178
Yeon Woo...

364
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:06,156
Is that

365
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,193
really you?

366
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,774
What do you mean?

367
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:16,219
It's not just an image,

368
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,839
but is that

369
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,109
really you?

370
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:32,181
It's not an image.

371
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:37,190
I really did come to see you.

372
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:47,208
I'm very foolish, right ?

373
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,570
What is

374
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,345
this?

375
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:36,223
It's 'a moon that embraced the sun'.

376
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:40,921
The sun refers to the King

377
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,133
and the moon refers to his wife.

378
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:49,026
This white on the accesory is the moon.

379
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,215
And the moon is embracing the red sun,

380
00:33:53,215 --> 00:33:55,163
so I call this

381
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:59,234
the moon that embraced the sun.

382
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,200
The moon that embraced the sun.

383
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:12,289
You're the only

384
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,728
person in my heart.

385
00:34:14,728 --> 00:34:16,216
So,

386
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:18,586
get well soon and

387
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,136
come back to my side.

388
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:26,493
Crown Prince...

389
00:34:27,322 --> 00:34:29,154
Tell me.

390
00:34:30,613 --> 00:34:33,091
I'm sorry.

391
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:38,043
For what?

392
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:41,109
When we first met,

393
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:46,175
I mistook you for a thief.

394
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:50,099
I'm sorry.

395
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:53,138
And I'm sorry

396
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:55,041
to have mistaken

397
00:34:55,698 --> 00:34:58,182
your real feelings.

398
00:34:58,988 --> 00:35:01,257
I'm very sorry.

399
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:07,294
You should be feeling sorry for that matter.

400
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:09,976
Everything is

401
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:13,785
my fault.

402
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:17,120
It's not your fault.

403
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:19,796
So,

404
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:24,186
no matter what happens,

405
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,554
don't blame yourself.

406
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:33,071
A man doesn't blame heaven

407
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:36,221
nor find fault with another.

408
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,181
That's right,

409
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:41,472
Crown Prince.

410
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,129
It's fine even if you don't say all the words.

411
00:35:44,132 --> 00:35:46,115
Tell me.

412
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,469
I...

413
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:55,146
I'm very happy

414
00:35:56,941 --> 00:36:00,477
to have been able to meet you.

415
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:20,100
You will be even happier in the future,

416
00:36:21,794 --> 00:36:25,189
so don't say things like that.

417
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:55,720
It's not like you to agree to

418
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,755
do such a dangerous mission.

419
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,459
Someone like me who doesn't have any issues

420
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,563
has caused people around me to be implicated.

421
00:37:05,566 --> 00:37:10,124
If anything disastrous happens to the Crown Prince... All your family members are here.

422
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,957
How is it possible that only the Crown Prince would have a mishap?

423
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:18,122
Matters of the heart would get worse if he doesn't find a cure.

424
00:37:20,724 --> 00:37:22,206
Do you know that?

425
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,270
The Crown Prince wishes

426
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:29,112
that you'd be his royal guard.

427
00:37:30,142 --> 00:37:32,697
Did Yeon Woo just

428
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:36,114
make his wish come true?

429
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:46,634
I think

430
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:49,350
she likes you.

431
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,707
Well,

432
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:52,120
I don't think

433
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:53,507
the same as you do.

434
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:56,828
She is very much interested in swords.

435
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,526
And her sword skills are

436
00:37:59,602 --> 00:38:03,099
very similar to yours.

437
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:16,260
Did you say you're called Kim Jae Woon?

438
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,121
Yes, I am.

439
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:22,139
Prince Yang Myung and my teacher

440
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,338
just call you Woon, right?

441
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:28,506
That's right.

442
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:32,268
Can I call you

443
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,715
Woon as well?

444
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:38,826
Please pardon me.

445
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,559
Woon,

446
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:45,289
thank you.

447
00:38:45,968 --> 00:38:47,658
I wanted to see

448
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:50,177
what kind of place

449
00:38:51,189 --> 00:38:53,155
she was born and grew up in.

450
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:57,078
She's suffering

451
00:38:57,078 --> 00:39:01,175
in pain like that,

452
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:06,532
but I can't do anything for her.

453
00:39:06,532 --> 00:39:08,068
Crown Prince...

454
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:10,480
I'm the Crown Prince of this country . . .

455
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:17,129
It is because I'm the Crown Prince of a country,

456
00:39:20,457 --> 00:39:24,029
there's nothing I can do.

457
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,490
"You're just a wild-gentle horse-weed."

458
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,909
"In the night, you follow the moon."

459
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:47,344
"In the day, you follow the sun. 
A lonely wild-gentle horse-weed."

460
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:49,984
But, what's horse weed?

461
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,536
Horse means horse and weed means grass.

462
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:57,422
It refers to an unruly man like me.

463
00:39:57,511 --> 00:40:00,697
What's a wild-gentle horse-weed then?

464
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:05,598
Should I say it's wild horse and gentle weed?

465
00:40:05,598 --> 00:40:09,214
You're making me embarrassed. Let's stop here.

466
00:40:10,043 --> 00:40:10,900
Is that the place?

467
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,595
Yes,

468
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:15,213
that's the market place. Oh, really?

469
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:17,596
Come,

470
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:19,399
take these and get some rice soup.

471
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,523
Thank you!

472
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:24,691
Let's see . . .

473
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:28,150
Shall I try selling these then?

474
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:06,109
10 wins out of 10 fights.  There's a myth that he is invincible.

475
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:29,829
The winner is the Ban Dal.

476
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:31,650
Any other challenger?

477
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,385
The price is a cow.

478
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:37,380
Any other challenger?

479
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:41,419
If that's the case, Ban Dal is the winner?

480
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:43,660
There's a challenger.

481
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:49,024
We have a new challenger.

482
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:51,318
Will this challenger

483
00:41:51,338 --> 00:41:53,502
be able to dispel the myth

484
00:41:53,502 --> 00:41:56,468
of invincibility?

485
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:02,248
Hey, your name.

486
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,150
Wild-gentle horse-weed.

487
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:09,453
Yes, gentle-skirt.

488
00:42:09,453 --> 00:42:11,105
No,

489
00:42:11,105 --> 00:42:13,035
it's wild-gentle horse-weed.

490
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:14,226
Yes!

491
00:42:14,264 --> 00:42:17,728
Please give your attention to the fight of

492
00:42:17,816 --> 00:42:20,197
Ban Dal and wild-gentle horse-weed.

493
00:42:55,629 --> 00:42:57,277
For a person,

494
00:42:57,297 --> 00:42:59,506
just as there some who will be king

495
00:42:59,565 --> 00:43:02,387
and some who will become subjects,

496
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:05,557
The same is true for women.

497
00:43:24,422 --> 00:43:26,221
You wouldn't regret

498
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:30,098
the path you've chosen, right?

499
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,650
Aigoo, this person...

500
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,350
Innkeeper, give me a glass of liquor.

501
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,050
What's wrong? Did something happen?

502
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,850
They say the tax has increased again.

503
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,736
What?

504
00:44:09,756 --> 00:44:11,247
These assholes!

505
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:13,968
All those taxes will be given to the Yoon household.

506
00:44:13,968 --> 00:44:18,390
It's the same even now. 
Everything will be fine if the daughter of the
Yoon household becomes the Crown Prince's wife.

507
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,894
What's the use of saying that? 
We have no idea how much longer 
will the Crown Prince's betrothed,

508
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:25,050
who has been banished 
out of the palace, live.

509
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:29,591
I think they are waiting for her to die.

510
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:35,036
The Crown Prince's betrothed has been changed?

511
00:44:35,102 --> 00:44:37,804
- What do you mean by that? 
 - Who are you?

512
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:43,246
- What's wrong? 
 - What do you mean by they are waiting for the 
Crown Prince's betrothed to die?

513
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,684
Yeon Woo, please be alive.

514
00:44:50,707 --> 00:44:53,082
Please stay alive.

515
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,570
What did you just say?

516
00:45:02,698 --> 00:45:06,608
Go to your uncle's place to avoid the disease for now.

517
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,506
Father!

518
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,494
You're the eldest son of our household

519
00:45:11,801 --> 00:45:14,450
and someone who serves the Crown Prince.

520
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:16,485
Yeon Woo is fighting with all her might to survive.

521
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,414
How can you instruct me to avoid the disease?

522
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:21,216
Go on.

523
00:45:21,244 --> 00:45:23,181
I can't do that.

524
00:45:24,115 --> 00:45:28,507
At least I have to know what illness Yeon Woo contracted, before...

525
00:45:28,507 --> 00:45:31,590
It's an illness that even the
Royal Physician doesn't recognize.

526
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:36,829
- So, how would you be able to know about it?
 - I will find it out even if I have to scan

527
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:41,150
through all the medical books in the world.
 - Did you forget that you're the teacher

528
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,350
of the Crown Prince?
 - How can I serve the Crown Prince

529
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:48,250
if I can't even protect my own sister?

530
00:45:48,294 --> 00:45:51,006
There needs to be someone who protects the Crown Prince.

531
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:53,694
It's you! You have to protect him.

532
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:59,089
That's what you and Yeon Woo can do

533
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:04,117
to repay your father's love for you.

534
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:08,263
Go on.

535
00:46:44,637 --> 00:46:45,675
Seol,

536
00:46:46,106 --> 00:46:47,223
I need a favor.

537
00:46:48,317 --> 00:46:51,395
Yeon Woo has fallen asleep 
so I can't bid her goodbye.

538
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:55,366
If Yeon Woo looks for me,

539
00:46:56,122 --> 00:46:58,139
send me letters -

540
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:02,083
Ah, you don't know how to write.

541
00:47:03,827 --> 00:47:05,915
- You can send someone...
 - I know...

542
00:47:06,017 --> 00:47:07,531
I know how to write.

543
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:10,211
The young lady taught me.

544
00:47:10,266 --> 00:47:13,197
She said if I know how to write, 
I know how the world revolves.

545
00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:16,164
So, I learn a little every night.

546
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:20,359
I feel at ease with you around, Seol.

547
00:47:21,033 --> 00:47:23,547
Help me to protect Yeon Woo for

548
00:47:23,547 --> 00:47:27,137
this period when I'm not around.

549
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:34,135
I'm counting on you, Seol.

550
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,150
Seol!

551
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:20,728
Follow that person.

552
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:24,823
He's the person who will bring you to your new owner.

553
00:48:24,823 --> 00:48:26,798
Master...

554
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:29,526
She's a nice and kind child that

555
00:48:29,729 --> 00:48:31,453
my daughter holds dear.

556
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:33,336
I hope you will be nice to her.

557
00:48:33,456 --> 00:48:35,330
Don't worry, Mister.

558
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,064
Did I do something wrong?

559
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,149
That's not it, Seol.

560
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:42,792
I will amend my mistakes.

561
00:48:43,564 --> 00:48:47,030
Please don't send me elsewhere.

562
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:52,128
I won't eat a lot. Please let me stay beside the young lady.

563
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:57,367
Seol...
 I've promised young master that I will protect the young lady.

564
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:00,403
Please, I beg of you.

565
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,185
When the young lady recovers fully,

566
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:10,172
I will bring you back again.

567
00:49:10,386 --> 00:49:11,780
So,

568
00:49:12,426 --> 00:49:16,129
listen to what I say now.

569
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:29,100
Yeon Woo! Yeon Woo!

570
00:49:34,482 --> 00:49:35,529
Yeon Woo...

571
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:38,141
Come to your senses. Yeon Woo...

572
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:42,389
Yeon Woo!

573
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:47,811
As long as she lives,

574
00:49:47,857 --> 00:49:52,133
there's no way to cut off that magical spell.

575
00:49:53,462 --> 00:49:58,148
Are you saying that you'd end her life?

576
00:50:03,776 --> 00:50:05,681
Only this method allows me to

577
00:50:05,694 --> 00:50:08,761
take away that magical spell after she dies.

578
00:50:08,761 --> 00:50:14,144
It's the only way to let her die without having to suffer.

579
00:50:32,944 --> 00:50:34,798
Let me ask you just one thing.

580
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,491
Please ask me.

581
00:50:36,976 --> 00:50:40,098
If she takes that medicine,

582
00:50:40,143 --> 00:50:42,712
will she really die without any pain?

583
00:50:43,601 --> 00:50:45,009
That's right.

584
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:48,256
Can she die in peace having been rid of that

585
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:52,795
magical spell that can't be dispelled
even if she dies?

586
00:50:53,745 --> 00:50:54,951
I will promise

587
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:56,961
you that.

588
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:08,514
I've committed a grave sin towards you.

589
00:51:13,964 --> 00:51:18,460
I'll have to repay this sin while living my entire next life.

590
00:51:26,942 --> 00:51:28,130
My Lord,

591
00:51:29,432 --> 00:51:31,953
Why didn't you wake me up?

592
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:33,673
Let me do that now,

593
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,250
so go and get some rest.

594
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:40,783
I will do this.  So, you should rest
for the whole of today.

595
00:51:40,854 --> 00:51:45,089
What have I done that requires rest? 
Please give that to me.

596
00:51:47,013 --> 00:51:49,357
I, too, want to do something for her,
as her father.

597
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,469
The very least is

598
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,220
to brew her medicine.

599
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,682
Please let me do that.

600
00:52:05,406 --> 00:52:08,116
Your daughter is under

601
00:52:09,381 --> 00:52:13,149
a magical spell.

602
00:53:17,802 --> 00:53:20,340
Crown Prince,

603
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,349
I'm writing this letter with my

604
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:28,099
remaining strength.

605
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:04,511
Yeon Woo...

606
00:54:11,474 --> 00:54:13,046
Are you all better now?

607
00:54:13,137 --> 00:54:14,419
Crown Prince,

608
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:16,172
do you know

609
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,987
why I sent you

610
00:54:19,937 --> 00:54:21,582
this potted plant?

611
00:54:22,172 --> 00:54:23,656
Didn't you

612
00:54:24,489 --> 00:54:26,569
tell me that already?

613
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,550
Actually,

614
00:54:30,194 --> 00:54:32,019
there's another

615
00:54:32,525 --> 00:54:34,594
hidden meaning to it.

616
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:37,187
Hidden meaning?

617
00:54:40,533 --> 00:54:43,818
I wanted you to be curious as to

618
00:54:44,316 --> 00:54:47,076
find out what would grow out of this pot.

619
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:49,165
If so,

620
00:54:50,946 --> 00:54:52,524
then, you'd send me a letter

621
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:55,167
expressing your curiosity?

622
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:58,073
Are you saying

623
00:54:58,861 --> 00:55:00,487
that you were anticipating

624
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:04,121
my reply?

625
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,579
You're really...

626
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:15,826
You should have told me that then.

627
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:17,429
I didn't even realise it and

628
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:20,627
thought that you were avoiding me. 
 - Crown Prince...

629
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:41,220
Please stay healthy.

630
00:58:10,067 --> 00:58:11,537
Yeon Woo,

631
00:58:13,153 --> 00:58:15,093
wake up.

632
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:19,436
It's time

633
00:58:20,928 --> 00:58:23,092
for your medicine.

634
00:58:31,938 --> 00:58:33,368
The medicine

635
00:58:33,368 --> 00:58:35,610
is very hot.

636
00:58:36,021 --> 00:58:38,182
Let's cool it a little.

637
00:58:50,557 --> 00:58:52,183
Yeon Woo...

638
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:59,164
I'm sorry for this entire time.

639
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:06,118
I only remember feeling regret towards you.

640
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,437
If I had known,

641
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:13,110
I'd have allowed you to read 
whenever you wanted to

642
00:59:14,155 --> 00:59:17,372
and allowed you to do 
whatever you wanted to.

643
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,058
There's still

644
00:59:22,004 --> 00:59:26,078
a lot time left, going forward.

645
00:59:27,204 --> 00:59:29,141
How foolish am I.

646
00:59:30,632 --> 00:59:33,102
Father...

647
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:39,177
Please give me the medicine now.

648
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:41,824
I will drink

649
00:59:46,831 --> 00:59:49,147
the medicine.

650
00:59:50,209 --> 00:59:51,795
I don't want

651
00:59:53,072 --> 00:59:56,170
to feel sick anymore.

652
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:45,449
Is the

653
01:00:47,397 --> 01:00:49,519
medicine bitter?

654
01:00:49,831 --> 01:00:53,000
It's bitter, very bitter.

655
01:00:56,912 --> 01:00:58,776
My Yeon Woo,

656
01:01:01,253 --> 01:01:05,053
I will hug you until you fall asleep.

657
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:07,093
Yes,

658
01:01:08,654 --> 01:01:10,493
I like the smell

659
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,462
coming from you.

660
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:17,138
Alright,

661
01:01:17,158 --> 01:01:20,882
sleep peacefully in my arms.

662
01:01:34,505 --> 01:01:39,202
I want to fall asleep with this in my arms.

663
01:01:40,811 --> 01:01:44,208
Please let me do it.

664
01:01:46,184 --> 01:01:47,345
Yeon Woo...

665
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,729
Father,

666
01:01:54,187 --> 01:01:56,054
I'm sleepy.

667
01:01:57,016 --> 01:01:59,171
I want to sleep.

668
01:02:07,745 --> 01:02:10,164
Yeon Woo...

669
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,435
I'm sorry, Yeon Woo.

670
01:02:14,435 --> 01:02:16,174
Your father will

671
01:02:16,187 --> 01:02:19,111
follow suit soon.

672
01:02:28,694 --> 01:02:29,800
Yeon Woo...

673
01:02:30,471 --> 01:02:31,718
Yeon Woo!

674
01:02:31,726 --> 01:02:33,147
Yeon Woo!

675
01:02:33,656 --> 01:02:35,312
Yeon Woo!

676
01:02:35,312 --> 01:02:38,126
Yeon Woo!

677
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:29,257
They said she died peacefully,

678
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,080
as if she were sleeping,

679
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:36,165
in the arms of her father.

680
01:03:38,738 --> 01:03:41,745
Her funeral will be the day after tomorrow.

681
01:03:41,745 --> 01:03:43,345
Her family decided

682
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:47,116
to proceed normally.

683
01:03:59,283 --> 01:04:01,177
Crown Prince...

684
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,152
Crown Prince...

685
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,093
You can't do that, Crown Prince.

686
01:04:32,629 --> 01:04:38,139
There's an order from the Queen Dowager
that you need to stay in your quarters
the entire day.

687
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:40,065
Unhand me!

688
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:42,900
I say unhand me!

689
01:04:43,185 --> 01:04:46,123
Unhand me!

690
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:55,131
I have something

691
01:04:56,772 --> 01:05:01,320
left to say to my Crown Princess.

692
01:05:01,535 --> 01:05:03,686
I still have something

693
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:09,094
left to say to my Crown Princess.

694
01:05:11,376 --> 01:05:12,846
Yeon Woo!

695
01:05:13,092 --> 01:05:16,083
Yeon Woo!

696
01:05:16,365 --> 01:05:18,149
Let go!

697
01:05:18,642 --> 01:05:20,027
Crown Prince...

698
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:22,238
Yeon Woo!

699
01:05:23,523 --> 01:05:26,891
Yeon Woo!

700
01:05:27,869 --> 01:05:30,269
I say unhand me!

701
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:34,247
I have something left to say.

702
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,600
Yeon Woo!
