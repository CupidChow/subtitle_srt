00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,400
Episode 12

2
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:18,308
You.

3
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,615
Since when have you known?

4
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:44,569
Since you aren't saying anything, 
 you really did know about this.

5
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,284
Is she that alike?

6
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:52,583
Did the King say that?

7
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,849
That...

8
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:57,580
Child is alike.

9
00:00:58,716 --> 00:01:02,224
So did he shield your mouth to not tell me?

10
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:04,273
Your Excellency . . .

11
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,489
You too,

12
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:12,480
have become the King's person.

13
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:42,878
Thanks to you, I saw it well.

14
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:45,729
It's a relief

15
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,205
that you think so.

16
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:54,735
However the story line is made up 
with false ideas that are so unreasonable.

17
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,775
Yes?

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,330
A common woman meets the King 
when he was out for investigation.

19
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,349
And falls in love without knowing he's the King.

20
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:06,723
Does that make sense?

21
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:11,174
How does a busy King have time to fall in love with a woman?

22
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:12,876
If the King is in that state,

23
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:15,344
do you think the nation will be faring well?

24
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:19,025
I wanted to take those people to the police station.

25
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,228
As if that wasn't enough . . .

26
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:23,233
And that woman is the same.

27
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:25,522
No matter what kind of environment she was raised in,

28
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:28,458
how can the debonair King's aura not be noticed?

29
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,027
She didn't know he was the King?

30
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:34,030
Hah! That is ridiculous.

31
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,101
I'm sure she seduced the King,
 knowing he was the King.

32
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:39,636
You can't always see it like that...

33
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:41,904
And what,

34
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:44,007
That woman comes into the palace as a palace maid

35
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,542
and, then meets the King again in the Palace?

36
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,245
Ha! Unbelievable.

37
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:53,049
Do they think that the Palace would just pick anyone
 as a palace maid?

38
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:58,253
Whoever made that low-graded story 
should be arrested and put into jail!

39
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:02,425
What are you staring at?

40
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:05,261
Because we're humans.

41
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:09,832
Because we're humans,

42
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,300
it can be possible.

43
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:16,824
What?

44
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:20,924
The things that happen between two humans.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,300
How can it be explained with just common sense?

46
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:31,687
Well...

47
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:34,490
I was just saying . . .

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
I watched it well because of you.

49
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:43,633
I will surely repay the money. 
So don't worry.

50
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,637
You don't have to.

51
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:51,240
I can't live in debt.

52
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,276
I will pay back, so I'll separately-

53
00:03:56,713 --> 00:04:00,248
Anyway, we'll meet again.

54
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,700
From today on, this servant,

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,300
 will no longer be able to protect you.

56
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:23,205
 I'm sorry, but, I,

57
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:28,209
Will leave Seongsucheong.

58
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:59,307
I sent Jan Shil safely to Seongsucheong.

59
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:06,516
Why are you so late?

60
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,000
Just like I sent Jan Shil to those scary ladies at Seongsucheong

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,388
It looks like I'm going to have to drag you,
 by the ear, to them.

62
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:14,323
Then . . .

63
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:17,193
The person who took care of Jan Shil...

64
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:18,861
It was me.

65
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,200
She came to find me because she had nowhere to go.

66
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,167
I am so popular.

67
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:29,305
So the rich man with free spirited will...

68
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:32,074
It was you?

69
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,700
Jan Shil described me like that?

70
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,300
Haha! That little rascal...

71
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,816
She knows how to see a person.

72
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:44,287
I thought she was taken in by a fraud.

73
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:47,189
I was worried.

74
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,961
Since, it was this handsome man that took care of her..

75
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:55,230
aren't you relieved?

76
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,303
Anyway, Thank you for everything.

77
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:05,341
Please go safely.

78
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:13,315
The person about whom you worried so much . . .

79
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:20,255
Why is it that...

80
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:26,194
You have only thought of Jan Shil now.

81
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:27,364
Yes?

82
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:29,555
Forgetting the person you were looking for...

83
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,968
Forgetting about the person 
who was waiting for you...

84
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:36,204
Was there someone who...

85
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:41,243
made you forget all that?

86
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:51,252
I gave up the first time, but...

87
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:54,857
I don't have confidence for a second time.

88
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:57,326
What...

89
00:06:57,326 --> 00:07:00,329
are you talking about?

90
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:05,201
To another place 
Or to another person.

91
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:10,404
And watching you do those things again.

92
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:17,112
Sir.

93
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,848
Then . . .

94
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:22,217
Let's meet again.

95
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:28,256
Wait, Sir.

96
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:44,840
How can you keep on doing this, Your Majesty?

97
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:49,212
If you were going out again, 
you should have told me before you went.

98
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:53,616
Why did you tell me to make a useless snowman?

99
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:55,985
So, that's why I apologized.

100
00:07:55,985 --> 00:08:00,256
You told me to make it with clean snow that hasn't been stepped on by humans.  So,

101
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:02,826
I climbed up to the roof and I

102
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:05,728
almost fell and died.

103
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,863
That's why it's a relief you are alive.

104
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:11,801
Why are you...
Why are you so cruel?

105
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:15,805
Can you not see my swollen hands?

106
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:20,843
I could have gotten frostbite because of the snow.

107
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:25,448
Why are you like this, Your Majesty?

108
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:27,150
Come here.

109
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,020
Bring your hands to my warm heart.

110
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:40,261
I will tell the kitchen to prepare something
 for you to eat and drink.

111
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:45,166
Please let go of me.

112
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:12,161
Tomorrow morning, if you go to Gangnyan..

113
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:16,165
there will be someone to escort you.

114
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:22,238
Since you've made up your mind about leaving the capital, go to a place that is the furthest from here.

115
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,276
Why do you not answer?

116
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:31,780
Ah, in any case, we'll meet again.

117
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:34,383
Spirit Mother,

118
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:37,653
Just for today . . .

119
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:40,690
Can I be at the king's side?

120
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,692
Why?

121
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:45,528
Why am I seeing a shaken expression again?

122
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:48,297
Because I don't want to be swayed,
 that's why I'm asking you.

123
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,634
Just leaving without saying farewell isn't right...

124
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,802
Do you and the King . . .

125
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:56,204
have a relationship in which you need to say farewells?

126
00:09:57,173 --> 00:10:01,777
If you've decided to leave, then do it right!

127
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,080
I have something I must surely

128
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,716
say to the King.

129
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:13,188
After, I say my farewell, I will leave.

130
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:17,325
So, for just today, please let me go in.

131
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:22,229
I beg you, Spirit Mother.

132
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:33,761
 The King was angry...

133
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,911
 he was scolding the bad luck absorbing shaman, and..

134
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:38,213
 She answered,

135
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:41,078
"I don't know how much that person and I have in common, but

136
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:43,318
This servant, is not that person.

137
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,000
 If there is more that need be asked, please directly ask that person."

138
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,500
 That's what she said.

139
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,642
Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

140
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,500
Queen!

141
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,543
Are you all heading over to the King's Palace?

142
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,295
Yes, Your Majesty.

143
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,300
I came all the way over here because 
I had things to tell you myself.

144
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:24,475
So please put your jacket down.

145
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,800
Didn't I tell you to put it down?

146
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,700
You mustn't, Your Majesty.

147
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,700
This girl was ordered specially from the

148
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,600
Didn't you hear my words?

149
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:39,940
Why don't you show your face?

150
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,117
You are a little late.

151
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,300
It's been a while since the curfew bell has rung.

152
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:30,992
Are you disappointed that I am not the person you were waiting for?

153
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:34,206
Why are you here?

154
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:38,542
What you were trying to hide all this time,

155
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:42,304
I wanted to find that out by meeting you

156
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,206
and now I completely know what you were hiding.

157
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:51,277
When I met you for the first time eight years ago at the Hidden Moon Building,

158
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:53,339
Your Majesty,

159
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,318
You had the same expression at that time.

160
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:59,587
Even though we didn't have any emotional connections,

161
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:02,670
I thought that you would have some decency.

162
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,760
I guess I was wrong.

163
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,379
I'm quite sure that last time...

164
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,631
I told you not to come here for the time being!

165
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:10,149
Didn't I tell you?

166
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,214
And what for?!

167
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:15,542
What is it about her that attracts you?

168
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:18,506
What is it about that lowly shaman that

169
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:21,877
Is she so similar to that child 8 years ago?

170
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:23,012
Queen.

171
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:24,913
Yes.

172
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:26,382
Keep her in your heart.

173
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:31,265
An old woman or a talisman, keep them in your heart.

174
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:34,689
I won't care.

175
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,858
Didn't you say

176
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,995
that I would never receive your sacred heart?

177
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:42,665
I don't care.

178
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:44,573
It doesn't matter.

179
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,935
Queen!

180
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:47,803
But,

181
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:51,372
You should never forget this,

182
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:58,279
No matter who has your heart
 or who is in your heart,

183
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:01,750
The one who is the mother of this country

184
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,218
Is me.

185
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:08,790
Do you know that?

186
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:12,327
That place beside the king...

187
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:15,363
It is mine.

188
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:21,002
Your Majesty

189
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:24,305
will soon have to accept that truth.

190
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:52,266
Hurry and go in, His Majesty is waiting.

191
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,062
Who are you?

192
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:25,333
Yes? T-This servant..

193
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:28,737
I am a talisman sent from

194
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:31,421
Seongsucheong and Gansanggam.

195
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:33,475
Then,

196
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,078
what happened to the last female shaman?

197
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,781
That child has done everything she had to.
So,

198
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:43,818
she will leave Seongsucheong soon.

199
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:53,862
Since you've set your mind about leaving,

200
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:56,297
are you sad?

201
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,602
Why would I be sad?

202
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:03,038
I feel like I didn't help

203
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:06,274
the King at all.

204
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:09,511
I'm just sorry.

205
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,014
But, your expression looks like...

206
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:14,750
It's going to cry soon.

207
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:18,787
She should have at least

208
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:21,223
let you say your final goodbyes.

209
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,893
She is so cruel!

210
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:27,028
Change your,

211
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,230
Clothes.

212
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,484
Why are you like that?

213
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:52,754
The reason why His Majesty called you again...

214
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:55,423
You shouldn't just think lightly of it.

215
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:59,795
The King is currently thinking of someone else.

216
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:02,196
Why are you...

217
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,467
Talking formally to me?

218
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,938
D-did

219
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:12,340
I do that?

220
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:18,779
Since you are talking formally to me too, aren't you thinking the same?

221
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:22,317
Please don't worry.

222
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:25,487
I know what you are worried about,

223
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:29,257
Very well.

224
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:33,294
I will not think of it lightly.

225
00:17:57,153 --> 00:17:59,187
Who told you to leave

226
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:02,223
As you wish?

227
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,527
Tell me.

228
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:08,096
Whose permission did you get to leave?

229
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:10,798
I have done all I can,

230
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,068
so it is only right that I leave.

231
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:15,670
Who told you that you've finished your work!

232
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,640
The person you need . . .

233
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:23,011
Who was the one who told me that

234
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:25,114
she can relieve my pain?

235
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:27,048
This servant . . .

236
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,051
cannot be that person.

237
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:31,186
Didn't you say that you will take away

238
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:33,956
my stress and let me sleep peacefully?

239
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:36,158
You said that I should not get close to you.

240
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:40,260
I never commanded you to go away either.

241
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:51,272
Your words...

242
00:18:51,272 --> 00:18:53,341
are correct.

243
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:57,745
The person I am seeing . . .

244
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,482
If it's that child or...

245
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:03,615
Or, if it's just you...

246
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:06,221
I am . . .

247
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:08,724
confused.

248
00:19:08,724 --> 00:19:11,025
So, I . . .

249
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,328
Until I can resolve this confusion...

250
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:19,500
Before I know what this feeling is . . .

251
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:22,203
Don't you dare

252
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:30,244
go far away from me.

253
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,983
It's my command.

254
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,172
Did you say in four days?

255
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:58,774
Yes.

256
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:03,412
Today, we selected the 17th 
for the Marriage Consummation date.

257
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,281
And have told the Queen Dowager.

258
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,751
Why is it so fast?

259
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:11,387
According to a few scholars,

260
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:14,323
that day will be most auspicious 
with the gods

261
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:18,293
to make babies.

262
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:20,930
A son will be conceived,

263
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,799
who will lead a great nation.

264
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,268
So, Queen,

265
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,473
Don't be shaken by rumors and

266
00:20:29,473 --> 00:20:31,774
just take care of your body and mind.

267
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:34,910
until then.

268
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,613
I will keep

269
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:41,000
your advice in mind.

270
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,254
 Subtitles brought to you by The 'Eclipse Team @ Viki.com

271
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:48,790
What are you going to do, Your Majesty?

272
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,393
Are you going to make an excuse about your health

273
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:54,228
and try to avoid it, again?

274
00:20:54,228 --> 00:20:57,098
I'm sorry. But this time,

275
00:20:57,098 --> 00:21:00,500
things won't go the way you want.

276
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,171
Lady Jo.

277
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:03,806
Yes, Your Majesty.

278
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:07,100
Please tell my father to meet me

279
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,300
before he returns home.

280
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,746
I will.

281
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:12,815
Ouch, my head!

282
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:16,885
I am still hung over from the alcohol from yesterday.

283
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,000
Isn't it suspicious?

284
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,500
What is suspicious?

285
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,028
They suggested the Arrack liquor from Gaeseong.

286
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:29,331
But, given how long this 
hangover is lasting,

287
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,734
don't you think they mixed something
strange into it?

288
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:36,538
The way I see it, it's not the Arrack liquor, but

289
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:39,275
your old age.

290
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:41,444
Look at me, I'm fine.

291
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:44,580
How can you say such nonsense!

292
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,300
This guy right here, is as good as ever!

293
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:54,422
Sir,

294
00:21:54,422 --> 00:21:56,124
What's wrong?

295
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:57,726
Go ahead first.

296
00:21:57,726 --> 00:21:59,228
I'll follow you later.

297
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:00,629
Yes.

298
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:02,764
Let's go first.

299
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,200
Have you come, Minister?

300
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,611
Why does everyone seem so busy?

301
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:21,683
Yesterday, His Majesty came to investigate and messed the place.

302
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:23,652
As we need to clean the office anyway,

303
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:25,654
I ordered Posae [drying the books/clothes]

304
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:28,356
His Majesty?

305
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:33,429
Minister, some of the records appear to be missing.

306
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:36,331
What?
 How can that be?

307
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
How many are you missing?

308
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:39,835
A few from 8 years ago.

309
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:42,404
It's not like they have legs. Where could they have gone?

310
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,273
Search again, thoroughly!

311
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:55,853
It certainly wasn't here!

312
00:22:55,853 --> 00:22:58,720
Sir, I found it!

313
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,300
You've worked hard.

314
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:03,925
If we were a little bit late,

315
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:06,300
we would've been caught.

316
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,531
Make sure you do it carefully and cautiously.

317
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:11,199
I don't want the old fox

318
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:14,302
to know what we are up to.

319
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:18,273
Your Majesty, there's trouble.

320
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,575
What is it?

321
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:23,212
The former head eunuch, who served the King,

322
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:27,214
has committed suicide.

323
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:14,429
There's no use in investigating more.

324
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,000
It looks exactly like suicide.

325
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,301
So what I'm saying is . . .

326
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,200
We don't need to know who or 
what did this to him.

327
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:33,048
We need to find out WHY he did this.

328
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:35,684
And, what his motives were.

329
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,386
It mostly likely was to keep a secret.

330
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:40,388
Pah~

331
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:44,291
I suddenly have an inspiration now.

332
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,931
What in the world,

333
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:53,134
are you trying to hide?

334
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:55,671
Even sacrificing your life.

335
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:59,140
What is it you were trying to keep?

336
00:24:59,442 --> 00:25:02,945
Your Majesty, it's time for your lunch.

337
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:05,180
There's one thing I'm sure about.

338
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,148
There's a...

339
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:10,485
secret that I should never know.

340
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:11,654
Hyung Sun

341
00:25:11,654 --> 00:25:13,121
Yes, Your Majesty.

342
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:15,257
Go to the Justice Court and gather up

343
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:18,360
all the names of the Court Officials.

344
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,463
You must not leave out even the lowest of the guards.

345
00:25:21,463 --> 00:25:22,400
And this..

346
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,434
is a secret command. If you dare to leak

347
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:30,236
the secrets, you'll be killed.  
So be forewarned.

348
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,500
Wait.

349
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,621
Why must I be wearing

350
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:50,792
a eunuch's clothing?

351
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:53,395
Sure is tight lipped.

352
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:56,332
But why does it feel like

353
00:25:56,332 --> 00:26:00,268
this has happened before?

354
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:21,222
Sir!

355
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:30,599
Do you remember me?

356
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,500
How can I forget you?

357
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,600
You were once Sungkyunkwan's head scholar,

358
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,775
Now you are one of the Justice Court officials.

359
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:41,510
To see your name in the government book,

360
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,479
I am extremely happy.

361
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,348
Thank you, Your Majesty.

362
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,500
You know the Head Eunuch that once served

363
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,156
my father committed suicide, right?

364
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:57,659
I know.

365
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,400
I have just returned from 
the investigation site.

366
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,035
Perhaps it was Your Majesty's arrangement?

367
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:09,138
Your mental sharpness has not changed
since your younger days.

368
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,600
Regarding the punishment, 
they understand it thoroughly.

369
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,876
They are in charge of the investigation.

370
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:18,380
The truth is something that will always be unknown to me.

371
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:21,383
The truth?

372
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:23,985
What truth

373
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:26,055
are you referring to?

374
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:28,556
That is something I should ask you.

375
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:30,425
Yes?

376
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:33,896
Starting today, just pretend you are providing
assistance to the Investigation Bureau,

377
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:37,599
investigating the death of Head Eunuch.

378
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,635
Pretending . . .

379
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:42,203
to investigate?

380
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,100
That's right.

381
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,000
There is something else you must investigate.

382
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,244
The thing I want to know, through you, is . . .

383
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,700
The whole death story

384
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,319
of the Crown Princess-elect from 8 years ago.

385
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:10,332
The King's movement is not normal?

386
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:12,967
I'm not sure, but . . .

387
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,200
It looks like there is a secret movement.

388
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,540
It must be the event 8 years ago.

389
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,900
We must think

390
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,300
of a counter plan.

391
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,800
If he finds out about the truth,

392
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,300
he will take this opportunity

393
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,421
to sweep out everyone in one stroke.

394
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:37,057
In my opinion, this happened because the consummation of the sun's marriage was set for an earlier date.

395
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:39,528
It is indeed, God's will.

396
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:42,465
What does that have to do with this?

397
00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:44,433
If they have children,

398
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:47,869
those parents can't help but pray
for their stability.

399
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:52,541
The King Former first had Prince Yang Myung
and later Crown Prince Lee Hwon.

400
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,800
He restrained them to keep

401
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,279
the utmost peace between these two princes.

402
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:03,718
Between relatives, what makes it so worrisome?

403
00:29:03,718 --> 00:29:08,800
In our hands, it is insurance.

404
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,594
No matter what he tries to do,
he will never find anything.

405
00:29:12,594 --> 00:29:15,730
Even if he finds out,

406
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:20,300
there's nothing he can do about it.

407
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:34,234
Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

408
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:50,278
Why are you looking at me like that?

409
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:55,337
You look the coolest when you read a book.

410
00:29:57,216 --> 00:30:01,663
You look more cool when you smile.

411
00:30:01,663 --> 00:30:05,300
I am embarrassed, so please stop looking.

412
00:30:06,227 --> 00:30:08,055
But, Husband,

413
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:11,499
Until when are you going to read a book?

414
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:18,260
Why don't you give that kind of gaze to me?

415
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:23,183
I'd rather be that book.

416
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:28,016
If...

417
00:30:28,605 --> 00:30:31,807
There are writings on my body . . .

418
00:30:31,807 --> 00:30:37,546
would you look more at me?

419
00:30:55,598 --> 00:31:02,387
You will have a hard time trying to erase all the ink on your body.

420
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,386
What is this?!

421
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:14,182
It was almost the moment when I and Husband lock eyes together!

422
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,910
It seems so long since husband has left...

423
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:20,203
oh...

424
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:21,924
oh...

425
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:26,204
It's only been two days.

426
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:33,235
Please take care of Mother while I'm gone.

427
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:36,539
I should listen to Husband.

428
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:40,038
Mother.

429
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:42,620
I'm going in.

430
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,248
Yes, Princess,
 Please enter.

431
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:53,223
Mother,

432
00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:55,291
What were you doing?

433
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,829
The Queen Dowager sent over this letter.

434
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:01,824
I was reading it.

435
00:32:01,824 --> 00:32:03,699
Mother?

436
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:05,135
What did she write?

437
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:08,037
She asked if you were staying well.

438
00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:09,772
What else?

439
00:32:10,507 --> 00:32:13,876
The day of the consummation for the King

440
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,612
has been rescheduled to an earlier date.

441
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:18,715
Consummation day?...

442
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:21,147
When is it?

443
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:24,253
She said in 4 days,

444
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:26,889
On the 18th.

445
00:32:27,557 --> 00:32:29,826
That fast!

446
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:34,797
Mother, I think I have to enter the palace.

447
00:32:34,797 --> 00:32:37,979
It's fine to enter the Palace.  But,

448
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:39,469
why all of a sudden?

449
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:44,106
There are a few things to tell the Queen.

450
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:49,310
I'll think of it as you allowing me to go. 
So,  I'll be going.

451
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:06,062
In order to have a baby boy...

452
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:10,244
Eat a lot of vegetables.

453
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:17,299
And, you must sleep laying on the left side.

454
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:22,700
What else is there?

455
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,900
Your Highness, please show some dignity.

456
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,300
Something's strange.
 I thought I saw something important?

457
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,480
7 things that should be done, 8 things that shouldn't be done, just where is it?

458
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:41,063
It looks like you saw it here.

459
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:45,201
What?
You saw this book too?

460
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:47,503
Why would you need this?

461
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:51,140
As a study tool.

462
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:57,246
Anyway, you see everything.

463
00:34:03,854 --> 00:34:07,290
I'm going to teach a few tricks to the Queen,

464
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,559
What should I request?

465
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,428
A head ornament?

466
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:15,396
Or a pearl hairpin?

467
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:25,307
Princess, it has been a long time.

468
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:27,143
Grandmother.

469
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:29,866
Have you been well?

470
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:33,716
And is your husband well also?

471
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:36,418
Yes.

472
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,522
Have you been well, Grandmother?

473
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:41,524
No.

474
00:34:41,524 --> 00:34:44,400
This Grandmother hasn't been well.

475
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,862
What?

476
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:49,933
Since my only granddaughter doesn't visit me often,

477
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:52,568
how can I be well?

478
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:54,637
I'm sorry.

479
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:58,841
I was just joking.

480
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:02,711
Are you going to the Queen's palace?

481
00:35:02,712 --> 00:35:05,648
I happen to be going there as well.

482
00:35:05,648 --> 00:35:07,356
Why don't we go together?

483
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:12,422
No. I just received word that I should go home.

484
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:15,357
I was on my way to leave.

485
00:35:15,357 --> 00:35:18,327
Please stay healthy.

486
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:24,767
Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

487
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:32,140
The truth that father wanted to hide . . .

488
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,279
Despite having to sacrifice himself,
 the former official must protect the secret.

489
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:41,283
What is it?

490
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:46,623
Your Majesty,

491
00:35:46,623 --> 00:35:49,424
The three professors and physician request 
an audience with you.

492
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:52,194
Bring them in.

493
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:06,776
Your Majesty,

494
00:36:06,776 --> 00:36:08,778
Your Majesty.

495
00:36:08,778 --> 00:36:13,347
We will be examining your pulse rate, please take a seat.

496
00:36:31,134 --> 00:36:33,651
This is strange.

497
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:38,244
Why did you all come to see me today?

498
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,274
What is this?

499
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:51,167
This is the date of the consummation.

500
00:36:54,494 --> 00:36:56,036
In 3 days?

501
00:36:56,036 --> 00:36:57,538
Yes.

502
00:36:57,538 --> 00:37:01,228
That happens to be the auspicious date.

503
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:05,487
It's the best day for you to consummate with the Queen.

504
00:37:05,487 --> 00:37:07,678
The weather will be excellent as well.

505
00:37:07,678 --> 00:37:09,739
The weather will be excellent as well.

506
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:14,427
The suitable place has also been selected, Your Majesty.

507
00:37:14,427 --> 00:37:17,150
The suitable place has been selected, Your Majesty.

508
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:21,203
In addition to that, Your Majesty has also recovered too.

509
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:24,162
The wedding needs to be consummated as soon as possible.

510
00:37:24,162 --> 00:37:26,444
I still have not recovered completely yet.

511
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,428
Forgive me for speaking directly.

512
00:37:28,428 --> 00:37:31,684
However, Your Majesty's health has improved and there's nothing to worry about now.

513
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,968
If I'm sick, then I'm sick!

514
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:35,468
But,

515
00:37:35,468 --> 00:37:38,711
The days of the unpredictable things can happen.

516
00:37:38,711 --> 00:37:40,260
That's correct, Your Majesty.

517
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,172
The most favorable place that has been chosen is the rarest, Your Majesty.

518
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:48,455
The most favorable place that has been chosen is the rarest, Your Majesty.

519
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:52,215
In order to carry on the family line, we can no longer postpone it, Your Majesty.

520
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:54,732
Didn't I say my body is not well yet!

521
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:57,353
Since you're disturbing, 
 leave now!

522
00:37:57,353 --> 00:38:00,132
Your Majesty . . .

523
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,559
Don't you hear my commands?

524
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:06,228
Hurry up and leave immediately!

525
00:38:31,688 --> 00:38:34,357
It's not the first time that the His Majesty has declined the consummation.

526
00:38:34,357 --> 00:38:36,759
It's not the first time that the His Majesty has declined the consummation.

527
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:38,561
It was something I expected.

528
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:40,899
But the efforts into this consummation might be useless then.

529
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,999
But the efforts into this consummation might be useless then.

530
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:45,668
But why are you so calm about this?

531
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:49,838
This time must be successful, no matter what.

532
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:54,242
Could it be that you have a good idea for this matter?

533
00:38:55,178 --> 00:38:57,647
Actually, I'm thinking about the shaman.

534
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:58,982
Actually, I'm talking about the shaman.

535
00:38:58,982 --> 00:39:01,284
Are you talking about that again?

536
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:03,353
His Majesty is well aware of the talisman's existence.

537
00:39:03,353 --> 00:39:05,722
His Majesty is well aware of the talisman's existence.

538
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:07,690
Doesn't that shaman come in only when he's asleep?

539
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,727
Doesn't that shaman come in only when he's asleep?

540
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,502
That's why it's strange.

541
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:18,901
His Majesty disagrees to anything related to the shaman.

542
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:23,772
Except for Woon and Hyung Sun, 
His Majesty won't allow anyone to be by his side.

543
00:39:23,773 --> 00:39:27,710
But, yet, he always keeps the shaman by his side.

544
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,012
What does it mean?

545
00:39:30,012 --> 00:39:33,382
Is it really because of his health?

546
00:39:33,382 --> 00:39:34,784
Then . . .

547
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:39,722
It's his feelings.

548
00:39:39,722 --> 00:39:42,091
If this is true, we cannot let this continue.

549
00:39:42,091 --> 00:39:44,227
How can we just stay stlll like this?

550
00:39:44,227 --> 00:39:46,295
What should we do then?

551
00:39:46,295 --> 00:39:48,330
We need to make the shaman leave His Majesty's side immediately.

552
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,166
We need to make the shaman leave His Majesty's side immediately.

553
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:54,003
We must not do that.

554
00:39:54,003 --> 00:40:00,242
Until the day the consummation happens, 
she must remain at his side.

555
00:40:00,643 --> 00:40:02,712
You told me 8 years ago

556
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:06,749
that this marriage was not for the sake of love.

557
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,886
What you said was right.

558
00:40:09,886 --> 00:40:11,921
But the matter of the consummation..

559
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:14,791
I can take advantage of his feelings
 to complete my objective.

560
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:18,293
I can take advantage of this feeling to complete my objective.

561
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,167
Since I will never received those feelings ...

562
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:29,170
Since I will never receive those feelings ...

563
00:40:31,508 --> 00:40:34,276
I can only take advantage of them.

564
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:44,919
Your words.... are correct.

565
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:47,288
The person I am seeing is,

566
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:49,223
If it's that child...

567
00:40:49,223 --> 00:40:50,825
or if it's just you.

568
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:52,527
 I'm..

569
00:40:52,527 --> 00:40:54,598
 confused...

570
00:40:55,731 --> 00:40:58,232
So I,

571
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,000
 Until I can figure out this confusion...

572
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,200
Until I know what these feelings are,

573
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,274
Don't you dare,

574
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:10,017
Go far away from me.

575
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:20,356
These are so pretty.

576
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:21,224
Look at these colors.

577
00:41:21,224 --> 00:41:22,691
Unni, come here quickly.

578
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:25,794
There's a big present for you, Unni.

579
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,100
It's so pretty.

580
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,703
Look at edges of the knife! It is the best!

581
00:41:36,305 --> 00:41:38,940
Aren't the sounds of the bells great also?

582
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:42,677
Jan Shil, where did these come from?

583
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:45,414
Here, a letter.

584
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:51,720
Do you like it?

585
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,656
I hope you can wield your spiritual power as much as you want.

586
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,500
From the person who is wealthy and has a free spirited will,

587
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,360
Chivalrous Fighter.

588
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:07,368
What kind of luck does she have?

589
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,300
Did she save the nation in her past life or something?

590
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,300
Are you looking for me?

591
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:37,165
Did you like the presents I sent you?

592
00:42:37,165 --> 00:42:41,904
I didn't know what to get you.  So, I took a well known Shaman with me to pick out the gifts.

593
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:45,306
I will get you a cutter knife next time.

594
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:47,809
Why are you like this, Sir?

595
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:50,890
What about me?

596
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,982
I... am a shaman.

597
00:42:53,982 --> 00:42:56,659
That is why I gave you things for a shaman.

598
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:00,255
I'm asking why you sent the presents?

599
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,791
Are you asking because you really don't know?

600
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:06,362
I'm asking because I don't know.

601
00:43:06,362 --> 00:43:08,329
Because I like you.

602
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,200
I...

603
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
like you.

604
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,905
Your jokes are...

605
00:43:16,905 --> 00:43:18,107
too excessive.

606
00:43:18,107 --> 00:43:19,408
It's not a joke.

607
00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:21,877
If it's not a joke, then what is it?

608
00:43:21,877 --> 00:43:24,279
If a man likes a woman,

609
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:25,848
it's the truth.  What else can it be?

610
00:43:25,848 --> 00:43:29,017
What do you know about me that

611
00:43:29,017 --> 00:43:31,620
started your interest in me?

612
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,300
Because it was the first.

613
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,600
'Don't try to hide behind a smile.'

614
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,661
'Don't fool your heart.'

615
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:44,565
'The pain deep within your heart..'

616
00:43:44,565 --> 00:43:46,335
'just let it go.'

617
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:49,571
You were the first person who told me that.

618
00:43:49,571 --> 00:43:52,273
And those words . . .

619
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,211
gave me encouragement.

620
00:43:58,948 --> 00:44:01,349
Your words are correct.

621
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:05,352
How much do I know about you?

622
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:08,100
In the beginning, it was just

623
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:13,865
that you were similar to a woman I once liked.

624
00:44:14,997 --> 00:44:17,365
But not anymore.

625
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:21,302
The person I am looking at is

626
00:44:23,238 --> 00:44:24,806
you.

627
00:44:25,675 --> 00:44:27,109
 Once again..

628
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:31,912
the relationships that aren't meant to tangle up are being tangled.

629
00:44:32,348 --> 00:44:35,750
I feel uneasy.

630
00:44:36,352 --> 00:44:39,011
There is going to be much chaos.

631
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:41,523
I have a premonition about

632
00:44:41,523 --> 00:44:44,659
a blood-bath rising.

633
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:48,564
How can a destiny

634
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:51,700
be controlled by a human?

635
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,400
The only way this will end is . . .

636
00:44:56,172 --> 00:44:58,206
In  3 days . . .

637
00:44:58,206 --> 00:45:00,775
It is only that day.

638
00:45:00,775 --> 00:45:03,578
If the consummation succeeds,

639
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:06,700
the destiny will break again.

640
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,600
When that day passes,

641
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,700
I will send Agasshi

642
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,400
to a safe place, far far away.

643
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,391
Do you think everything will be okay after you send her off?

644
00:45:17,726 --> 00:45:20,428
The truth that we've kept secret

645
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:23,698
is starting to surface.

646
00:45:23,698 --> 00:45:26,401
It wouldn't make a difference,

647
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,300
even if the truth is revealed.

648
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:33,374
Don't you know?

649
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:36,611
As long as they know all of our weaknesses,

650
00:45:36,611 --> 00:45:39,815
there is no one who can escape

651
00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:44,083
from the misfortunes headed this way.

652
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,609
I know that I'm good looking.  But,

653
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:09,383
stop staring at me.

654
00:46:10,246 --> 00:46:11,413
Anyway,

655
00:46:11,413 --> 00:46:14,949
a working man always look cool,

656
00:46:14,949 --> 00:46:17,486
especially when he is the King.

657
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,200
Doesn't it look really cool?

658
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,261
Are you laughing?

659
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:29,597
Did you just laugh?

660
00:46:30,366 --> 00:46:33,401
I've sinned.

661
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:37,883
Follow me.

662
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,300
It's a walk.

663
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,100
Is there something that is bothering you?

664
00:47:01,674 --> 00:47:04,381
For some reason, you look

665
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:06,401
especially tired.

666
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,277
Today . . .

667
00:47:11,481 --> 00:47:14,342
Someone died because of me.

668
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:17,600
Because of my reckless decision,

669
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,400
that person killed himself.

670
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,400
So . . .

671
00:47:24,687 --> 00:47:26,631
The person who killed him

672
00:47:26,631 --> 00:47:28,400
is me.

673
00:47:29,091 --> 00:47:31,011
WithIn my boundary,

674
00:47:31,011 --> 00:47:34,000
a shadow of death follows me.

675
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,431
The people whom I cherish

676
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:38,833
all become in danger.

677
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:39,935
I am

678
00:47:39,935 --> 00:47:43,104
unable to protect all of them.

679
00:47:43,104 --> 00:47:46,740
Not only unable to protect them, but

680
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:50,744
I couldn't even relieve them

681
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:53,850
from their regrets.

682
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:58,085
It's not...

683
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:01,589
your fault.

684
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:06,394
They probably all know

685
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,300
how much you wanted to protect them.

686
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,200
How much grace you had.

687
00:48:14,637 --> 00:48:16,938
They probably

688
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:19,746
knew how you felt.

689
00:48:19,746 --> 00:48:21,476
So,

690
00:48:21,476 --> 00:48:25,345
please do not blame yourself.

691
00:48:28,384 --> 00:48:31,252
With your spiritual talent, tell me,

692
00:48:31,252 --> 00:48:34,338
Do you think the truth I am searching for..

693
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,200
will be revealed?

694
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,927
It will be.

695
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,300
Then . . .

696
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,065
This time, not with your spiritual talents, but...

697
00:48:45,668 --> 00:48:48,882
from your own thoughts..

698
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:51,039
The truth I am searching for right now,

699
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:53,441
do you think it will be revealed?

700
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:55,410
It will be.

701
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,200
Why are you so sure?

702
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,157
Because I believe in Your Majesty's efforts.

703
00:49:02,585 --> 00:49:04,553
The tangled up knots

704
00:49:04,553 --> 00:49:07,955
aren't meant to untangle all at once,

705
00:49:07,955 --> 00:49:12,293
But when you untangle those knots, one by one,

706
00:49:13,529 --> 00:49:16,306
wouldn't the hidden secret

707
00:49:16,306 --> 00:49:19,701
be revealed someday?

708
00:49:19,936 --> 00:49:22,131
So,

709
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:25,085
please believe . . .

710
00:49:25,808 --> 00:49:28,862
in yourself.

711
00:49:30,946 --> 00:49:33,262
Thanks.

712
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:37,741
It's been a long time since I've heard..

713
00:49:40,823 --> 00:49:43,323
a warm encouragement.

714
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:56,972
 Subtitles brought to you by The 'Eclipse Team @ Viki.com

715
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,400
How many times do I have to repeat my words?!

716
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,494
Didn't I say I'm still sick?!

717
00:50:04,494 --> 00:50:07,394
You seem to be fine.

718
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,200
Could there be really any other reasons?

719
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,646
Then, do you think I'm lying?

720
00:50:14,646 --> 00:50:16,724
Inside the Grand Palace,.

721
00:50:16,724 --> 00:50:20,928
it has been more than 20 days
 since you've had the talisman.

722
00:50:20,928 --> 00:50:23,700
Why is that issue being brought out now?

723
00:50:23,777 --> 00:50:25,233
Honestly,

724
00:50:26,235 --> 00:50:28,897
did it not work?

725
00:50:28,897 --> 00:50:30,773
Why is that issue

726
00:50:30,773 --> 00:50:32,641
being raised now?

727
00:50:32,641 --> 00:50:35,382
If the talisman

728
00:50:35,382 --> 00:50:38,098
wasn't able to do what she was supposed to do,

729
00:50:38,098 --> 00:50:39,699
this means

730
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:42,851
that we need to punish her with the law.

731
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:44,987
What do you mean by punish her?

732
00:50:44,987 --> 00:50:48,022
She performs her services,

733
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,200
with her life on the line.

734
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,000
If talisman was there for over 20 days 
and it hasn't affected you in any way,

735
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
there is something to suspect about her.

736
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,400
And it is only right to destroy it.

737
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,291
Isn't that correct?

738
00:51:07,243 --> 00:51:09,253
His feelings.

739
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:11,798
We just need to use his feelings.

740
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:13,916
The King . . .

741
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:19,318
If he refuses consummation again
 because of his health,

742
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:23,063
It will be because the talisman 
didn't do her work correctly.

743
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:26,113
Therefore, she needs to be punished.

744
00:51:26,113 --> 00:51:28,265
Thankfully,

745
00:51:28,265 --> 00:51:30,173
what if

746
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:32,055
the King agrees to the consummation?

747
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:35,401
Since the talisman accomplished all she needed to do,

748
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:37,849
we have to let her go.

749
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:40,171
Either to leave with a life

750
00:51:40,171 --> 00:51:42,397
or with a dead one

751
00:51:42,397 --> 00:51:45,273
is the only difference.

752
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:48,591
That child's life....

753
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:52,245
is in our hands.

754
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,500
But, what if

755
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,300
he wants to keep her even after the consummation?

756
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,215
What if he makes that kind of command?

757
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:07,973
What are you going to do then?

758
00:52:07,973 --> 00:52:10,962
Then...

759
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,300
You will have tell this issue to the Confucian scholars.

760
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,301
Our nation stands, thanks to the Confucian scholars.

761
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:24,500
The King, who should be an example
 to the people of the country,

762
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:28,338
is keeping a shaman near him.

763
00:52:29,158 --> 00:52:31,121
Think about the reactions of the Confucian scholars.

764
00:52:31,121 --> 00:52:33,647
What would it be?

765
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:45,198
Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

766
00:53:02,328 --> 00:53:05,138
I know that I'm good-looking, but . . .

767
00:53:05,138 --> 00:53:07,224
Stop staring at me.

768
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,897
Unni!

769
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,500
We cleaned up today in the morning.
 Why do we have to do it again?

770
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,584
I told you today is the day of consummation for the King and the Queen.

771
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:32,076
The day of consummation?

772
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:33,600
That's right! Consummation Day.

773
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:39,297
I told you that's why we are all gathering to pray,
 so that everything will go smoothly.

774
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,200
You are so forgetful.

775
00:53:50,485 --> 00:53:52,224
Your Majesty,

776
00:53:52,224 --> 00:53:56,106
It is something you have to do.

777
00:53:56,106 --> 00:53:59,034
In order to continue your family line,

778
00:53:59,034 --> 00:54:01,817
you need to have an heir to your throne.

779
00:54:01,817 --> 00:54:06,738
Only then, will you able to comfort the nation.

780
00:54:06,738 --> 00:54:08,700
Stop now.

781
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,100
This servant... 
Before I serve you,

782
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,472
I have the obligation to serve the nation as well.

783
00:54:16,472 --> 00:54:17,400
We cannot delay anymore.

784
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,900
How can you also act this way to me?

785
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,500
Most of all,

786
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:27,252
as long "they" know of her existence, 
you need to be very careful.

787
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:31,296
If you keep on denying it,

788
00:54:31,296 --> 00:54:34,266
The child . . .

789
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,300
will be in danger.

790
00:54:42,872 --> 00:54:44,573
This servant,

791
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:48,970
is very worried that you will be hurt again like in the past.

792
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:57,228
I am worried that you will blame yourself again 
for not being able to protect her.

793
00:54:59,968 --> 00:55:02,277
Your Majesty.

794
00:55:04,013 --> 00:55:06,258
Tonight . . .

795
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,300
Don't bring the child here.

796
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:17,225
I don't want her to be here,.

797
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:21,929
all by herself.

798
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:37,398
Queen, the King has arrived.

799
00:58:08,897 --> 00:58:14,569
There was an order from the King 
telling you not to come tonight.

800
00:58:18,374 --> 00:58:20,893
Why do you have such a sad expression

801
00:58:20,893 --> 00:58:24,278
while thinking?

802
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:38,126
Why did you come here again?

803
00:58:38,126 --> 00:58:39,327
Is it because

804
00:58:40,362 --> 00:58:44,199
you heard about the King and Queen's consummation tonight?

805
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:46,568
Please go back.

806
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:49,704
He is Joseon's king.

807
00:58:49,939 --> 00:58:53,876
This is something that he must do.

808
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:55,644
I know that.

809
00:58:55,644 --> 00:59:00,882
From loving him, you will only get 
a broken heart and

810
00:59:01,536 --> 00:59:03,152
pain.

811
00:59:03,152 --> 00:59:05,020
I also

812
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,225
know that.

813
00:59:10,526 --> 00:59:13,728
But, why do I see tears?

814
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,233
Can't I...

815
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:22,070
be the one?

816
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:26,975
Can't I?

817
00:59:27,576 --> 00:59:29,310
Can't I...

818
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:38,219
Please remove the crown, Your Majesty.

819
00:59:55,926 --> 01:00:00,353
Please unbuckle your belt, Your Majesty.

820
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,719
Finally,

821
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:15,255
you must be happy since you're getting 
what you've wanted.

822
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:18,327
How can this

823
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:21,896
be what only I want?

824
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:28,236
From the elders, council and all 
the citizens of the country,

825
01:00:28,771 --> 01:00:32,273
isn't it what everyone expects?

826
01:00:33,976 --> 01:00:36,211
Can't I . . .

827
01:00:36,453 --> 01:00:38,314
be the one?

828
01:00:38,314 --> 01:00:41,016
Please go back.

829
01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:43,819
Will you go with me?

830
01:00:43,819 --> 01:00:46,689
I really hate this place being the Prince.

831
01:00:46,689 --> 01:00:49,558
I can throw away my position at anytime

832
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:52,127
and leave.

833
01:00:53,963 --> 01:00:56,865
Living as a shaman

834
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:59,268
can't always be good.

835
01:00:59,669 --> 01:01:03,438
If you really want to run away from this horrible situation . . .

836
01:01:03,438 --> 01:01:06,240
if you really do . . .

837
01:01:08,344 --> 01:01:12,246
Will you run away with me?

838
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,100
Whatever you say,

839
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,200
I . . .

840
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:42,310
am your woman.

841
01:01:58,186 --> 01:01:59,910
Regardless . . .

842
01:02:00,924 --> 01:02:04,362
Since you can't have my heart,

843
01:02:05,518 --> 01:02:10,248
I'll bet you, at least, want to be a mother of the next king.

844
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,329
Fine.

845
01:02:20,985 --> 01:02:24,234
For the Queen,

846
01:02:24,512 --> 01:02:30,308
I will take my clothes off just this one time.
