Episode 9

2
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,287
Who are you?

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,197
Who are you that you dare to be here?

4
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:34,619
Tell me!

5
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,852
What is your identity?!

6
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:42,003
Bring in the candles!

7
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:47,532
What are you doing?!

8
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:50,948
Bring light into the room!

9
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,272
You...

10
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:24,056
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,387
No way...

12
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,056
Nothing will happen right?

13
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:42,232
Hey, Jan Shil.

14
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:46,412
You...do you...

15
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:47,721
not feel anything?

16
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:50,039
The darkness is gathering.

17
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:53,412
The darkness is gathering?

18
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:56,344
What are you talking about?

19
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:58,231
What do you mean darkness is gathering?

20
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,283
What does it mean?

21
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:03,541
Move! I'm saying it's dark because 
you're blocking the light.

22
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,329
Aish!

23
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:20,209
Who commanded you to come here?

24
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:28,031
Meeting me at Won Yang that night too.

25
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:31,001
Was it a command by that person?

26
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,184
What did that person command you?

27
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:37,900
Did he command you to seduce me?

28
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:40,089
Or,

29
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:43,161
did he command you to strangle me with this very hand?

30
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:46,700
If not that, then while I slept,

31
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,859
were you ordered to stab me with a 
knife without anyone knowing?

32
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,904
Answer me!

33
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:56,172
From whom do you get orders 
and whose spy are you!

34
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:58,151
Spy?

35
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:00,824
That is not true.

36
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:05,092
I am just a powerless shaman.

37
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,843
A powerless shaman?

38
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:18,501
Your Majesty,

39
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,592
Please calm down.

40
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:23,451
This woman is a Seongsucheong shaman,

41
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:25,740
We only brought her here to make you feel better.

42
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,717
She isn't a spy.

43
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:30,135
She's just a shaman and not a spy, you say?

44
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:31,515
That is correct.

45
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:35,568
Instead of a person, you can consider her just a talisman.

46
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:37,889
Then...

47
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,660
A person who is not a person ...

48
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,872
Dares touch my body?

49
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,727
Tell me!

50
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:52,649
Who can prove that these hands

51
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,768
weren't trying to strangle me?!

52
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,248
Y-your M-majesty!

53
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:02,851
The crime for touching your body.

54
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,737
It is right for me to die a hundred times.

55
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:08,749
Please give me the chance to explain myself.

56
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,839
Explain?

57
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:13,868
Try it then.

58
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,800
Of course

59
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:22,679
Even the heavens and the sky that control the weather,

60
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,788
need to rest in order to take care of the land

61
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:28,233
and make the flowers bloom.

62
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,925
Then

63
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:33,096
as for you, a king, who carries his country on his shoulders

64
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:35,759
what more can be said?

65
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,496
You've studied the classics(SasoOhkyung), 
so you know how to speak eloquently.

66
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:43,452
Your restful sleep leads to this country's peace.

67
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,901
How can you take care of the people in your country

68
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:48,700
if your body is weak?

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,200
So, this servant only . . .

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,961
Only while you are sleeping . . .

71
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:59,576
Just wanted to take away your fatigue from reigning

72
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:03,581
and help you let go of the pain within your heart

73
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,921
and wanted to let you rest in peace.

74
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,017
Did you just say...

75
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:11,700
pain within my heart?

76
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Yes?

77
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,073
I guess because you are a shaman, you can read people's minds?

78
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:19,533
So is that why you touched my body?

79
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,200
So that you can read me?

80
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,989
I'm sorry, but . . .

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,500
The girl you called out to in your sleep

82
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,671
seems to be linked to your pain and so

83
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:33,431
I just wanted to  comfort you.

84
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:36,699
And committed the crime of touching you.

85
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,036
 No, it can't be.

86
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:40,368
 This girl is not Yeon Woo.

87
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:45,804
 If it was Yeon Woo, then she would not just have sat there when her own name was called out.

88
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,929
 It's a misunderstanding. It's an illusion.

89
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:51,067
Your Majesty

90
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,299
 I have to...

91
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:54,919
 stop.

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,700
Throw that girl...

93
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:08,903
Out of the palace, immediately

94
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,092
Your Majesty

95
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:12,069
What are you doing!

96
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,743
Didn't you hear the command?!

97
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:16,693
Your Majesty

98
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:18,871
Your Majesty

99
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,731
Your Majesty!

100
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:23,192
Your Majesty!

101
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,376
You woman!

102
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:41,239
How dare you touch his body?!

103
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:43,756
Were you out of your mind?!

104
00:06:43,756 --> 00:06:48,108
If you were caught, then you should have just sat there in silence until your punishment was given.

105
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:52,992
Who do you think you are to talk back to him!

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,300
Imprison her

107
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,915
Immediately.

108
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,604
Miss.

109
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:00,525
Stop right now!

110
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:03,312
This woman is a shaman from Seongsucheong, so

111
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:05,303
I will punish her following our shaman laws.

112
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:06,939
She has commited treason for touching the king's body

113
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:09,413
so she cannot be punished with your law!

114
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:10,736
Didn't you hear?

115
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:12,871
Put this girl in prison!

116
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:15,233
Sir.

117
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:20,336
On her forehead,

118
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,839
I will inscribe the word "criminal" and send her away.

119
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,901
Without my order,

120
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:27,905
you are not to give her anything, not even a drop of water.

121
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,824
Yes.

122
00:07:57,015 --> 00:07:59,295
Please open!

123
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,908
Spiritual Mother!

124
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:11,992
Please open the door!

125
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:16,941
Please open the door! I beg you...

126
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:19,117
Seol...

127
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,484
 Your Majesty
 Your Majesty
 Your Majesty!

128
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,481
Tha's right. She isn't human

129
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,640
you can treat her as a talisman.

130
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,523
A person who isn't a person.

131
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:20,005
Dares touch the king's body?

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,038
Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

133
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:46,110
 It seems the professors caught the 
shaman girl, so let's go.

134
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:59,374
Word must not spread about this situation.

135
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,152
Do you understand?

136
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:03,448
Yes. 
 Let's go.

137
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:17,764
Wow, it's been a long time.

138
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:21,876
Professor of Prophecy.

139
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:32,634
Don't be so nervous.

140
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:34,652
Do you think . . .

141
00:10:34,652 --> 00:10:37,955
I'll eat you up?

142
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:44,450
It's dangerous for a royal to visit the Office of Physiognomy...

143
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,988
Don't you know?

144
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:48,247
I know. Why wouldn't I know?

145
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:55,267
There is not a single conspiracy 
where shamans from Seongsucheong 
and physiogonomists weren't involved.

146
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:57,859
You're talking about that, right?

147
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,356
I'm sorry, but if you clearly understand that . . .

148
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:09,366
So why did you come here?

149
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:14,036
First have a look at this.

150
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:17,427
How is it? 
 Doesn't it look like it would've hurt a lot?

151
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:21,290
It must've hurt, but...

152
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,146
Aren't you going to ask how it became like this?

153
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:28,596
How did it happen?

154
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:33,832
A few days ago, after helping a shaman that was being chased, I was wounded.

155
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:37,400
I did so many cool things in front of the shaman, but

156
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,655
but a few strange men came along and dragged her away, as if dragging away a dog.

157
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:45,563
Those strange men said, "the professor..."

158
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:48,746
"had taken the shaman."

159
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:50,920
So,

160
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,930
I tried using my broken head.

161
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,216
A professor?

162
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:02,652
Then, I ruled out the medical doctors and the scribes.

163
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:04,494
Then,

164
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,500
is it Princess' mathematics professor? Is it?!

165
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,296
But, then, it wasn't.

166
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:18,310
Professors of law wouldn't personally go out and do such a thing themselves.

167
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,386
Then, the only one left,

168
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,300
is the Office of Physiognomy.

169
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,932
And from among them,

170
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:37,286
it must be Professor of Prophecy.

171
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:41,324
That shaman . . .

172
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:43,456
Where is she?

173
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:47,991
How would I know where that shaman is?

174
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:52,215
I just targeted heresy and was ordered to take necessary action.

175
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:55,820
So all I did was get rid of the shamans and monks within the capital city.

176
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,007
At the time I, too, was disguised as a monk.

177
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,958
So why didn't you arrest me?

178
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:06,028
That is...
 That girl had evil yin

179
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:09,546
and she committed a great crime,
 so we were eager to arrest her.

180
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:12,100
After arresting her, where did you put her?

181
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,314
Is it at Yongsankang? Text:Yongsankang: 
a village made by shamans who were kicked 
out of the capital city

182
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:17,708
No, she was filled with evil energy,

183
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,410
so we sent her far away.

184
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,238
Then tell me where she's registered?!

185
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:23,938
She isn't registered

186
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:29,827
and had evil yin, which is why we arrested her.

187
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:49,542
Prince Yang Myung.

188
00:13:57,716 --> 00:14:02,107
It looks like you both are in a hurry to 
get to the king's quarters.

189
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,574
Is there something wrong with,

190
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,248
The King?

191
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:08,947
Why are you asking?

192
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:12,474
Did you wish for something to happen to the King?

193
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:13,410
Mother-in-law...

194
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,928
Royal Concubine is no longer in the palace, 
so why did you come?

195
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:21,390
Have you already forgotten the previous king's

196
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,900
warning to not frequently enter the palace?

197
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,692
Why are you like this, Mother-in-law?

198
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,100
He must have entered the palace because he is worried.

199
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,562
Isn't that correct?

200
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:33,916
These days . . .

201
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:38,119
Vicious people (supporters) are gathering around you, is what I heard.

202
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:40,815
That...

203
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:45,184
Has nothing to do with me.

204
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,520
Don't flies gather because there is a stench?

205
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,918
They gather because someone is releasing a foul odor.

206
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:54,670
But,

207
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,306
You must keep something in mind.

208
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:00,536
As long as I am alive,

209
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:03,000
you'll never (become king).

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,871
Understood? You can't.

211
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,882
Let's go, Queen.

212
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,939
Grandmother.

213
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:24,507
Grandmother, your vigor isn't like what it used to be.

214
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,944
So I...

215
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:30,156
feel quite sad.

216
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:33,666
What did you just say?

217
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:39,212
Flies aren't gathering around my house because of a foul stench,

218
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:43,532
but rather because the King hasn't been able to produce a heir.

219
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:45,788
For the King to be safe,

220
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:49,562
Grandmother you need to stay alive even past the age of 100.

221
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:51,880
It is such a worry.

222
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,230
Because it seems like I will

223
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,440
be alive on this earth longer than you.

224
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,903
While you are alive, you must be filled with such worry.

225
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:09,528
To wish your strong health and longevity,

226
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:12,586
I will visit every now and then to cheer you.

227
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:14,967
Well then...

228
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:18,954
Please stay well.

229
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:31,472
Are you really fine?

230
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:33,890
As you can see, I am quite healthy.

231
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,171
I am well.

232
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:37,162
It is such a relief.

233
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,743
I heard your attendants were quite frantic during the night, so

234
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:43,760
I thought your health had worsened.

235
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,049
Nothing happened. 
 Don't worry.

236
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,308
You must be more strong.

237
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:52,692
So,

238
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:55,188
that no more vicious supporters

239
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:58,127
of Prince Yang Myung can rise again!

240
00:16:58,127 --> 00:17:00,984
Why are you like this, Mother-in-law?

241
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:03,052
They are acting on their own.

242
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:06,026
How could Prince Yang Myung have such thoughts?

243
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:12,795
Prince Yang Myung's very existence reeks of danger!

244
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:17,351
You must be stronger than ever, King.

245
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:20,483
You must hurry and produce an heir.

246
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,000
Most of all, you must keep your distance from Yang Myung.

247
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,784
Only in that way, can you  continue your reign.

248
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,595
Do you understand?

249
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,643
[Location provided by Korean Folk Village.]

250
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:13,635
Prince Yang Myung.

251
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:18,692
Mother.

252
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:21,747
What were you praying for so sincerely?

253
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:25,500
I am always asking for the King's health.

254
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:30,635
And that our Prince Yang Myung can have a beautiful wife as well.

255
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:33,255
is what I ask for too.

256
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,359
Why are you like that?

257
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,192
Even without a common hair pin,

258
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:43,943
your hair always look beautiful.

259
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:49,068
Though I've entered the monastery,

260
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:55,478
I still haven't been able to cleanse away
 my worldly agonies.  
So I haven't been able to shave my head bald.

261
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:57,990
One day when I cleanse away my worldly agony...

262
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,582
Just...

263
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,492
Why don't you just leave it like that.

264
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:06,121
Who knows...

265
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:10,560
If the King is faced with unavoidable death...

266
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,162
You may go back to being a Queen.

267
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:14,697
Prince Yang Myung.

268
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,100
How can you say such a terrible thing?

269
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,438
King's safety is your safety, don't you know that?

270
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,900
How can I not know?

271
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:30,887
Since I was born

272
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:34,216
haven't I always heard those words from you, Mother.

273
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:38,087
Prince Yang Myung,

274
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:42,024
though the tree tries to stay still,

275
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,800
the wind

276
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,196
eventually makes it bend and shake.

277
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:48,931
Please,

278
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:52,034
don't bend despite whatever winds comes your way.

279
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,736
Don't be shaken.

280
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:57,206
That way the previous king will be happy

281
00:19:57,206 --> 00:20:00,809
and it is the way for you to be safe.

282
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:04,546
Prince Yang Myung.

283
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,182
Mother..

284
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:11,186
do you believe in reincarnation?

285
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:15,591
I have emptied my heart.

286
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,361
Both towards power and making a name for myself.

287
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:23,232
I'm not desirous of anything.

288
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:27,102
Just...

289
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:30,539
Only one person.

290
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:36,444
If there is such a thing as rebirth, then

291
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,615
all I want is to meet this one person.

292
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,388
That the person might not recognize me...

293
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:52,360
That once again someone else

294
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:54,864
will be chosen, and not me.

295
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,903
Even though we may have already met...

296
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,876
I might lose her again...

297
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:14,916
That is my only concern.

298

Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

299
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,000
 Where should I go

300
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,300
 to find you?

301
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,300
Woon,

302
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:58,354
Do you also think that,

303
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,148
Yang Myung Hyungnim is that kind of person?

304
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,911
You must know Hyungnim well, so . . .

305
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,524
Tell me.

306
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:11,560
Are you

307
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,740
greatly suspicious?

308
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,136
Do you think I would suspect Hyungnim?

309
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,266
The tree is shaken

310
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:23,804
So I fear the tree will break before it is bent.

311
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:28,700
Isn't it funny?

312
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,759
This so-called king's position.

313
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:36,518
Even brothers related by blood need to see each other as enemies.

314
00:22:36,518 --> 00:22:40,016
Today, I feel this position is...

315
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:43,772
really tiresome.

316
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,638
 At least while you were sleeping,

317
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:51,522
 I wanted to take away the fatigue

318
00:22:51,522 --> 00:22:54,587
 and lessen the pain within your heart.

319
00:22:54,587 --> 00:22:57,147
 I only wanted you to rest in peace so-

320
00:22:57,147 --> 00:22:58,292
Woon.

321
00:22:58,292 --> 00:22:59,750
I await your command.

322
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,183
Seongsucheong's registry...

323
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:04,251
Check it.

324
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:06,762
What do you want me to look into?

325
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:09,079
Check the Minister's movements too.

326
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,696
Are you checking to see if she's a spy?

327
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:15,999
Or are you checking because you want to know that she's not a spy?

328
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:34,375
 Yeon Woo, Yeon Woo.

329
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,911
 Yeon Woo!

330
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:39,071
Yeon Woo!

331
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:42,914
You can't, Yeon Woo! 
 Yeon Woo!

332
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:14,972
Yeon Woo.

333
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:18,359
My child...

334
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,898
My baby.

335
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,300
You are alive.

336
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,388
You were alive.

337
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:33,134
The weather's so cold, why are you dressed so lightly?

338
00:24:33,134 --> 00:24:35,986
What if you catch  a cold?

339
00:24:39,454 --> 00:24:42,267
Didn't it hurt?

340
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:45,239
Wasn't it painful?

341
00:24:46,707 --> 00:24:49,548
wasn't it cold?

342
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:52,156
Wasn't it scary?

343
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:03,100
Say something, Yeon Woo...

344
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:07,346
Mother...

345
00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:09,684
What...

346
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:13,208
Always...

347
00:25:14,192 --> 00:25:16,978
stay well.

348
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:31,726
Mother...

349
00:25:42,246 --> 00:25:45,492
Mother...

350
00:25:49,804 --> 00:25:51,511
Are you going to leave Miss like that?

351
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:52,976
You said you're the Chief Shaman!

352
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:55,138
He said he'll tattoo "criminal" on her face!

353
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,951
I'll get in there and break down the door and...!

354
00:25:56,951 --> 00:25:59,016
Be quiet.

355
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,600
I'm gathering my thoughts right now.

356
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,500
Can everything be solved by thinking?

357
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,996
Our Miss! Thanks to someone...

358
00:26:05,996 --> 00:26:09,276
can't breathe in small dark places!

359
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:13,343
Instead, go to His Majesty and tell him the truth.

360
00:26:13,343 --> 00:26:15,496
That Shaman Wol, who he's trying to kill,

361
00:26:15,496 --> 00:26:17,370
is Heo Yeon Woo!

362
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,944
Shut up!

363
00:26:20,503 --> 00:26:24,664
Say it one more time and

364
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:27,431
I'll rip your mouth off.

365
00:26:29,235 --> 00:26:31,035
I'm thinking of a plan, so . . .

366
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:34,895
stop distracting me and stay outside right now!

00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,474
Orabeoni, it's Yeon Woo

369
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:03,643
It's already the time of night when we used to read together, isn't it?

370
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,602
Let's see. 
 What book were we going to read, again?

371
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:13,703
 Orabeoni, your face is filled with worry.

372
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,794
Mother.

373
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:39,590
You were well for so long

374
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,515
Why are you like this again?

375
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:44,444
Yeon Woo...

376
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,600
Our Yeon Woo...

377
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,115
Came to me.

378
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:55,006
Mother...

379
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,295
There was something...

380
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:04,796
She wanted to say...

381
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,506
For sure...

382
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:11,324
She had something...

383
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:20,862
to tell me...it looked like she did.

384
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:29,871
That kind thing worried that her mother 
would be sad, so...

385
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:33,938
Only tears came out....

386
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,031
And went...

387
00:28:39,198 --> 00:28:41,531
Poor thing...

388
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:45,571
Aigoo, my baby...

389
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,300
What is the matter?

390
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,200
Did you poke your finger on the needle again?

391
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,209
It feels ominous.

392
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:58,947
It's not your first time poking your finger on a needle, so what is so ominous about it?

393
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:02,228
If I say it is ominous, then it's ominous!

394
00:29:02,228 --> 00:29:03,504
Look at this.

395
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:06,739
There's blood on the breastpiece 
I am making for Husband.

396
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:09,307
That is why I said you should sleep now

397
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:13,474
and do it in the morning with a clearer mind.

398
00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:15,146
What is the matter?

399
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:16,780
I should ask Mother-in-law to teach me.

400
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,334
Princess, it is already late!

401
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:20,692
Princess.

402
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,305
Princess. 
 Princess.

403
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:26,026
Prince Consort.

404
00:29:26,026 --> 00:29:28,196
Husband.

405
00:29:28,196 --> 00:29:29,618
Mother-in-law!

406
00:29:33,576 --> 00:29:35,944
What happened, Husband?

407
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:39,559
I'm bringing her back from the Byuldang (annexed house).

408
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:45,711
She hasn't gone for awhile.

409
00:29:45,711 --> 00:29:48,430
Why did she go there again?

410
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,100
I'm sorry.  But, please take care of my mother.

411
00:29:53,331 --> 00:29:54,947
Mr. Park!

412
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:56,446
Bring the lock to the Byuldang.

413
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:58,162
Yes, Sir.

414
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:30,284
 Why did that child...

415
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,100
 Why did that dead child...

416
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:35,006
 Why did she come into my dream?

417
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,999
 I'm sorry, but...

418
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:04,888
 That woman you called out to in your dream,

419
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:08,500
 seems to be linked to your pain.

420
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,879
 So I wanted to console you and...

421
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:17,240
committed the unspeakable crime
 of touching the royal body.

422
00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:38,055
Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

423
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,233
Are you the kitchen maids?

424
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:48,592
Yes, we are.

425
00:31:48,592 --> 00:31:50,811
I saw that I had broth on my breakfast table this morning again.

426
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:52,375
Yes.

427
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,999
Then,

428
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:57,579
are you telling me to keep eating that broth until I die?

429
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:00,820
If you give me broth one more time, then

430
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,405
I will mete out a punishment.

431
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:12,243
Why did he become so cold again?

432
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:14,945
Now we can't give him broth again.

433
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:16,033
Right?

434
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:19,983
- He looks so much better with a smile. 
 - You're right.

435
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:22,796
"The broth was very delicious. I ate it well."

436
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:26,179
That's what he said. 
 With a smile like this!

437
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:30,175
If I could see him smile once again...

438
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:33,319
Queen.

439
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,939
Queen, we deserve death.

440
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:38,697
You wretches! Which department do you work for?!

441
00:32:38,697 --> 00:32:40,219
You shall be immediately...!

442
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,812
Stop, Court Lady Jo.

443
00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:44,723
Knowing that His Majesty looks better...

444
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:47,567
How can there be something greater than this?

445
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:49,620
I won't take it to heart.

446
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,164
So do not worry.

447
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:00,763
 What did you just say, Queen?

448
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:03,765
I am gravely sorry to say this

449
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:07,180
but words denigrating His Majesty and my relationship

450
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:09,199
are spread throughout the palace.

451
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,721
Denigrating?

452
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:13,603
When His Majesty's health worsens,

453
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:15,986
it is my fault.

454
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:18,538
When His Majesty's health improves,

455
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,193
it is because

456
00:33:20,193 --> 00:33:23,901
he secretly kept a woman pleasing to him.

457
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:27,782
What do you mean His Majesty is 
keeping a woman close to him?

458
00:33:27,782 --> 00:33:32,453
You know better than anyone else that he wouldn't.

459
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:34,650
Looking beyond the rumor . . .

460
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,418
If such denigration spreads beyond the palace walls,

461
00:33:37,418 --> 00:33:41,457
then, how will this country's people view His Majesty?

462
00:33:41,457 --> 00:33:43,006
I beg of you.

463
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:46,800
Please allow me to freely enter the King's quarters.

464
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,470
It is because I am not able to protect His Majesty 
by being at his side,

465
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,462
such rumors continue to form.

466
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:55,018
But,

467
00:33:55,018 --> 00:33:59,679
both the Office of Physiognomy 
and Seongsucheong . . .

468
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,667
They both said it's best for you two to stay apart
 until the day of consummation.

469
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:03,734
Then,

470
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:07,075
as the queen of this palace,

471
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:09,814
I am to continue witnessing such humiliation?

472
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,505
Please wait a little bit, Queen.

473
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:17,003
Once the consummation is successful, the rumors will die down too.

474
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:18,305
But,

475
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:21,185
we don't know when His Majesty's 
health will worsen again.

476
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:24,251
Please do not worry about that.

477
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:28,261
The truth is, Mother-in-law has brought in Chief Shaman Jang's spiritual daughter

478
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:31,834
as a bad luck absorbing shaman within the King's quarters.

479
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:34,363
Bad luck absorbing

480
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,877
shaman, is what you said?

481
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:37,499
That is right.

482
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:39,723
His Majesty becoming better and more peaceful

483
00:34:39,723 --> 00:34:42,214
is all because of her skills.

484
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:45,371
So, please have faith and wait a bit more.

485
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:09,014
Isn't it true the north is facing all sorts of harsh cold weather?

486
00:35:09,014 --> 00:35:12,699
The north is normally cold.

487
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:15,929
Then,

488
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:20,662
As I previously mentioned, Pi...Han...

489
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,598
 Pi Ahn Dol?

490
00:35:23,911 --> 00:35:27,053
wasn't planned?

491
00:35:27,053 --> 00:35:31,353
Since the north is normally cold, are you saying the people should fend for themselves
 and freeze to death?

492
00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:34,238
Quickly formulate a plan to get the residents out of the cold (Pihan).

493
00:35:34,238 --> 00:35:37,291
Yes, Your Majesty.

494
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:40,273
Wait, I missed something.

495
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:43,375
Pi...

496
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,067
 As suspected, is it Pi Ahn Dol?

497
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:48,281
Pi...

498
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:52,946
Please investigate the situation regarding the damage.

499
00:35:55,335 --> 00:35:57,690
Also as discussed in the last meeting,

500
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,269
regarding the bribed officials in the Ministry of Personnel,

501
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:04,173
I heard you didn't follow through with the order
 to gather what was received.

502
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,100
It wasn't a lot,

503
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,819
so is there a need to gather it all?

504
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:12,758
However, it is right to use the bribe for the people.

505
00:36:12,758 --> 00:36:15,984
It isn't for themselves, isn't it?

506
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:18,286
What do you think, Minister of Home Office?

507
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:20,647
Though you are right,

508
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:22,081
there isn't much.

509
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:26,129
For the people who can't even aspire to 
a bowl of bamboo congee (pijook), 
it's from their blood (pi) and sweat.

510
00:36:26,129 --> 00:36:28,363
So there's no reason to not gather it.

511
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:30,886
Immediately gather

512
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:33,933
the goods (piryuk) that he received as bribes.

513
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:37,090
Let's end the meeting.

514
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,340
Wait.

515
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,733
Minister of Finance

516
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:42,778
I am curious about something.

517
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:45,810
Please ask.

518
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:49,507
Is the building construction going smoothly?

519
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,874
If you are so worried,

520
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:58,278
then you should go to the construction site

521
00:36:58,278 --> 00:37:01,774
and look around.

522
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:06,290
That is a good idea.

523
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,327
However,

524
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,569
for some reason,

525
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:13,975
I feel that

526
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:16,783
it's too late.

527
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:29,789
What in the world! He's onto everything.

528
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,161
Pi! Pi! Pi! He keeps repeating it.

529
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:36,211
He's completely playing around with us.

530
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:40,546
It looks like he knows something for sure.

531
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:44,072
But he's not making a move.

532
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:48,421
It's as if he's trying to suck us dry.

533
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:51,113
He knows that it's too late

534
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:53,062
to delve further into the construction project.

535
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,355
Then,

536
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,581
are you saying he's given up?

537
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:58,782
Not giving up,

538
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:01,362
but rather looking for a chance.

539
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,359
Chance? 
 What kind of chance?

540
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:08,063
Stop acting dramatic, as if you know something!

541
00:38:08,063 --> 00:38:10,249
Can't you just say it all at once?!

542
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,859
A chance? 
 What kind of chance are you talking about?

543
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:15,403
He's probably trying to sweep away

544
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:19,193
his (father's) maternal relatives' power.

545
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:33,941
The Queen wishes to see you.

546
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:36,527
What did you just say?

547
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,443
Shaman Jang

548
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:40,591
has returned to Seongsucheong?

549
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:42,264
Yes.

550
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:46,575
They brought her spiritual daughter in as a bad luck absorbing shaman within the King's quarters.

551
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:50,295
I'm sure the order was issued by Queen Dowager.

552
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,353
So, for me,

553
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:54,971
can you make a request to Queen Dowager?

554
00:38:55,425 --> 00:38:56,777
A request?

555
00:38:56,777 --> 00:38:58,831
Even though she is just a shaman,

556
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:01,202
isn't she still a woman?

557
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:04,107
It is something that can't be left alone.

558
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,720
Then,

559
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,398
So, you want me to get rid of someone who was brought here by command?

560
00:39:10,401 --> 00:39:14,163
Are you talking about that kind of request?

561
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:16,694
But

562
00:39:16,694 --> 00:39:20,525
For many days, I've had troubling dreams

563
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,538
and the King's sudden change in health is troubling too.

564
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:25,407
I feel uneasy.

565
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:28,459
As the mother of the nation,

566
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:32,503
how can you be jealous of a lowly shaman?

567
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,217
Even though the King is estranged from you,

568
00:39:35,217 --> 00:39:38,853
How can he love a shaman?

569
00:39:44,393 --> 00:39:47,762
 So Shaman Jang has returned.

570
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:49,882
 And...

571
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:02,299
What brings you all the way here?

572
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,830
When you needed my help,

573
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,749
you would visit practically every day. But,

574
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:10,234
it becomes harder to see you now.

575
00:40:10,234 --> 00:40:13,003
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

576
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:15,424
The Minister of Home Office's position...

577
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:18,529
It is not an easy job.

578
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,483
I know it very well.

579
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:26,668
It is not an easy position to obtain after all.

580
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:29,505
Who do you think helped you get that position;

581
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:32,100
 that you're acting almighty in front of me?

582
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,106
The lion who has lost its teeth;

583
00:40:34,106 --> 00:40:37,879
 still thinks it's the ruler of the woods.

584
00:40:39,048 --> 00:40:42,253
How is it a busy man, such as yourself,

585
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,687
is visiting an old woman like me?

586
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:48,090
I heard you brought Shaman Jang back

587
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,693
to Seongsucheong.

588
00:40:50,693 --> 00:40:51,660
So what?

589
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,877
Do we not

590
00:40:53,877 --> 00:40:55,723
already have Shaman Kwon at Seongsucheong?

591
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:58,057
She's only temporary.

592
00:40:58,057 --> 00:40:59,401
And her skills

593
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:02,104
can't even compare to Shaman Jang

594
00:41:02,104 --> 00:41:03,572
But,

595
00:41:03,572 --> 00:41:05,773
Shaman Jang

596
00:41:05,908 --> 00:41:10,112
was too involved in the incident that occurred 8 years ago

597
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:13,238
What if she accidentally says something?

598
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,917
Shaman Kwon too

599
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,100
was deeply involved in the Prince Ui Seong's incident.

600
00:41:20,131 --> 00:41:22,424
If we're comparing the level of danger,

601
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:24,059
then it is the same for both of them.

602
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:25,994
But,

603
00:41:25,994 --> 00:41:28,030
that happened a long time ago.

604
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,865
Is 8 years a short time?

605
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:37,439
I need Shaman Jang's knowledge and skills.

606
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,300
There's no one as capable as she.

607
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,579
How can I throw that kind of thing away?

608
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,880
Kwon . .  .

609
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:49,351
is strongly knowledgeable about 
military force and politics,

610
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:51,787
so it's easier to control her.

611
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:53,622
Shaman Jang

612
00:41:53,622 --> 00:41:56,125
is just too unpredictable,

613
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,760
which makes it harder to control her.

614
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,196
She's dangerous.

615
00:42:00,196 --> 00:42:04,132
The more the dangerous, the more you have to keep them by your side.

616
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:05,534
Your Majesty.

617
00:42:05,534 --> 00:42:09,004
Exactly, what are you afraid of?

618
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:11,907
It's all in the past.

619
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,076
Most of all,

620
00:42:14,777 --> 00:42:16,712
A dead man

621
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:20,114
tells no tales.

622
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:31,060
Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

623
00:42:46,612 --> 00:42:49,323
Take her out.

624
00:42:49,323 --> 00:42:50,898
Yes sir.

625
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:09,918
Shaman Wol,

626
00:43:09,918 --> 00:43:12,988
was ordered to enter His Majesty's room as an amulet shaman

627
00:43:12,988 --> 00:43:17,098
but she neglected her duties and 
committed a disloyal crime.

628
00:43:17,098 --> 00:43:20,020
Therefore we will show how the national and spiritual laws

629
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,362
are extremely applied.

630
00:43:22,362 --> 00:43:25,027
Everyone pay attention

631
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:27,783
and witness this scene.

632
00:43:27,783 --> 00:43:30,359
Begin.

633
00:43:52,554 --> 00:43:56,096
So she really is a shaman registered under Seongsucheong?

634
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:57,247
That is correct.

635
00:43:57,247 --> 00:43:58,734
What about Minister of Home Office?

636
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:03,851
It looked like he didn't even know about the bad luck absorbing shaman's very existence.

637
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:06,415
Please take back . . .

638
00:44:06,415 --> 00:44:07,815
the command.

639
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:10,248
The girl is not a spy.

640
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:14,640
If you are going to punish, then you should punish me too for letting a woman inside.

641
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,647
Are you taking the woman's side?

642
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:20,655
It's not like you.

643
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,923
I know.

644
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:29,199
It is not the girl who is dangerous,

645
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,320
it is I.

646
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:38,934
 What can I do, Ari?

647
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:43,128
If I reveal the truth, she may live, but will die soon.

648
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:47,490
But if I don't, her life will not be worth living.

649
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,906
 What should I do?

650
00:44:49,906 --> 00:44:52,916
 Please tell me, Ari.

651
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,638
Stop!

652
00:44:57,442 --> 00:44:59,123
Stop!

653
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:02,280
It is a command!

654
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:08,766
Shaman Wol is to return to the King's quarters

655
00:45:08,766 --> 00:45:11,662
and complete her duties.

656
00:45:11,662 --> 00:45:14,189
It is a royal command.

657
00:45:15,206 --> 00:45:18,211
Miss! Unni!

658
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,608
Are you okay?

659
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:42,778
Did you say that I'm being foolish?

660
00:45:42,778 --> 00:45:45,908
And that I need to be free of her?

661
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:53,032
I've already become foolish.

662
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,744
But,

663
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,903
I can't let go of her.

664
00:46:49,236 --> 00:46:51,208
Spritual Mother.

665
00:46:52,536 --> 00:46:54,408
Can I . . .

666
00:46:55,907 --> 00:46:58,099
go outside for a moment?

667
00:47:04,433 --> 00:47:07,862
Where are you going in that state?

668
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:09,875
Just for a moment.

669
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:12,622
Only a moment.

670
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:16,622
I have something I must do.

671
00:47:16,622 --> 00:47:19,183
Are you out of your mind?

672
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:20,703
After everything that's happened?

673
00:47:20,703 --> 00:47:22,278
I know.

674
00:47:23,284 --> 00:47:27,078
I know that a shaman that serves the king must not wander around and

675
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:29,244
that I am a Shaman.

676
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:30,951
And as a lowly shaman,

677
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:34,416
I dare not overstep my boundaries.

678
00:47:35,758 --> 00:47:38,570
I know it very well now.

679
00:47:40,244 --> 00:47:46,930
However, even if I can't do anything about the mistreatment and humiliation I faced as a shaman,

680
00:47:47,704 --> 00:47:50,175
but as a shaman

681
00:47:50,207 --> 00:47:53,740
I want the misunderstandings and prejudice

682
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,619
to be at least clarified.

683
00:47:57,588 --> 00:47:59,903
Please give me permission.

684
00:48:01,784 --> 00:48:03,864
It is my first and . . .

685
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,831
last request.

686
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:21,496
I brought you out to the market,

687
00:48:21,496 --> 00:48:23,224
but you don't even want a dress ornament

688
00:48:23,224 --> 00:48:24,947
or dress fabrics.

689
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:29,060
Mother, do you really have nothing you want?

690
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,788
no I have none.

691
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,890
So don't worry about me.

692
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:39,078
If you need anything, please ask me, Princess.

693
00:48:39,078 --> 00:48:41,907
If you don't have anything, then I don't either.

694
00:48:42,538 --> 00:48:44,666
I have one!

695
00:48:44,728 --> 00:48:46,734
I noticed that my husband

696
00:48:46,734 --> 00:48:48,237
is running out of paper.

697
00:48:48,237 --> 00:48:52,147
Since we're out, we should buy him the best one.

698
00:48:52,147 --> 00:48:54,087
Princess

699
00:48:54,087 --> 00:48:57,579
Thinking of your husband first

700
00:48:57,579 --> 00:49:00,088
As his mother, I could not be more grateful.

701
00:49:00,088 --> 00:49:01,417
Mother-in-law,

702
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:03,368
Did you just smile?

703
00:49:03,368 --> 00:49:06,280
You're going to stop being sad, right?

704
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,856
Yes.

705
00:49:07,856 --> 00:49:11,894
Seeing you try so hard to cheer me up,

706
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:14,062
how can I not?

707
00:49:14,163 --> 00:49:17,398
If you smile, it says luck will come into your home.

708
00:49:17,398 --> 00:49:19,574
So, you must smile a lot.

709
00:49:19,574 --> 00:49:21,986
Yes, I will.

710
00:49:21,986 --> 00:49:25,474
Let us visit the drygoods store for a second and then go to the paper shop.

711
00:49:25,474 --> 00:49:27,312
Yes, Mother-in-law.

712
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,059
Seeing as you're putting a lot of care in picking one,

713
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:45,930
it looks like you're going to write a love letter.

714
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:48,212
It's not a love letter.

715
00:49:48,244 --> 00:49:51,188
But a letter of self-reflection.

716
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:59,386
It's not a letter, but a self-reflection (to apologize).

717
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:09,234
 Will you wait for me?

718
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:12,430
 Will you wait for me?

719
00:50:14,991 --> 00:50:19,026
But you haven't finished selecting one?

720
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:21,830
I will come back soon.

721
00:50:44,686 --> 00:50:47,068
Too many days have passed . . .

722
00:50:47,068 --> 00:50:50,591
Of course he wouldn't be here.

723
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,300
Actually,

724
00:50:55,316 --> 00:50:58,499
I didn't even say thank you.

725
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,608
Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

726
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,116
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

727
00:51:34,116 --> 00:51:36,265
I had to take care of something,
 so I had come to the market place, and

728
00:51:36,265 --> 00:51:39,368
I thought, per chance, and so I stopped by
 at the fabric store...

729
00:51:39,368 --> 00:51:42,762
I didn't know you'd really be there.

730
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:45,276
To be able to greet you now is

731
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:47,940
such a relief to me.

732
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,772
For that previous time that you helped me,

733
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:54,306
I'm really grateful.

734
00:51:54,306 --> 00:51:57,410
I'm sorry

735
00:51:57,485 --> 00:51:59,714
that I couldn't keep my promise.

736
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:03,326
You're welcome.

737
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:05,890
Anyway, I couldn't even save you.

738
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,709
Does it hurt a lot?

739
00:52:09,389 --> 00:52:11,488
I grew up in a tough environment, so

740
00:52:11,488 --> 00:52:12,866
this is nothing.

741
00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:14,568
But,

742
00:52:14,568 --> 00:52:16,990
why are you not in the monk's outfit today?

743
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:18,494
What?

744
00:52:21,144 --> 00:52:22,872
It looks like you misunderstood.

745
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:24,066
I'm not a monk.

746
00:52:24,066 --> 00:52:27,082
There was a situation, so I disguised myself.

747
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:30,460
You're really not a monk?

748
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,746
Of course.

749
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:33,289
I have a very mellow body

750
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:36,905
and, under all of heaven, I am a free spirit.

751
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:38,944
And of course,

752
00:52:38,944 --> 00:52:41,777
I can get married too.

753
00:52:49,645 --> 00:52:51,666
The scratch  on your face . . .

754
00:52:52,147 --> 00:52:54,525
What happened?

755
00:52:57,282 --> 00:52:59,688
It seems like you faced a lot of hardships.

756
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,322
If you want to run away,

757
00:53:03,322 --> 00:53:05,341
tell me.

758
00:53:06,242 --> 00:53:08,686
I'll help you.

759
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,145
Thanks for saying that, but,

760
00:53:11,145 --> 00:53:13,932
I'm staying in a safe place now.

761
00:53:13,932 --> 00:53:15,778
So, you don't have to worry.

762
00:53:15,778 --> 00:53:18,807
 If you want to escape this dangerous situation . . .

763
00:53:18,807 --> 00:53:20,914
 If you really do,

764
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:23,501
 then the status of being royal

765
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:27,682
 and the noble priviledge of being Prince Yang Myung,
I can throw it all away

766
00:53:27,682 --> 00:53:31,444
 and run away with you.

767
00:53:31,465 --> 00:53:33,174
By any chance,

768
00:53:34,338 --> 00:53:36,902
are you related to the king?

769
00:53:38,754 --> 00:53:40,172
How did...

770
00:53:42,957 --> 00:53:44,950
How did you know?

771
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,090
It's my spiritual powers.

772
00:53:47,522 --> 00:53:49,224
Spiritual powers?

773
00:53:49,984 --> 00:53:51,464
Yes.

774
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:53,982
A few seconds ago,

775
00:53:53,982 --> 00:53:56,989
I saw your past.

776
00:53:59,597 --> 00:54:02,110
It's just your spiritual powers?

777
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:09,491
It's nothing much, in return for your kindness, but...

778
00:54:09,491 --> 00:54:11,693
Speaking as a shaman,

779
00:54:11,693 --> 00:54:14,348
can I say something?

780
00:54:14,348 --> 00:54:16,445
Say it.

781
00:54:17,289 --> 00:54:19,362
Now...

782
00:54:21,022 --> 00:54:23,621
That girl you have in your heart . . .

783
00:54:23,621 --> 00:54:25,740
You must let her go.

784
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:31,866
For someone new, you must open up that space in your heart.

785
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:35,350
Do not

786
00:54:35,784 --> 00:54:40,946
hide what you're really trying to say behind laughter.

787
00:54:42,142 --> 00:54:44,841
Deceiving your true feelings

788
00:54:44,841 --> 00:54:47,829
and living a fake life.

789
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:53,401
Is that not a heartbreaking situation?

790
00:55:02,345 --> 00:55:04,104
Your name.

791
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,304
What's your name.

792
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:12,208
I'm sorry, but I don't...

793
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:15,857
 I'll name you Wol.

794
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:18,727
Wol.

795
00:55:19,548 --> 00:55:21,663
They call me Wol.

796
00:55:22,626 --> 00:55:23,986
Wol.

797
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,698
I have to go now.

798
00:55:30,698 --> 00:55:33,509
I'm very grateful for that day.

799
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:37,077
For you to surely meet someone new,

800
00:55:37,077 --> 00:55:39,098
I'll pray for it.

801
00:55:39,098 --> 00:55:41,225
Then.

802
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,600
W-wait!

803
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,297
Mother-in-law, are you alright?

804
00:55:55,297 --> 00:55:58,132
I'm sorry, I was in a hurry.

805
00:55:58,132 --> 00:56:01,002
I'm okay, so please go.

806
00:56:01,002 --> 00:56:02,938
Thank You.

807
00:56:05,912 --> 00:56:08,714
How can a woman be so clumsy?

808
00:56:08,714 --> 00:56:11,256
Isn't that right, Mother-in-law?

809
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:15,357
Prince Yang Myung!   Orabeoni!

810
00:56:15,357 --> 00:56:17,176
Why are you two here?

811
00:56:17,176 --> 00:56:19,082
How's your health?

812
00:56:19,082 --> 00:56:23,693
Since you suddenly disappeared, 
do you know how much we worried?

813
00:56:23,726 --> 00:56:26,370
Mother, I'm a bit busy, I have to go.

814
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,934
I'll visit you later.

815
00:56:31,149 --> 00:56:34,514
Have you gotten yourself a girlfriend, O-lder bro-ther?

816
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:38,888
I did get a girlfriend. Satisfied?

817
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:43,860
She went over that way, so hurry up 
and catch up to her.

818
00:56:47,092 --> 00:56:50,033
I think he's serious, Mother-in-law.

819
00:56:51,693 --> 00:56:53,689
To know who she is

820
00:56:53,689 --> 00:56:57,329
I should've seen how she looked.

821
00:56:58,228 --> 00:57:01,829
Would she be the age of our Yeon Woo?

822
00:58:47,952 --> 00:58:50,473
 Please do not worry about it.

823
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:52,184
 The truth is

824
00:58:52,184 --> 00:58:55,860
 Mother-in-law brought Chief Shaman Jang's spiritual daughter into the King's quarters,

825
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:59,814
 as a bad luck absorbing shaman.

826
00:59:03,141 --> 00:59:05,566
Your Majesty, why are you like this again?

827
00:59:05,566 --> 00:59:07,146
Move aside!

828
00:59:07,146 --> 00:59:10,250
If you block my way again,

829
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:13,864
I will bite my own tongue and die!

830
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:27,422
Are you surprised?

831
00:59:27,422 --> 00:59:30,545
I've decided to no longer drink the tea that the doctors give me.

832
00:59:31,245 --> 00:59:34,713
I will do it like that from now on.

833
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:36,873
So, you,

834
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:41,280
will bear the responsiblities of your words.

835
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,569
At least while I sleep, did you not tell me to forget the tiredness of reigning?

836
00:59:46,569 --> 00:59:48,230
Yes, that is correct.

837
00:59:48,824 --> 00:59:51,500
Did you tell me

838
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,702
to let go of the pain in my heart?

839
00:59:54,754 --> 00:59:56,938
Yes, that is correct.

840
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:03,144
I am extremely tired right now.

841
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:07,248
And pain that I don't want in my heart

842
01:00:09,518 --> 01:00:11,966
has settled in.

843
01:00:11,966 --> 01:00:16,891
So you must help me forget my tiredness.

844
01:00:16,891 --> 01:00:21,095
The pain that tries to settle in my heart...

845
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:23,877
You need to put it to rest.

846
01:00:23,877 --> 01:00:26,253
Can you do it?

847
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:31,406
Answer me. 
 Can you do it?

848
01:00:31,406 --> 01:00:33,842
Please let me.

849
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,900
If you allow,

850
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,500
then the bad luck and energy that tries to harm you, Your Majesty,

851
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,846
This servant will block them.

852
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:45,585
This servant will soothe

853
01:00:45,585 --> 01:00:48,948
the weariness and pain that torments you.

854
01:00:48,948 --> 01:00:51,026
This servant,

855
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,932
may be lacking,

856
01:00:52,932 --> 01:00:58,499
but I am a bad luck absorbing shaman with the duty to protect your well-being.

857
01:00:58,499 --> 01:01:01,636
From the beginning, I had been given a month's time.

858
01:01:01,636 --> 01:01:04,906
So within the time that I've been given,

859
01:01:04,906 --> 01:01:07,961
I will do all that I can.

860
01:01:25,694 --> 01:01:30,132
Your Majesty, I will tell the King you are here,

861
01:01:30,132 --> 01:01:31,984
So, please wait.

862
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:33,250
Open the door.

863
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:37,785
I cannot do it.

864
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,137
Lift...

865
01:01:41,277 --> 01:01:43,111
Your head.

866
01:01:45,514 --> 01:01:47,449
Lift it.

867
01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:50,018
It is a command.
