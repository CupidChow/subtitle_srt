1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm in extreme agony right now.

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,900
Furthermore, the agonizing pain
in my heart that I didn't wish for,

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
is impossible to get rid of.

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,210
So I need you to remove this pain.

5
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,210
This pain which has been filling my heart,

6
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,520
I need you to calm it down.

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,020
Are you able to do that?

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,620
Answer me. Can you do it?

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,120
Your Majesty, please allow me.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,230
If Your Majesty consents,

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,330
I'm willing to protect Your Majesty
from bad luck and disaster.

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,730
I'm willing to block it for you.

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,040
Lift up your head.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,740
Lift your head up. This is an order!

15
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,410
I'm just worried about
His Majesty's royal body.

16
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,410
This matter, you don't need
to report it to His Majesty.

17
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,530
<i>Is there anybody outside?</i>

18
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,630
Yes, Your Majesty!

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,840
At your command, Your Majesty.

20
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,540
Call the royal physician.

21
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,150
Your Majesty, are you feeling unwell?

22
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,950
It isn't me, it's her.

23
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,550
You mustn't, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,260
What do you mean?

25
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,860
The royal physician is only
for treating the royal family,

26
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,660
How can he treat a shaman?

27
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,670
Isn't she a living talisman that blocks
bad luck and disaster on my behalf.

28
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,370
If her body is unwell, it will affect me too.

29
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,770
This isn't for her, but for me.

30
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,370
Get him here quickly.

31
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,670
But, Your Majesty.

32
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,380
A command.
It's a command!

33
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,700
Why did you come out?

34
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,100
His Majesty has ordered everyone
to leave his chamber.

35
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,510
What is that?

36
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,310
While searching the shaman
we found this.

37
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,010
It seems like a letter.

38
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,020
It seems that the shaman has written
a love letter for His Majesty.

39
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,820
Take a look.

40
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,750
Your Majesty.

41
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,150
<i>His Majesty's expression was
like a man looking at a woman.</i>

42
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,530
<i>This pain which has been filling my heart,</i>

43
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,130
<i>I need you to calm it down.</i>

44
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,840
<i>I'm willing to protect Your Majesty
from bad luck and disaster.
</i>

45
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,040
<i>I'm willing to block it for you.</i>

46
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,590
What is this?

47
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,200
This was discovered while
searching the shaman.

48
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,800
Apparently, it was meant to
be given to Your Majesty.

49
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,200
If Your Majesty doesn't want to
look at it, I will take it away.

50
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,410
Put it down.

51
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,120
<i>Weeds are good for nothing.</i>

52
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,630
<i>Though weeds are not beautiful,
they still have their uses.</i>

53
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,130
<i>Shamans which aren't seen as human beings,
are still there for the people.</i>

54
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:31,330
<i>Although shamans aren't seen as human beings,
we are still Your Majesty's people.</i>

55
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,640
<i>Since you are not a human,
how dare you touch my body?</i>

56
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,940
Shamans are commoners and people too.
Please do not ignore me.

57
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,050
A short but powerful blow.

58
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,260
It's very rare that a shaman
is able to read.

59
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,460
It's amazing that a shaman is able
to write such beautiful words.

60
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,470
<i>Have a look at this letter, Hyeong Seon.</i>

61
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,180
<i>How can one believe that this is
a 13 year old girls literary talent?</i>

62
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,290
<i>And I was thinking how
smart she is, but she's really foolish.</i>

63
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,790
- How.
- <i>How.</i>

64
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,700
<i>- How can I forget you?
- How can I forget you?</i>

65
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,600
Your Majesty.

66
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,500
Why are you calling me?

67
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,510
That girl... is only a female shaman.

68
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,710
Who says she isn't?

69
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,220
I have served Your Majesty
for many years.

70
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,520
So, how would I not be able
to read your thoughts?

71
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,620
Your Majesty's sacred heart
must not waver.

72
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,830
So you're saying that I will
be moved by a Shaman?

73
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:13,340
She... is not Miss Yeon U.

74
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,540
No matter how similar they are,

75
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,740
Miss Yeon U is already...

76
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,640
Don't say that. Don't say it. Don't say that!

77
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,340
Your Majesty!

78
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,850
I don't want to see you, so turn the other way!

79
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,860
Last night, the Queen came to the
palace hall but left soon after.

80
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,760
The Queen put aside her
self-respect as a woman,

81
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,760
took a step forward with much difficulty,
but turned and left.

82
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,370
How would the Queen feel inside her heart?

83
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:50,470
So please, Your Majesty, I ask you to
empathise with the Queen's feelings.

84
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,580
Your Highness!  Your Highness, my Queen.

85
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,190
Why are you shouting?

86
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:09,990
His Majesty wishes to come
over to your chambers.

87
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,700
Bring my clothes and jewelry
here immediately. Quickly.

88
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,300
Yes!

89
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,540
Did you say that His Majesty has gone
over to The Queen's chamber?

90
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,450
Yes, Mother.

91
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,250
I just came back from there.

92
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:13,060
Until now the Queen has been
continually heavy-hearted,

93
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,160
but I think her sincerity must have
opened His Majesty's heart.

94
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,060
It's really surprising.

95
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,360
What?

96
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,170
Ever since the female shaman entered the palace,

97
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,170
all matters have become smooth-sailing.

98
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,780
But how can you say that it's
because of the shaman?

99
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,580
It's because your efforts in
caring for His Majesty's health,

100
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,780
have moved Heaven.

101
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,490
Only because she has been at his side has
the royal body been able to recover day by day.

102
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,390
Relationships within the palace are
unexpectedly running smoothly.

103
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,190
She is worthy of being
Shaman Jang's spiritual daughter.

104
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,300
It looks like we'll need the Physiognomy Office to
select another auspicious date for the consummation.

105
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,400
What? Hasn't a date already been set?

106
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,710
Due to His Majesty's disinterest,

107
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,810
every time we selected a suitable
date it was a wasted effort.

108
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,510
Now that His Majesty's royal body is healthy,

109
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,920
the relationship between the two
seems to have become more relaxed.

110
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,420
How can we let slip this
golden opportunity?

111
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,620
However, after reading the
universe's movement,

112
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,330
there won't be many dates
that are suitable.

113
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,930
The Heavens are helping us.

114
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,630
How can we wait for a whole month?

115
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,430
We have to use all possible
methods to make this work.

116
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,550
You don't look well.

117
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,550
Is there something troubling you?

118
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,860
For me, other than thinking
of Your Majesty's well-being,

119
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,760
what else is there for me
to worry about?

120
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,070
It's only that I couldn't sleep last night.

121
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,870
I heard you... came to my chamber last night.

122
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,680
Your Majesty, please forgive me.
I acknowledge my mistake.

123
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,080
I was worried about your health.

124
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,880
What were you trying to monitor?

125
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,490
What? How could Your Majesty say monitor?

126
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,290
Regardless of what you saw,
or what you heard,

127
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,300
there wasn't anyone in my chamber.

128
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,300
If you did see someone,

129
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,510
it was only a talisman sent by
the Office of Physiognomy.

130
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,320
Is it in a month's time?

131
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,020
What are you referring to?

132
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,320
The day of our consummation.

133
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,530
The physicians and the Office of Physiognomy
have warned us repeatedly.

134
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:12,630
Until that day, we must keep our
distance and meditate to purify our minds.

135
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,140
<i>Thus, don't come again to my chambers.</i>

136
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,740
<i>Is that what you mean?</i>

137
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,750
Looks like you finally understand.

138
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,670
<i>What are you trying to hide?</i>

139
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,870
<i>What's the reason for warning
me not to come?</i>

140
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:57,680
<i>Your Majesty, what is it exactly
that you want to hide from me?</i>

141
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,290
<i>Are you in love with someone?</i>

142
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,290
<i>Not only is a dead person
constantly in your mind,
</i>

143
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,500
<i>now you're trying to keep a lowly
shaman close to your heart.</i>

144
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,610
Court Lady Jo.

145
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,710
Yes, Your Highness.

146
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,220
Take a look and see if there's one of the king's
palace maids that we can secretly use.

147
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,720
What?

148
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,920
Why do you want a secret palace maid?

149
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,920
When you find someone to use,

150
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,730
tell her to secretly monitor the shaman
who spends each night with His Majesty.

151
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,630
I want her every movement
secretly reported to me.

152
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,530
Your Highness.

153
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,740
Female shaman?

154
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,540
Carefully look at my face.

155
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,450
Can't you remember the woman
that was here with me last time?

156
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,550
Ah! I remember.

157
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,960
She was so elegant and demure I thought
she was the daughter of a professor.

158
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,360
She was a shaman?

159
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,460
Has she not come here since?

160
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,970
From what I remember
she never came back again.

161
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,070
I understand.

162
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,900
<i>Just wait a little longer.</i>

163
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
<i>I'll take you to a physician.</i>

164
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,400
<i>And I'm not an ajussi, girl!
(Ajussi - older man, uncle)</i>

165
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,210
<i>Because of her despicable crime, she's already
been expelled far away to the border.</i>

166
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,920
<i>Thank you for your good intentions.
At the moment I'm residing at a safe place.</i>

167
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,220
<i>The shaman records don't have such a name,
and she committed a crime of promiscuity,</i>

168
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,830
<i>which is why we wanted to arrest her.</i>

169
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,030
<i>I am Wol.</i>

170
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,430
<i>One of them is definitely lying to me.</i>

171
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,940
<i>Who is she? Why is there a
need to lie to me?</i>

172
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,340
Orabeoni!
(Orabeoni - older brother)

173
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,550
Me...? Orabeoni...?

174
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,650
You're alive.

175
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,550
Wait! Wait.

176
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,960
Looking at you, you don't seem like a gisaeng to me.
(Gisaeng - female Korean entertainer)

177
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,960
How can I be a gisaeng? One look and
you can tell that I'm a Celestial Hall shaman.

178
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,470
A Celestial Hall shaman?

179
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,870
The magic stone, don't you remember?

180
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,480
You're that kid who could see
through someone with your eyes shut.

181
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,190
You've become a grown up young lady.

182
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,190
I almost didn't recognize you.

183
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,590
Have you been doing well?

184
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,890
Thanks to my spiritual mother
who offered me shelter.

185
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,200
I'm not a fake shaman anymore.
I'm a real shaman.

186
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,500
That's a relief.

187
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,210
Just now, you said you're a shaman?

188
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,610
Yes, I am from the Celestial Hall.

189
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,110
<i>The safest place for a female
shaman in the capital city.</i>

190
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:56,820
<i>A place where a female shaman is
safe to come and go freely in the capital.</i>

191
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,920
Among the Celestial Hall's shamans,

192
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,420
is there a shaman named Wol?

193
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,030
Wol...

194
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,530
<i>I told you to watch your tongue.</i>

195
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,230
<i>Do you want me to sew your
mouth shut so you can only hear?</i>

196
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,040
Turn a blind eye and a deaf ear.

197
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,540
<i>How many times have I told you?</i>

198
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,540
<i>Did I say something wrong again?</i>

199
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,950
<i>Things like Sun and Moon,</i>

200
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,050
<i>just dare try and say another word.</i>

201
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,350
<i>Regarding agassi's matters,
if you dare try and say anything again,
(Agassi - young lady)</i>

202
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:34,460
<i>see if I don't tear you
limb from limb!</i>

203
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,260
I don't know.

204
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,170
This is the first time I've
heard the name Wol.

205
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,270
Don't be like this, try to remember.

206
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,870
I said I don't know.

207
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,070
There isn't someone called that
in the Celestial Hall.

208
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,480
Hey, Jan Sil!

209
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Yes, coming right away.

210
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,790
Hurry up and come. How long
are you going to fool around?

211
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,290
Orabeoni, if it's fated we'll meet again.

212
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,690
W... Wait!

213
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,800
<i>If she's not in the Celestial Hall,
then where could she be?</i>

214
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,140
You left all excited because
you were going to the market.

215
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,540
Why is your expression like that now?

216
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:13,660
<i>Sorry, orabeonni.
I'm really... really sorry.</i>

217
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,190
Agassi!... Agassi!

218
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,110
Agassi, what's wrong with you?

219
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,810
Did you have that dream again?

220
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,620
It's been a while since you last
had it. Why did it start again?

221
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,820
I know.

222
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,930
This time too, you weren't
able to see his face?

223
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,430
This time I really wanted to see it.

224
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,840
This time I should have
been able to see it.

225
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,340
<i>Agassi,</i>

226
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,950
<i>do you really want to see his face?</i>

227
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:49,950
<i>Every night, aren't you by his side?</i>

228
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,200
You used a letter to me to strike back.

229
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,010
I fully experienced the depth of
your resentment towards me.

230
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,810
I don't resent you.

231
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,610
Though you say you don't resent me,

232
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:54,620
your written words were
clearly rebuking me.

233
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,020
Did I misread it?

234
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,520
Words of advice out of loyalty, and
grudges with personal emotions

235
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,630
are two different things.

236
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,630
So you weren't complaining,
but you were still rebuking me?

237
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,530
I only wanted to say,

238
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,640
that just like a pebble by the side of
the road has a reason for its existence,

239
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,440
a shaman like me,
one of Your Majesty's people,

240
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,150
also wishes to do what
she can for Your Majesty.

241
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,050
You are clearly rebuking me.

242
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,750
You're saying that as this country's king I'm unable
to fully understand the thoughts of the common people.

243
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,660
Are you trying to make me
understand my own incompetence?

244
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,960
It has nothing to do with
the writer's intentions.

245
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,260
If the reader is filled with
prejudice and preconceptions,

246
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,060
then misunderstandings are
bound to arise.

247
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,370
If Your Majesty misunderstood
my intentions,

248
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,170
that would naturally be the reason.

249
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,570
So what you're saying is
that I'm filled with prejudice

250
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,480
and that I have misunderstood
the true meaning of this letter,

251
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,580
and also make political mistakes.

252
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,780
That wasn't what I meant.

253
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,090
Though I have shown much affection to
you lately, you're now crossing the line.

254
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,290
Have you forgotten to whom
you're speaking?

255
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,990
I'm the Joseon's...

256
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,000
<i>I'm the Joseon's...</i>

257
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,510
Is anyone out there?

258
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,320
Yes, Your Majesty,
please give your order.

259
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,920
I feel suffocated in here.

260
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,020
I'm going to take a walk,
make preparations immediately.

261
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,420
The night wind is cold,
why not leave it until tomorrow...

262
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,230
I feel troubled, didn't you hear?

263
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,830
Hurry and get ready to go out.

264
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,540
What are you doing?

265
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,040
What?

266
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,640
Didn't you say that you would
block bad luck for me?

267
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,350
Why aren't you fulfilling
your duty now?

268
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:09,850
You're my talisman, so follow me.

269
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,980
All of you step back a little further.

270
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,690
I said you should all step back.

271
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,090
Un, you should also step back.

272
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,810
You remain here,
since you're my talisman.

273
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,310
Step back a little more.

274
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,660
<i>Let go!</i>

275
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,060
<i>Yeon U! Yeon U!</i>

276
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,670
Is it here,

277
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:12,570
hidden deep inside Your Majesty's
painful memories.

278
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:24,990
That person who was crying here in the past,
was it you, Your Majesty?

279
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:37,800
What exactly did you see?

280
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,020
Were you using your shaman's
abilities to see?

281
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,520
That's right.

282
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,120
Then try to use your shaman's
ability to make a guess.

283
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,530
To guess what?

284
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:15,640
What do you think I'm
going to do next?

285
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,650
Today Hyeong Seong said
something strange to me.

286
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,550
What do you think?

287
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:43,770
Do you think I will pay attention to
a mere shaman like you?

288
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,170
Why are you like this...?

289
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,080
What are you doing?
Quickly catch up.

290
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:38,320
You. Who are you exactly?

291
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,120
I am Shaman Wol.

292
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,730
No, you aren't Wol.

293
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,330
Then who else could I be?

294
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:54,140
I have always lived my life as
a shaman without a name.

295
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,740
It was Your Majesty who
gave me the name, Wol.

296
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:15,060
Are you really...
not able to recognize me?

297
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:22,360
Have you...
really never seen me before?

298
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:29,370
Your Majesty, are you looking for
traces of that person in me now?

299
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:36,380
Facing me now, whom do you see?

300
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:46,990
Is it that girl called Yeon U?

301
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,410
Why did you allow me to
stay by your side?

302
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:14,120
Is it because I resemble that woman?

303
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,420
But, I'm not that woman.

304
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,930
Shut up!

305
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:30,230
You really are crossing the
line right now.

306
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,240
Just because I allow you to remain by
my side doesn't mean that I like you.

307
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:40,340
You're only a living talisman,
aside from that you're nothing.

308
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,150
Who do you think you are
to actually dare...

309
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:53,260
Who do you think... you are exactly?

310
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,860
To actually dare...

311
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,160
<i> confuse me like this.</i>

312
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,270
Don't come near me.

313
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:15,780
If you cross the line again,
I won't easily forgive you.

314
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:51,110
Tonight I'm going to sleep alone,
you don't need to follow me.

315
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Un.

316
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:12,940
Silently escort her back.
Don't let her know.

317
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:18,340
Apart from this, I need you to go
somewhere on the way back.

318
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,050
<i>Just because I allow you to remain by
my side doesn't mean that I like you.</i>

319
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:31,150
<i>You're only a living talisman,
aside from that you're nothing.</i>

320
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:14,400
Why are you standing outside now when you're
supposed to be by His Majesty's side?

321
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,900
Has something happened?

322
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,100
Shinmu.

323
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,810
Who... exactly am I?

324
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,920
You said that when I was young I was
abandoned by my parents to wander the streets.

325
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,620
You saw my shaman's abilities
in me so you took me in.

326
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,830
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

327
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:50,530
During the past few days,
I've been seeing some strange images.

328
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:54,540
They're certainly someone else's memories.

329
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,740
It feels exceptionally real,
like I've experienced it before.

330
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,140
This makes me extremely confused.

331
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,750
This is because your psychic
ability hasn't matured,

332
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,450
creating a temporary illusion.

333
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:11,250
So, stop dwelling on the past.

334
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:20,260
I couldn't... possibly be the owner
of those memories, could I?

335
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:28,470
No matter how I resemble her,
I can't become that person?

336
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,200
Who is it?

337
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,010
Prince Yang Myeong! You startled me!

338
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,010
I did it to scare you.

339
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,420
Why do you have to jump over the
wall every time you come here?

340
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,120
That's because,

341
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,120
I'm more familiar with the wall
than the front entrance.

342
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,030
Besides, it's already past curfew.

343
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,130
It was really hard trying to
hide away from the patrols.

344
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,730
Come, come. The weather is so cold.

345
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,340
Let's go inside and have a drink.

346
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Ja Un. What brings you here this late?

347
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,950
You scared me.

348
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,150
How could you just appear
without any warning?

349
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,350
Is it possible you jumped over
the wall to come in like me?

350
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,150
After all it's already late.

351
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,960
Do you come here as a royal messenger,
or come here as a close friend?

352
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,160
His Majesty has ordered you to
make a trip to the palace, Uibin.
(Uibin - Prince Consort)

353
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,570
Suddenly calling me to the palace,
has something happened?

354
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,870
Pretend I didn't ask. Unless
His Majesty says to do so,

355
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,680
you absolutely won't tell me.

356
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,380
Since I have relayed the royal command,
I will be going now.

357
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,780
Going so soon?

358
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,280
I've already left my position
long enough.

359
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,190
<i>That's my birthday present
made by our Yeon U.</i>

360
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,900
So, is this your sister's handwriting?

361
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,300
Absolutely.

362
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,400
She was truly exceptional.

363
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,410
Not only in painting and calligraphy,
but also fluent in literature.

364
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,510
It's really a shame she was born a girl.

365
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,410
On top of that,

366
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,510
she was a considerate and
respectful child.

367
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,720
But, why are you suddenly asking this?

368
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,620
It's only because I saw her
handwriting that I asked.

369
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,350
Who sent you here?

370
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,360
Why were you spying on
the Uibin's residence?

371
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,060
What is your objective?

372
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,470
That person...

373
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,470
Kim Chae Un has unexpectedly
showed an interest in a woman.

374
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,880
That's pretty rare.

375
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,480
It's unprecedented.

376
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,980
What woman? It's not like that.

377
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Don't quibble.

378
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,690
Anyway, a woman is a woman.

379
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,190
Contrary to what one might expect from you,
I hear that you have a lover.

380
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,400
I guess it was Princess Min Hwa
who said that.

381
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,100
Is it true?

382
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,700
I thought it was only a joke,

383
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,510
but it's actually true.

384
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,410
What kind of person is she?

385
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,610
Yes...

386
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,820
What kind of person is she?

387
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,620
In fact I don't know either.

388
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,620
What?

389
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:45,130
Do you know that 8 years ago,
the night before the final selection day,

390
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,030
I climbed over the walls of this place.

391
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,730
<i>Do you want to go with me?</i>

392
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,240
<i>Doesn't matter if it's the position
of a prince </i>

393
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,140
<i>or the title of Prince Yang Myeong,
I'll abandon them all,</i>

394
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,740
<i>and take you far, far away.</i>

395
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,750
But, do you know how your
sister replied?

396
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,350
<i>This joke is not funny.</i>

397
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,950
Her sparkling eyes looked so resolute,

398
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,560
I was unable to say anything more.

399
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,660
Prince!

400
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,860
But, if that day, I...

401
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,270
hadn't used a smiling face to
hide my true feelings...

402
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:33,480
<i>Deceiving your inner heart
and living in disguise,</i>

403
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,280
<i>isn't it something that's
really torturous?</i>

404
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,290
If I'd taken more courage and
extended my hand out to her,

405
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,790
if I'd shown my true feelings,

406
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,900
and asked her to run away with me,

407
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,300
then would she now...

408
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,010
be by my side?

409
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,630
Haven't you gone to sleep yet?

410
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,230
I wanted to ask you where
you've been so late at night.

411
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,740
You are hurt.

412
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,540
How did it happen?

413
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,150
I made a mistake while
practicing with the sword.

414
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,550
Come here so I can take
a look at your wound.

415
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,750
Really, I'm fine.

416
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,760
The clothes just got ripped,
there's no wound.

417
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,560
Where exactly did you go?

418
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
Just...

419
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,560
My previous owner's house.

420
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,970
They must have been good people,

421
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,870
since you still visit them now.

422
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,370
Yes.

423
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,880
They really were extremely good people.

424
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,780
While others treated me like an animal,

425
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,590
they treated me like a person.

426
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,490
They gave me the name "Seol",
such a beautiful name.

427
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:36,500
<i>Agassi, that's the kind of person you are.</i>

428
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,810
<i>Both of us have changed.</i>

429
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,910
<i>In my memories, your sister...</i>

430
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,820
<i>is still 13 years old.</i>

431
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:49,970
<i>Never back down when you
have already taken a step forward.</i>

432
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,680
<i>You clearly taught me that.</i>

433
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:31,410
<i>A person's heart is like that too.</i>

434
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,020
<i>It's not easy to change a person's
heart once it's made up.</i>

435
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,120
<i>So no matter what happens, I...</i>

436
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,730
<i>can never disappoint
His Highness, the Crown Prince.</i>

437
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,650
Are... Are you a g-ghost or a person?

438
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:12,860
Aren't you...

439
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,460
It's me, Orabeoni.

440
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,860
What are you doing here so late?

441
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,460
I'm sorry, Orabeoni.
I was wrong.

442
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,570
What are you sorry about?

443
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,370
The person that you're looking for,

444
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:33,680
I'll help you meet her.

445
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,780
Orabeoni.

446
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,590
Because you're my savior,
I will surely repay your kindness.

447
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,990
No matter what happens to me
I'm going to repay you.

448
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:54,500
I'ill make sure that you'll
meet her again,

449
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,800
so don't be too sad.

450
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,240
<i>Who do you keep looking for in me?</i>

451
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,250
Through me, who do you see?

452
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,070
You should go back to your
room to rest.

453
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,370
I will be fine by myself.

454
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:11,770
No.

455
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:16,680
Until you're feeling better,
I will always stay by your side.

456
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,180
Thanks to you Princess
I'm feeling much better now.

457
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,890
I won't be sad anymore...

458
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:24,590
Mother.

459
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:29,590
Why are you here too,
Princess Min Hwa?

460
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,300
Since yesterday she's never left my side
because she's afraid that I will be sad again.

461
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,800
You've taken a lot of trouble.
I'm very grateful.

462
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,810
How can you say that when
we're a couple?

463
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,910
My husband, are you entering
the King's palace?

464
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,520
Yes, last night I received
an imperial order.

465
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,920
Why are you only telling me now?

466
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,720
If you had told me earlier,
I could have gone with you.

467
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,330
I'm very sorry I didn't think of that.

468
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,230
Next time, I'll make sure to tell you first.

469
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,430
I'm going now Mother.

470
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,140
Don't let His Majesty feel vexed
or worried, and act prudently.

471
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,550
Are you angry that you can't go?

472
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,850
It's not that I'm angry,
but because I'm uneasy.

473
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:34,460
Uneasy? What are you uneasy about?

474
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,360
That, it's because if my husband
enters the palace?.

475
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,680
<i>Teacher.</i>

476
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,980
Why do you stay at home
and not go out?

477
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,190
If I didn't take the initiative to invite you,
you wouldn't have come to see me.

478
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,090
Your Majesty,

479
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,590
please have a seat so that
I can greet you properly.

480
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:12,900
No need for that.

481
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,900
Come, quickly prepare some
tea and cake.

482
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,300
And I want to chat with
the Teacher in private.

483
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,200
Don't let anyone disturb us.
All of you may leave now.

484
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,910
How could the Uibin visit the palace?

485
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,720
This is ridiculous.

486
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,120
He should have lived quietly for the
rest of his life until the day that he dies.

487
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,320
Isn't that what an Uibin should do?

488
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,330
How dare he randomly visit
the palace in broad daylight?

489
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:46,630
That's true. Since ancient times
the position of Uibin

490
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:51,130
has always been banned from
political activities, the study of
knowledge and all such external activities.

491
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,040
This is what the law states.

492
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,540
This matter is very dangerous.

493
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,340
Thanks to him,

494
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,740
my ranking in the palace will drop.

495
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,640
What... ranking?

496
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,750
In the past, when there was
a popularity rank inside the palace,

497
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,550
after Un, wasn't it me?

498
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:14,860
His appearance in the palace
will sway the rankings.

499
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,460
You have the power to change it.

500
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,960
But in case

501
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,170
this is the King's plan to gather
the dispersed faction of scholars...

502
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:29,370
But Heo Yeom isn't the kind of
person to incite the scholar faction.

503
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:32,880
Heo Yeom is a strong, symbolic figure
among the scholar faction.

504
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,880
His existence itself can move them.

505
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,480
I'm afraid,

506
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,190
his influence will surpass his
father's, Heo Yeong Jae.

507
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:51,990
<i>Heo Yeom has already lost his power,</i>

508
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:54,400
<i>so why did he visit the palace?</i>

509
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,400
What is... this?

510
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:07,710
It's my sister's last letter,
that she left behind.

511
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:12,410
I wanted to forget about it,
because it was in the past.

512
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:17,720
But then, even though it's late I thought
I should pass it on to it's real owner.

513
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,220
This is what should be done.

514
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,120
Is it really...

515
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:28,630
Yeon U's letter which she left for me?

516
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:30,930
That's right.

517
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:39,540
Yeon U, left for me...

518
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:45,750
While my sister was still alive,
there was only one husband in her heart.
That was Your Majesty.

519
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:50,450
Because this letter is from a sinner,
it was supposed to be burned.

520
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,160
If Your Majesty can personally burn it,

521
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,260
if you really can personally do it,

522
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,460
my sister in heaven, would be happy.

523
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:20,280
So please, from now on,
please forget my sister.

524
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,490
Your Majesty, you already
have the Queen by your side.

525
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,890
Please don't make the Queen
lonely anymore.

526
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:36,300
If Your Majesty continues to be unable
to break free from that child's shadow,

527
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:41,300
that is not what my sister
would have wished for.

528
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,510
This is a sincere request from
my sister and me.

529
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,610
Please fulfill it.

530
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:53,720
Your Majesty.

531
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,920
Everyone...

532
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:07,830
keeps telling me to forget all about her.

533
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,840
Uibin, My Lord,

534
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,350
from now on I hope you will
visit the palace often.

535
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:26,350
Even though His Majesty
doesn't show it,

536
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:29,550
he actually misses you a lot.

537
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,750
Being an Uibin,

538
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:36,660
how can I randomly visit the palace?

539
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:41,160
So, please be with him.

540
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,470
Take good care of His Majesty.

541
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,780
Uibin,

542
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,880
you should have been the one
to accompany His Majesty.

543
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,620
<i>Your Highness, Crown Prince.</i>

544
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,030
<i>With my last ounce of strength,</i>

545
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,030
<i>I'm writing to you this letter.</i>

546
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:51,130
<i>This may add to your troubles.</i>

547
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,340
<i>Maybe, </i>

548
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,840
<i>this letter will not be
delivered to you.</i>

549
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,140
<i>But I'm still picking up
this pen to write.</i>

550
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,540
<i>This girl,</i>

551
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,950
<i>before departing,</i>

552
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:08,450
<i> was able to meet Your Highness,</i>

553
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:12,350
<i>and for this I'm extremely grateful.</i>

554
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,460
<i>Therefore,</i>

555
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,860
<i>I'm asking you not to
blame yourself again.</i>

556
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,560
<i>Please just forget about me.</i>

557
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:25,470
<i>Keep me in a corner of your memory.</i>

558
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:32,370
<i>Father will bring my medicine soon.</i>

559
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:34,280
<i>So,</i>

560
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,680
<i>afterwards, I'll never be able
to see you again.
</i>

561
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:45,290
<i>I'm asking you to forget me.</i>

562
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,790
<i>Please take good care of your health.</i>

563
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:55,900
<i>I hope you can be honored
as a great monarch.</i>

564
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:01,000
She was worried about my health,

565
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,510
at the moment she was
about to leave this life.

566
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:13,320
Using her last bit of strength
she wrote down this letter...

567
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,720
But I...

568
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,420
But I...

569
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,030
Your Majesty.

570
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:28,030
She must have been in a lot of pain.

571
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:35,240
How much she must have suffered.

572
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,940
Her writing at the end of the letter,

573
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:46,650
is so loose and weak.

574
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,760
Hyeong Seon.

575
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

576
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:01,360
Issue an order to Court Lady Jo.

577
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,770
Ask her to find the box
and bring it to me.

578
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:07,170
Yes.

579
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:11,970
I can't remember,

580
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,580
Yeon U's handwriting.

581
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,280
I can't remember.

582
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,290
I must see it.

583
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:28,990
Those letters that she wrote to me.

584
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:34,200
I want to see them again.

585
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:42,500
I will... obey your order, Your Majesty.

586
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:47,510
After taking a walk at night,

587
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,310
His Majesty ordered that
the living talisman

588
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:52,410
not be allowed near his chambers.

589
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,420
A walk?

590
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,820
Late at night,

591
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,020
both of them went for a walk?

592
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:59,320
Even before,

593
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,720
whenever His Majesty reads at night,

594
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,730
he often goes out to take a walk.

595
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,730
So,

596
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:10,230
did anything happen after that?

597
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,530
It didn't...

598
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,940
Ever since Lord Uibin came
over during the day

599
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,840
His Majesty has been very troubled

600
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,150
and suddenly ordered one of
the ladies to bring him a box.

601
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:24,450
A box?

602
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:25,550
Yes.

603
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:28,350
It looks like a normal storage box,

604
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:34,460
but on the box is engraved
the word "rain".

605
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,560
Just now,

606
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,160
did you say "rain"?
(Rain - U)

607
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,330
Please order me.

608
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,830
Bring Wol...

609
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,630
Bring Wol here.

610
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:52,250
Immediately bring Wol over now!

611
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:17,660
You... Do you recognize me?
