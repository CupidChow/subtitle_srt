00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,257
The Moon That Embraces The Sun

2
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:04,901
Enjoy:)

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,310
<i>This drama is set during the Joseon Era
under the rule of a fictitious king.</i>

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,790
<i>All characters and events are fictitious
and have no historic basis.</i>

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,390
Episode 11

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,770
Do you recognize me?

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,910
Who are you?

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,389
Arrest him!

9
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:33,580
Yes.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,730
Who are you to dare touch me?

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,579
I am the former king's eldest son,

12
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:43,889
Prince Yang Myung.

13
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:45,060
My Lord

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,300
Can you recognize me?

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,389
We met previously in the...

16
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:54,410
Please let go of that hand.

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,820
Quickly, take her.

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,950
Wait!

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,130
Let's go.

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,080
Wait a minute.

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,130
Whose way are you blocking right now?

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,900
<i>This can't be!</i>

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,560
<i>This can't be!</i>

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,429
<i>Please go back.</i>

25
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,439
<i>You cannot do this.</i>

26
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,199
What can I not do?

27
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,799
She is only a human amulet

28
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,270
to absorb evil energy.

29
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,099
So for just a piece of *paper,
(*yellow papers to ward off evil)

30
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,129
how can you have any feelings for?

31
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,209
I'm also a person who is
no better than paper, so I don't care.

32
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,659
This is

33
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,249
a fate that is not destined.

34
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:11,240
Who decided that kind of fate?!

35
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,300
As a shaman,

36
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,460
I dare deliver the message of God.

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,230
That is

38
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,250
for not God, but for me to decide.

39
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,210
Not only you, My Lord,

40
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,290
but that child will be in danger as well.

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,209
Because of you,

42
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,209
that child can be
the target of political strife,

43
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,590
how can you not understand that?

44
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,390
Do not look for her again.

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,170
Do not harbor any feelings for her.

46
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,300
If you care at all for that child,

47
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,260
you must keep your distance from her.

48
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,260
Answer me now!

49
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,540
I asked where you were born.

50
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,810
Although I am not sure,

51
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,729
I heard it was a place
far away from the city.

52
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:14,939
Then, have you lived your whole life
in Oh Nyang?

53
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:17,619
I followed Mistress here and there

54
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,359
and lived in many different places.

55
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,489
Your parents? Siblings?

56
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:21,910
Where are they?

57
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,900
I do not have any.

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,840
The people I have grown up with

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,189
are my family.

60
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:30,269
Then,

61
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:31,990
are you saying you're an orphan?

62
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,070
Although I may have in the past,

63
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,650
because I was abandoned at the same time
I received my divine powers,

64
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,439
I do not remember now.

65
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,610
Then,

66
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,489
you were not an orphan from the beginning.

67
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,719
What kind of people
were your parents and siblings?

68
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,110
Do you remember?

69
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,760
A shaman,

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,950
as she receives her powers from God,

71
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,930
must forget about her past and memories.

72
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,000
So I also

73
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,690
do not think of

74
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,320
or remember my past.

75
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,410
You have to remove all memories of the past?

76
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,360
Yes, that is correct.

77
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,600
Then,

78
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,499
break the seal,

79
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:23,159
and try to remember the past!

80
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,669
Where were you born and raised?

81
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,059
What was your name
before you became a shaman?

82
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:27,909
Your Highness.

83
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:31,389
Your divine powers, when, where,
and who gave it to you?!

84
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:33,769
By any chance in your past life, am I...

85
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,530
Am I not there?

86
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,820
Please I beg of you to stop.

87
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,570
I humbly beg of you

88
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,450
please stop your questioning.

89
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,760
Regardless of
what Your Highness may ask, I

90
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,830
cannot give you the answer you seek,
Your Highness.

91
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,440
I...

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,210
It is because
I am not the person that you want.

93
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,120
Although I do not know
how much I resemble that person,

94
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,990
if you do anymore to ask,

95
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,020
please ask her directly.

96
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,189
Immediately

97
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,430
leave. Did you not hear me?

98
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,059
I was wrong, Mistress.

99
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:39,729
Please save me.

100
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:42,280
If you went out,
you should not have returned.

101
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,330
Why did you come back in like a thief?

102
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,260
I do not have anywhere to go, Mistress.

103
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,700
So please, don't chase me out.

104
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,410
I told you not to use the divine powers
for personal reason.

105
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,920
How is it...

106
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,090
How is it that
you cannot follow that one thing?!

107
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,959
You are no longer

108
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,270
a shaman for the King

109
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,659
so immediately leave Seongsucheong!

110
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,060
Do you understand?

111
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,229
Please forgive me, Mistress.

112
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,399
- Please forgive me!
- Ahjumma,

113
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:16,350
this isn't the first time
that Jan Sil has done this,

114
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
just punish her lightly
and get it over with.

115
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,540
I felt pity for brother,
which is why I did it.

116
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,040
Just one

117
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,570
Just one I wanted to give to brother.

118
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,769
His Highness has everything,

119
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,690
but brother...

120
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,080
<i>Wol, you as well,</i>

121
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,730
<i>are seeing the King first?</i>

122
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,900
<i>You as well</i>

123
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,390
<i>are protecting the king?</i>

124
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,500
Immediately,

125
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,859
leave this place.

126
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:59,160
Immediately!

127
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,020
Mother, why

128
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,120
do you keep telling me
to live for other people?

129
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,150
Prince Yang Myung.

130
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,710
What brings you here at this late hour?

131
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,710
What about you, mother?

132
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,000
What were you doing at this late hour?

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,779
As always,

134
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:04,530
I pray for the safety of the His Highness.

135
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,499
Prince Yang Myung.

136
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,270
Just once

137
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,010
before His Highness

138
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,309
can't you say my name first?

139
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:16,859
How can you say such disloyal words?

140
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:21,110
Disloyal. Restrain. Give it up.
Hide it. Don't waver!

141
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,090
Mother, aren't you tired of it?

142
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,829
What is wrong?

143
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,420
Just once.

144
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,610
Just once,

145
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,860
do as you wish.

146
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,040
You can be selfish at least once.

147
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,660
Can't you say that just once?

148
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,520
From now, your son

149
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,450
will not live for others anymore.

150
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,710
If I want to laugh, I will laugh.

151
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,520
If I want to be angry, I will be angry.

152
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,839
I will steal when I want.

153
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,050
That's how I am going to live!

154
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,880
Mistress.

155
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,780
Let's run away.

156
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,820
Run away with me.

157
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,869
Jan Sil

158
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:28,369
If it were me, I would have protected you.

159
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,939
If it were me,
I would not have left you like this.

160
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,380
If it were me...

161
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,400
Before I tear your mouth,

162
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,400
will you not shut it at once!

163
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,500
M- mistress.

164
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,569
What are you doing?

165
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:02,449
Quickly drag Jan Sil out.

166
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:04,180
<i>Yes, State Shaman.</i>

167
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,099
Mistress. Mistress!

168
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:08,760
Mistress!

169
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,689
Why are you doing this, Mistress?

170
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,010
Whoever it may be,

171
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,610
if anyone brings Jan Sil
back to Seongsucheong,

172
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,899
I am going to punish you
according to the divine law.

173
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,009
Do you understand?

174
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,830
Yes, State Shaman.

175
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,530
Do you want to be chased out as well?

176
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,769
Mistress.

177
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:32,519
No!

178
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,410
Mistress!

179
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,499
Why are you being so mean?

180
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:46,909
Jan Sil, like me,

181
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,519
is unable to control her powers.

182
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,099
Even if she did make a mistake-

183
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:53,780
Stop arguing with me.

184
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,040
If you're done with your work,
go in and rest.

185
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,470
Mistress

186
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,229
Let her go.

187
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:02,969
She is teaching her a lesson.

188
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:06,479
She has to be this harsh
so Jan Sil comes to her senses as well.

189
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,359
She is a child with nowhere to go.

190
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:11,159
We cannot let her
wander in this cold weather.

191
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,039
In the end,
she will come crawling back in.

192
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,810
Then Ahjumma Jang will pretend
she can't win and let her in.

193
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,760
Is this the first time we are dealing
with her leaving the house?

194
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,330
Mistress.

195
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,050
If it is about Jan Sil,
don't waste your breath.

196
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,090
Then,

197
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,490
I will leave Seongsucheong as well.

198
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,649
Are you threatening me?

199
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:00,720
It is not a threat.

200
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,010
Then,

201
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,480
are you serious about leaving Seongsucheong?

202
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,570
In the past,

203
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,089
you said if you want, I will protect you,

204
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,370
so run away with Seol.

205
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,200
You said this, right?

206
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,760
Why are you bringing it up?

207
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,280
It's just that Seol,

208
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,430
Jan Sil

209
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,160
and I

210
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,860
I feel as if the three of us
do not belong here.

211
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,170
That is why I am asking.

212
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,490
How did you come to such a decision?

213
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,320
What made you want to leave?

214
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,580
Mistress, what you said was correct.

215
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,940
My hasty decision

216
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,430
to watch over him was incorrect.

217
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,640
What I can do for His Highness

218
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,470
is nothing. I realize that now.

219
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,619
I was trying to help His Highness
lessen his burden,

220
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:22,590
I was not trying to confuse him.

221
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,430
My being is actually

222
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,210
causing him confusion.

223
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,800
The person he needs

224
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,880
is not me.

225
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,750
Leaving his side is actually

226
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,520
the way to help him.

227
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,669
Your Highness.

228
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:14,330
You should take a nap.

229
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,049
You have not slept at all last night

230
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,730
so how will you attend the mourning court?

231
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,659
<i>Although I do not know
how much I resemble that person,</i>

232
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:26,079
<i>if you do anymore to ask,</i>

233
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,960
<i>please ask her directly.</i>

234
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,520
<i>How do I ask a child who has already died?</i>

235
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,060
<i>Father will be bringing the medicine soon.</i>

236
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,630
<i>If so,</i>

237
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,310
<i>I probably won't ever see you again,
Crown Prince.</i>

238
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,050
Once her father brings her medicine,

239
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,130
she won't ever see me again?

240
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,470
Woon,

241
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,850
what does this mean?

242
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,560
Isn't it that

243
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,909
she foresaw that she would be die soon?

244
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,510
That is what I thought at first

245
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,080
but

246
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
when you think about it

247
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,110
it's almost as if this means

248
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,960
that if she takes the medicine
her father brings, she will die?

249
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,179
But the former Chief Scholar Heo

250
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,609
was well known
for having a warm personality.

251
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,389
No way
to his own daughter...

252
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,090
That is why I think it is strange.

253
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,540
As a matter of fact,
that is not the only strange thing.

254
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,950
She was a healthy Crown Princess.

255
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,350
That kind of Crown Princess suddenly died,

256
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,600
but he did not investigate
and covered it up.

257
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,109
Your Highness,

258
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:45,360
what exactly are you suggesting?

259
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,090
If the Crown Princess's death

260
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,560
was not because of a simple illness

261
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,309
Then,

262
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,369
the former Chief Scholar Heo Young Jae

263
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:04,510
becomes a murderer
for killing his own daughter.

264
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,889
The last medicine that Yeon Woo drank,

265
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:10,250
do you think the Prince Consort
will know anything about it?

266
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,270
He probably wouldn't.

267
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,799
At that time, he received an order
to stay at a relative's,

268
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,869
he blamed himself over and over again

269
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:21,010
for not being able
to stay by his sister's side.

270
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,540
Well,

271
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,750
since you know,

272
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,580
asking him

273
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,470
will be cruel.

274
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,800
<i>What do you mean travel?</i>

275
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,320
<i>That is something I cannot do.</i>

276
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,569
Slowly travel
through the countryside of Yeongnam,

277
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:58,219
do some nature sightseeing,

278
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:00,810
and sort out your feelings.

279
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,420
There is no hidden meaning.

280
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,009
<i>Can I come in?</i>

281
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:07,900
Yes, please come in mother.

282
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,829
Did you finish packing your traveling gear?

283
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,020
Yes.

284
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,990
If you leave on this trip,

285
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,770
we'll see each other after about a month.

286
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,910
Yes.

287
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,120
But,

288
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,700
did you say farewell to the Princess?

289
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,560
Not yet.

290
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,800
How can you be so remote?

291
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,019
She is probably anxiously waiting for you,

292
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:44,620
quickly go and comfort the Princess.

293
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,610
Yes, mother.

294
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,570
Why are you avoiding me again?

295
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,099
I'm about to leave,

296
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:28,750
but you're not going to show me your face?

297
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,229
Can't I go with you?

298
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:36,710
This is a royal command,

299
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,149
and the journey will be long and hard,

300
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:40,949
so it will not be good for you, Princess.

301
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,360
But!

302
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,250
If you leave me,

303
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,190
I have to apart from you
for such a long time.

304
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,400
Since I know you are waiting for me,

305
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,820
I will finish my mission
and return as soon as I can.

306
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,000
What is wrong?

307
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,050
I

308
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,450
complain every day,

309
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,289
so you hate me, right?

310
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,229
I do not hate you.

311
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:11,999
Because of me,

312
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,180
you cannot take up your government service.

313
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,290
You are stuck at home,

314
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,330
so you resent me, right?

315
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,649
I do not resent you.

316
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:25,100
Liar.

317
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,930
Princess,

318
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,290
you are my family's savior.

319
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,289
After Yeon Woo left us,

320
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,599
you were the one...

321
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,380
who brought laughter
back into this desolate house.

322
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,159
Just with that,

323
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,600
I feel nothing but gratitude for you.

324
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,040
Then,

325
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,340
you will not abandon me?

326
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,199
Why are you saying this again?

327
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,099
Promise me.

328
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,449
Haven't I already handed my life to you?

329
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:04,199
So,

330
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:08,100
what do I have to give you now
to make you satisfied?

331
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,710
No, there's no need.

332
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,260
I

333
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,860
will believe you
even if you do not give me anything.

334
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,970
The promise you made about not abandoning me

335
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,140
and the promise to return quickly

336
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,350
I will believe everything.

337
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,910
So,

338
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,530
even if I want to cry every night,

339
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,460
I will restrain myself and wait for you.

340
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,519
<i>The Prince Consort has left to go
to the countryside of Yeongnam.</i>

341
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,719
His Highness is too much.

342
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,639
If he was going to send anyone on a trip,
it should have been me.

343
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:51,669
It is Yeongnam of all places too.

344
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,609
The scenery is beautiful.

345
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:55,339
Especially Jin Ju is famous

346
00:20:55,339 --> 00:21:00,900
for having many ivory and fair gisaengs.

347
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,399
It's a pity. A pity.

348
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:06,939
For someone as old fashioned
as the Prince Consort to go,

349
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:10,950
how will he understand
the essence of romance?

350
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,790
If the Prince Consort was more like you,

351
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,060
we would not be nervous.

352
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,360
If seems as His Highness
is moving the Prince Consort

353
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,500
to gather the scattered scholars.

354
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,200
Have you prepared what I have asked for?

355
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,110
I will find documents accusing
the Prince Consort of misconduct

356
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,899
and report them to the palace.

357
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:37,040
What?

358
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,519
The genius Heo Yeom is so clean
that there is no sign of dust,

359
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,320
but you have evidence of his misconduct?

360
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,060
How exactly did you find such rare evidence?

361
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,640
Oh.

362
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,280
Fabricated?

363
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,400
Everything about His Highness is good,

364
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,390
but his vigor and youth lead him.

365
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,650
We have cut him down once

366
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,910
so he understands

367
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,929
what politics is.

368
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,609
Your royal command for the Prince Consort

369
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:11,759
please revoke it, Your Highness.

370
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,039
They say that rumors
travel a thousand miles,

371
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,220
The rumors spread quickly.

372
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,199
I thought that the Prince Consort
had already reported for the trip,

373
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,969
so what is the problem?

374
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:23,529
Since the past,
the position of Prince Consort

375
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:27,329
was one that was forbidden
from participating in political affairs.

376
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:32,020
Already, the Prince Consort's actions
are attracting people's attention.

377
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,069
Please,

378
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:34,979
rescind your royal command.

379
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,450
The Prince Consort has spent
many years quietly at home.

380
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,759
The Princess really felt sorry for him,

381
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,159
so I ordered him on a vacation
to get some fresh air.

382
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,389
If that is so,

383
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:46,809
please order him to travel to

384
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:48,079
another location for vacation.

385
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,519
And why is that?

386
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,089
For the Prince Consort to travel
to the countryside of Yeongnam is

387
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:55,279
extremely dangerous.

388
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,380
Why?

389
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,580
By any chance, are you worried
that the Prince Consort's movements

390
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,120
will gather the scholars in Yeongnam

391
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,929
and cause a political riot?

392
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:06,370
We are just

393
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,419
worrying about the Prince Consort's safety

394
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:10,569
and raising our concerns, Your Highness.

395
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:12,309
The safety of the Prince Consort?

396
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,100
Although the Prince Consort

397
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,509
is on a light journey,

398
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:18,479
for those who are trying to gain power,

399
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:21,079
there will be no better chance than this.

400
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,279
If by any chance,

401
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,209
they capture the Prince Consort
to gain more power,

402
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:28,179
then the Prince Consort
could be a political target?

403
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:29,320
Of course,

404
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,589
when people are gathered,
they tend to talk too much.

405
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:36,799
Trying to compromise,
they will talk a lot,

406
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,899
but in the end,

407
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:41,590
wouldn't it end in chaos?

408
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,660
If there is criticism because of patriotism,
then I should have to abide.

409
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,560
Oh,

410
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,600
I think I hear it now.

411
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,040
He is the icon of a puppet king
being controlled by his council.

412
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,699
That is disloyalty, Your Highness!

413
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:06,739
If anyone were to say such a thing,

414
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:08,419
he must be arrested immediately

415
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:10,770
and punished severely!

416
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,030
People can say
whatever they want in private.

417
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,120
You do the same
when you're in your private quarters.

418
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,430
Isn't that right?

419
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,050
<i>It wasn't enough
to break the Prince Consort's wings,</i>

420
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,630
<i>now they are threatening me with his safety.</i>

421
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,510
Your Highness,

422
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,610
what is wrong?

423
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,410
Woon.

424
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,120
It has been a while,
but it is time for us to have some fun.

425
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,180
Why are you doing this again, Your Highness?

426
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,889
Since the last time I have come,

427
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:23,299
what is the reason the bills
that should be increasing

428
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:25,799
are decreasing.

429
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,180
Because of the weather,

430
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,859
the express coming from the countryside

431
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:31,579
hasn't arrived on time.

432
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:34,650
The mail hasn't arrived on time?

433
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,740
That sounds believable.

434
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,299
But, the documents
regarding the Prince Consort's travels,

435
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,809
how were they handled so quickly?

436
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:45,080
Are you telling me
that only rumors are handled quickly?!

437
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,160
Your Highness, that is...

438
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,390
Although I have participated in politics
for 3 years,

439
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,520
compared to the problems that I handled,

440
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,530
you have handled more.

441
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,240
Your Highness if you would like
to view the political records,

442
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,700
- you must another give an order.
- Since this is my situation,

443
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,730
it is not difficult for you
to ignore my order!

444
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,040
But,

445
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,839
if my advisors were to see this,

446
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,760
what would you say to them?

447
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,169
Tell me!

448
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,840
What would you say to them?

449
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,500
Y- your Highness

450
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,619
<i>Although he is passionate,</i>

451
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:36,720
<i>he is an incompetent patient,</i>

452
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,760
<i>or</i>

453
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,770
<i>a puppet who does your bidding?!</i>

454
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,890
<i>Tell me!</i>

455
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,039
<i>In the future, when my grandson
becomes the Crown Prince,</i>

456
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,960
<i>how will I be remembered in the records?!</i>

457
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,559
Your Highness.

458
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,629
Your Highness.

459
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:59,039
If it isn't enough
to cover my eyes and ears,

460
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,609
and you dare defy my order,

461
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:04,099
you will be more than depressed,

462
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:05,610
you will be disloyal.

463
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,280
Do you understand?

464
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,630
Were you able to find any clues?

465
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,690
No,

466
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,240
there's nothing.

467
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,270
It's strange. How can there be nothing?

468
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,400
When I look at the chronicles
from Yeon Woo's death eight years ago,

469
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,620
I thought we would be able to learn
more about the situation.

470
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,600
It is written that she died from an illness.

471
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,700
But when I think it over,

472
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,410
it was such a sudden illness, wasn't it?

473
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,430
And the timing was too coincidental.

474
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,420
If she became ill
before the selection process,

475
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,940
then the Chief Scholar's family
would not have been implicated.

476
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,650
If she had become ill
after the marriage ceremony,

477
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,210
she would not have been so cruelly
chased out of the palace.

478
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,810
Your Highness.

479
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,090
Your Highness.

480
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,890
Why

481
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,890
was it then of all times?

482
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,770
Why?

483
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,910
What did you just say?

484
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,230
The shaman

485
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,599
resembles someone?

486
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,759
Yes,

487
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,099
although I am not sure,

488
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:16,020
that is what I heard.

489
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,740
Tell me in more detail.

490
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,839
His Highness was furious

491
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,109
and forcibly questioned the shaman,

492
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:28,160
and that girl answered,

493
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,329
I do not know how much I resemble the girl,

494
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:32,789
but I am not her.

495
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:34,699
If you have any more questions,

496
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:36,990
please ask her.

497
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,850
That's what she said.

498
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,889
Your Highness, what is wrong?

499
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:02,410
Court Lady Jo,

500
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,760
didn't you hear the cries of a woman...

501
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,290
coming from Eunwol Palace?

502
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,589
Is someone inside?

503
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:36,640
A shaman from Seongsucheong is inside.

504
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,860
A Seongsucheong shaman?

505
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,470
As you have commanded,

506
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,789
I have requested Gwansanggam
to move up the date of the marital bed.

507
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:01,990
You did? That is good.

508
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,629
Your spiritual daughter played a big part.

509
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,459
When the consummation matters are settled,

510
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,539
I will greatly reward her.

511
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:09,970
Actually,

512
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,179
I have something to discuss with you
about that matter.

513
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:14,740
Go ahead.

514
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,640
I was thinking

515
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,330
of sending the shaman out of the palace.

516
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,579
It is right before the consummation,

517
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,440
how can we remove the talisman?

518
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,229
That is absurd!

519
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:29,180
His Highness's health

520
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:35,170
will get stable
without the help of a talisman.

521
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,590
Actually, if he keeps a talisman
that took the evil fortune from him,

522
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,809
it could have the opposite effect.

523
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:43,030
But,

524
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,830
if we suddenly remove that girl

525
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,489
and His Highness's health
were to decline again,

526
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,000
The most important things right now

527
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,849
are to improve His Highness's health

528
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:56,540
and to successfully get a heir,
aren't they?

529
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,990
So,

530
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,560
is there another way?

531
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,420
A talisman to protect His Highness's health

532
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,589
and a talisman to help with consummation

533
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:07,600
are greatly different.

534
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,249
So from tonight onward,

535
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:13,949
in order to help with the consummation
of the two highnesses,

536
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:16,759
I would like to use a consummation talisman.

537
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,860
Consummation talisman?

538
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,239
There is such a thing?

539
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:26,180
It is a talisman in preparation
of the consummation.

540
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,150
I understand.

541
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,879
As long as the consummation will succeed,

542
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:39,940
anything can be done.

543
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,980
Do as you please.

544
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,260
I will adhere to your command,
Your Highness.

545
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,599
You have come, Your Highness.

546
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:18,570
I heard from Grandmother
that you have returned.

547
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,970
After your spiritual daughter
entered the palace,

548
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,730
it is said that His Highness's health
has improved.

549
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,970
I do not deserve your praise.

550
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,410
But that child,

551
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,380
does she resemble the dead Heo girl?

552
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,830
Why do you ask that?

553
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,050
Even if you are not curious,

554
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,760
the palace is place
where there are no secrets.

555
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,269
If it is a woman,

556
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:53,290
His Highness never looked at one,

557
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,020
and the fact that he so easily
left her at his side.

558
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,960
Do they really look that much alike?

559
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,339
In my eyes,

560
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:10,080
she is just a plain child.

561
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:15,040
I would like to meet her myself
and reward her.

562
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,909
When would be-

563
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,360
Your expression

564
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,850
is clouded by worries.

565
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,000
Since when
have you heard the cries from Eunwol Palace?

566
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,330
Please do not worry.

567
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,130
My spiritual daughter
will soon be leaving the palace.

568
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,270
The date of the consummation
will also be moved up.

569
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,819
Everything

570
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:51,060
will be as you wish.

571
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:59,220
You will not need to make any
separate requests to the Queen Dowager.

572
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,560
I have received permission
from the Queen Dowager.

573
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,360
Starting today, you do not
have to enter the main palace.

574
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,040
You received what you wished for

575
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,320
yet you look disappointed.

576
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,990
I am not.

577
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:29,229
I feel as if I've caused you trouble,
mistress.

578
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:30,760
Be aware of this

579
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,980
and prepare
to leave tomorrow morning with Seol.

580
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,990
I will do so.

581
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,769
Who did it come from?

582
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:47,130
Do I have to report that also?

583
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,220
<i>Wol unni,</i>

584
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,290
<i>it's me Jan Sil.</i>

585
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,250
<i>You were worried about me, right?</i>

586
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,860
<i>I,</i>

587
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,099
<i>thanks to a good person,</i>

588
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,130
<i>am doing well.</i>

589
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,109
<i>The kind of person,</i>

590
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:13,300
<i>he is...</i>

591
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,420
<i>He is a very wonderful and kind person.</i>

592
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,320
<i>He is a man among men.</i>

593
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,949
<i>He is someone who is bold and free-spirited,</i>

594
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:27,029
<i>but with one look at his mouth,</i>

595
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:29,670
<i>you know that he is a chivalrous fighter.</i>

596
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,089
<i>Anyway, thanks to him,</i>

597
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,479
<i>I am staying in a small inn in the city.</i>

598
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:37,419
<i>So I have a favor to ask.</i>

599
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:39,550
<i>Can you bring my clothes to me?</i>

600
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,899
<i>But you have to keep it a secret
from mistress.</i>

601
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:45,339
<i>Oh, do not bring Seol unni.</i>

602
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:48,710
<i>This morning,
she was on the same side as mistress.</i>

603
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,459
<i>There are so many things I want to eat,</i>

604
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:18,090
<i>I didn't know</i>

605
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,730
<i>Certainly,</i>

606
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,900
<i>Father must have had a lot of questions</i>

607
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,670
<i>and probably ordered a secret investigation.</i>

608
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,360
<i>There must be a secret record that remains
that is not in the government records.</i>

609
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,919
<i>Please be advised to remove the Princess</i>

610
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,739
<i>Successor from the palace, Your Highness!</i>

611
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:48,419
<i>Furthermore, the father
who hid his daughter's illness and</i>

612
00:37:48,419 --> 00:37:49,939
<i>listed her for selection, Heo Young Jae,</i>

613
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:51,629
<i>and the one who hid his family's illness and</i>

614
00:37:51,629 --> 00:37:53,619
<i>entered the Sigangweon, Heo Yeom,</i>

615
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:56,029
<i>should be held accountable for their crimes.</i>

616
00:37:56,029 --> 00:38:00,010
<i>Father will be bringing medicine soon.</i>

617
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,989
<i>But, Father is no longer in this world,</i>

618
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:07,979
<i>and the doctor
who treated Yeon Woo at the time</i>

619
00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:10,630
<i>was ordered to take poison
after my father passed.</i>

620
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,900
<i>The Chief Scholar who gave the
mysterious medicine to Yeon Woo has also</i>

621
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,600
<i>already left this world
because of an illness.</i>

622
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,490
<i>The people who would know anything
about that situation are all dead.</i>

623
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,220
<i>There is no one left is who alive.</i>

624
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,240
<i>There is just one person who is alive.</i>

625
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,430
<i>The person who served the king so closely</i>

626
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,620
<i>the previous head of eunuchs.</i>

627
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,680
Woon.

628
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,150
Why did he ask me
to make a snowman suddenly?

629
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,249
Your Highness, it is Hyung Sun.

630
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:15,560
As you have ordered,
I have brought the snowman.

631
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,180
Your Highness!

632
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,580
Your Highness!

633
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,380
What is wrong?

634
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,460
You know already, so why do you ask?

635
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,550
The house of the former head of eunuchs is

636
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,839
over there, somewhere?

637
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,180
Yes, Your Highness.

638
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,960
What?

639
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,970
You are people that His Highness has sent?

640
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,059
Is the owner inside?

641
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:06,410
Well,

642
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,320
Master has become ill,

643
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,569
so he left to receive treatment far away.

644
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:15,369
How disrespectful of him!

645
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:19,329
<i>His Highness has urgent matters
to discuss with him, so he sent a notice.</i>

646
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:20,390
<i>Alright,</i>

647
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,500
<i>what do you think?</i>

648
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,219
Do you think
your master's treatment will be long or

649
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:27,990
will he come back immediately?

650
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,929
That...

651
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,760
I'm not sure of.

652
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,730
Alright.

653
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,390
When your master returns,
tell him this.

654
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,319
No matter how hard he tries to hide,
the truth will be revealed.

655
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,360
<i>Though he evaded me for now,</i>

656
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,210
<i>in the future,
he will deal with a bigger punishment.</i>

657
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,170
While we will go back today,

658
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,960
if he does not enter the palace by tomorrow,

659
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,010
then, he will be seeing me
not in the palace but in prison.

660
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,280
Tell him this on my behalf.

661
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,229
You were fully aware
that he was in the house,

662
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:10,530
but why did you not meet him?

663
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,380
For eight years,
he kept his mouth shut like a dead person.

664
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,930
If a loyal servant like him is avoiding me,

665
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,590
then father ordered him to hide the truth.

666
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,710
So, if we had forced our way in
to provoke the truth,

667
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,019
It would have had the reverse effect

668
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,870
and we would not gain
the information we want.

669
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,390
Today was

670
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,500
just a test to see if my hunch was correct.

671
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,000
What you are assuming

672
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,310
may I ask?

673
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,160
Yeon Woo's death

674
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,500
was not a simple illness.

675
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,280
Also, the secret records
that father has left behind

676
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,980
actually do exist somewhere.

677
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,960
If you say secret records

678
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,040
If the death was not illness but murder,

679
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:06,680
then why did father hide the truth?

680
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,510
Definitely,

681
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,130
he must have had a reason for doing so.

682
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,070
Then, that reason

683
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,840
he must have left behind somewhere, right?

684
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,040
Woon,

685
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,770
my head hurts.

686
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,230
It has been a while since we have come out,

687
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,150
so let's get some fresh air.

688
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,650
Okay. Come again.

689
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,550
After you finish eating,
return to Seongsucheong.

690
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,419
A- are you alright?

691
00:42:53,419 --> 00:42:54,870
Brother,

692
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,190
can't I

693
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,620
not go back to Seongsucheong?

694
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,189
How long are you going to run away
because you are scared?

695
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:03,849
Listen to me

696
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:06,870
and go back and beg for a long time.

697
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,129
In this kind of situation,
there is no better solution.

698
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:10,949
Even if I want to apologize,

699
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:14,469
I probably won't have hands and feet
to beg with.

700
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:16,280
As soon as I enter,

701
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,599
my limbs will be ripped from my body.

702
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,249
For a child with a beautiful face,

703
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:22,239
why do you say such scary things?

704
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,059
The mistress

705
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,219
once she says she will do something,
she does it.

706
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:27,659
No matter what,

707
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:30,990
it will be difficult
for my limbs to be safe.

708
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:34,380
For someone with so much fear,

709
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,560
what is the reason
you risk your limbs to help me?

710
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,490
Because you were the first person.

711
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,600
Someone to risk his life for me,

712
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:50,650
you were the first.

713
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,229
The faces of my parents who abandoned me

714
00:43:55,229 --> 00:43:57,640
I don't remember at all,

715
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,530
but the face of the boy who carried me away,

716
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,340
I have never forgotten it.

717
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,640
Then,

718
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,279
your situation is similar to mine.

719
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:11,339
Oh!

720
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:14,530
Then you too were abandoned by your parents

721
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,240
and have someone
you can't forget even in your death?

722
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,080
Well,

723
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,609
something like that.

724
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:26,000
The person you can't forget
even in your death

725
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,130
what kind of person is she?

726
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,440
She was a very very bright

727
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,210
and beautiful person.

728
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,210
Just by looking at her, she put me at ease.

729
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,450
She caused me a lot of pain,

730
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,240
but she also

731
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,490
made me very happy.

732
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,580
Then, I called Wol unni here for no reason.

733
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,689
What did you say just now?

734
00:45:13,689 --> 00:45:16,230
So that you could see her,

735
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,580
I called Wol unni here.

736
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,400
<i>Why do you need a letter paper suddenly,
Young Miss?</i>

737
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,620
<i>Do you plan on writing a letter?</i>

738
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,909
<i>Not a letter,</i>

739
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:50,359
<i>but an apology letter.</i>

740
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:51,829
<i>Why are you writing an apology</i>

741
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:53,939
<i>on such expensive paper?</i>

742
00:45:53,939 --> 00:45:57,380
<i>You can just go in person
and apologize till your hands become raw.</i>

743
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,899
<i>I'm sorry miss,</i>

744
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:12,669
<i>I'll just be a minute.
I want to go to the blacksmith.</i>

745
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,270
<i>Just a minute!</i>

746
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:23,439
<i>Please escape.</i>

747
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:25,790
<i>This isn't a fate</i>

748
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,710
<i>that the young miss can handle.</i>

749
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,969
<i>Don't let there be any more connection
between you two.</i>

750
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:33,959
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

751
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,790
<i>Did you hope I had forgotten about you?</i>

752
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,439
Why are you walking so slowly?

753
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,390
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.

754
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,569
Is there a law that states

755
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:29,380
you have to go all the way to Jin Ju
to see the best courtesans?

756
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,619
Is that all?

757
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:32,179
A spacious racing area,

758
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:33,899
magnificent lodge,

759
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:35,769
comfortable drinking habits

760
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:39,050
If there was a utopia,
it would probably be this place.

761
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,669
With the current political situation,

762
00:47:41,669 --> 00:47:44,399
you have the time to go to Chong Road.

763
00:47:44,399 --> 00:47:46,669
You must be very happy, Minister of Finance.

764
00:47:46,669 --> 00:47:50,320
If you are so displeased, Minister of War,
you can always leave.

765
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,849
However,
you don't only drink at Chong Road.

766
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:57,299
In a new atmosphere,

767
00:47:57,299 --> 00:48:00,439
I can maybe come up with a new idea.

768
00:48:00,439 --> 00:48:03,050
Well, let's take a look.

769
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,839
Then, I will go ahead and get us a seat.

770
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,060
Follow me.

771
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,410
Why are you out here?

772
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,710
Oh,

773
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,090
you said you had an errand to run.

774
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,420
I was making a private undercover visit.

775
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,480
Oh,

776
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,490
did I say that earlier?

777
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,560
Without your guard,
you came out on your own?

778
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,369
Although we don't see him,

779
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:48,400
Woon is keeping a watchful eye on us
from somewhere.

780
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,810
But,

781
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,180
for a talisman,

782
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,880
is it okay for you
to be walking around like this?

783
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,679
What?

784
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:01,370
No wonder.

785
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,430
After I woke up,
I would be sore and uncomfortable all over.

786
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,680
Now I know the reason for it.

787
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,559
The talisman sits by me
after being exposed to bad air,

788
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:13,239
so of course I will have a headache.

789
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:15,570
Are you feeling ill?

790
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,920
I was just joking.

791
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,430
What kind of child doesn't know a joke?

792
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,060
That's a relief.

793
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,940
Since I must be interrupting your visit,
I will be going now.

794
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:56,910
Wait a minute.

795
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,430
Minister Yoon and his people
are coming this way.

796
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,899
Before we run into them,

797
00:50:17,899 --> 00:50:19,940
we must hurry back to the palace.

798
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,640
I understand.

799
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,380
<i>You disrespectful fellow!</i>

800
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:47,109
What are you going to do about this?

801
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:48,389
What are you going to do?

802
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:51,379
Do you know how valuable this robe is?

803
00:50:51,379 --> 00:50:55,539
It is made from the finest silk
that is for the royal Ming palace.

804
00:50:55,539 --> 00:50:57,479
How will you pay for this?

805
00:50:57,479 --> 00:50:59,069
I am sorry.

806
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:00,299
Please forgive me.

807
00:51:00,299 --> 00:51:02,500
Again. Again. Again.

808
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:07,340
I hate people who try to
talk their way out of things the most!

809
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,430
Don't use your mouth,
but your body to repay me.

810
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,369
Drag him home and make him chop wood.

811
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,229
Make him chop a lot of wood.

812
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:16,189
Yes.

813
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:18,590
<i>Please let the child go.</i>

814
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,589
On a busy crowded market street,

815
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:25,279
it is inevitable for people
to bump into each other.

816
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:27,649
The child did not do it deliberately,

817
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:29,840
so please forgive him.

818
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,459
This gown is so precious

819
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:36,319
that you cannot wash it with water.

820
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,769
That's why I'm making him repay me.

821
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:42,330
If he cannot pay me,
then I will use him as my servant,

822
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,669
so what exactly is the problem?

823
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:46,100
It seems

824
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,240
as if you a respectable nobleman,

825
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:52,140
You at least have sharp eyes.

826
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,009
I am the Minister of Finance-

827
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:56,039
If you're of such a high rank,

828
00:51:56,039 --> 00:51:58,889
shouldn't you be more passionate?

829
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:01,060
You, woman,

830
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,109
I was going to let you go
because you were pretty,

831
00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:06,369
but how dare you raise your voice at me!

832
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:08,289
It is the same with your clothes.

833
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:10,399
As a high-ranking official of this country,

834
00:52:10,399 --> 00:52:13,820
you reject the superb material
made in our country

835
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,920
and only look for silk made in Ming,

836
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,819
what will the commoners think of you?

837
00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:22,150
What did you say? This woman!

838
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:23,319
What are you doing?

839
00:52:23,319 --> 00:52:25,749
Grab this woman and take her back!

840
00:52:25,749 --> 00:52:26,880
Yes!

841
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:28,749
Please let me go.

842
00:52:28,749 --> 00:52:31,060
- That brat!
- Please let go.

843
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,390
Catch those people

844
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,029
Catch them.

845
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,819
Catch him!

846
00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:41,270
Why!

847
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,120
<i>What is wrong?</i>

848
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,920
<i>King?</i>

849
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,949
What kind of child

850
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:11,419
has no fears?

851
00:53:11,419 --> 00:53:13,379
If you talk
to the Minister of Finance like that

852
00:53:13,379 --> 00:53:15,309
and get dragged to prison,

853
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:16,969
do you want to give up your life?

854
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:19,699
Then, even after seeing something
that was wrong,

855
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:21,789
should I have turned a blind eye to it?

856
00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:23,889
That child dirtied the clothes,

857
00:53:23,889 --> 00:53:25,709
he could ask him to pay him back for it.

858
00:53:25,709 --> 00:53:29,220
Do you know
how expensive the silk from Ming is?

859
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,000
The higher rank you are,

860
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,840
shouldn't you be more frugal?

861
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,510
That is true.

862
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:43,360
But,

863
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,849
because of the views from the outside,

864
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:47,829
don't you think we should show our status?

865
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:50,980
During the reign of Sejong,
a man named Yo Gwan,

866
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,519
who was a high ranked prime minister,

867
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:56,610
lived in a thatched house without a fence.

868
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:59,389
So King Sejong who pitied him

869
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:01,119
made him a wall.

870
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,910
Because he was a government official,

871
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,939
he could not decline the wall,

872
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:07,280
so he kept his front door open all the time.

873
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,350
What do you think were his intensions?

874
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,509
He was being frugal,

875
00:54:13,509 --> 00:54:16,720
so that others would follow his lead.

876
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,220
Why is it that you, a shaman,

877
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,820
keep saying things that are true

878
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:26,180
but unpleasant to the ears?

879
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,260
A sharp rock will be hit with a rock,

880
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,760
so if you continue to live like that,
you will be

881
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,410
How dare you look away when I am speaking!

882
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,380
[Puppet Show]

883
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,059
Now. Now. Now.

884
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,929
Instead of furtively looking,

885
00:54:57,929 --> 00:54:59,579
come and see the show for yourself.

886
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:02,509
Or you eyes will become slanted.

887
00:55:02,509 --> 00:55:05,239
It is a popular story
about the first love of a servant girl.

888
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:07,189
The first seats are available.

889
00:55:07,189 --> 00:55:08,419
How about it?

890
00:55:08,419 --> 00:55:10,630
You want to watch, right?

891
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:14,369
Sheesh, you're hesitating too much.

892
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:16,419
At this rate, you'll lose the seat.

893
00:55:16,419 --> 00:55:17,599
Come with me.

894
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,100
You won't regret it.

895
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,970
Get out of the way. Move. Move.

896
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,299
Here, what do you think?

897
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:33,400
You'll be able to see well, right?

898
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,820
Then,

899
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:36,630
5 nyang.

900
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:40,870
5 nyang.

901
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,219
Here you go.

902
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,730
Oh yes.

903
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:53,089
Altogether, 10 nyang. It's correct.

904
00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:55,850
Then, have a good time.

905
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:20,950
Although I didn't mean to,

906
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:23,130
I am indebted to you.

907
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,590
I'll repay you when we enter the palace,

908
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,370
so don't worry.

909
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:41,479
<i>I am a criminal.</i>

910
00:56:41,479 --> 00:56:43,479
<i>You mustn't do this.</i>

911
00:56:43,479 --> 00:56:47,100
<i>What crime have you committed?</i>

912
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,689
<i>I wasn't able to recognize His Highness,</i>

913
00:56:50,689 --> 00:56:52,829
<i>who is higher than the heavens right away,</i>

914
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:54,359
<i>but I fell in love with you.</i>

915
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:56,309
<i>This is my first crime.</i>

916
00:56:56,309 --> 00:56:58,659
<i>After I knew of your status,
I could not forget about you</i>

917
00:56:58,659 --> 00:57:00,429
<i>and I even entered palace.</i>

918
00:57:00,429 --> 00:57:02,829
<i>- That is my second crime.
- move your arm.</i>

919
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:03,739
<i>Move your head.</i>

920
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:05,509
<i>I can't see.</i>

921
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,890
<i>I can't see.
What are you doing?</i>

922
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,400
<i>...don't say anymore.</i>

923
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,990
<i>- I can't see.
- Don't say anymore.</i>

924
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,099
<i>Do you want to cut all ties with me...</i>

925
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:16,120
<i>- and break my heart?
- move your arm!</i>

926
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:20,189
- How could that be your fault alone?
- My god!

927
00:57:20,189 --> 00:57:21,739
Who do you think I am?

928
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:22,669
<i>What if you're a nobleman?</i>

929
00:57:22,669 --> 00:57:24,860
<i>You should let us watch the show!</i>

930
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,599
<i>Dong Ju... if I could,</i>

931
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:33,369
<i>if I could, I would give up everything.</i>

932
00:57:33,369 --> 00:57:35,849
<i>Why would His Highness say that?</i>

933
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:39,819
<i>Even if I am a king over many people,</i>

934
00:57:39,819 --> 00:57:43,800
<i>if I am unable to have you as my love,</i>

935
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:47,940
<i>what is the point of being king?</i>

936
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,790
<i>Your Highness</i>

937
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,389
<i>Your Highness I am sorry.</i>

938
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:55,259
You find this vulgar play fun?

939
00:57:55,259 --> 00:57:59,020
<i>- Your Highness, these words-
- Yes, it is fun.</i>

940
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:04,449
<i>I will remember you forever.</i>

941
00:58:04,449 --> 00:58:08,280
<i>Your Highness,
please take care of your health.</i>

942
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:13,180
<i>I wish you and the Queen
100 years of happiness.</i>

943
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,490
She's later than I thought.

944
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,770
Did you tell her the directions correctly?

945
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,920
<i>Third,</i>

946
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:24,580
<i>Stop.</i>

947
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,400
<i>Speak no more.</i>

948
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,830
That person

949
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:33,190
- have you met her?
- Are my feelings for you nothing?

950
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:37,360
<i>How is that
only your crime?</i>

951
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:38,660
Have you met her?

952
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:50,870
I wasn't able to meet her.

953
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,590
Why weren't you able to meet her?

954
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,200
Come here.

955
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,379
For the last time,

956
00:59:59,379 --> 01:00:01,039
I want to hug you.

957
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:01,789
Why,

958
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,199
Your Highness,

959
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,729
weren't you able to meet her?

960
01:00:04,729 --> 01:00:06,890
what are you doing?

961
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:08,580
That child is

962
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,319
<i>What kind of treacherous thing
are you doing?</i>

963
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:13,790
no longer in this world.

964
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:21,770
How did that...

965
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,020
It is my fault.

966
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:31,070
I tried to protect her,

967
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:35,440
but I was unable to do so.

968
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,320
There was so much I wanted to say to her,

969
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,940
but I was unable to say them.

970
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:48,710
That is why,

971
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,520
I am still

972
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,890
unable to let her go.

973
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,820
I heard that shamans

974
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,190
can communicate with the dead.

975
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,650
Is that true?

976
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,590
That is what I heard.

977
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:19,090
Then will you

978
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,640
tell that child something for me?

979
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:29,440
What do you want to tell her?

980
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,470
Tell her I really

981
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,700
really

982
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,680
liked her.

983
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:37,489
<i>Tonight, I</i>

984
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:40,409
<i>will not be able to protect
Your Highness's side.</i>

985
01:02:40,409 --> 01:02:43,069
<i>Other people looking affectionately at you,</i>

986
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:44,979
<i>I cannot take it any longer.</i>

987
01:02:44,979 --> 01:02:46,639
Can't it be me?

988
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:48,539
Can't it be me?

989
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:50,849
<i>The person that I am looking at is</i>

990
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:52,010
<i>you.</i>

991
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:54,359
<i>Who said you can leave the palace?</i>

992
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,279
<i>Who did you receive permission from?</i>

993
01:02:56,279 --> 01:02:57,969
<i>Who says you completed your work?</i>

994
01:02:57,969 --> 01:02:59,159
<i>I am confused.</i>

995
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:03,170
<i>Until I figure out what these feelings are,
don't you dare</i>

996
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,919
<i>leave my side.</i>
