1
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,230
Mul...! Mul...! It's a Mul Goe!

2
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,490
-=Mul Goe - An object possessed by a spirit=-

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,620
Quickly, take the Mul Goe away. Quickly.

4
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,640
Your Highness.

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>Can it be... that we shall meet again?</i>

6
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,060
Can it be...
that someone sent an assassin here?

7
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,020
Problem solving stone.

8
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,490
<i>What is troubling you that you are unable to sleep?</i>

9
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,940
<i>Try talking to this stone and see.</i>

10
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,340
<i>This is a problem solving stone.</i>

11
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,340
<i>It can solve hundreds of worries.</i>

12
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,740
<i>It will take away all your problems.</i>

13
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,040
<i>You should be able to sleep well now.</i>

14
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,740
<i>This is a gift from my travels.</i>

15
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,540
He went travelling again?

16
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,140
This person, really...

17
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,440
Haven't I made myself clear?

18
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,340
Your skills are truly extraordinary.

19
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,840
I really don't have any talent for sword-fighting.

20
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
I have been practicing for several
years without much improvement.

21
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,440
Are you all right, Young Master?

22
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,940
Can you not call me "Young Master"?

23
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,140
I've already said this several times,
yet you keep on doing so.

24
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,640
Anyway, how come Prince Yang Myeong isn't here yet?

25
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,240
I've planned this meeting ahead of time,
yet he's still over an hour late.

26
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,840
When Prince Yang Myeong was still here,
there was never a peaceful day.

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,940
Now, it's just the two of us
and it's really a bit lonely.

28
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,040
If I had known you would miss me like this,

29
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,940
I would have not gone on these trips.

30
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,340
Prince Yang Myeong.

31
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,040
My dear Heo Yeom!

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,740
Congratulations on passing
the Civil Service Exams.

33
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,340
Prince Yang Myeong.

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,640
Gim Je Un.

35
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,040
Not adorable at all.

36
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,240
Je Un,

37
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm only half congratulating you.

38
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,240
Did you have a fun trip?

39
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,640
It was more than fun.

40
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,240
Just for you two, my dear friends,

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,640
I've had some delicious side dishes prepared.

42
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,840
Let's enjoy a drink under the moon.

43
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,240
Let's go.

44
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,940
Come. Drink.

45
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,240
You didn't show up on time,
so we had to wait for you.

46
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,740
I went to see someone I care about,
so I was a bit late.

47
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,640
Forgive me.

48
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,840
I have someone I adore more than you.

49
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,240
In such a short time,
you have someone in your heart?

50
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,640
How come I've never heard you mention it?

51
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,240
You didn't climb over a wall again, did you?

52
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,140
Hey, what are you saying?

53
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,240
I am of royal blood.

54
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,640
How could I possibly climb
over a wall to see a woman?

55
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,840
Not to mention the fact that she's your dongsaeng.
How could I?
(Dongsaeng - younger brother or sister)

56
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,440
Even though my sister is young,
males and females are still different.

57
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,740
Last time when you saw her,
weren't you severely scolded?

58
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,340
Being scolded like that,
how could you dare to see her--

59
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,540
I know. I know.

60
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,040
I understand perfectly,
so don't talk about it anymore.

61
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,840
You really talk too much.

62
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,040
When I want to see her,
just let me see her.

63
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,440
That way, I won't get scolded or lose face.

64
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,640
Whenever your sister is mentioned,

65
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,240
your face darkens and you lower your voice.
Really...

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,540
Prince Yang Myeong.

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,440
Did you just smile?

68
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,140
You saw it too, right?
This ice cube knows how to smile.

69
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,340
It's a phenomenon you only see once in a lifetime.

70
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,340
You agree, right?

71
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,740
From now on, if you scale
the wall and snoop around,

72
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,640
I won't just stand by and watch.

73
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,840
I already said I know.

74
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,240
Other than this,

75
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
I've prepared special gifts for you two.

76
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,440
They're talismans that grant
you good luck for the future.

77
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,040
They're called Mystic Stones.
Have you heard of them?

78
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,540
Seeing this stone is like seeing me.
You must definitely carry it with you.

79
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,640
It's a little bit heavy to be carried on oneself.

80
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,040
Is that so?

81
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,140
If stone #2 is too heavy,

82
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
I will exchange it with stone #4 for you.

83
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,440
In the future, you both will be
the Crown Prince's people.

84
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,540
What's wrong with this atmosphere?

85
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,940
Come, come, come.

86
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,640
Once you take your positions, we won't be
able to get together and drink like this again.

87
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,140
Tonight, we're not going home
until we're senselessly drunk.

88
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,540
Come on.

89
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,140
<i>The newly edited Vice Minister official list.</i>

90
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,340
Is this the Sam Mang?
-=Sam Mang - A recommendation of 3
names and His Majesty chooses 1=-

91
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,940
Yes, including Seol.
-=Sam Mang - A recommendation of 3
names and His Majesty chooses 1=-

92
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,240
They all have been chosen from Sigangwon
after great discussion from the grand masters.

93
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,840
The most outstanding of candidates.

94
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,540
Your Highness, according to your wishes,

95
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,440
I inquired about which junior officers
have been appointed as candidates for Vice Minister.

96
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,840
Okay, who has been appointed?

97
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,740
Although I don't know who has been chosen,

98
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:12,840
I went through great pains and managed
to acquire the Sam Mang list.

99
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,340
First, let's talk about the candidates for the Crown Prince's
first tutor: Yun Seong Cheol, Yun Dae Ho, Gim Gye Ju.

100
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,339
Pil Seon's candidates are Bak Ji Hong,
Yun Pil Hyeon and Jeong Min.

101
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:28,839
Literary candidates are Yun Si Won,
Choe Byeong Hun, Choe Chi Su.

102
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,639
You already knew this?

103
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,839
You consider this as information?

104
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,839
It looks like my grandmother
put in a lot of effort.

105
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,839
No, the one who put in effort is probably Yun Dae Hyeong.

106
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,539
What else? This was all you could discover?

107
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:50,639
Starting from today, there'll be a
new person assigned for literacy.

108
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,739
But as for who it is, I...

109
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:55,739
It doesn't matter who he is.

110
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:59,339
Eight or nine out of ten are sly and
shrewd people, who are only here for power.

111
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,739
You can't mean that you'll
make him lose his position.

112
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:08,439
I can't participate in politics yet,
so what power do I have?

113
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:09,539
Could it be that...

114
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:12,839
I only have one choice.

115
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,339
Make him retreat on his own.

116
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,239
Your Highness.

117
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:23,539
Then let us wait and see how long
this new literature teacher will last.

118
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,439
Your Highness.

119
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:40,639
How long will this one last?

120
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,039
Within a month he'll give up
and resign from his position.

121
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,239
I bet on my 3 foot long accessory.

122
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:12,139
Omo.
(Omo - oh my)

123
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,939
Your Highness.

124
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:20,839
The literature teacher has arrived.

125
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,639
I was ordered to take over the
literature position. I, Heo Yeom,

126
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,139
am meeting Crown Prince for the first time.

127
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,739
<i>Orabeoni, has gone to Crown Prince's Sigangwon?</i>
(Orabeoni - older brother)

128
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:20,739
Then, will orabeoni become
the Crown Prince's teacher?

129
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:26,739
Since he has become Sigangwon's
literature scholar, then that is only natural.

130
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,039
Yeon U, are you hurt?

131
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,839
I am all right.

132
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,339
My mind was elsewhere just now.

133
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,439
This child...
What was your little mind thinking of?

134
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,639
You can read all those complicated books so quickly,

135
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,939
yet you can't finish your embroidering.

136
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:54,939
Could it be that he knows I'm Orabeoni's dongsaeng?

137
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:57,939
What are you mumbling about?

138
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,539
It's nothing.

139
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:09,339
<i>I'm here to participate in the ceremony of
my orabeoni getting the top literacy scholar.</i>

140
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,739
Your Highness.

141
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,439
Please pay your respects to your teacher.

142
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:24,739
This year... how old are you?

143
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:27,339
I am already past the Jihak by 2 years.
-=Jihak: 15 years old=-

144
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:31,739
Then... you are only 17 years old.

145
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:34,139
That's right.

146
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:39,739
Your highness, please bow to the teacher.

147
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:47,139
With such a young age, it seems like the person
backing you must have a lot of power.

148
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,439
<i>Heo Yeom? Did you say Heo Yeom?</i>

149
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:58,839
How many openings are there in Sigangwon

150
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,839
that you can't even place an informer in there?
-=Minister of Personnel Yun Dae Hyeong=-

151
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,839
You're just going to let him sit in the literature position?
-=Queen Dowager, Yun Clan=-

152
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,739
Are you unaware of the importance of that position?

153
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:12,039
Or were my words like wind passing your ear?

154
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:18,139
Heo Yeom will not be able to control the Crown Prince's temper.

155
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,839
Before long, he will bow out by himself.

156
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,239
Have I not told you before?
Who is he?

157
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:31,339
It's the son of His Majesty's most trusted,
Chief Scholar of Office of Special Advisors.

158
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:34,639
Can it be that you still cannot see
His Majesty's intentions?

159
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,839
The current official appointment indicates
the King's intent to curb the royal clan's power.

160
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,639
His Majesty has already
started forming his power.

161
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,839
Don't make him an official first.

162
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:04,339
First bring him under you, then slowly make him an official.
Then over time, he will treat you as the King.

163
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:10,239
Moreover, he will be an official who is also your teacher.

164
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:15,339
Good. Very good.

165
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,739
<i>Seventeen years old!
Only seventeen years old?</i>

166
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:26,239
How could Abamama send such a child?
(Abamama - used by Prince when calling his father)

167
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:32,239
Your Highness, I've obtained more
information regarding Heo Yeom.

168
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,939
He is this year's top literary scholar.

169
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,639
Forget it. Has your information ever been accurate?

170
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,739
This time, it's definitely correct.

171
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:44,839
When he was a scholar at Sungkyunkwan,
his fame was already widespread.
(Sungkyunkwan - the top school of the time period)

172
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:47,939
If you want appearance, he has appearance.
If you want knowledge, he has knowledge.

173
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:52,039
If you want kindness, he has kindness.
He does not have any single flaw.

174
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,439
He's truly an idol of scholars!

175
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:02,939
<i>Is there any empty seat?</i>

176
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:04,939
<i>- Sit here.
- Please sit here.</i>

177
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:07,139
<i>Not to mention the Principal of Sungkyunkwan.</i>

178
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:12,439
<i>He has been praised by all the Confucian scholars.</i>

179
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,439
<i>Regardless of their gender, age, and social status,</i>

180
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:24,139
<i>everyone thinks of him as an idol.</i>

181
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:28,139
<i>He's also known as the fascination of the scholars.</i>

182
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:33,039
<i>Are you the Heo Yeom that made Eun Hyang
from the brothel fascinated?</i>

183
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,439
<i>Today, I must punish...</i>

184
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,539
<i>Especially to people that annoy him.</i>

185
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,339
<i>Let's be friends.</i>

186
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,839
<i>They will be filled with admiration
from his appearance and kindness.</i>

187
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,539
<i>He'll actually want to be his friend.</i>

188
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:48,739
Not only that,

189
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,939
literature, politics, history, astronomy
and other miscellaneous subjects,

190
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:57,239
he understands everything, is skilled in everything.
In short,

191
00:15:57,239 --> 00:16:01,439
the super-genius scholar.

192
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:04,839
Shut your mouth! Shut your mouth!
Just shut your mouth for me!

193
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:09,739
I don't want to see you anymore.
Turn your back to me.

194
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,739
Orabeoni, it's Yeon U.

195
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:35,539
Oh, okay. Come in.

196
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,138
Is it already time for us to read?

197
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:54,039
Let me see, what should we read today?

198
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,638
Records of the Grand Historian
or New Account of the Tales of the World?

199
00:16:57,638 --> 00:17:02,138
Orabeoni, your face is full of worry.

200
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:05,239
You saw through it?

201
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:10,439
Did something happen in the palace?

202
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:16,339
Or did His Highness create trouble for you?

203
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,539
No, it's not like that.

204
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,039
His Highness issued me a challenge.

205
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,039
What is it? Please tell me.

206
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,939
Maybe I can help.

207
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:32,139
Are you willing to help me?

208
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,839
It appears that the Crown Prince
has greatly misunderstood me.

209
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,839
I really do not know how to open
the tightly closed door to the Crown Prince's heart.

210
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,139
A misunderstanding?

211
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:49,439
Of course, it's not just a misunderstanding.

212
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:52,239
The feelings of accepting someone so young as a teacher,

213
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,439
I can understand.

214
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,339
It's not because of Orabeoni.

215
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,839
It's because of...

216
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:04,239
<i>It's possibly because of me.</i>

217
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:07,439
It's all my fault, letting you worry.

218
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:11,639
Do not worry. A boat approaching the bridge
will naturally straighten itself.

219
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,439
What?

220
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:20,739
Orabeoni... You want to win Crown Prince's heart, right?

221
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:23,239
Do you have a good idea?

222
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:58,839
Today's subject will just end here, then.

223
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:08,539
What a shameless fellow.

224
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:15,839
You don't teach anything,
but keep receiving an official's salary.

225
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,639
Is this not called being shameless?

226
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:19,139
It is because this subject feels that Your Highness...

227
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:24,739
is still not ready to learn.

228
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:28,239
So in place of today's lesson,

229
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:32,639
may this humble subject present you a riddle?

230
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,039
You said a riddle?

231
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,439
Correct. If Your Highness guesses correctly,

232
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:41,939
then I'll go according to Your Highness's
wish and hand over the literature position.

233
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:46,639
But if Your Highness can't
figure out the answer...

234
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:48,239
If I can't figure it out?

235
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,639
Please do the apprentice ceremony to me,

236
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,839
and use a positive attitude when learning.

237
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,039
Do you want to make a deal with me?

238
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,739
Very well. Speak.

239
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:04,239
Since you've ordered it, then I'll ask.

240
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:07,939
Can cause all living things in the
world to become bright in a moment,

241
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,639
and can cause all living things in the
world to become dark in a moment.

242
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,239
What is it?

243
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:17,439
This is too easy.

244
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:19,539
I'm afraid it's not so simple.

245
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:22,239
That's just your thinking.

246
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:27,239
I hope to hear Your Highness's answer
at our next lesson.

247
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:32,639
At the same time,
I won't have to see you ever again.

248
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,639
Aren't they eunuchs from the Crown Prince's palace?

249
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,239
But why are they taking books from the library?

250
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,439
Are they moving it all to the Crown Prince's palace?

251
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:54,839
Her Majesty Jung Jeong is
waiting for you, Princess.

252
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,339
Princess, didn't you have to go to Jung palace?

253
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:18,739
You finally can't listen to Abamama's nagging,

254
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:21,639
so you're starting to be
enthusiastic on your studies?

255
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:30,639
There are so many books,
when will you finish reading them?

256
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,839
Min Hwa, I don't have time to play with you.

257
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,639
Don't bother me and go back.

258
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:39,039
Crown Prince, what is all this about?

259
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,939
Why are you standing here like this?

260
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,639
The reason why I'm standing here like this,

261
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:54,339
is because of the Crown Prince's order.

262
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:58,039
His Highness is trying to solve Sigangwon's riddle.

263
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,739
Riddle? Then what is the riddle?

264
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:02,839
I already told you to go back.

265
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:08,139
Tell me, what is this riddle?

266
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:17,139
Can cause all living things in the
world to become bright in a moment.

267
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:23,439
And can cause all living things in the
world to become dark in a moment, what is it?

268
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:31,139
Isn't that eyelids?

269
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:32,639
Look carefully.

270
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:34,839
If you close your eyes like this,

271
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,339
then the whole world will be dark.

272
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,339
If you open your eyes like this,

273
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:42,039
then the whole world will be bright.

274
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,739
Your way of thinking is too simple.

275
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,839
That's why I don't talk to you.

276
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:54,339
You're hindering my studies, quickly leave.

277
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:09,239
The correct answer is the monarch's politics.

278
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,439
As the Doctrine of the Mean have said, "Let the states
of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection,

279
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:17,939
and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth,
and all things will be nourished and flourish."

280
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,739
Your... Your Majesty.

281
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:34,939
So a monarch should govern the country
with sincerity and morality.

282
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:38,139
It should ensure the harmony and equilibrium in all living things.

283
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:41,439
In other words, people's lives will
have a bright future ahead,

284
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:45,739
and on the other hand, people's
lives can turn dark and lightless.

285
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:49,839
So correct answer is the monarch's politics.

286
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,839
I'm very sorry.

287
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,239
The answer is not the same as mine.

288
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:00,339
What... did you say?

289
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:03,739
Isn't it the correct answer?

290
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:05,339
Exactly.

291
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,139
Then, what is the correct answer?

292
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:14,739
The answer is...

293
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:26,839
eyelids.

294
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,439
Are you currently making fun of me?

295
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:40,339
If Your Highness is not satisfied
with the correct answer,

296
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,039
then will it become a joke?

297
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,939
What... What did you say?

298
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:47,539
Not being able to find the answer
in the books to the question,

299
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:49,139
do you think it's a low level thing?

300
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:51,939
So, if that's a joke...

301
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:53,439
it is the real answer?

302
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,939
From a child's point of view,

303
00:24:55,139 --> 00:24:58,339
all living things in the world
can become a question,

304
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:01,538
and all living things in the
world can become it's answer.

305
00:25:02,638 --> 00:25:05,638
In the process of learning, there are two
important points that have to be remembered.

306
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:10,338
One point, is the arrogance of
knowing the correct answer.

307
00:25:10,338 --> 00:25:11,838
The other point is,

308
00:25:12,438 --> 00:25:16,238
your prejudice in using your
own norm to determine things.

309
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:19,138
This arrogance and prejudice,

310
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:23,238
will cover Your Highness's eyes
and mind with darkness.

311
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:26,038
You should be understanding instead.

312
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:28,838
-=Office of Special Advisors,
Chief Scholar, Heo Yeong Jae=-

313
00:25:28,838 --> 00:25:31,238
Thank you for your graciousness,
Your Majesty.

314
00:25:33,438 --> 00:25:36,138
You talked about the monarch politics, right?

315
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:38,538
What you said is right.

316
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,938
But if the eyelids are closed,

317
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:44,838
how will you observe the lives of the people?

318
00:25:45,338 --> 00:25:48,438
How will you talk about the road of the king?

319
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:54,038
First of all, please correct your attitude in learning.

320
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:08,438
Someone, get in here!

321
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:10,738
Yes, Your Highness.

322
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:22,438
Yes, Your Highness. Please give your orders.

323
00:26:22,438 --> 00:26:26,238
Tell the fruit room to prepare some light refreshments.

324
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:27,038
What?

325
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,838
Why the light refreshments...

326
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:36,238
After I finish studying,

327
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:39,038
I want to have a chat with teacher,

328
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:41,438
to enhance a teacher and
a student's relationship.

329
00:26:41,938 --> 00:26:43,038
What?

330
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:45,638
But...

331
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,038
Your Highness.

332
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,238
Today I pay my respects to you as Great Tutor

333
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,238
to seek your teachings.

334
00:26:57,238 --> 00:26:58,938
Please forget my rudeness
during this period of time,

335
00:26:58,938 --> 00:27:02,238
and accept my respect.

336
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:26,838
It looks like Crown Prince has
finally met a decent teacher.

337
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:42,238
In other words, orabeoni,

338
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:45,338
that great Crown Prince, His Highness,

339
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:49,638
he actually raised a white flag to
a Sigangwon Literature teacher?

340
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:54,738
Princess, you're laughing too loudly.

341
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:57,438
Please lower your voice...

342
00:27:57,438 --> 00:28:00,338
That's a really interesting fellow.

343
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:05,738
I have to see his face.

344
00:28:05,738 --> 00:28:07,938
And reward him some things.

345
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:10,838
Princess, could it be that you're
planning to find literature teacher Heo?

346
00:28:10,838 --> 00:28:16,738
I also have to tell him that I guessed
correctly to his difficult question.

347
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:19,638
Princess.

348
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,038
Princess.

349
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,638
Princess. Princess...

350
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:36,438
Princess. Princess...

351
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:26,238
There's something that I'm
particularly curious about.

352
00:29:26,238 --> 00:29:27,638
Please ask.

353
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:30,738
If I answered correctly,

354
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:33,138
did you really plan to hand over
the literature position?

355
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,638
How inconsiderate of you,

356
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:37,438
I thought that you were a pedant.

357
00:29:37,438 --> 00:29:39,638
So it turns out that you had such a strong side.

358
00:29:39,638 --> 00:29:43,938
Actually, it's my dongsaeng who
gave me the courage.

359
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:46,338
<i>If you were all humble,</i>

360
00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:48,838
<i>His Highness will probably be even unwilling to learn.</i>

361
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:52,038
<i>So even if His Highness
Crown Prince's learning attitude,</i>

362
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:54,138
is a bit willful and unfettered,

363
00:29:54,138 --> 00:29:57,438
<i>it'll also do with having a suitable issued Tongjasaeng.-</i>
-=Tongjasaeng - A transcript with the highest mark=

364
00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:01,238
<i>So there's such a simple method.</i>

365
00:30:01,238 --> 00:30:05,338
<i>But if you depend on flattery to get
his heart, how long will it last?</i>

366
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:09,438
<i>What you get isn't sincerity,
would it be useful?</i>

367
00:30:10,338 --> 00:30:12,138
<i>That sentence is reasonable.</i>

368
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:16,638
<i>It is easy to be a treacherous official,</i>

369
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:21,938
<i>but the first thing to consider is which
road is the best for Crown Prince.</i>

370
00:30:21,938 --> 00:30:25,038
<i>By being a treacherous official
you'll get a hypocritical heart,</i>

371
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:27,638
<i>then you might as well be a loyal
official and reason earnestly.</i>

372
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:29,538
<i>Is that the meaning?</i>

373
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:33,138
<i>Crown Prince is a wise person.</i>

374
00:30:33,138 --> 00:30:35,738
<i>Although he's currently misunderstanding orabeoni,</i>

375
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:39,738
<i>but he'll understand orabeoni's loyalty one day.</i>

376
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,338
<i>So you have to work hard, orabeoni.</i>

377
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:48,338
She's a really clever girl.

378
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,838
How old is your dongsaeng this year?

379
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:53,138
13 years old.

380
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:55,738
13 years old?

381
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:59,938
Then, do you share your
problems with your dongsaeng?

382
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:03,638
Your Highness, the tea is going cold.

383
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:07,138
Before the tea fragrant disperses,
please have a taste.

384
00:31:07,138 --> 00:31:08,938
Okay.

385
00:31:09,438 --> 00:31:12,338
Literature teacher Heo,
you should taste the tea too.

386
00:31:18,338 --> 00:31:23,138
Then the person who blamed me
today isn't literature teacher Heo,

387
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:25,238
but literature teacher Heo's dongsaeng.

388
00:31:25,238 --> 00:31:27,438
You can say that...

389
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:31,238
Then the right to taste such a precious barley sugar,

390
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:33,338
is with your dongsaeng.

391
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:35,538
What?

392
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:37,038
Yes, Your Highness.

393
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:39,538
Wrap up all these barley sugar.

394
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:42,338
I want to give it to my hidden teacher,

395
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:44,938
and not to literature teacher Heo.

396
00:31:55,738 --> 00:31:56,838
Hyeong Seon.

397
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:58,438
Yes, Your Highness.

398
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,738
For a girl of only 13 years old,

399
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:02,738
to actually say such smart things,

400
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:03,938
do you believe it?

401
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:07,238
If it's literature teacher Heo's dongsaeng,
I believe it is possible.

402
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:08,438
Literature teacher Heo is also

403
00:32:08,438 --> 00:32:11,538
barely 17 years old and has become
the top scholar and is an outstanding...

404
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:13,138
What did you just say?

405
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:16,538
Is literature teacher Heo
the top scorer on the imperial exam?

406
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:18,838
When... when did he pass the imperial exam?

407
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:21,738
This... this time, in literature.

408
00:32:22,438 --> 00:32:25,638
<i>I'm here to participate in the ceremony of</i>

409
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:28,838
<i>my orabeoni getting the top literacy scholar.</i>

410
00:32:30,138 --> 00:32:32,338
Why did you just tell me now? Why?

411
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:36,338
When I came to tell you last time,

412
00:32:36,338 --> 00:32:38,238
but it was Your Highness who told me to shut up,

413
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:42,938
saying "Your reports are not reliable,
immediately be quiet..."

414
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:56,338
Crown Prince?

415
00:32:56,338 --> 00:32:59,838
Yes, he said that it's a substitute
of Soksu for giving it to you.

416
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:00,738
-=Soksu - A dedicated gift for the teacher=-

417
00:33:00,738 --> 00:33:04,338
If it's a Soksu, wouldn't it for orabeoni?

418
00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:06,138
Why are you giving it to me?

419
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:07,738
About that...

420
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:11,238
I told His Highness, the person who made me muster
up my courage and reason earnestly towards His Highness...

421
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:13,538
that it was you.

422
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:14,938
What?

423
00:33:19,738 --> 00:33:21,938
What was his reaction?

424
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:26,138
He said the real teacher isn't me
but you who personally prepared it.

425
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:29,038
Did he say anything else?

426
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,238
That... Nothing out of the ordinary...

427
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:37,338
He asked me if the riddle was also your idea.

428
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:39,238
A riddle?

429
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:41,038
Yes.

430
00:33:41,538 --> 00:33:44,638
Actually, I gave His Highness a riddle.

431
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:47,238
Ah... yes...

432
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:53,237
But... why were you agitated earlier?

433
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:54,538
What?

434
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:58,838
It's nothing.

435
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:39,938
Did you solve the riddle that I gave you?

436
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:48,738
Are you really... the Crown Prince?

437
00:34:50,738 --> 00:34:52,538
Who knows...

438
00:34:54,438 --> 00:34:56,538
What do you think?

439
00:34:56,538 --> 00:35:01,538
I hope that you aren't.

440
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:08,238
Have a taste.

441
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:25,038
How's the taste?

442
00:35:25,038 --> 00:35:27,538
It's very sweet.

443
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:32,438
The meaning of giving me this is...

444
00:35:33,638 --> 00:35:36,738
Have you forgiven me?

445
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:46,838
Or are you threatening me?

446
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:52,738
Please tell me.

447
00:35:53,538 --> 00:35:55,738
What exactly does this mean?

448
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:20,038
He can't ignore ministers' merit like this.

449
00:36:20,038 --> 00:36:24,538
Who was the one that saved His Majesty from
the hands of rebellious subjects in the past?

450
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:29,838
For His Majesty to be able to sit on
the throne now, who's credit was it?

451
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,338
Doesn't all the credit,

452
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:35,338
belong to Queen Dowager
and Minister of Personnel?

453
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:39,038
Isn't this holding a Goemaengchae to Saphyeol?
-=Goemaengchae - A unity meeting for Ministers who
have done a meritorious service to the court.=-

454
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:42,838
He shouldn't of have excluded the Ministers who
have done a meritorious service in the royal court.
-=Saphyeol - An ancient form of swearing an oath=-

455
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:44,338
If it was going by precedent then Minister of Personnel,

456
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:48,538
would be in the leading position a lot earlier, right?

457
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:52,838
Heo Yeong Jae, must be gotten rid of first.

458
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,638
After he became the Chief Scholar
the 3 departments have united.

459
00:36:56,738 --> 00:36:59,638
The supervisors have starting doing things.

460
00:36:59,738 --> 00:37:04,238
Petitions slandering the ministers of merit
are continuously being sent to the palace.

461
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:06,438
It makes sense for His Majesty to be swayed.

462
00:37:06,438 --> 00:37:09,338
That's right, during the change
of people in Sigangwon,

463
00:37:09,338 --> 00:37:11,638
the meaning of his son being promoted is,

464
00:37:11,638 --> 00:37:16,938
that His Majesty will use him
heavily in the future, right?

465
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:18,638
If preventative measures aren't
immediately done, I'm afraid...

466
00:37:18,638 --> 00:37:25,038
If preventative measures are done,
I'm afraid we'll see blood, right?

467
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:29,338
Then is there an even better method?

468
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:32,438
When one position is obtained,

469
00:37:32,438 --> 00:37:35,938
the other position will be easily yours too.

470
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:39,738
Don't be anxious.

471
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:57,838
You're home, Father.

472
00:37:58,338 --> 00:38:01,138
Why did you drink so much?

473
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:03,938
Hurry and send us a cup of honey water.

474
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:05,738
Let's go inside.

475
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,238
You...

476
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:16,338
Do you want to see the royal palace?

477
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:17,438
What?

478
00:38:17,438 --> 00:38:22,938
If you want to, I can let you live there.

479
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:29,038
Father of the Queen... Father of the Queen.

480
00:38:57,638 --> 00:38:59,938
Why are you suddenly looking
at letter paper, agassi?
(Agassi - young lady)

481
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:01,538
Do you want to write a letter?

482
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:05,538
It's not a letter, but a reflection of fault.

483
00:39:05,538 --> 00:39:06,438
What?

484
00:39:06,438 --> 00:39:09,938
What type of reflection of fault
uses such expensive paper?

485
00:39:09,938 --> 00:39:13,738
Wouldn't it be all right as long as you go and
find him, and beg for forgiveness?

486
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:17,138
He isn't a person that can be seen easily.

487
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:21,038
Is he to the extent of His Majesty or Crown Prince?

488
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:26,438
Just say it with words to beg for forgiveness then or
get hit a few times so he can vent his anger.

489
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:29,538
It doesn't matter if I get hit.

490
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:33,438
I'm just afraid it'll cause some trouble for orabeoni.

491
00:39:40,038 --> 00:39:41,938
I'm sorry, agassi.

492
00:39:41,938 --> 00:39:44,438
I'm going to the blacksmith
for a bit, I'll be back in a moment.

493
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:46,438
Just for a moment.

494
00:39:55,738 --> 00:40:00,338
Did you really make some
mistake towards those two?

495
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:21,338
Agassi...  Agassi!

496
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:22,938
Don't you have eyes?

497
00:40:23,038 --> 00:40:24,838
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

498
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:27,238
Are you all right, agassi?

499
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:30,038
Take your dirty hands away.

500
00:40:31,938 --> 00:40:35,438
Forget it, wet nurse,
this child didn't do it deliberately.

501
00:40:35,438 --> 00:40:38,038
Looks like you have urgent matters.

502
00:40:38,038 --> 00:40:41,038
I am all right.
You can go settle your matters.

503
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,738
Thank you. Agassi, thank you.

504
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:57,838
We are here to take the
jewelry that we agreed before.

505
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:00,038
Yes. Please wait a moment.

506
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:10,538
What's wrong, wet nurse?

507
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:12,638
How come it's not here?

508
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:18,038
Agassi, please wait here for a moment.

509
00:41:52,937 --> 00:41:54,537
It's dangerous here,
move a bit further away.

510
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:57,537
Ajussi. Other than sickles, hoes, and plows,
(Ajussi - older man, uncle)

511
00:41:57,637 --> 00:41:58,737
don't you sell swords?

512
00:41:58,737 --> 00:42:00,737
The kind that warriors use.

513
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:07,437
How come it's like this?

514
00:42:07,537 --> 00:42:08,937
It's obvious.

515
00:42:08,937 --> 00:42:10,337
Hurry, hand over the purse.

516
00:42:10,337 --> 00:42:11,637
What purse?

517
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,737
Do you think I don't know?

518
00:42:13,737 --> 00:42:15,937
You purposely bump into people,

519
00:42:15,937 --> 00:42:17,237
and then pretend to dust
the dust off the clothes,

520
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:18,837
to take away the purse, isn't it?

521
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:20,437
I really didn't steal it.

522
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,437
You little wench!

523
00:42:22,437 --> 00:42:25,437
Will you only hand it over after giving your face a Cheokja?
-=Cheokja - Giving a tattoo on the body of the thief
according to the crime committed=-

524
00:42:25,437 --> 00:42:27,737
Where is the money?
Where did you hide it?

525
00:42:27,737 --> 00:42:28,837
I really didn't steal it.

526
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,137
Really, it's not me who stole it.

527
00:42:30,137 --> 00:42:32,437
That's enough. Stop it, wet nurse.

528
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:34,137
Agassi.

529
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:38,237
There are many people watching.
What are you doing?

530
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:43,037
Believe me, Agassi.
I really didn't steal it.

531
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:46,437
Is that so?
You're saying that you are innocent, right?

532
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:48,237
Yes.

533
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:50,337
Then,

534
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,437
give some proofs,

535
00:42:55,937 --> 00:42:58,937
that you're not a thief.

536
00:43:02,837 --> 00:43:04,937
Forget about that letter paper.

537
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:07,537
Since it's a reflection of fault, why are you
using a letter paper with patterns on it?

538
00:43:07,537 --> 00:43:09,737
Since you're writing a letter for
His Majesty, then you might as well,

539
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:12,637
use a letter paper that has the
4 noblemen drawn on it, it'll be better.

540
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:15,437
I already said that it's not for His Majesty.

541
00:43:15,437 --> 00:43:18,537
Then is it for the Crown Prince?

542
00:43:20,337 --> 00:43:23,337
Looks like it is for the Crown Prince.

543
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:25,237
Then, that'll be even better.

544
00:43:25,237 --> 00:43:28,037
I am the Crown Prince's brother.

545
00:43:28,537 --> 00:43:31,637
Let's see which one Crown Prince will like...

546
00:43:31,637 --> 00:43:33,137
But...

547
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:34,037
What exactly that you did wrong?

548
00:43:34,037 --> 00:43:36,437
That you have to write a reflection of fault?

549
00:44:25,337 --> 00:44:27,837
Isn't this a greenhouse?

550
00:44:28,437 --> 00:44:30,237
You already knew.

551
00:44:30,237 --> 00:44:31,537
I've only seen it in the books.

552
00:44:31,537 --> 00:44:33,637
This is my first time seeing it.

553
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:37,937
This window uses oil paper,

554
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:41,737
So that light can seep in and block the wind.

555
00:44:44,837 --> 00:44:47,237
Did you do it all yourself?

556
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:53,537
There's a saying by an art fanatic that goes,

557
00:44:53,537 --> 00:44:55,437
since I can't take up an official post,

558
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:57,937
why should I go to Jong Hakdang?

559
00:44:57,937 --> 00:45:01,537
Afterwards, he spent some money
and made this greenhouse.

560
00:45:02,337 --> 00:45:05,237
<i>Also for hyeongnim to live have to like that,</i>
(Hyeongnim - respected older brother)

561
00:45:05,237 --> 00:45:07,237
<i>it's all because of me.</i>

562
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,637
<i>He's probably afraid of getting blamed by father,</i>

563
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:13,137
<i>so hyeongnim hasn't come and
looked for me in a while.</i>

564
00:45:15,437 --> 00:45:19,437
Thanks to his good fortune,
I occasionally borrow this house.

565
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:23,137
This isn't a bad place to dry wet clothes, right?

566
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:28,337
I heard that Prince Yang Myeong hasn't
been to Jong Hakdang in a while too.

567
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:32,937
Look, how is it?

568
00:45:32,937 --> 00:45:37,037
His Majesty really likes this type of chrysanthemum.

569
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:39,837
So every time when there's
a banquet this will be used.

570
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,937
If it's like that, this can
replace the reflection of fault.

571
00:45:42,937 --> 00:45:48,537
What type of person is His Majesty?

572
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:52,537
I really want to know
what type of person he is.

573
00:45:52,537 --> 00:45:56,537
I wonder.

574
00:45:57,737 --> 00:46:01,037
How should I say it?

575
00:46:01,437 --> 00:46:08,737
Your Royal Highness is a person who is knowledgeable
and able to perceive things well at all times.

576
00:46:08,737 --> 00:46:14,937
He always thinks of the
commoners and the country.

577
00:46:16,537 --> 00:46:18,637
<i>You really don't know shame.</i>

578
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:20,737
<i>For a royal illegitimate son like you,</i>

579
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:26,037
<i>on what basis do you have
to learn the road of a king?</i>

580
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:31,637
Although he was extremely strict,

581
00:46:31,637 --> 00:46:35,237
but he also had an extremely loving side.

582
00:46:35,237 --> 00:46:38,637
<i>The Crown Prince has arrived.</i>

583
00:46:42,637 --> 00:46:45,937
<i>I heard that you have learnt a lot
knowledge in a short period of time.</i>

584
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:52,337
<i>I must reward the officials who have
taught the Crown Prince very well.</i>

585
00:47:00,637 --> 00:47:05,137
Generally speaking, he's extremely outstanding.

586
00:47:09,337 --> 00:47:13,337
Aren't you going to have a look at the palace?

587
00:47:13,337 --> 00:47:18,637
I heard that since you've came back from travelling,
you've just been staying at home.

588
00:47:18,637 --> 00:47:20,037
Did Yeom ask you to ask?

589
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:26,037
It's not like that, I just feel
that he'll miss Prince Yang Myeong.

590
00:47:26,037 --> 00:47:27,837
Who would be waiting for me?

591
00:47:27,837 --> 00:47:30,437
Crown Prince, His High....

592
00:47:30,437 --> 00:47:32,437
N...no...

593
00:47:32,437 --> 00:47:37,237
His Majesty is also like that.

594
00:47:37,237 --> 00:47:41,137
They are all very busy,
they don't have the time to see me.

595
00:47:41,137 --> 00:47:43,737
Just keep waiting.

596
00:47:44,037 --> 00:47:46,137
For a person like you who can write poems,

597
00:47:46,137 --> 00:47:48,137
could it be that you don't
know what missing is?

598
00:47:48,137 --> 00:47:51,537
If you miss too much, in
the end it'll become an illness.

599
00:47:51,537 --> 00:47:58,137
As a Prince, how can you climb over a wall?

600
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:04,837
Then you should be able to understand
why I climbed over a wall, right?

601
00:48:04,837 --> 00:48:08,437
These are two completely different types of...

602
00:48:17,737 --> 00:48:21,437
How is it different?

603
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:30,737
No matter what, hurry up and go to
the palace to pay your respects.

604
00:48:32,237 --> 00:48:35,237
What I'm saying is the truth,
so why are you laughing?

605
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:37,237
It hasn't been like this in a long time.

606
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:42,537
For you to be able to look at me seriously
and to have a long chat with me.

607
00:48:42,537 --> 00:48:45,237
Thank you for the advice.

608
00:48:45,937 --> 00:48:49,237
But you should focus on yourself.

609
00:49:02,037 --> 00:49:04,537
Quickly tell me, what type of person is your owner?

610
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:08,537
So I can ask for the money from your owner.

611
00:49:08,837 --> 00:49:11,537
Why aren't you speaking?

612
00:49:11,537 --> 00:49:16,537
You're in the same
group as your owner, right?

613
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:22,837
This girl, if you don't say it then I'll hand
you over to the Government Office.

614
00:49:23,237 --> 00:49:25,837
<i>This girl...</i>

615
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:29,737
So, why didn't you widen your
eyes when you were walking?

616
00:49:30,337 --> 00:49:34,437
To actually dirty my most favorite clothing,
did you think that you'll be all right?

617
00:49:34,437 --> 00:49:37,037
That is a grave mistake.

618
00:49:40,837 --> 00:49:42,237
You said things were stolen?

619
00:49:42,237 --> 00:49:46,537
Yes, why did she have to touch
the Minister of Personnel's things?

620
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:50,337
They want to drag her to the
Government Office and tattoo her face.

621
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:54,437
Due to their agassi coming forward,
she was sent to their household.

622
00:49:56,037 --> 00:49:59,937
You vicious girl, bring the mangseok here.

623
00:50:13,337 --> 00:50:14,837
Seol!

624
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:18,037
Agassi.

625
00:50:18,437 --> 00:50:21,937
Are you fine? Are you all right?

626
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:25,537
What are you all doing?

627
00:50:25,537 --> 00:50:27,137
Even if a mistake was made,

628
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:28,537
how can you hit a person till like this?

629
00:50:28,537 --> 00:50:30,737
What's with the noises?

630
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:38,637
Sorry for my lack of manners.

631
00:50:38,637 --> 00:50:43,237
I'm Office of Special Advisor's
Chief Scholar's daughter, Heo Yeon U.

632
00:50:43,237 --> 00:50:47,337
I heard that my servant stole your purse.

633
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:49,037
There should be some misunderstanding...

634
00:50:49,037 --> 00:50:50,337
What are you all doing?

635
00:50:50,337 --> 00:50:52,137
Didn't I ask you all to find out the truth?

636
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:53,737
Who let you all hit the
person without a reason?

637
00:50:53,737 --> 00:50:55,737
Didn't agassi just say,

638
00:50:55,737 --> 00:50:59,237
that we could hit as viciously as
we want, as long as she doesn't die?

639
00:50:59,237 --> 00:51:01,137
I'm sorry, agassi.

640
00:51:01,137 --> 00:51:04,237
You already let me release the person, but I...

641
00:51:04,237 --> 00:51:08,037
You shouldn't be apologizing to me, right?

642
00:51:08,637 --> 00:51:10,637
I'm sorry.

643
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:16,237
It's because no matter how I ask her,
she won't say which households servant she is.

644
00:51:22,437 --> 00:51:25,637
It's these ignorant people
that don't know the kindness.

645
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:27,237
You should understand,

646
00:51:27,237 --> 00:51:31,637
that it's actually not easy
to teach a lowly servant.

647
00:51:31,637 --> 00:51:35,537
But this type of small problem isn't easy to change.

648
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:41,437
From what I see, before she commits an
even bigger mistake, you should sell her off.

649
00:51:41,437 --> 00:51:45,837
No matter what, the money that you've
lost, I'll find someone to send it to...

650
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:47,737
There's no need.

651
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:54,037
Since we've hurt your household's
property, we're even.

652
00:51:54,037 --> 00:51:59,237
Agassi, she is not something
that can be bought or sold.

653
00:51:59,237 --> 00:52:04,237
She is my friend and my family.

654
00:52:04,237 --> 00:52:05,437
What?

655
00:52:05,437 --> 00:52:09,237
I feel that there should not be a
division between the noble and lowly.

656
00:52:09,237 --> 00:52:12,937
However, there are the noble and the
lowly in a person's personality.

657
00:52:13,237 --> 00:52:17,937
Although I don't know how
much money you've lost today,

658
00:52:17,937 --> 00:52:23,437
can it compare to the
amount of pain in her heart?

659
00:52:23,837 --> 00:52:26,737
What did you say?

660
00:52:26,737 --> 00:52:32,637
Then I'll just take it as that you've
spared her, I'm going to take her away.

661
00:52:32,637 --> 00:52:34,637
Let's go, Seol.

662
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:38,937
Are you all right?

663
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,537
There's still such people.

664
00:53:00,137 --> 00:53:04,837
This is her return gift for the barley sugar
you gave to my dongsaeng.

665
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:12,537
It looks like a flower pot,
what's planted inside?

666
00:53:12,537 --> 00:53:14,737
About this, I don't know either.

667
00:53:14,737 --> 00:53:17,837
It seems that the seed came from
the warm house of an acquaintance.

668
00:53:17,837 --> 00:53:22,637
Even though it's raised in an ondol,
it's the same doing it in a greenhouse.
-= ondol: underfloor heating =-

669
00:53:31,537 --> 00:53:32,537
Then, let's start...

670
00:53:32,537 --> 00:53:35,637
What type of person is
Literature Teacher Heo's dongsaeng?

671
00:53:35,637 --> 00:53:36,537
What?

672
00:53:36,537 --> 00:53:40,137
Seeing that she can listen to Literature Teacher Heo's
worries and being able to help you contribute an idea,

673
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:42,437
she must be a very smart lady.

674
00:53:42,437 --> 00:53:44,137
Just exactly what type of person is she?

675
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,737
Your Highness, now is the time to study.

676
00:53:47,737 --> 00:53:52,537
I felt that the relationship between
you two were good, that's why I asked.

677
00:53:53,737 --> 00:54:00,237
It's because I can read theories on some
matters with my dongsaeng every night.

678
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,137
You read books with your dongsaeng?

679
00:54:03,137 --> 00:54:08,537
It's like this, since young she has liked reading.

680
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,637
She has a lot of areas thats
worthy of me to learn.

681
00:54:12,137 --> 00:54:15,637
That's a really big difference from
my dongsaeng, Princess Min Hwa.

682
00:54:15,637 --> 00:54:19,337
That child only knows the first
line of the Thousand Character Classic.
(Thousand Character Classic - A Chinese Poem equivalent to ABC)

683
00:54:19,337 --> 00:54:22,137
And she especially loves to cry.

684
00:54:29,137 --> 00:54:31,637
Min... Min Hwa, you...

685
00:54:31,637 --> 00:54:33,237
Look at what you look like now.

686
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:35,837
Orabeoni, I hate you. I hate you!

687
00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:38,537
What are you doing?

688
00:54:38,537 --> 00:54:40,137
Why are you like this?

689
00:54:40,137 --> 00:54:41,737
You were saying bad things about me.

690
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,637
Furthermore, to say it in front of him.

691
00:54:43,637 --> 00:54:46,837
I hate you, hate you, hate you!

692
00:54:48,537 --> 00:54:51,637
The Crown Prince's words were all lies.

693
00:54:51,637 --> 00:54:55,237
I'm not headstrong,
I'm a very dignified lady.

694
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:59,337
I've nearly finished memorizing the
Thousand Character Classic.

695
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:04,137
I understand, I understand what you're saying.

696
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:06,937
So don't be too angry.

697
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:10,637
If you continue, then your beautiful
cheeks will be all ruined.

698
00:55:12,537 --> 00:55:17,337
I'm... beautiful?

699
00:55:18,037 --> 00:55:19,937
What?

700
00:55:21,537 --> 00:55:26,537
Am I really beautiful?

701
00:55:28,037 --> 00:55:31,937
Princess, Princess. Quickly send the princess back.

702
00:56:17,537 --> 00:56:20,037
Have a look at this letter, Hyeong Seon.

703
00:56:20,037 --> 00:56:24,737
How can one believe that this is
a 13 year old girls literary talent?

704
00:56:24,737 --> 00:56:30,937
There aren't many girls that understand the Chinese
characters, moreover to have such a good literary talent.

705
00:56:30,937 --> 00:56:34,837
But how is the content written in the letter?

706
00:56:48,437 --> 00:56:51,037
It's Lee Gyu Bo's poem.

707
00:56:58,737 --> 00:57:04,337
<i>A mountain monk desires the light of the moon.</i>

708
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:08,137
<i>He draws water from the well into the bottle.</i>

709
00:57:09,037 --> 00:57:12,637
<i>And when he gets back to the temple he realizes,</i>

710
00:57:13,737 --> 00:57:19,437
<i>that when the bottled is poured,
the moon will disappear.</i>

711
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:29,937
<i>Why must you keep thinking
of a young girl's mistake?</i>

712
00:57:30,937 --> 00:57:36,537
<i>Please forget what transpired
at the Silver Moon Building.</i>

713
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,537
<i>I'm currently repenting.</i>

714
00:57:58,237 --> 00:58:02,537
She has solved the riddle that I gave her.

715
00:58:03,937 --> 00:58:06,437
Telling me to forget her.

716
00:58:07,837 --> 00:58:12,337
And I was thinking how smart she is,
but she's really foolish.

717
00:58:20,236 --> 00:58:25,336
<i>How can I forget you?</i>

718
00:58:29,036 --> 00:58:32,736
Princess! Princess! Princess...

719
00:58:32,736 --> 00:58:34,436
Abamama!

720
00:58:34,436 --> 00:58:37,136
It's Princess Min Hwa.

721
00:58:37,136 --> 00:58:41,536
Abamama, are you in good health today too?

722
00:58:41,536 --> 00:58:47,636
From seeing my Princess Min Hwa,
there's no illnesses.

723
00:58:47,636 --> 00:58:51,436
But my Princess, why did
you come to the palace hall?

724
00:58:51,436 --> 00:58:55,436
Abamama, I want to learn literature.

725
00:58:57,036 --> 00:59:00,436
Has my Princess fallen in love with learning?

726
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:05,536
Yes, I want to learn from Crown Prince's teacher.

727
00:59:05,536 --> 00:59:07,436
Are you talking about Literature Teacher Heo?

728
00:59:07,436 --> 00:59:08,636
Yes.

729
00:59:09,936 --> 00:59:12,536
You can't.

730
00:59:12,536 --> 00:59:15,736
Why can't I...

731
00:59:15,736 --> 00:59:17,336
He's the Crown Prince's teacher.

732
00:59:17,436 --> 00:59:19,436
How can Princess and Crown Prince's teacher...

733
00:59:19,436 --> 00:59:22,936
I don't want that, I must
learn from Literature Teacher Heo!

734
00:59:22,936 --> 00:59:25,636
Didn't I say that you can't?

735
00:59:25,636 --> 00:59:29,036
There are some things that you can
and some things that you can't.

736
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:40,436
Please confer me to die.

737
00:59:52,836 --> 00:59:54,536
Are you saying a study helper?

738
00:59:54,536 --> 00:59:56,836
It's like this.

739
00:59:57,436 --> 01:00:01,336
It's just the same as previously preparing
a study helper for the Royal Prince.

740
01:00:01,336 --> 01:00:03,436
Prepare one for the Princess,

741
01:00:03,436 --> 01:00:05,936
that can study together with
a person of a similar age,

742
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,636
by choosing a daughter amongst the officials.

743
01:00:08,636 --> 01:00:14,236
A person that has a good character and is smart,

744
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,136
to be Princess's study helper, how about it?

745
01:00:17,336 --> 01:00:20,536
Originally only the Royal Prince can have someone
prepared for accompaniment when studying.

746
01:00:20,636 --> 01:00:22,536
Although this has never been done before,

747
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:23,936
but for Princess's learning,

748
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:26,936
it's not like finding a study helper can't be done.

749
01:00:26,936 --> 01:00:31,936
Then, is there a lady that's worth recommending?

750
01:00:31,936 --> 01:00:34,736
Considering according to age
and moral character,

751
01:00:34,736 --> 01:00:38,936
Minister of Personnel's daughter
is worth recommending.

752
01:00:41,436 --> 01:00:46,136
Minister of Personnel's daughter, isn't bad.

753
01:00:46,136 --> 01:00:52,136
Then, how about also calling Chief Scholar's
daughter to be a study helper?

754
01:01:04,336 --> 01:01:07,436
Be Princess's study helper?

755
01:01:07,436 --> 01:01:13,536
Yes, every 3 days enter the palace
and play with the Princess.

756
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:16,836
Also listen to Her Highness Jung Jeong's teachings.

757
01:01:16,836 --> 01:01:18,336
Do you want to try?

758
01:01:18,336 --> 01:01:20,336
Entering the palace?

759
01:01:20,336 --> 01:01:22,336
You don't want to?

760
01:01:22,336 --> 01:01:24,536
It's not that...

761
01:01:24,536 --> 01:01:26,636
If you don't want to,
you don't have to go.

762
01:01:26,636 --> 01:01:30,836
I'll notify His Majesty.

763
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:54,236
Why aren't you resting yet?

764
01:01:54,236 --> 01:02:00,036
Why? Does Yeon U not want to be a study helper?

765
01:02:00,036 --> 01:02:01,636
She agreed.

766
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:03,836
Then, why are you like this?

767
01:02:03,836 --> 01:02:12,236
The palace is a place that you have to
be cautious of every step that you take.

768
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:15,636
For both our children to
be at that kind of place,

769
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:18,536
I'm really worried.

770
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:26,536
Isn't it just keeping the Princess company?

771
01:02:26,536 --> 01:02:28,936
If there's no status and hidden agenda,

772
01:02:28,936 --> 01:02:32,236
then nothing can be done.

773
01:02:32,236 --> 01:02:37,836
There's actually some hidden
agenda from choosing a study helper?

774
01:02:40,436 --> 01:02:42,636
You're just over thinking it.

775
01:02:42,636 --> 01:02:45,536
She doesn't know what politics is.

776
01:02:45,536 --> 01:02:51,136
I just keep feeling very unwilling.

777
01:02:51,136 --> 01:02:54,736
Very unwilling.

778
01:02:58,236 --> 01:03:02,636
The noble fate that our Yeon U has,

779
01:03:02,636 --> 01:03:06,336
someone once said that she'll
risk her life to protect it.

780
01:03:06,836 --> 01:03:08,336
Who was it?

781
01:03:08,336 --> 01:03:13,236
There's such a person,
so don't be too worried.

782
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:15,936
You should go rest.

783
01:03:41,736 --> 01:03:46,636
A Ri, how have you been?

784
01:03:47,036 --> 01:03:48,036
-=Shaman, Jang Nok Yeong=-

785
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:55,136
I'm sorry, that I couldn't often
come and see you lately.

786
01:03:55,136 --> 01:04:04,536
<i>My life is not long.
You must live and protect that child.</i>

787
01:04:07,936 --> 01:04:16,336
Tell me, A Ri. Who is the child
that I'm suppose to protect?

788
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:26,036
I'm really worried about Princess Min Hwa.

789
01:04:26,036 --> 01:04:27,636
Don't worry.

790
01:04:27,636 --> 01:04:30,036
The Princess will be together with
the Scholar Official's family members.

791
01:04:30,036 --> 01:04:33,336
It will affect her deeply as well.

792
01:04:35,236 --> 01:04:38,136
Queen Dowager, Celestial Hall's shaman,

793
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:41,536
has already arrived in the capital not long ago.

794
01:04:41,536 --> 01:04:45,936
Is that so? She probably rushed here.

795
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:53,136
Celestial Hall's shaman.

796
01:04:53,136 --> 01:04:57,736
Do you want to do the blessing?

797
01:04:57,736 --> 01:04:58,836
The reason I called her is because

798
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:01,936
I want to look at the children's physiognomy
of those that are becoming study helpers.

799
01:05:01,936 --> 01:05:05,436
Why are you looking at
the study helpers physiognomy?

800
01:05:05,436 --> 01:05:09,836
No matter what, they are children
who'll enter the palace.

801
01:05:09,836 --> 01:05:14,236
You must be careful, very careful.

802
01:05:14,236 --> 01:05:16,536
Who knows?

803
01:05:16,536 --> 01:05:20,836
Amongst the two, there might be one
that'll become Crown Prince's wife.

804
01:05:21,236 --> 01:05:23,136
What?

805
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:28,836
In future, Jung Jeong's responsibility is quite big.

806
01:06:42,636 --> 01:06:47,536
<i>Although going near the
sun will attract a disaster,</i>

807
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:51,336
<i>but fate will force her to stand by
the sun's side and protect him.</i>

808
01:06:51,336 --> 01:06:56,536
<i>Just to make sure that child is safe,
protect her on my behalf.</i>

809
01:07:18,036 --> 01:07:20,036
<i>It's two moons.</i>

810
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:48,836
-=Next Episode Preview=-

811
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:52,436
Two moons. Two suns.

812
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:55,636
Could this be luck?

813
01:07:55,636 --> 01:07:58,736
Can it be... it's really her?

814
01:07:58,736 --> 01:07:59,836
Please escape.

815
01:07:59,836 --> 01:08:02,935
This isn't a fate that agassi can handle.

816
01:08:02,935 --> 01:08:06,636
Don't use any marriage contracts anymore.

817
01:08:07,536 --> 01:08:09,935
Do you know who I am?

818
01:08:09,935 --> 01:08:11,935
This country's, Joseon's...

819
01:08:11,935 --> 01:08:17,435
Crown Prince, Lee Hwon...
