00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,589
Episode 19

2
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:53,859
But . . .

3
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:54,742
What?

4
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,700
I gave you my life, but . . .

5
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,600
I don't get anything back?

6
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:04,012
It's because I don't have anything.

7
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:08,909
Do you want something?

8
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,024
That...

9
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:15,807
I want to try it.

10
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,300
What do you mean?

11
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,945
That is . . .

12
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:28,857
That... 
The thing you played 
with my brother and the Royal Infirmary.

13
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:32,479
The one you play with a long stick.

14
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,300
If we can succeed in 
overthrowing the King,

15
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,525
you can have both of them.

16
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:21,000
But,

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,463
There is something that doesn't make any sense.

18
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:26,868
What do you mean?

19
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:30,600
It isn't hard for me to give up my current status, but

20
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,369
it isn't an easy thing for you to give up your position as the King's Father-in-Law.

21
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:38,100
I don't have any plans

22
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,467
of letting go of that position.

23
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:44,692
I know that you only have one daughter.

24
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:47,480
If I need one,

25
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:50,684
I will get one.

26
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:57,586
For the first time, I pity the Queen.

27
00:02:57,586 --> 00:03:01,251
You can betray your own blood-related daughter.

28
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:03,920
How can I trust you?

29
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:07,792
Are you testing me?

30
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:12,575
Since you tested me first,
I am testing you now.

31
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:16,519
There is no agreement without the same investment.

32
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,663
I have already shown you my cards, 
 it is only right for you to show yours.

33
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:24,150
It would be obvious that you want a spot on the council.

34
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,836
What else is left?

35
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:32,005
Bring back the Hwensang, the law of the King sharing his power with the prime minister.

36
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:34,825
Sharing the King's power?

37
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:39,839
I guess that is some nice card to keep the King from having the sole power.

38
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:41,458
I will think about it.

39
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,583
But,

40
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:47,667
Not about the issue regarding Heo Yeon Woo.

41
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:53,146
The scholars will rebel if you choose to marry a woman who belonged to the dethroned King.

42
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:57,608
It is better to treasure the things you like,

43
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:59,617
privately, right?

44
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:02,458
If I sit on the throne,

45
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,692
there are limitations to my power.

46
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:09,857
Fine then.

47
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:12,542
I'll be on your side.

48
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,225
You want to live in the Palace.

49
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:23,150
Then do you want to take a tour of the Palace?

50
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:31,805
Father...

51
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,431
Are you...

52
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,775
really going to abandon your daughter and the King?

53
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:41,775
No, no!

54
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:50,685
Your Majesty,
where are you going at this hour?

55
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:54,125
The King is in danger.

56
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,400
I must tell the King that he is in danger.

57
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,562
Your Majesty!

58
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,667
What is it saying?

59
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:43,208
It's saying that the King is keeping a shaman with him.

60
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,341
The other one is saying that

61
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:48,110
the current Queen's clan was the one who killed the Crown Princess.

62
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,175
Without knowing anything,

63
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:54,842
which one is telling the truth?

64
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:58,977
Well, I think the one about the shaman
 is more believable.

65
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:00,817
But,

66
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:03,100
they say that the Crown Princess Heo,

67
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,083
who died 8 years ago, came back to life.

68
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,542
Nonsense!

69
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:11,292
There is a limit to what you can make up.
How can a dead person come back to life?!

70
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:14,625
I wish that was true.

71
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:19,357
The Queen's clan is doing such a lousy job.

72
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:22,767
If the Crown Princess, who died,
 came back and

73
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:27,417
fixed up all the mess that we are in, 
that would be wonderful.

74
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,763
Actually,

75
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:32,135
the shaman isn't just a shaman, but . . .

76
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:35,121
is the Crown Princess that died.

77
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,911
But then, what is this?

78
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:41,562
So what you are saying is that the Queen is just sitting around

79
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:44,750
and pretending to be the Queen all this time?

80
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,300
As for the person who posted the posters,

81
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,850
and the ones spreading rumors should be found and put into prison.

82
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,742
And punish them.

83
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:00,308
That's right.

84
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:05,558
It was obvious that  Miss Heo died from a disease.

85
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,833
Nevertheless, there is a rumor that she was killed.

86
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:13,333
It means that there are the rebellious who are trying to destroy this country.

87
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,874
What the chief secretary said is perfectly reasonable.

88
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:19,742
Please eradicate and punish them 
in accordance with the strictest law.

89
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:23,029
I understand your earnestness.

90
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:28,450
But, about the poster related to me,

91
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,988
you don't care about that.

92
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:34,357
I am very disappointed.

93
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:37,950
It is rumored that I never got out from behind a wicked shaman's skrit

94
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,267
and neglected the affairs of state.

95
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:46,103
Will you do nothing but just look on?

96
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:47,871
Is it possible that

97
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:50,750
you agree with the rumor?

98
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,100
How can you say such nonsense?

99
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,700
Or,

100
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,767
Did you promote that rumor to be spread?

101
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,517
Are you alright?

102
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:04,667
It was just a joke.

103
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,525
I saw that child in the palace, Father.

104
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,433
Are you saying that again?

105
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,558
Did you ask to see me just to hear your whining?

106
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:25,158
It isn't whining.

107
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:29,000
It isn't an illusion either.
That child . . .

108
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,542
is in the palace for sure.

109
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,933
Whether she is alive or dead,

110
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,125
or anywhere,

111
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,108
it doesn't matter anymore.

112
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:40,033
It doesn't matter?

113
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:44,875
Father, what are you thinking of? What else could you be thinking?

114
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,458
I'm sorry, but

115
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,925
I have piles of work to do urgently.

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,100
I must leave now.

117
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:04,467
If I am to be abandoned by the King,

118
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:07,817
and you...

119
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:12,432
I can only protect my position by myself.

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,467
Lady Jo.

121
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:20,283
Yes, Your Majesty.

122
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,700
Find the previous chief shaman of Seongsucheong,

123
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,475
and bring her immediately.

124
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:28,350
Yes?

125
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,117
Why?

126
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:35,200
Do as I command you.

127
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,033
I will find her immediately.

128
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:58,661
I had to obey the order of the Queen Dowager.

129
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,403
And I . . .

130
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:04,086
couldn't betray the promise to protect you

131
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:06,944
that I made to my friend.

132
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:16,703
Recently, isn't it too obvious?

133
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,103
You are looking at me openly?

134
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:24,553
Your Majesty.

135
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:26,536
What?

136
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:28,119
I'm sorry, but . . .

137
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:33,786
May I make a request?

138
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,944
Request?

139
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:41,653
Say it. I'll listen to everything.

140
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,353
Can I meet

141
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,994
Spiritual Mother just once?

142
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:54,053
She was the one who hid you.

143
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,944
How can you meet a sinner?

144
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:57,028
But,

145
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:00,753
she is also the person who saved me.

146
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:04,028
I'm very thankful.
So,

147
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,311
you're thinking of her as a savior?

148
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,419
Whenever I see your face,

149
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,728
I am very thankful for

150
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:16,144
being alive.

151
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,586
The reason that I can see your face,

152
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:25,294
for one reason or another . . .

153
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:28,486
Isn't it because she saved me?

154
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:33,836
I know she can't avoid being punished.

155
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:38,469
Before that, I want to meet her just once and

156
00:11:38,469 --> 00:11:41,919
clean up the past 8 years ago.

157
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,486
So,

158
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:50,494
please allow it.

159
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,144
For what reason have you look for this lowly person?

160
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:24,136
Have you ever seen the Chief Shaman's spiritual daughter?

161
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:27,619
Yes, I've seen her.

162
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:34,503
Can you put a curse on that child with your powers?

163
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,100
Answer me.

164
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,378
Can you use a curse?

165
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:46,519
That is...
It isn't impossible.  However,

166
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:50,386
there are some restrictions.

167
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:51,769
Restrictions?

168
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:55,778
You have to be sure where that person is and

169
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:59,669
that place must not be far.

170
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:05,878
Is it possible if that person is in the palace?

171
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:09,536
It is impossible to lay a killing curse on her for now.

172
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:11,986
But, like the last time the King was cursed,

173
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:14,436
it can give pain.

174
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:20,661
Then that incident, 
did you do it?

175
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:23,094
I've done a sin worthy of death!

176
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:27,428
I just acted on orders from the Prime Minister.

177
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:32,828
Father?

178
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,994
Forget that.

179
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:45,369
Forget it.
That is the past so I won't ask anymore.

180
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:49,519
But, if murder is impossible,

181
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:54,261
make sure that she feels the most intense pain 
that a human has ever experienced.

182
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:58,103
I will try my best.

183
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:00,378
However . . .

184
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:02,128
However?

185
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:08,069
In order to perform a murdering curse,
there needs to be an offering.

186
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:12,400
And, with a pure virgin's strong aspiration,

187
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,800
you can make them die.

188
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:20,511
If there is an offering,

189
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:26,736
you can make them die?

190
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:41,894
It's blood!

191
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:53,411
Are you Jang Nok Young?

192
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:55,319
Yes.

193
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,511
Are you going somewhere?

194
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:26,353
During my absence, don't even think about going to BukChon (house of Heo family)

195
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:10,311
Are Seol and Jan Shil . . .

196
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,503
alright?

197
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:19,186
Yes. They are both doing well.

198
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:25,728
Are you, Spiritual Mother, doing well?

199
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:31,544
Why are you addressing me as a spiritual mother?

200
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:34,644
When I was in jail,

201
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:39,061
you told me you had a best friend.

202
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:43,269
And that her last request was for you to protect me.

203
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:45,694
That is right.

204
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:49,728
What kind of person was she?

205
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,100
I just know that

206
00:16:55,403 --> 00:16:57,594
Before you were born,

207
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,300
it was the chains of causation due to your mother's good deeds.

208
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:08,278
My mother's good deeds?

209
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,353
Yes.

210
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:13,486
In the end, your savior

211
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:20,861
wasn't my best friend or me,
but your own mother.

212
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:27,653
I believe what you are saying.

213
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:33,278
I didn't totally forgive you, 
but I understood.

214
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:38,769
I, too, kept quiet when I knew the truth.

215
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:45,494
It's just that . . . Before it's too late,

216
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:52,644
I wanted to say this.

217
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:57,694
Thank you.

218
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,894
For saving me,

219
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:05,186
I thank you.

220
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:11,436
Thank you for...

221
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,200
raising me . . .

222
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,600
for protecting me.

223
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,653
Thank you.

224
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:30,519
For being my mother for the last 8 years.

225
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,578
Thank you.

226
00:18:51,700 --> 00:19:02,239
Subtitles brought to you by Eclipse Team @ viki.com

227
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,400
Is the offering for the curse ready?

228
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:19,886
Where is it?

229
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
I . . .

230
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,400
will be the offering.

231
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,500
Tonight there will be a curse in the palace.

232
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,391
Perhaps...

233
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Is it a curse on the King?

234
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,300
No.
That curse is

235
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:02,557
 towards you.

236
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:05,847
If, through me, the King becomes endangered . . .

237
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:07,303
I . . .

238
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
will block it.

239
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,800
I will block it with my life.

240
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:24,700
An evil spirit, go back to the one who woke you up.

241
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,900
You might think that you did nothing wrong.

242
00:22:13,617 --> 00:22:16,915
You might think you're just a victim.

243
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,500
But you're wrong.

244
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,900
The sin of keeping silent when you knew.

245
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:26,992
The sin of simply looking on as she was killed.

246
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,800
The sin that you are in a position which you stole.

247
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:35,684
The sin that you deceived the King

248
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:41,031
and gave up an opportunity to repent for your sins.

249
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,500
Those are . . .

250
00:22:43,886 --> 00:22:46,286
your sins!

251
00:22:46,286 --> 00:22:48,178
No!!!

252
00:22:57,386 --> 00:23:00,429
Lady Jo!
Lady Jo!

253
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:03,394
Take her away!

254
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:04,609
Hurry!

255
00:23:15,836 --> 00:23:21,044
You might think that you did nothing wrong.
You might think you're just a victim!

256
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:23,603
But you're wrong.
Are you going to kill Yeon Woo?

257
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:30,322
The sin of keeping silent, the sin of silently watching murder, the sin of coveting someone's place,

258
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:35,059
the sin of deceiving the King, the sin of giving up an opportunity to repent for your sins.

259
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:37,967
Those are your sins!

260
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,500
Do you have to go, Mother?

261
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,200
I will pray for the princess and her childbirth.

262
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:13,518
Also, I will stay at the temple a few more days.

263
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:18,103
I want to pray for our Yeon Woo.

264
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:21,420
Mother.

265
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:28,769
It's just that before a new child is born,

266
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:35,769
I want to let the deceased go with all my heart.

267
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:41,868
If I keep holding onto Yeon Woo's shadow,

268
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:45,926
it might cause the Princess, who is pregnant, inconvenience.

269
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:52,269
When I . . .

270
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:54,936
gave birth to Yeon Woo,

271
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:59,858
your father had gone to China as an envoy.

272
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:02,830
Even though I knew it was of no use,

273
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,431
I was sad.

274
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:09,103
So, Yeom,

275
00:25:09,103 --> 00:25:14,394
protect the Princess.

276
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:18,469
Yes, I will do that.

277
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,611
Master . . .

278
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:44,800
What's wrong?

279
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,500
Have you heard the rumors?

280
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:50,803
What rumors?

281
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:57,078
It's about Miss Yeon Woo who passed away.

282
00:25:57,078 --> 00:25:59,262
What about Yeon Woo?

283
00:25:59,262 --> 00:26:04,520
There's a lot of rumors, but..

284
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,400
It is said that 8 years ago, Miss YeonWoo
 was killed by

285
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,900
the maternal relatives of the King.

286
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,519
What do you mean?

287
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:21,728
There's also rumors that Miss Yeon Woo
 may be alive!

288
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:26,969
There was something that bothered me 8 years ago.

289
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:29,036
Something bothered you?

290
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:32,181
As I told Agent Hong the other day,

291
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:37,936
After her funeral, I went to the grave and 
saw signs of digging.

292
00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:39,103
What?!

293
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:44,376
So, the girl who Mistress saw could be Miss Yeon Woo!

294
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:49,403
Master, are you alright?

295
00:26:56,061 --> 00:27:00,045
Isn't that a letter?
Who did this?

296
00:27:05,553 --> 00:27:09,428
Master Heo, do you know that your sister 
didn't die from a disease, but was murdered?

297
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:10,994
8 years ago,

298
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:15,219
Do you know that the Princess who wanted you
performed a curse

299
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:18,349
and killed your sister?

300
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:22,453
Do you know that the person 
who tried to cover this up

301
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:27,466
was the previous King?

302
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:28,811
But,

303
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,900
do you have a wife?

304
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,761
I don't have one.

305
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:41,078
Then, do you have a fiance?

306
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:44,336
Please forgive me, Husband.

307
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:47,461
What do you mean?

308
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,978
Everything.

309
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,600
Everything.

310
00:28:15,975 --> 00:28:17,785
Husband!

311
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Now, you know that the happiness you have
 enjoyed has been just 'a castle in the air'.

312
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:30,167
What are you thinking of doing?

313
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,546
Husband,

314
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:36,500
sit here.  Why don't you sit down?

315
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:43,000
I was making a "Bainat Jegori" 
(which can be worn when a baby is first born)

316
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:47,992
Isn't it small and cute?

317
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,665
I...

318
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:55,030
am going to raise this child well.

319
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,163
Like you, to be a smart and

320
00:28:59,953 --> 00:29:03,175
a good looking man.

321
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:06,083
Did you . . .

322
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:11,005
want me to that extent?

323
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:12,174
Yes?

324
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:15,113
What did you want

325
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:18,300
to that extent from me?

326
00:29:21,422 --> 00:29:24,430
So now,

327
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:31,485
what did you get from me?

328
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:34,100
Just what part of me...

329
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,505
did you want so badly?

330
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:43,931
If it is not,

331
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:48,332
say it wasn't that; that I'm mistaken.

332
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:51,887
Please tell me that I am wrong and that I am being foolish.

333
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:56,813
Please forgive me.

334
00:29:56,813 --> 00:29:58,839
Husband.

335
00:30:00,725 --> 00:30:03,642
Please forgive me.

336
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:08,225
How...

337
00:30:10,356 --> 00:30:13,410
How could you?!

338
00:30:14,953 --> 00:30:17,468
For such a long time...

339
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:22,902
You fooled me.
You fooled Mother.

340
00:30:22,902 --> 00:30:25,113
My sister!

341
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:28,200
I tried to say it.

342
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,772
I tried to say it, but

343
00:30:31,772 --> 00:30:36,244
when I saw you were so happy 
about the news of the pregnancy,

344
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,500
I just couldn't open my mouth and

345
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:41,417
tell you.

346
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:45,284
If I were to open my mouth and tell you,

347
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:49,792
I was afraid that your child, as well,

348
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:54,200
would become a sinner.

349
00:30:56,492 --> 00:30:59,185
That the child would be yours,

350
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:02,926
who killed my sister.

351
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:16,375
But,

352
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,300
I, too, am a sinner.

353
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:24,056
For me, you killed my sister.

354
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:27,175
I, too, am a sinner.

355
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:30,600
Even without knowing,

356
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,184
I loved you.

357
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:38,348
I, too, am a sinner.

358
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:42,639
I have lived in luxury, in reward,
 for killing my sister.

359
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:45,454
I am a bigger sinner!

360
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,900
No!
I am the sinner!

361
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,384
Husband and the child

362
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,765
have no sin!

363
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:05,409
It's good to curse at me, but

364
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:09,753
husband, I beg you, don't blame yourself!

365
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,000
Your child...

366
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:18,717
Please don't blame your child!

367
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Would Master Heo (Prince Consort) 
know everything by now?

368
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,845
Speaking of which, women are quite difficult to understand.

369
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:56,696
Who could have imagined that the innocent Princess could have committed such a big crime as that?

370
00:32:56,696 --> 00:33:03,025
Since he knows the truth,
he won't stay still.

371
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:06,006
He might even commit suicide and

372
00:33:06,006 --> 00:33:07,710
purge away his sins.

373
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,782
That would be great.  But,

374
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:15,659
a problem could arise if he were to go to the King and tell him about his sin.

375
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,834
Then,

376
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:21,152
we need to get rid of him.

377
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,934
Who is it outside?

378
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,600
Seol!

379
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:21,200
I will cover you, so go inside.

380
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,150
I can't do that!
How can a woman protect me?

381
00:35:19,227 --> 00:35:21,317
Seol
Seol.

382
00:35:21,317 --> 00:35:23,675
Come to your senses!
Seol!

383
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:25,250
Seol!

384
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,958
Seol! 
Seol!

385
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,059
Seol!

386
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,400
Come to your senses!
Seol!

387
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:40,759
Miss Yeon Woo...

388
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:43,684
Is alive.

389
00:35:48,975 --> 00:35:53,121
Young Master...

390
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:55,725
You asked me...

391
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:01,459
to protect her when you are not around,
 did you not?

392
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:11,809
I'm sorry.

393
00:36:13,748 --> 00:36:16,349
To the end,

394
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,200
I wanted to protect Miss, but . . .

395
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,000
But I'm forced to leave like this...

396
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,773
I'm sorry, Young Master.

397
00:36:27,773 --> 00:36:30,195
Don't say that.

398
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:34,234
Seol, you...

399
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,934
were with Yeon Woo the whole time.

400
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:41,840
You do not know how thankful I am for that.

401
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:45,373
To someone so small as you,

402
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:50,784
I'm sorry that I gave you such a big burden.

403
00:36:50,784 --> 00:36:54,392
Please do not say you are sorry.

404
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,509
When I came to your house,

405
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,517
aren't you the master....

406
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:08,517
who changed my name from "that brat"....

407
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:12,084
and gave me the name Seol?

408
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,500
Since then till now...

409
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:25,209
Even though I knew that I was not supposed to . . .

410
00:37:26,984 --> 00:37:30,350
A lowly girl, such as I . . .

411
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,975
held feelings...

412
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
for the precious young master.

413
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,100
I...

414
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,200
was always deeply sorry about that.

415
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,392
- Please forgive me. 
  - Sorry about what?

416
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:54,850
Forgive you, you say?

417
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,592
What are you asking me to do?

418
00:37:57,592 --> 00:38:00,942
Just what am I worth?!

419
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:05,934
That you would throw away your life for me?

420
00:38:07,392 --> 00:38:09,492
Young Master...

421
00:38:09,492 --> 00:38:14,559
because of you, I became a person...

422
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,934
I became a woman...

423
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:19,950
and I became Seol.

424
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,434
Although it was a short life . . .

425
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,559
At this very moment....

426
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:29,092
Out of all the women in the world,

427
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:31,534
I am the happiest woman.

428
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:33,075
Therefore,

429
00:38:33,934 --> 00:38:40,059
you must also be happy, Young Master.

430
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:42,309
Seol...

431
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:43,625
Seol!

432
00:38:45,096 --> 00:38:47,025
Seol!

433
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,667
Seol!

434
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,484
Seol!

435
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,659
Spiritual Mother.

436
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,300
Seol unni...

437
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:49,767
has died.

438
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:52,642
She kept on telling me to live well.

439
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:59,734
She told me to thank you for her.

440
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:02,300
Since she's happy,

441
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,100
she told us

442
00:40:05,142 --> 00:40:09,142
to live happily and well.

443
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:23,391
You foolish girl.

444
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,200
Are you happy...

445
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,275
that in the end, you can embrace your fire (flower) and go?

446
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:32,842
Yes, I'm happy.

447
00:40:32,842 --> 00:40:38,534
For a slave girl like me, didn't I live a pretty decent life?

448
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:48,939
I took the Princess and your brother-in-law

449
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:51,556
to a safe place for now.

450
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,648
I was one step late.

451
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:58,039
Was any innocent blood spilled?

452
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:02,431
The woman Seol...

453
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,700
is dead.

454
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:13,273
In order to protect Prince Consort,

455
00:41:13,273 --> 00:41:16,498
she fought the assassins and died.

456
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:32,464
Send someone to the Onyanghaeng Palace.

457
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Grandmother is in danger!

458
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,800
Yoon Dae Hyung, you scoundrel!

459
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,806
You...

460
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:52,464
You knave dare...

461
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,281
King...

462
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:13,489
Are you here to take me?

463
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,423
Hurry,

464
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,800
hurry up and...

465
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,700
King.

466
00:42:30,956 --> 00:42:33,448
King...

467
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,400
Everything that was done...

468
00:42:36,414 --> 00:42:40,181
It was for you.

469
00:42:40,264 --> 00:42:42,556
Why won't you

470
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,500
understand me?

471
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:50,573
King!

472
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
No!

473
00:42:52,623 --> 00:42:55,106
This can't happen!

474
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,573
Yoon Dae-

475
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:59,156
This can't happen, you scoundrel!

476
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:02,498
This really can't happen!

477
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,573
8 years ago . . .

478
00:43:05,573 --> 00:43:08,139
The sin for murdering the Crown Princess,

479
00:43:08,139 --> 00:43:09,306
and

480
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:11,114
for involving,

481
00:43:11,114 --> 00:43:13,273
your innocent granddaughter in your evil scheme!

482
00:43:13,273 --> 00:43:16,773
Why do you think I have kept silent this entire time?!

483
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:20,939
Even though I learned the truth about Prince Ui Seong, I did not press on that matter!

484
00:43:20,939 --> 00:43:24,439
Just who do you think I did it for?!

485
00:43:25,873 --> 00:43:30,623
Looking the other way for 13 years should be enough, as my duty to you, as a son.

486
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:32,131
So,

487
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:36,498
please do not be greedy anymore.

488
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:53,073
We finished the old fox.

489
00:43:53,073 --> 00:43:56,881
Who can block us now?

490
00:43:56,881 --> 00:43:59,731
But public opinion is worrisome.

491
00:43:59,731 --> 00:44:03,956
People are concerned about the strange rumors.

492
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:05,598
Even the scholars are getting suspicious.

493
00:44:05,598 --> 00:44:08,806
If this keeps up,

494
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:12,448
we could lose public support, even if we succeed.

495
00:44:13,106 --> 00:44:16,356
Then, we should quicken our 'great deed'.

496
00:44:23,648 --> 00:44:29,939
Subtitles brought to you by The 'Eclipse' Team @ Viki.com

497
00:44:34,698 --> 00:44:36,581
Advance the great deed?

498
00:44:36,581 --> 00:44:38,381
Do you have a suggestion?

499
00:44:38,381 --> 00:44:41,306
Before the rumor ruins our will

500
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:43,248
let's finish him off.

501
00:44:47,914 --> 00:44:50,531
Any treason (coup d'état) that the public does not support

502
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,600
is merely a blood bath brought on 
by the powers that be.

503
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,400
Luckily, I have some power to move 
the heart of the masses.

504
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,914
The heart of the masses?

505
00:45:01,914 --> 00:45:05,598
Have you not heard of my fame at the public health center?

506
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:10,281
I have befriended the commoners, without discriminating against high or low class.

507
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,100
This is why people should do good.

508
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,464
Who would have known it would turn out so useful.

509
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,800
If the coup d'etat is successful,

510
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,000
it will most likely go down in history.

511
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:35,500
The King who wanted the poor shaman, the King who ignored the service and contributions, the King who dismissed public opinion,
 and resorted to violence was

512
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,281
stopped with the rising of a new King,

513
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,400
who sided with the commoners.

514
00:45:44,764 --> 00:45:46,589
Tonight...

515
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:52,073
I anticipate proper council.

516
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:07,414
It's okay to

517
00:46:07,414 --> 00:46:10,314
cry as much as you want.

518
00:46:10,314 --> 00:46:12,173
I...

519
00:46:13,873 --> 00:46:17,056
have no right to cry.

520
00:46:17,056 --> 00:46:18,600
That child

521
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,500
always protected me.

522
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:27,423
However, I couldn't protect that child.

523
00:46:35,698 --> 00:46:37,998
Was she...

524
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:40,439
someone you cherished greatly?

525
00:46:43,848 --> 00:46:45,731
She was my friend.

526
00:46:45,731 --> 00:46:47,739
She was my family.

527
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:50,873
No, much more . . .

528
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:52,681
She must have been.

529
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,800
That's why,

530
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,300
she gave up her life for her master.

531
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,398
Why she died . . .

532
00:47:01,398 --> 00:47:05,531
Why my brother is in danger . . .

533
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,000
I don't know the reason.

534
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,800
What is power

535
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,298
or the great cause that

536
00:47:16,664 --> 00:47:19,214
requires the blood

537
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:22,489
of the innocents?

538
00:47:33,014 --> 00:47:35,664
Just as you lost something precious,

539
00:47:37,873 --> 00:47:39,764
I, too . . .

540
00:47:39,764 --> 00:47:42,039
I have lost a faithful person in the nation.

541
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,500
So,

542
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:49,239
I won't stop.

543
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,300
Never again,

544
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,800
So that no more innocent lives would be sacrificed . . .

545
00:47:56,939 --> 00:48:00,406
This cycle of evil deeds . . .

546
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:04,539
I will be the one to end it.

547
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:39,414
There are a lot of people.

548
00:48:42,056 --> 00:48:43,898
Why are you laughing?

549
00:48:43,898 --> 00:48:46,564
It's just funny.

550
00:48:46,564 --> 00:48:49,223
Who would have thought a known playboy such as I,

551
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,500
would dream of a power grab.

552
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,806
How can you say such nonsense?

553
00:48:55,806 --> 00:48:57,698
Everyone who is gathered here tonight,

554
00:48:57,698 --> 00:48:59,664
believes that the rightful owner of the throne

555
00:48:59,664 --> 00:49:03,581
is you.

556
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:04,973
Enough.

557
00:49:05,848 --> 00:49:08,364
When is the D-day?

558
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:12,248
We all have decided that...

559
00:49:13,114 --> 00:49:17,598
the D-day should be on the upcoming Gangmoo.

560
00:49:17,598 --> 00:49:19,464
Gangmoo...?

561
00:49:20,406 --> 00:49:21,489
That's good.

562
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:24,131
However,

563
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:28,956
the rebellion will not be held at the hunting area.

564
00:49:28,956 --> 00:49:31,514
It will be in the Palace.

565
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,200
The palace will become the hunting field?

566
00:49:37,598 --> 00:49:40,423
However, the prey will be...

567
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,900
the King?

568
00:50:29,523 --> 00:50:31,931
What is this?

569
00:50:31,931 --> 00:50:34,139
If you believe in me and decide to follow my cause

570
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:37,400
put your signature here.

571
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,300
It might just be an empty book but

572
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,600
One day when I sit upon the throne

573
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,500
this record of loyal subjects will tell of

574
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,500
the ones who helped me in the coup d'etat.

575
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:45,265
Is the planning for tomorrow's hunting expedition going well?

576
00:51:45,265 --> 00:51:46,672
Yes, Your Majesty.

577
00:51:46,672 --> 00:51:50,207
We have set a boundary in KyungJu for the hunting and

578
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,100
an order was given so that

579
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,800
hunting and woodcutting would be forbidden.

580
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,498
It has been a while since the last Gangmoo, so I am looking forward to this greatly.

581
00:51:59,498 --> 00:52:01,807
Performers will accompany us to entertain us as well, it should be very fun.

582
00:52:01,807 --> 00:52:05,207
Nothing should be lacking or be in shortage.

583
00:52:05,207 --> 00:52:10,500
This expedition is not only for entertainment.

584
00:52:12,123 --> 00:52:16,490
It has meaning for military excercise

585
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:20,582
as well as strengthening ties between the city and suburbs.

586
00:52:20,582 --> 00:52:23,282
Do not forget this.

587
00:52:23,282 --> 00:52:26,307
I will keep that in mind.

588
00:52:26,307 --> 00:52:29,343
It will also determine

589
00:52:29,343 --> 00:52:31,905
who will become the hunter and who will be the hunted.

590
00:52:31,905 --> 00:52:34,457
It will become a match to determine the victor.

591
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:40,332
Oh yes! Minister of Military Affairs, what will be the estimated number of men at the Gangmoo?

592
00:52:40,332 --> 00:52:44,515
Since Your Majesty has asked to reduce the size,

593
00:52:44,515 --> 00:52:47,457
about 200 people will be joining us.

594
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:50,832
How many men will be moving?

595
00:52:50,832 --> 00:52:54,240
I have given the King an estimated size of 200 people.

596
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,765
But there will actually be a 100 more people. Thus making it 300 people leaving for the hunting area.

597
00:52:58,765 --> 00:53:01,215
Then the Palace Defense

598
00:53:01,215 --> 00:53:04,332
will be extremely weakened.

599
00:53:04,332 --> 00:53:08,948
The King will most likely pass through Jongmyo in order to get to the Gangmoo.

600
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:12,115
I too, shall also follow behind him as a loyal subject.

601
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,200
We need to aim for that time.

602
00:53:18,223 --> 00:53:22,407
When he is about to leave the Jongmyo and the palace doors are just about to open.

603
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,307
Minister of Military Affairs, you will take your men

604
00:53:24,307 --> 00:53:27,990
and advance towards the palace, not the hunting area.

605
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:32,032
Thus, I will have the soldiers ready to go

606
00:53:32,032 --> 00:53:35,923
and head to the hunting area first.

607
00:53:36,507 --> 00:53:40,248
I was a bit concerned a while ago that everyone's feelings may have been disturbed, but...

608
00:53:40,248 --> 00:53:43,223
As expected, the Gangmoo will be an event to enjoy!

609
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,300
Please make sure to show off your hunting skills also.

610
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:53,100
I especially, have high expectations from you, Prime Minister.

611
00:53:53,173 --> 00:53:55,473
Of course, Your Majesty.

612
00:53:56,573 --> 00:53:59,798
I will be sure to not fall short of your expectations.

613
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,200
Get ready to leave.

614
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,023
Where will we be going?

615
00:54:22,023 --> 00:54:26,390
There will be a Gangmoo tomorrow.

616
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,482
I heard.

617
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:31,698
It isn't very far, but . . .

618
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:34,140
I may not be able to come back quickly.

619
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,323
Thus, I believe...

620
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,400
that you should move to a safer location.

621
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,657
Do I have to do that?

622
00:54:43,457 --> 00:54:46,273
What will you do being in an empty room by yourself?

623
00:54:46,273 --> 00:54:49,300
I don't like the fact that

624
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,900
I am leaving you behind by yourself.

625
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,132
So please listen to my request.

626
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:56,132
I will.

627
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,800
No matter where you are, as long as you are safe,

628
00:55:03,523 --> 00:55:06,473
I ask for nothing more.

629
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:08,798
Whatever it is you are achieving,

630
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:12,273
I hope that Your Majesty

631
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:16,465
achieves it.

632
00:55:17,157 --> 00:55:19,290
Please,

633
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,090
achieve your goals.

634
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,607
I will.

635
00:55:23,607 --> 00:55:25,473
Please,

636
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,182
come back safely.

637
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:32,515
I will . . .

638
00:55:33,923 --> 00:55:36,523
come back.

639
00:55:42,982 --> 00:55:45,715
Korean Folk Village

640
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:56,132
Look,

641
00:55:56,132 --> 00:55:58,290
didn't I tell you?

642
00:55:59,465 --> 00:56:01,398
That moon . . .

643
00:56:03,015 --> 00:56:06,648
would follow me wherever I go?

644
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,800
I will ask one thing.

645
00:56:21,848 --> 00:56:24,340
Did you come here as commanded

646
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,457
or,

647
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,100
as a friend?

648
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:32,282
I came here

649
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:34,473
as a friend.

650
00:56:34,473 --> 00:56:36,473
As a friend?

651
00:56:38,782 --> 00:56:42,448
The word friend is such a good word.

652
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:46,423
I will ask one thing.

653
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:49,940
You already did.

654
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,840
You're such a boring friend.

655
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,665
Then I'll ask one more question.

656
00:56:56,665 --> 00:56:58,932
Ask me.

657
00:56:59,898 --> 00:57:01,423
Do you...

658
00:57:02,865 --> 00:57:05,740
Do you still think of me as a friend right now?

659
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:08,215
I do now

660
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,500
and even in the future.

661
00:57:13,282 --> 00:57:14,840
Then,

662
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,457
whatever decision I come to . . .

663
00:57:19,457 --> 00:57:21,800
whatever I do . . .

664
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:27,148
will you be my friend till the end?

665
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:28,590
Why...

666
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,440
are you asking about that?

667
00:57:32,007 --> 00:57:33,782
No.

668
00:57:33,782 --> 00:57:35,998
I don't need an answer.

669
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,800
Another person's answer is irrelevant.

670
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,040
My decision won't change.

671
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:44,515
Just...

672
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:48,557
How did we become like this?

673
00:57:49,548 --> 00:57:52,482
I think about that.

674
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,800
The royal family and your subjects

675
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:32,815
have finished preparing and are awaiting you.

676
00:58:33,132 --> 00:58:34,982
It is almost time

677
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,100
that you head out to the Jongmyo now.

678
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:39,732
Okay.

679
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:41,665
I understand.

680
00:58:41,665 --> 00:58:43,448
Your Majesty.

681
00:58:46,048 --> 00:58:48,773
It was an honor

682
00:58:48,773 --> 00:58:52,273
for me

683
00:58:52,273 --> 00:58:54,673
to have served you all these years.

684
00:58:56,215 --> 00:58:59,315
Why are you talking like you're going to die?

685
00:59:00,065 --> 00:59:01,690
Please,

686
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,700
stay safe.

687
00:59:09,148 --> 00:59:11,207
Don't worry.

688
00:59:11,207 --> 00:59:13,298
I did not idly waste my time

689
00:59:13,298 --> 00:59:15,982
after all these years.

690
00:59:18,773 --> 00:59:20,298
Woon.

691
00:59:21,048 --> 00:59:23,048
Are you ready?

692
00:59:23,048 --> 00:59:25,815
If my master's command is there,

693
00:59:26,523 --> 00:59:28,215
I am ready anytime.

694
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,200
The King

695
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,032
has arrived!

696
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,600
The time has come.

697
01:00:01,623 --> 01:00:03,607
Everything

698
01:00:03,607 --> 01:00:06,548
will return to its rightful position.

699
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,300
As soon as the King starts to make his way out,

700
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,500
the palace doors will open.

701
01:00:58,973 --> 01:01:02,598
When the King and all of the people have gathered,

702
01:01:03,698 --> 01:01:07,707
and we start to make our way out from the Jongmyo,

703
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,232
is the start of the rebellion.

704
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:13,790
Depart!

705
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,265
I, too, shall also follow behind him as a loyal subject.

706
01:01:32,265 --> 01:01:34,507
You must aim for

707
01:01:34,507 --> 01:01:39,407
the time when the palace doors are about to open.

708
01:02:39,165 --> 01:02:41,940
I have come to inform you: The sun lives in the sky,

709
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,873
and that sky has thrown away the sun.

710
01:02:45,223 --> 01:02:49,182
Fate has shifted and..

711
01:02:50,415 --> 01:02:54,290
you have reached the end of your providence.
